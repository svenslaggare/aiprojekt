[12:01] <puff> RichiWish: I got automount to work by installing ubuntu :-).
[12:01] <Adam_G> jumble, from Gnome just do panel-> quit -> shutdown, or open a terminal and run said command :D
[12:01] <Red_Death> jumble: or if you're desparate, you can unplug it
[12:01] <njal> kitche: Nope, that didn't work either, have had to switch back to the vesa driver
[12:02] <nekr0z> puff: now I see. Anyway, I need something to use in realtime monitoring. Some netstat frontend maybe...
[12:02] <jumble> thanks! ok, i think i have enough basic commands to get me through an installation (i hope). thanks for your help guys,
[12:02] <whyameye> trying to repair a reiserfs disk. I'm running reiserfsck and it appears to be hung?
[12:02] <NoUse> whyameye is the disk active?
[12:02] <kitche> njal: check xorg.0.log but if you started X then you won't be able to see your error
[12:02] <whyameye> NoUse: what does that mean "active?" Mounted? No.
[12:03] <aluno_> so
[12:03] <NoUse> whyameye no I mean is the computer reading the disk, ie actively light on
[12:03] <puff> nekr0z: Check the netstat manpages.
[12:03] <aluno_> oie
[12:03] <njal> kitche: Where is it /var/tail?
[12:03] <Adam_G> jumble: don't forget apt-get moo (try it!)
[12:03] <wIRC7> can anyone here help me with internet connection
[12:03] <LjL> nolimitsoya: installed LostIRC, and here the ideograms render fine
[12:03] <whyameye> NoUse: there's no light on the box to tell...
[12:03] <sonyax> im running a dual-core dell laptop with 1 gig ram and i couldnt get ubuntu to install/load correctly on edgy/dapper so i installed it on breezy
[12:03] <aluno_> tem alguem alguemm
[12:03] <nekr0z> puff: that's what i'm doing right now
[12:03] <sonyax> and X doesnt load on breezy
[12:03] <kitche> njal: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[12:03] <puff> Hm, this:  http://www.smorgasbord.net/cant_automount_usb_device_in_dapper_no_device_created
[12:03] <sonyax> how do i 1. get X to work and 2. upgrade from console?
[12:03] <puff> ...Seems to suggest that i should install (or reinstall) the usbmount package.
[12:03] <NoUse> whyameye and your drive doesn't make any noise when being read from?
[12:03] <nolimitsoya> LjL, yes, as i said, its a system wide problem in my case :) nothing works
[12:04] <whyameye> NoUse: not that I hear now anyway...
[12:04] <craigbass1976> bimberi: ok, I'm going to install on another box before on this one.  If all goes well there, I'll back up data on this one and throw one in 'er.
[12:04] <LjL> nolimitsoya, are you using the dejavu sans as your default font anyway? many other fonts probably don't have most unicode characters
[12:04] <whyameye> NoUse: I have my ear right up to it and hear nothing....
[12:04] <bimberi> craigbass1976: sounds like a very good plan
[12:04] <NoUse> whyameye well you can run it with the verbose option on and maybe get more feedback
[12:04] <nolimitsoya> LjL, default font system wide?
[12:05] <wIRC7> ive just setup ubuntu 6.1 amd64, setup the network and can log into the router so the network is up but it wont let me access the internet
[12:05] <craigbass1976> bimberi: sorry about the long response times... I have a two year old and a newborn; it was supper time for both.  Hope to see you in here in t eh future
[12:05] <whyameye> NoUse: should I be able to <CTRL>C out of reiserfsck? 'Cause I can't...
[12:05] <NoUse> whyameye you should be able to
[12:05] <njal> kitche: http://pastebin.ca/261890
[12:05] <LjL> nolimitsoya: well, default font for something. like for lostirc, though i haven't seen an option for setting the font in lostirc...
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> LjL, im using regular sans for lostirc, and times new roman for firefox. doesnt help if i change though... still dead in the water
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> LjL, first tab in preferences :)
[12:05] <grimboy> The people in ##linux are meanies.
[12:05] <whyameye> NoUse: killall -9 doesn't even work....
[12:06] <Jordan_U> sonyax: Probably better to figure out why Dapper / Edgy didn't install, but if you want to upgrade run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade first to be sure you have the latest Breezy packages.
[12:06] <NoUse> whyameye probably should restart the machine
[12:06] <Red_Death> grimboy: maybe you're just a pussy?
[12:06] <LjL> nolimitsoya: ok but leave firefox alone for a minute - that could be firefox being stupid with encoding detection
[12:06] <drael> Why is Wine doing this?
[12:06] <drael> X Error of failed request:  BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device

[12:06] <wIRC7> no help then, back to windows i suppose
[12:06] <kitche> njal: yeah but it's still using VESA
[12:06] <grimboy> Red_Death, Not really, I was more irritated on the behalf of their continuous piss taking of the less skilled.
[12:07] <sonyax> Bok
[12:07] <sonyax> thanks
[12:07] <Red_Death> grimboy: oh, well then I guess they aren't meanies, just asshats. Nothing unusual there
[12:07] <LjL> nolimitsoya: hmm do you have libicu34 installed?
[12:07] <nolimitsoya> !jp
[12:07] <ubotu>  #ubuntu-jp  #kubuntu-jp 
[12:07] <Red_Death> grimboy: they are all mostly 10 year olds that think that, because they use linux, they are better then anybody else
[12:08] <Jordan_U> sonyax: Then run: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and change all "breezy" to "dapper" NOT edgy, even if you want edgy do dapper first
[12:08] <nolimitsoya> LjL, yes i have it, and no changing to dejavu sans didnt help :)
[12:08] <grimboy> Red_Death, Ahh... Of course, my OS affects my penis size mentality.
[12:08] <wIRC7> yeah, the ignorant fookers here are much better
[12:08] <wIRC7> l8rs
[12:08] <njal> kitche: Ah, ok, well i can't see where it's blowing up
[12:08] <grimboy> wIRC7, lol bibi!
[12:08] <Red_Death> grimboy: yea, if you didn't compile it yourself, and write your own installation script, you don't have an 80 ft airplane penis like they all do xD
[12:08] <grimboy> Damn, I think it rubbed off on me.
[12:08] <alm_> hello everybody
[12:09] <grimboy> Red_Death, Heh.
[12:09] <alm_> anybody who can help me with sound problem
[12:09] <SpAc> Quick question... i think i had 2.6.17-10-generic, then I installed the nvidia drivers, and now I have the 2.6.17-10-386 kernel. Is that ok? Everything is running fine
[12:09] <Jordan_U> sonyax: Then run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade again
[12:09] <njal> kitche: I think i found an old log file from when i tried nvidia driver
[12:09] <grimboy> !ask | alm_
[12:09] <ubotu> alm_: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:10] <alm_> i can hear sound from my headphone but no sound from speaker
[12:10] <justin_> !botsnakc
[12:10] <justin_> !botsnack
[12:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about botsnakc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[12:11] <malakhi> alm_, on a laptop?
[12:11] <alm_> yes
[12:11] <alm_> acer
[12:11] <barrett9h> any hint on how to share internet connection via bluetooth?
[12:11] <kitche> njal: found the problem for some reason your nvidia kernel module isn't being loaded
[12:12] <kitche> njal: try sudo modprobe nvidia
[12:12] <Red_Death> barrett9h: google around, I'm not entirely sure it's been done, but if it has you'll find it
[12:12] <malakhi> alm_, right click on the speaker in the notification area (next to clock) and select 'Open Volume Control;
[12:12] <alm_> ok..done
[12:12] <njal> kitche: It's possible, I am using the 2.6.15-23 kernel and the updated one is 2.6.15-27 but i couldn't get nvidia driver nor build my networking driver under the new kernel
[12:12] <malakhi> alm_, make sure PCM, Master, and Headphone are all unmuted and turned up.
[12:13] <LjL> nolimitsoya: do you have xfonts-encodings?
[12:13] <alm_> they are unmuted
[12:13] <njal> kitche: No errors modprobing
[12:13] <njal> kitche: restart X?
[12:13] <nolimitsoya> LjL, yes, 1:1.0.0-5.1
[12:13] <malakhi> alm_, did you turn up the volume on them?
[12:13] <kitche> njal: do lsmod|grep nvidia in a console and you should see nvidia come up
[12:14] <dubious> Wow, they can trace your phone's internal GPS! http://www.phonetrace.org/
[12:14] <alm_> they are 100%
[12:14] <malakhi> alm_, any sound out speakers?
[12:14] <njal> kitche: Yes, we have nvidia modules present
[12:14] <nekr0z> puff: Thanks I figured it out, now it prints updated stats every second. Not too comfortable, but at least something close to what I need. Thanks.
[12:14] <alm_> i can hear from headphone
[12:14] <kitche> njal: ok then that's your problem probably for soem reason on boot your system isn't auto loading the nvidia module
[12:14] <njal> kitche: So add nvidia to /etc/modules?
[12:15] <malakhi> alm_, you won't be able to hear sound through the speakers if your headphones are plugged in.
[12:15] <alm_> malkhi> i cannot hear from speaker but can hear from headphone output
[12:15] <alm_> yes done that no sound
[12:16] <kitche> njal: well you should have a file in /etc/modules.d/ where modules are being loaded from
[12:16] <alm_> only from headphone i hear sound
[12:16] <b33r-> Can u tell me a good program that convert mp3 and burn an audio CD?
[12:16] <LjL> nolimitsoya: i'm at a loss
[12:16] <nolimitsoya> LjL, me too :)
[12:16] <puff> nekr0z: There are a bunch of tools for that sort of thing, check out ntop.
[12:16] <nolimitsoya> LjL, thanks for trying <3
[12:16] <njal> kitche: Nope nothing in the file
[12:16] <malakhi> alm_, click on file > Change Device in the Volume Control window and make sure that the ALSA adapter is selected

[12:17] <alm_> yes it is alsa
[12:17] <malakhi> hmm
[12:17] <Vann> My CRT monitor dims every once in a while (sometimes all the way to pitch black).  Is it likely this is a monitor issue, or could my graphics card be dieing?
[12:17] <puff> b33r-: Or maybe http://www.overclock.net/faqs/127519-how-burn-mp3-cd-ubuntu-without.html
[12:17] <NET||abuse> hmm,, no sound...
[12:18] <njal> Vann: Monitor issue
[12:18] <b33r-> k
[12:18] <nolimitsoya> Vann, most likely your monitor. could also be the screensaver fading in ;)
[12:18] <Vann> nolimitsoya, hehe, that's what i thought at first :D.
[12:18] <Vann> nolimitsoya, but it does it on windows too, and moving the mouse/typing doesn't do anything
[12:18] <malakhi> alm_, i'm not sure at this point. There's no sound from the onboard speakers at all? No gnome sounds or anything?
[12:19] <nolimitsoya> Vann, it must be one of those very eager screensavers :P
[12:19] <kitche> njal: then add it to /etc/modprobe.conf or /etc/modules.conf
[12:19] <ejer> I am getting a dpkg error on a dapper dist-upgrade, sound-juicer package is 'missing final newline'
[12:19] <NET||abuse> anyone got any know how on a 5.1 surround sound card in ubuntu?
[12:19] <Vann> nolimitsoya, perhaps BOINC is getting a bit greedy and forcing the comp into screensaver mode..
[12:19] <alm_> well onboard speaaker doesnot produce sound only headphone produces sound and also my mic doesnot work
[12:19] <njal> kitche: /etc/modules is where modules appear to load
[12:20] <kitche> njal: yeah there is couple of files that can make modules load I only know of modules.conf and modprobe.conf
[12:20] <NET||abuse> lspci tells me i have,  nVidia Corporation CK804 AC'97 Audio Controller
[12:20] <njal> kitche: Ok try a reboot see what happens
[12:21] <malakhi> alm_, I'm afraid there's a lot of problems with laptop mics under alsa right now.
[12:21] <NET||abuse> now i've been lookin at the system sound properties, added in center channels and things,, but i can't see where the sound is at.
[12:21] <pianoboy3333> How do I find out how fast my pentium 4 is? like ghz
[12:21] <malakhi> alm_, open up a console and run alsamixer
[12:21] <NoUse> pianoboy3333 'cat /proc/cpuinfo'
[12:21] <alm_> malakhi> should upgrade to 1.0.13 solve this issue
=== zntneo__ is now known as zntneo_
[12:21] <nolimitsoya> pianoboy3333, divide the heatloss in watts by a number between five and seven
[12:21] <alm_> ok
[12:22] <malakhi> alm_, possibly. I can't remember what the problem was, but it's a known bug
[12:22] <malakhi> alm_, but make sure none of the channels in alsamixer are muted
[12:22] <nolimitsoya> pianoboy3333, on a more sincere note, it should brint out during boot
=== Versed2 is now known as Versed`
[12:22] <nolimitsoya> *print
[12:22] <nickv111> Hey. I have an ATI SB soundcard, which was at first recognized correctly by Ubuntu, but is now being displayed as a Realtek card. After I blacklisted snd_hda_intel, it's not recognized as this anymore, but I obviously need to load some driver to get my ATI soundcard in my laptop to work. What driver would this be? I tried the "sb" driver, but that didn't recognize any hardware
[12:22] <ejer> is there a ubuntu support channel?
[12:22] <nickv111> Remember, this worked once
[12:22] <NoUse> ejer you are in it
[12:22] <nolimitsoya> ejer, you are in it :)

[12:23] <zapcojake> will Kubuntu + all the codecs from automatix play AVI's
[12:23] <ejer> ok, I can't dist-upgrade dapper because of sound-juicer package being broken
[12:23] <LjL> !automatix | zapcojake
[12:23] <ubotu> zapcojake: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[12:23] <LjL> Ubotu, tell zapcojake about avi | zapcojake, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:23] <malakhi> alm_, still get sound out of headphones?
[12:23] <alm_> how do i upgrade to 1.0.13..do i have to compile the kernel driver
[12:23] <Pie-rate> My USB optical mouse stopped responding after being unplugged and plugged back in. Restarting doesn't help. How do I fix this?
[12:23] <nolimitsoya> ejer, uninstall it temporarily, and then reinstall. or use adept
=== Omega_red is now known as Omega-red
[12:23] <alm_> yes only headphone
[12:24] <ejer> nolimitsoya: this is using update-manager applet
[12:24] <nickv111> What is the ATI sound card driver is all I'm asking. Does anyone know this?
[12:24] <alm_> my chip is ALC260 realtek
[12:24] <malakhi> alm_, it's rather complicated IIRC, and I'm not the best person to guide you in that. I'd check the ALSA website for information.
[12:24] <nolimitsoya> ejer, did i say adept?... i ment aptitude...
[12:24] <nickv111> alm_: What kind of laptop do you have?
[12:24] <ejer> nolimitsoya: no, it does not work... dies on sound-juicer
[12:24] <Pie-rate> !worksforme
[12:24] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[12:24] <alm_> acer travelmate c200
[12:25] <nickv111> alm_: I'm having an issue with my Acer Aspire 3100, which is claimed to have a Realtek ALC something, but actualy has an ATI soundcard.
[12:25] <nolimitsoya> ejer, aptitude fails? then youre in trouble :P anyway, as i said, try uninstalling sound-juicer, do the upgrade, and reinstall
[12:25] <ejer> nolimitsoya: I CANNOT UNINSTALL IT BECAUSE THE PACKAGE IT WANTS TO INSTALL IS UNINSTALLABLE
[12:25] <Pie-rate> My USB optical mouse stopped responding after being unplugged and plugged back in. Restarting doesn't help. How do I fix this?
[12:25] <nickv111> ejer: Please do not yell.

[12:25] <ejer> sorry
[12:25] <nolimitsoya> ejer, you cant uninstall what?
[12:25] <nickv111> ejer: Accident?
[12:25] <alm_> i am sure it is alc260 in my case
[12:25] <LjL> yeah, no need to flood and swear just to say you're sorry though :P
[12:25] <ejer> nickv111: totally ;)
[12:25] <wwallace_lap> how do you install packages in ubuntu?

[12:26] <bimberi> wwallace_lap: yes, various apt based tools
[12:26] <ejer> as far as I can tell, there is a problem in dapper with sound-juicer package
[12:26] <wwallace_lap> is this sid?
[12:26] <wwallace_lap> or etch?
[12:26] <ejer> I will check the bugs
[12:26] <LjL> wwallace_lap: it's neither. it's ubuntu some-version-that-i-cant-know
[12:27] <LjL> wwallace_lap: "lsb_release -a" will tell you the version
[12:27] <wwallace_lap> is based on debian no?
[12:27] <LjL> !debian | wwallace_lap

[12:27] <LjL> Pie-rate: yes
[12:27] <wwallace_lap> what are the sources?
[12:27] <LjL> wwallace_lap: the sources?
[12:27] <wwallace_lap> unstable?
[12:27] <Jordan_U> What does the error "no screens found" mean when xorg crashes?
[12:27] <Pie-rate> ok, then no one knows what to do when a usb mouse just stops working?
[12:27] <kitche> or unstable as some people put it since debian is lagging behind wwallace_lap
[12:28] <njal> kitche: Failed, again, here's the latest output http://pastebin.ca/261911
[12:28] <LjL> wwallace_lap: short answer yes, but the page should explain it all
[12:28] <wwallace_lap> is ubuntu on your humble opinion better than kanotix?
[12:28] <LjL> wwallace_lap: ubuntu is synced with debian unstable at releases
[12:28] <HappyPills> A bit of a dosemu question? Is the project dead or does anyone know of an irc channel for dosemu? #dosemu on freenode is nonexistent
[12:28] <chjunior> guys, I Shipped some Ubuntu CDs... how to know how distant is it from me?
[12:28] <LjL> wwallace_lap: not the kind of question to ask on an ubuntu channel, really... anyway, you're better off in #ubuntu-offtopic for that kind of question, i guess
[12:29] <wwallace_lap> simple question
[12:29] <Pie-rate> My USB optical mouse stopped responding after being unplugged and plugged back in. Restarting doesn't help. How do I fix this?
[12:29] <wwallace_lap> nothing tricky about it
[12:29] <ejer> files list file for package `sound-juicer' is missing final newline
[12:29] <kitche> njal: it's still not loading the nvidia module just try the sudo modprobe nvidia then just startx to see if it at leats works that way
[12:29] <NoUse> Pie-rate have you tried it on another machine?
[12:29] <bimberi> wwallace_lap: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship - in particular the "Releases" section within "Ubuntu and Debian"
[12:29] <alm_> malakhi> i remember when i used vmware in linux to boot to kubuntu it used ac97 chip driver and could hear the sound
[12:29] <ejer> it is actually dpkg that will not upgrade
[12:29] <njal> kitche: kk
[12:29] <Pie-rate> NoUse: Yes.
[12:29] <LjL> wwallace_lap, ok, but it's offtopic. and there's more than 900 people here, you wouldn't want all of them to give you an opinion. besides, since we're an ubuntu channel, it's pretty clear that most of us like ubuntu ;)

[12:30] <bimberi> tuedel: what help do you need?

[12:31] <tuedel> umm.. i want to use the vnc4 server with the module for x11
[12:31] <malakhi> alm_, you can do an 'lsmod | grep ac97' to see if the ac97 module is loaded...
[12:32] <malakhi> alm_, but, since you're getting sound from the headphones, i would assume that it is.
[12:32] <tuedel> as described here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279069
[12:32] <malakhi> alm_, is this a fresh install?
[12:32] <Pie-rate> NoUse: WOW, wtf, unplugging it and plugging it back in made it work again. I had done that at least 10 times previously
[12:32] <njal> kitche: Nope, that hasn't worked either
[12:33] <i7ch> is there an equivalent to babylon translator for windows, which will pop up a translation for any word in any application when clicked on with a certain hotkey combo?
[12:33] <alm_> well lsmod shows snd_hda_intel
=== w00d is now known as g0tw00d
[12:33] <nolimitsoya> last call: does anyone know whats needed to get a system to display kanji?
[12:33] <Pie-rate> NoUse: Well, thank you, i guess...
[12:33] <eugman> Anyone knows why my wirelss internet is being flaky? It's working with windows right now though.
[12:33] <i7ch> alm_, sorry, i've just had problems that i've solved with snd_hda_intel. can you repeat your problem?
[12:33] <LjL> i7ch: no. there is a program that can use the Babylon dictionaries, though, as well as other dictionary programs (most based on a common dictionary protocol)
[12:33] <malakhi> alm_, is that the only module you get?
[12:33] <NoUse> Pie-rate glad its working
[12:33] <puff> Has anybody here used the usbmount package?
[12:33] <i7ch> LjL, that's really a huge shame. i basically keep a windows partition around just to use it.
[12:34] <J4cK3Ro> CiaO A TuTTi
[12:34] <alm_> snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec,snd_pcm_oss, snd_pcm
[12:34] <LjL> !find wordtrans | i7ch, this is it
[12:34] <ubotu> Found: wordtrans-data, wordtrans-dict, wordtrans-doc, wordtrans-kde, wordtrans-qt (and 1 others)
[12:34] <Jordan_U> What does the error "no screens found" mean when xorg crashes?
[12:34] <alm_> snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec,snd_pcm_oss,snd_mixer_oss,snd_pcm,snd_timer
[12:34] <i7ch> Jordan_U, it means it couldn't find a valid display to start on.
[12:35] <i7ch> i7ch, try to dpkg reconfigure xorg. i'm not sure the exact syntax.
[12:35] <ejer> can someone tell me what this means? : files list file for package `sound-juicer' is missing final newline
[12:35] <kitche> njal: hmm seems odd though that the kernel module isn't being injected into the kernel
[12:35] <LjL> i7ch: the stuff that Babylon does in order to recognize text on the screen is actually pretty refined and complicated - it's a screen-based OCR really. one could probably hack something together using gocr or something, but i doubt it'd work very well
[12:35] <Jordan_U> i7ch: what woud make a display not "valid"?
[12:35] <bimberi> tuedel: ah, that's a little clearer.  What's the error?
[12:35] <alm_> i7ch > dpkg --reconfigure -a
[12:35] <LjL> i7ch: wordtrans can translate from the contents of the clipboard, however, and/or you can have a "dictionary" textbox in your panel
[12:36] <kbird> ejer: just means there is no carriage return, line feed at the end of the file
=== g0tw00d is now known as w00d
[12:36] <njal> kitche: Could it be since i am using an older kernel, that it's a NEW kernel module that's trying to be injected into an older kernel? Though i don't see how since the -23/-27 bit are just patches
[12:36] <ejer> kbird: where is that file so I can nuke it?
[12:36] <malakhi> alm_, maybe try 'sudo modprobe ac97_codec'
=== w00d is now known as g0tw00d
[12:36] <i7ch> LjL, clipboard translation is not bad, i'll give that a try.
[12:36] <kitche> njal: might be that but usually it will give off an error
[12:36] <cogumbreiro> lo all
[12:36] <i7ch> alm_, what problem are you experiencing?
[12:36] <shwag> how do I change the default editor from nano to vim ?
[12:37] <cogumbreiro> where did the disk mounting/managing application go (from dapper to edgy)?
[12:37] <alm_> that way i wont have hd audio
[12:37] <malakhi> i7ch, he's got a laptop and only gets sound from headphones, not speakers
=== g0tw00d is now known as p3ck3rw00d
[12:37] <i7ch> malakhi, this is a notorious problem with the intel_hda chipset
[12:37] <Jordan_U> cogumbreiro: It's gone :( it was unmaintained so they removed it.
[12:37] <njal> kitche: So what more can I try?
[12:37] <i7ch> alm_, if i'm not mistaken, compiling the latest alsa drivers manually helps.
[12:37] <LjL> i7ch: note there is no GTK/GNOME client for wordtrans, however, only Qt/KDE (not that you can't use that, of course). the Gnome Searchbar (right click on the panel / Add applet) can give you a dictionary, as well, and i think there's also another specialized applet (just going by memory, i use KDE myself)
=== p3ck3rw00d is now known as g0tw00d
[12:37] <tuedel> umm.. when i connect from my own pc, i get a somehow "broken" image of my own desktop (barely recognizeable), and my xserver seems to freeze. when i connect from another pc, i get the same image of my desktop, but the xserver on my own pc works like normal
[12:37] <ivx> hey what do they say the minimum ram for ubuntu 6.10 is?
[12:37] <cogumbreiro> Jordan_U, but, it was awesome :'( noobs love it
[12:38] <bimberi> shwag: sudo update-alternatives --config editor
=== clem is now known as clemyeats
[12:38] <malakhi> i7ch, he's saying it's a Realtek chipset... but audio's not my strong suit, so I may be missing something
[12:38] <treitter> is anyone here familiar with building a debian package from a debian source tarball?
[12:38] <eugman> Anyone have any idea why my wireless has stopped working lately? has there been a bad update or something?
[12:38] <cogumbreiro> Jordan_U, what's the name of the package? i'll maintain it, if I need to
[12:38] <cogumbreiro> *if it needs to
[12:38] <i7ch> malakhi, i have the same card, it uses the intel_hda chipset
[12:38] <LjL> ivx: i'd say 192
[12:38] <cogumbreiro> Jordan_U, what langage is it?
[12:38] <puff> Damn, this is really drving me nuts.
[12:38] <ivx> ljl you think 128 would be fine?
[12:38] <LjL> ivx: if you use Gnome or KDE on it, that is
[12:39] <ivx> ljl 128 with gnome
[12:39] <bimberi> tuedel: umm... sorry I can't help you
[12:39] <Jordan_U> cogumbreiro: I don't know, I never actually used it, it is probably still available in universe
[12:39] <LjL> ivx: no, i don't think. not with Gnome/KDE. it would work, but it would be a pain. and you couldn't install it from the Desktop CD, you'd have to use the alternate
[12:39] <cogumbreiro> Jordan_U, oh, I see...
[12:39] <i7ch> alm_, this might help: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_configure_sound_to_work_properly_in_GNOME
[12:39] <chjunior> guys, I Shipped some Ubuntu CDs... how to know how distant is it from me?
[12:40] <i7ch> alm_, also, here are instructions for using the latest alsa driver. it fixed my mic issue: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=272166
[12:40] <ivx> ljl, the standard live cd install won't work?
[12:40] <LjL> ivx: no
[12:40] <alm_> thanks man i will give it a try
[12:40] <_goofy_> how do i change the volume name of a partition
[12:40] <bimberi> chjunior: there's no way to know
[12:41] <ivx> ljl how would you install it with out the live cd then, do they make another version?
[12:41] <LjL> !alternate | ivx
[12:41] <ubotu> ivx: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[12:41] <Jordan_U> When I change "fglrx" to "ati" in my xorg.conf x no longer loads, I want "ati" for AIGLX.
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> ivx, try enlightenment/xfce4/fluxbox for a very lightweight wm
[12:41] <tuedel> bimbery: ok, then maybe with an easier question: when i logged on on my second x-session (:1) via vnc from my local pc, i played around with it an minimized all windows (including the console, so now i've only got a blank grey window). how can i bring the console back?
[12:41] <i7ch> p.s. anyone else having frequent firefox freezes on edgy?
[12:41] <jordo23> Anyone know how to get a webcam to work under Ubuntu?
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> ivx, do a cli install with the alternate cd, and then apt-get the wm you want
[12:42] <ivx> nolimitsoya, well it isn't a junky computer it has dual pIII 1.0ghz, just rambus is expensive
[12:42] <_goofy_> how do i change the volume name of a partition
[12:42] <Jordan_U> !webcam | jordo23
[12:42] <ubotu> jordo23: webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[12:42] <bruenig> i7ch, not frequent, occasionally, but generally it comes when I have a ton of tabs open and am probably pushing it a bit further than it ought to be
[12:42] <malakhi> alm_, found this thread in the forums: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=305712
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> ivx, you still need a small footprint wm, no matter what your available processing power would be
[12:42] <i7ch> bruenig, i have two gigs of ram and it does this sometimes with only one tab open.
[12:42] <malakhi> alm_, seems to match your problem exactly
[12:43] <gnomefreak> ivx: pc800 mem?
[12:43] <bruenig> i7ch, definitely a problem then

[12:47] <LjL> Pie-rate: why don't you use a more up-to-date version? 5.10 won't even be supported anymore in a couple of months
[12:47] <justin_> CoRnJuLiOx: However if you want an even smaller mem footprint, stay away from Opera 9.. go for 6-7, yes 6 still works well with most webpages.
[12:47] <Jordan_U> CoRnJuLiOx: Dillo
[12:47] <Pie-rate> oh i mean 6.10

[12:57] <bruenig> ReporterX, they don't update edgy except in new versions from what I have seen. Don't know if that is an official policy or that just happened to be the best move but they generally don't update gnome
[12:57] <gnomefreak> LjL: doesnt edgy have 2.16?
[12:57] <bruenig> ReporterX, they don't update gnome*
[12:57] <ReporterX> yes i know...

[12:58] <ReporterX> so, de only way it's compile it ?

[01:08] <Pie-rate> well the connection is capable of way more
[01:08] <ReporterX> Pie-rate: use a download manager....
[01:09] <NET||abuse> Pie-rate, also use a mirror close to you that you know has a good connection.. where are you based?
[01:09] <shaslap> Jordan_U, do i need to do anything special or just get mplayer from apt-get /synaptic?
[01:09] <Jordan_U> kitche: Ok, I typed driver instead of video
[01:09] <Pie-rate> California State University, Chico
[01:09] <bitflip> shaslap: the only way I have been able to is to use a 32 build of mplayer
[01:09] <NET||abuse> hmm, well locate a calif based mirror
[01:09] <NET||abuse> i'm sure there's one
[01:09] <sonyax> is a dual-core a 64bit or 32bit computer?
[01:09] <kitche> shaslap: you need w32codecs
[01:09] <NET||abuse> hrphm
[01:10] <shaslap> kitche, where do i get those?
[01:10] <kitche> sonyax: most are x86_64
[01:10] <Jordan_U> sonyax: It can be either.
[01:10] <NET||abuse> can't get my bloody ck804 surround card to play,
[01:10] <sonyax> how do i check?
[01:10] <shaslap> bitflip, how i do install the 32 bit version?

[01:11] <yaso> how to update the current package ?
[01:12] <ReporterX> i have an intel dual core Core laptop and when i run the "cpu frequency scalling monitor" i get the error "CPU frequency scaling unsupported". How do i solve this problem ?
[01:12] <NET||abuse> ReporterX, you don't, basically your cpu isn't a speedstep type cpu
[01:12] <DevC> ok where is a good place to download something that need s compiled that only I will use.....where is a good place to put it so I have to do sudo to run anything out of the directory from then on?
[01:12] <elotro> om.ar
[01:12] <NET||abuse> ReporterX, my amd 64 x2 is the same
[01:13] <bigfuzzyjesus> how do you change your default file manager?
[01:13] <kitche> DevC: /usr/local usually
[01:13] <AnthonyG> One small step for me , And one giant cyber-leap for my Modem :D. The SmartLink drivers are compatible! The ones for kernel 2.15 no less!!!
[01:13] <Arigato> how do I change the device that is being controlled by my keyboard volume shortcuts?
[01:13] <thor> DevC: having to use sudo depends on the permissions of the program, not its location
[01:13] <Jordan_U> shaslap: You should probably go with 32 bit even if you have 64 bit if you are new to Ubuntu and want flash and other video formats to work
[01:14] <Wiseguy> have any of you guys succesfully installed vmware workstation on ubuntu?
[01:14] <ReporterX> NET|abude: intel dual core isn't a speedstep cpu ?
[01:14] <AnthonyG> How might I turn off carrier check in wvdial?
[01:14] <AnthonyG> I specified "Carrier Check=no" in wvdial.conf but it still checks for it :(

[01:16] <mcphail> Wiseguy: works like a dream
[01:16] <Jordan_U> shaslap: Everything that works in 32 bit can be made to work in 64 bit, and most things "just work" but proprietary video formats among other things can be a hastle
[01:16] <kitche> Jordan_U: ok I would edit the xorg.conf by hand then, gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf then put ati instead of fglrx and then restart X to see if that works or you can just do the dpkg-reconfigure way
[01:17] <Jordan_U> kitche: Tried that already, same error
[01:17] <Jordan_U> kitche: Tried that first actually :)
[01:17] <Phuzion> How do I restart networking?
[01:17] <bimberi> AnthonyG: The pastebin is in the channel topic, which you can see by typing /topic in your IRC client (and which doesn't go to the channel)
[01:17] <mcphail> Wiseguy: you have to recompile the modules at every kernel upgrade, though
[01:17] <AnthonyG> Alright gentlemen , here is what I get when I wvdial , It loops forever. Please remember Carrier Check=no is specified in wvdial.conf. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34868/

[01:18] <Jordan_U> Phuzion: bimber's way is better than mine.

[01:18] <bimberi> AnthonyG: no worries :)
[01:18] <Phuzion> Jordan_U:  Yeah, I needed it to reload all the info, I changed my resolv.conf

[01:21] <AnthonyG> sonyax: What gives you that assumption?

[01:22] <sonyax> didnt work
[01:22] <Phuzion> sonyax:  did you get the video drivers installed?
[01:22] <sonyax> he had to install old version
[01:22] <poplars> mcphail, I can't do a direct link, thye have some sort of protection against that

[01:22] <sonyax> ive tried breezy, dapper, and edgy on it
[01:22] <sonyax> the only one that actually instaleld was breezy
[01:22] <poplars> so, does anyone know of a program that will attempt to extract corrupted zip files?
[01:22] <sonyax> and even then X didnt work.. im trying to fix that now
[01:23] <sgorilla80> poplars: winrar would be the best
[01:23] <poplars> erm
[01:23] <sonyax> this is a dual-core dell
[01:23] <sgorilla80> poplars: for doing that sort of thing
[01:23] <poplars> winrar is far from the best.
[01:23] <AnthonyG> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34868/ , How might I disable the Carrier check?
[01:23] <mcphail> poplars: some hosts just check the "referrer" header to limit direct downloads. This can be forged by wget.
[01:23] <sonyax> i think its 32 bit idk.
[01:23] <sgorilla80> poplars: why so?
[01:23] <Jordan_U> sonyax: That doesn't mean Ubuntu is bad on all laptops.
[01:23] <poplars> it says unexpected end of archive.
[01:23] <sonyax> every laptop ive tried it didnt work..
[01:23] <poplars> and doesn't even make an attempt
[01:23] <sgorilla80> sonyax: ubuntu works well on laptops
[01:23] <Jordan_U> sonyax: How many is that?
[01:24] <sonyax> i guess i have to buy a laptop based on ubuntu, if i want to use ubuntu
[01:24] <Phuzion> sonyax:  that just means that you had a bad experience or two with ubuntu and laptops
[01:24] <schierbeck> is it possible to go back to non-proposed versions of packages?

[01:24] <poplars> any ideas?
[01:24] <sonyax> i think it might be the kernel
[01:24] <Jordan_U> sonyax: Every laptop I have tried Ubuntu on X worked, that is > 20 of them, most Dell though
[01:24] <sonyax> i mean they have everything as a module in the ubuntu kernel but
[01:25] <sonyax> maybe they missed my video module
[01:25] <Pie-rate> sgorilla80: winrar?!?! GASP! non-F/OSS SOFTWARE! BLASPHEMY!

[01:35] <NET||abuse> hmmm, can anyone point me in the right direction to get my soundcard working?
[01:36] <NET||abuse> nvidia ck804, it's driving me nuts
[01:36] <livingdaylight> ReporterX, that is very iresponsible recommending Automatix, that can break people's systems, didn't you know?
[01:36] <AnthonyG> ReporterX: That's about the fifth time you've encouraged it XD , Promoting system killing is bad.
[01:36] <Jordan_U_> livingdaylight: Did you search for it in synaptic, I  don't think the package name is just realplayer?
[01:36] <Flannel> VigoFuse: well, reinstalling grub (ala that first link ubotu sent you) will work, at any rate.
[01:36] <bruenig> realplayer package name is realplay
[01:37] <VigoFuse> That makes sence, silly PC didnt come with a floppy drive,,,/giggles
[01:37] <Jordan_U_> livingdaylight: realplayer package name is realplay ( from bruenig )
[01:37] <ReporterX> livingdaylight: no.... i use automatix to fill ubuntu to my daily needs and it works very well....
[01:37] <bruenig> !automatix
[01:37] <LjL> !works for me | ReporterX
[01:37] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[01:37] <ubotu> ReporterX: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[01:37] <Flannel> VigoFuse: eh? floppy?  Who said anything about a floppy?  You can use your CDrom (whichever) to install it
[01:37] <LjL> ReporterX: just don't recommend it please. feel free to use it if it floats your boat.
[01:38] <bruenig> But realplayer is not in the normal repos. Not even in multiverse. So you will have to add others
[01:38] <livingdaylight> Jordan_U, it is realplay i did sudo apt-get install realplay but it didn't work
[01:38] <LjL> bruenig: dapper-commercial, correct?
[01:38] <bruenig> dapper maybe, I remember it being realplay but when I just searched I didn't find it
[01:38] <bruenig> I am on edgy
[01:38] <ReporterX> ok... please don't hate me for using automatix,,,,, i like it....
[01:38] <bigfuzzyjesus> how do you change your default file manager?
[01:38] <bigfuzzyjesus> how do you change your default file manager?
[01:38] <bigfuzzyjesus> how do you change your default file manager?
[01:38] <ReporterX> this is my first visit to this forum
[01:39] <AnthonyG> ReporterX: I doubt that
[01:39] <Jordan_U_> ReporterX: You can use it all you want, just don't suggest it.
[01:39] <chad> does anyone know where I can get help with getting evolution to sync the categories with my palm
[01:39] <livingdaylight> ok, realplay is not in my repositories
[01:39] <VigoFuse> Flannel: That I tried, same error, reset BIOS, and almost booted, had to resort to the Stable Backup CD-RWs that I make
[01:40] <ReporterX> anthonyG: why ? It's working on my laptop...
[01:40] <bruenig> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Multimedia_Player_.28RealPlayer_10.29
[01:40] <Flannel> livingdaylight: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-e5b6bdd2d22ee7abdfb6557799c2294322918a3d  Like I already linked
[01:40] <AnthonyG> ReporterX: What is?
[01:40] <Jordan_U_> ReporterX: The more people that use Automatix the more people we have to tell to reinstall when it irrecoverably breaks there install
[01:40] <cdcarter> malakhi: i ran that, and its still not available
[01:40] <bruenig> It says real player is in the PLF repos
[01:40] <Flannel> VigoFuse: So, how are your disks set up? what's where, what do you have, etc
[01:40] <AnthonyG> Indeed , I already broke mine without additional help XD . No need to increase it.
[01:41] <Jordan_U_> ReporterX: And it killed mine, working for you is not proof of stability
[01:41] <livingdaylight> Flannel, i have   deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu dapper-commercial main in my sources list but its not giving me realplay?
[01:41] <zntneo> ok how do i make it so that the bcm43xx does not load at boot time?
[01:41] <bruenig> livingdaylight, what are you on edgy or dapper?
[01:42] <AnthonyG> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34868/ <--- Why is this still appearing , Even though I disabled carrier check via: Carrier Check=no?
[01:42] <livingdaylight> bruenig, edgy
[01:42] <Flannel> livingdaylight: have you apt-get updated since adding it?
[01:42] <ReporterX> AnthonyG: yeah... for a newbie reading the 100's line of ubuntuguide, ubuntu wiki's, etc it's much easier then use automatix....
[01:42] <livingdaylight> Flannel, lol, yes i have buddy
[01:42] <ReporterX> yeah sure,,,
[01:42] <VigoFuse> 2hdds, Master,Slave, 2 parts each. The 1rst HDD is a 2part for backup, the 2hd Slave is the Linux, DOS
[01:42] <livingdaylight> Flannel, upgraded too even
[01:42] <AnthonyG> ReporterX: For one thing , Linux was made for experienced users who wish to have full control.
[01:42] <bruenig> livingdaylight, you need to add the PLF repo if you want to install it from the repositories. It is very easy to install it from the real player website. All you have to do is download and run a script that sets everything up.
[01:42] <LjL> ReporterX, AnthonyG, Jordan_U, livingdaylight: please move the Automatix discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:43] <Flannel> VigoFuse: and where is /boot? and where did you install grub?
[01:43] <livingdaylight> LjL, huh? a tad late on that buddy
[01:43] <AnthonyG> LjL: Oi now , I can't simply let a question directed at me go now can I?
[01:43] <ReporterX> ok... it's a windows vs linux like discution :)
[01:43] <VigoFuse> 2nd HDD Slave
[01:43] <malakhi> cdcarter, what's your goal with postfix? local delivery only, or your own general email server?
[01:43] <AnthonyG> ReporterX: It is O_O?
[01:43] <livingdaylight> bruenig, can you give me the plf thing?
[01:43] <RememberPOL> ReporterX: Fixed it.
[01:43] <Flannel> VigoFuse: so... hdb2? or hdb1?
[01:44] <zntneo> is there only way to stop a module from loading to blacklist it?
[01:44] <VigoFuse> hb1
[01:44] <zntneo> there=the
[01:44] <Flannel> VigoFuse: alright, and where is grub installed?
[01:44] <cdcarter> malakhi: being able to recieve email, and check it on the local machine
[01:44] <bruenig> livingdaylight, add this line to the /etc/apt/sources.list "deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf edgy-plf free non-free"
[01:45] <ReporterX> RememberPOL: no, i don't :)
[01:45] <darkposeiden> I'm running apt-get -t unstable install bacula yet it still insists on installing from stable
[01:45] <livingdaylight> bruenig, what else is in there besides realplayer?
[01:45] <bruenig> livingdaylight, then run wget http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/12B83718.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[01:45] <darkposeiden> is that the correct way to run the ocmmand
[01:45] <VigoFuse> Somewheres in there, I figured just get a GRUB loader and do the diagnostics, if any.
[01:45] <malakhi> cdcarter, is this going to be mail server for a domain? or are you just trying to receive email from another smtp server?
[01:45] <bruenig> livingdaylight, w32codecs probably. A whole bunch of questionably illegal stuff. I am sure libdvdcss is in there. Not sure on everything
[01:45] <cdcarter> malakhi: for the domain
[01:45] <zntneo> anyone?
[01:46] <livingdaylight> bruenig, i think i already have that
[01:46] <Flannel> VigoFuse: where it's installed is important ;)  but, We'll go ahead and assume it's in an appropriate place, because you're getting a grub error.  So, Can you pastebin your grub menu? (/boot/grub/menu.lst)
[01:46] <livingdaylight> bruenig, i cerainly have w32codecs and libdvdcss etc
[01:46] <bruenig> livingdaylight, sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get install realplay, at least that is what this guide is telling me.
[01:46] <malakhi> cdcarter, are you getting any errors?
[01:46] <Jordan_U_> bruenig: lbdvdcss is in multiverse FYI
[01:46] <livingdaylight> bruenig, if you're getting it from the ubuntuguide.org then tht is what i've already done too
[01:47] <bruenig> Jordan_U, I know there are other places, I was just saying what is likely in there
[01:47] <cdcarter> malakhi: tryign to telnet to port 25 from my home machine doesnt connect
[01:47] <malakhi> cdcarter, is postfix running?
[01:47] <cdcarter> malakhi: yea, i can telnet into it from localhost
[01:47] <VigoFuse> Flannel: Not now, I am on winbox, But thank you again Ljl for those links, I can maybe do it in Terminal Mode.
[01:47] <malakhi> cdcarter, ah. ok. did you set up TLS?
[01:47] <cdcarter> yea

[01:49] <cdcarter> malakhi: i got it now, it was a problem with the exim process floating around
[01:49] <LjL> !info tcl8.4 | Phuzion, you mean this?

[01:50] <zac1> how do you compile assembly language
[01:50] <LjL> shaslap: not that i know of, i normally use www.easyvmx.com
[01:50] <justin_> zac1: With an ASM compiler ;D
[01:50] <Phuzion> LjL:  I'm not sure, if that's what Eggdrop requires, then yes
[01:50] <shaslap> thanks LjL
[01:50] <AnthonyG> justin_: You mean Assembler :D
[01:50] <AlmtyBob> I just got a Promise SATAII 150 TX2 SATA controller, can I install it without recompiling the kernel?

[01:53] <zntneo> Jordan_U, its ok

[01:54] <justin_> I had no idea

[01:54] <Pie-rate> jleemc44: what exactly did you do to troubleshoot your sound card?
[01:54] <AlmtyBob> I just got a Promise SATAII 150 TX2 SATA controller, can I install it without recompiling the kernel?
[01:54] <tiptip> little question, how i check if my xgl is running ok ??
[01:54] <Flannel> zied: why can't you uninstall 1.4?
[01:54] <Phuzion> jleemc44:  type gdm
[01:54] <bigfuzzyjesus> woow
[01:54] <bigfuzzyjesus> suhweet
[01:54] <bigfuzzyjesus> ok so how do you change your default file manager?
[01:55] <zied> Flannel bcoz i am beginner
[01:55] <LjL> bigfuzzyjesus: right click on a directory, "Open with", select a file manager, and set as default. in KDE.
[01:55] <justin_> tiptip: usually it is "glxinfo | grep parameter
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[01:55] <bimberi> zntneo: in particular, see the "Configuring Devices" section at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[01:55] <bigfuzzyjesus> LjL, im in xfce
[01:55] <we2by> what tool to use to display djv files?
[01:55] <justin_> tiptip: .. like glxinfo | grep Composite etc
[01:56] <zac1> how do you compile assembly language
[01:56] <jleemc44> gdm not found
[01:56] <Flannel> zied: alright, that means you don't know how, not you can't.  It's a big difference.  Which version of ubuntu are you using?  And, java isn't installed by default, so, how did you install it?
[01:56] <Flannel> zac1: compile which language, and for what device?
[01:56] <dakira> zac1: with cc or gcc
[01:56] <tiptip> Justin, when i write "glxinfo | grep Composite"  it doesnt do anything, just moving to the next line (same as pressing 'enter' without anything)
[01:56] <zied> Flannel,  i am using edgy
[01:56] <zac1> assembly language for linux
[01:56] <bigfuzzyjesus> !file manager

[01:57] <we2by> what tool to use to display djv files?
[01:57] <zied> Flannel,  okey , mau be be coz i have installed eclipse
[01:57] <zac1> :-D
[01:57] <jleemc44> what folder is gdm located in?
[01:57] <Chipp1> how can I set up a program to run on startup if it requires root privileges?
[01:57] <Yashiro> i use eclipse with PHPEclipse and QuantumDB
[01:58] <jdt> Hi is this also the chat for Kubuntu?
[01:58] <jrib> Chipp1: what program?
[01:58] <Flannel> zac1: what sort of processor do you have? (you running i386? PPC?)  nasm will work, yasm is another.
[01:58] <Jordan_U_> jdt: #kubuntu
[01:58] <bimberi> jdt: #kubuntu
[01:58] <Chipp1> jrib: that I want to run?  it's a daemon for my keyboards LCD
[01:58] <jdt> ahh... Thankyou
[01:58] <zac1> where can you find an assembler
[01:58] <kmasta> anybody wanna help me with my fan problem
[01:59] <kmasta> i've been waiting for like an hour
[01:59] <Flannel> zac1: which one do you want? yasm or nasm?  "sudo apt-get install [program] " will install it
[01:59] <jleemc44> Could someone help me out. I just dont know where to start. It has to be simple
[01:59] <Flannel> zac1: where [program]  is nasm or yasm
[01:59] <we2by> what tool to use to display djv files?
[02:00] <joeljkp> this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyGoals says dmix by default was done in Breezy... what does this mean? esd is still default in Edgy, is it not?
[02:00] <Jordan_U_> jleemc44: What is your problem ?
[02:00] <jrib> Chipp1: you could put it in /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh, or read 'man update-rc.d' and create your own script in /etc/init.d.  Or if you are on edgy you could figure out how to use upstart
[02:00] <Chipp1> jrib: on edgy, so I'll just check out upstart; thanks
[02:00] <sdlkfjskdf> Is there a way to install Ubuntu FROM a thumb drive?
[02:00] <jrib> Chipp1: the first things I recommended are still valid, upstart is just the way of the future for ubuntu
[02:00] <jleemc44> Jordan_U, gnome will not start after troubleshooting sound card
[02:00] <Jordan_U_> sdlkfjskdf: Yes
[02:01] <sdlkfjskdf> Jordan, where can I get that?
[02:01] <bimberi> !install | sdlkfjskdf
[02:01] <jleemc44> I used a help wiki to help troubleshoot
[02:01] <ubotu> sdlkfjskdf: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[02:01] <Jordan_U_> !install | sdlkfjskdf
[02:01] <jrib> !upstart | Chipp1
[02:01] <ubotu> Chipp1: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[02:01] <Flannel> zied: eclipse won't install java (although, it won't work without it), I.. don't think it's possible to install java1.4 from package management, in edgy.  How did you install it?
[02:01] <Yashiro> how do i get the info of my network devices?
[02:01] <Chipp1> jrib: saved me a google search, thanks :)
[02:01] <bimberi> Yashiro: ifconfig
[02:02] <Jordan_U_> Chipp1: But it is compatable with the tools you would use with sys V init, so you don't need to know upstart specifically
[02:02] <Yashiro> i haven't used this pc for a long time, and i installed a new network device
[02:02] <Yashiro> i wanna know who is eth0 and who is eth1
[02:02] <Chipp1> Jordan_U_: how so?
[02:02] <jleemc44> There are no errors, it just boots to a text prompt now. Why?
[02:03] <Pie-rate> Yashiro: you may be able to tell by typing "ifconfig"
[02:03] <Jordan_U_> jleemc44: try: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[02:03] <Flannel> jleemc44: how did you install?
[02:03] <jleemc44> Live-cd
[02:03] <jleemc44> Been working fine, just no sound
[02:03] <Flannel> jleemc44: oh. nevermind.  Your sound thing.  Mhmm.
[02:03] <Yashiro> Pie-rate, i'll try
[02:04] <zied> Flannel,  i have already downloaded java 1.5 form IBM website installed it and i assigned a path in /etc/profile file when i type java-version i find java version "1.4.2"

[02:04] <Flannel> zied: ah, you don't have suns java.  ok.  Follow this,
[02:04] <jleemc44> will this get me back in
[02:04] <Yashiro> how can i get the info of connected pci devices?
[02:04] <Flannel> !java | zied, follow this.  (You actualy shouldn't have downloaded from IBMs website, ubuntu has a package for java)
[02:04] <Pie-rate> bimberi: ifconfig will do the same
[02:04] <ubotu> zied, follow this.  (You actualy shouldn't have downloaded from IBMs website, ubuntu has a package for java): To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[02:05] <jleemc44> It finished, should I restart?
[02:05] <Pie-rate> yashiro: "lspci"

[02:05] <umista> whts a good media player
[02:05] <kmasta> any ideas?
[02:05] <bimberi> Pie-rate: indeed (and that was my first answer)
[02:06] <jleemc44> I tried gdm and I got file not found

[02:07] <jleemc44> Yes, finished
[02:07] <jleemc44> back to login screen now. Maby fixed?
[02:07] <zied> Flannel, thank you are there any differences betweend the sun release and IBM release ?
[02:07] <AnthonyG> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34868/ <--- Why is this still appearing , Even though I disabled carrier check via: Carrier Check=no?
[02:07] <Pie-rate> jleemc44: wow, what did you do to that thing to manage to get rid of GDM?
[02:07] <lumpki> AnthonyG, did you get your modem working?
[02:07] <Jordan_U_> jleemc44: Yup, I think I know what you did too :)
[02:07] <AnthonyG> lumpki: May I PM?
[02:07] <thevenin> anybody happen to know where a netboot image for breezy badger PPC is?
[02:07] <Flannel> zied: Just use the one in the repositories.  That way it'll get bugfixes and security fixes automatically
[02:08] <EricJ2190> can somebody help me with iptables?
[02:08] <AlmtyBob> I just got a Promise SATAII 150 TX2 SATA controller, can I install it without recompiling the kernel?
[02:08] <jleemc44> I have no clue. Trying to learn how to troubleshoot but out of my element here
[02:08] <jleemc44> Stupid me
[02:08] <zied> Flannel, ok thx man
[02:08] <Pie-rate> Jordan_U_: for the sole purpose of education, how would one accidentally remove gdm?
[02:08] <zac1> I wrote an applet in java and it won't display on a web page
[02:08] <Jordan_U_> jleemc44: You probalby removed a package that ubuntu-desktop depended on then ran apt-get autoremove which then removed everything ubuntu-desktop depended on.
[02:08] <Pie-rate> I see.
[02:09] <Jordan_U_> I did it myself once :)
[02:09] <Pie-rate> Interesting.
[02:09] <DiaboluZ> Hi... I'm on the search for a traffic statistiq tool which can create graphs etc, anyone who knows something? :)
[02:10] <bimberi> DiaboluZ: webalizer
[02:10] <pwner> can someone please help me?? i have the newest alsa drivers and libs right...but im not sure how to install them via terminal if someone can help me i'd really appreciate it
[02:10] <jleemc44> Sounds close, I noticed a command like sudo modprob
[02:10] <zac1> how do I get a java applet to work on a web page
[02:10] <LjL> DiaboluZ: "apt-cache search graph network traffic", with universe enabled, is going to help
[02:10] <jleemc44> would that mess things up?
[02:10] <LjL> Ubotu, tell zac1 about java | zac1, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:10] <DiaboluZ> bimberi> does it run with php an mysql? or what?
[02:10] <bimberi> DiaboluZ: although that's for a web server
[02:10] <umista> i have a AMD 939 3200+ cpu should i upgrade the kernel for this type of CPU for better preformance
[02:10] <DiaboluZ> well i need it for all in/out traffic
[02:11] <Jordan_U_> umista, no need
[02:11] <EricJ2190> does anyone know how to use iptables to forward all ports for an ip?
[02:11] <jleemc44> what does modprobe do?
[02:11] <bimberi> DiaboluZ: LjL's answer was better then
[02:11] <umista> but wouldn't doing so make my system run better for the type of CPU
[02:11] <zac1> justin
[02:11] <Jordan_U_> umista, The kernel can do optimazations at run time, so there is really no difference, many years ago there would be though.
[02:11] <LjL> is there a way to "renice" a process as far as I/O is concerned, i.e. make it so that other programs take precedence in disk access, and can interrupt the "reniced" program's disk operations at any time?
[02:12] <pwner> can someone please help me?? i have the newest alsa drivers and libs right...but im not sure how to install them via terminal if someone can help me i'd really appreciate it..i have the bz2 archives on my desktop but not sure what command to use to install the packages :(
[02:12] <Jordan_U_> umista: So the i386 kernel actually DOES optimize for i686 etc.
[02:12] <LjL> Ubotu, tell pwner about nvidia | pwner, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:12] <zac1> :-P
[02:12] <umista> then wht about mplayer? should i get a version for the kenel i have or get one for the type of CPU i have

[02:13] <Pie-rate> woohoo alternate install iso is done downloading!
[02:13] <CoRnJuLiOx> correct me if im wrong, but isn't there a 'system' plugins folder (where you would install flash so that any browser you have can use it)?
[02:13] <pwner> LjL: alsa is for sound...and my pro audio card
[02:13] <zac1> what does parse mean?
[02:14] <Pie-rate> now it can fail again and i can continue my search for a windows disc!
[02:14] <silya> Can't establish connection with 3128:80 ..... - Network unreachable. apt-get shows, but! proxy set correct. whta's wrong?
[02:14] <LjL> pwner: uh... of course. i don't know how i could read nvidia into that, sorry.
[02:14] <lullabud> zac1:  parsing is sorting log files into meaningful information, graphs and whatnot.
[02:14] <jleemc44_> Now, the sound probelm. lspci shows: 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01)
[02:14] <malakhi> CoRnJuLiOx, all browsers that support plugins (that I know of) check /usr/lib/firefox/plugins for plugins
[02:15] <LjL> pwner: i'm not sure installing new versions of ALSA is an easy task, anyway. you'd probably have to recompile the kernel i suppose.
[02:15] <pwner> no prob...could you help me with finding the right command lines? i have the files on my desktop, just  green with command line :p
[02:15] <EricJ2190> does anyone know how to use iptables to forward all ports for an ip?
[02:15] <silya> ping of proxy server works fine
[02:15] <michael__> i just got this sd card for a digital camera, but i have no idea how to mount it, any advice?
[02:15] <lostsync> my main computer just died and i've been forced to install xubuntu on old p2 i dug out of my flatmate's closet.  the onboard sound was not detected so i threw an old isa asound card in there but i have no idea how to tell ubuntu that it's there and to try and use it...any help?
[02:15] <delirounix> hi
[02:15] <pwner> LjL: ouch
[02:15] <LjL> pwner, i wouldn't know where to start, but if you're "green with command line", i can quite safely tell you... don't.
[02:16] <pwner> ;) gotcha..but its basically what i have dual boot linux for so...i gotta try..thnx anyway
[02:16] <LjL> pwner: is your card not supported by the drivers that are shipped with edgy?
[02:16] <Jordan_U_> umista: The one for your proccessor, individual applications usually do not optimize at run time like the kernel does.
[02:16] <pwner> it is..but i was having problems with xruns
[02:17] <delirounix> I have problems with the line for mounting flash drives, the thing messed up are permission. I would like to be able to delete and write and read on the flash drive. Could someone show the fstab line for /dev/sda1?
[02:17] <umista> sweat ok then im getting my new dual core in 2 days, wht should i do or need to do make it run with both cores?
[02:17] <Jordan_U_> umista: install the 686 kernel from the repos
[02:18] <Jordan_U_> umista: If it doesn't "just work"
[02:18] <AnthonyG> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34868/ <--- Why is this still appearing , Even though I disabled carrier check via: Carrier Check=no?
[02:18] <umista> should i do that now? or when i install the cpu?
[02:18] <carl> I'm having trouble istalling powerbible (from http://jonathanscorner.com/etc/powerbible/powerbible1_0_2.tar.bz2 ) and just wondering if anywone might have a clue as to what could be going wrong.
[02:18] <vmware> list
[02:18] <carl> I've installed it successfully on other systems, but just failed on my new Ubuntu system.
[02:19] <lostsync> how about this, then: where is some sort of device manager for xfce?
[02:19] <Jordan_U_> umista: Either way. shouldn't make a difference AFIK
[02:19] <zac1> assembler error is ubotu a computer
[02:19] <AlmtyBob> can someone tell me how to install a Promise SATA II 150 TX2?
[02:19] <zac1> is UBOTU a computer
[02:19] <AlmtyBob> lspci lists it but I don't know where to go from there
[02:19] <LjL> Ubotu, tell zac1 about bot | zac1, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:22] <zac1> so a computer is talking with us
[02:22] <umista> should i install the 686-smp kernel?
[02:22] <Jordan_U_> lostsync: device manager works on xubuntu
[02:22] <webonomic> I am having VSFTP server error on Ubuntu server 6.10.  It is a freshly installed system.   When I go to $sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart, I get the error: *stoping ftp server No /usr/sbin/vsftpd found running;none killed. *starting ftp server
[02:23] <Jordan_U_> umista: I have been told that is just a meta package that just installs regular 686 which has smp support, but I may be wrong.
[02:23] <lostsync> Jordan_U, i had to do a server install and then manually apt-get install xubuntu-desktop...would that have maybe not included device manager?  because i can't seem to find it anywhere
[02:23] <zac1> assembly language parsing error
[02:24] <Jordan_U_> lostsync: I don't know if it comes with xubuntu, but the same package works in xubuntu and can be installed from the repos
[02:24] <DiaboluZ> Trying to use iptotal... It displays super fine graphs, but is there a way to also collect/store the amount of transferred data?
[02:25] <chad> anyone:  I need some help with getting my Palm categories to sync with Evolution using the Pilot applet.  I can sync fine; but, the categories do not sync.
[02:25] <delirounix> I have problems with the line for mounting flash drives, the thing messed up are permission. I would like to be able to delete and write and read on the flash drive. Could someone show the fstab line for /dev/sda1?
[02:25] <lostsync> Jordan_U, thank you very much for your help.  apt-cache search or google should be able to take it from here :)
[02:25] <lostsync> and/or perhaps
[02:25] <zac1> vasos
[02:25] <Pie-rate> thank you all for the help, i will try to help people here as much as possible and seed torrents as much as possible
[02:25] <Pie-rate> bye

[02:26] <yanqing> i compiled the hg version of alsa, then the snd-hda-intel module disappear
[02:26] <yanqing> actually, only some seq modules were produced
[02:26] <Chipp1> hey, writing my own upstart job and a little confused (and the upstart chan is dead quiet) can anyone here help me out?
[02:27] <lostsync> Jordan_U, that looks to be the one.  thanks :)
[02:27] <zac1> Java class applet not working on my web page. how do you get it to work?  i hava java installed
[02:28] <AnthonyG> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34868/ <--- Why is this still appearing , Even though I disabled carrier check via: Carrier Check=no?
[02:28] <SpAc> which is the best guide to follow for installing the nvidia beta drivers?
[02:29] <zac1> how do i display a Java applet that I created on my webpage
[02:29] <carl> Can anyone tell me why install of http://jonathanscorner.com/etc/powerbible/powerbible1_0_2.tar.bz2 would fail on ubuntu?  (It seems to work ok on slackware and fedora systems.)
[02:29] <SpAc> is the a reputable source? http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
[02:29] <LjL> AnthonyG, i think that's about the carrier line of the RS232 interface (i.e. the serial port), rather than about the carrier checking of the phoneline performed by the modem
[02:29] <zac1> source tarballs never work for me!
[02:30] <Jordan_U_> umista: I just checked and my dual core machine is using the generic kernel with both cores being utilised so even smp is supported in the generic kernel
[02:30] <kitche> carl: if it's source you need build-esstenial to compile
[02:30] <umista> mmmm
[02:30] <umista> nice
[02:30] <carl>  kitche So, I need to install  build-esstenial ?
[02:31] <anibal> hi
[02:31] <zac1> ./configure, make, install make
[02:31] <Jordan_U_> carl: yup
[02:31] <kitche> carl: yes if you want to use make and other compile tools
[02:31] <anibal> ?
[02:31] <kitche> !hi|anibal
[02:31] <ubotu> anibal: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[02:31] <AnthonyG> LjL: So is there a solution , Or is this procedure embedded into the line?
[02:31] <carl>  kitche Couldn't find package build-esstenial
[02:31] <anibal> thanks
[02:32] <carl> is it build-essential?
[02:32] <LjL> AnthonyG: there is a solution, which probably involves adding the appropriate command to the initialization AT sequence for the modem. i just don't remember the command.
[02:32] <malakhi> carl, yes
[02:32] <Jordan_U_> carl: forgot the "T" :)
[02:32] <AnthonyG> LjL: One step forward and two steps back....
[02:32] <carl>  Couldn't find package build-essetenial
[02:32] <carl>  Couldn't find package build-essetenial
[02:33] <malakhi> carl, apitude install build-essential
[02:33] <kitche> carl: essential
[02:33] <carl> ok,  yea,
[02:33] <carl> got it
[02:33] <LjL> AnthonyG: try adding "&C0" to your init string. not entirely sure.
[02:33] <Jordan_U_> malakhi: Now that apt has autoremove are there any advantages to using aptitude instead of apt?
[02:33] <AnthonyG> LjL: Alright , I'll give it a go and report back shortly :D
[02:34] <AnthonyG> exit
[02:34] <AnthonyG> :|
[02:34] <LjL> AnthonyG: "Init = ATZ&C0" would probably be the vwdial option
[02:34] <lostsync> well i have 4 PnP Devices listed that afaik linux has no idea what to do with.  is there a package other than alsa-base that needs to be installed for sound support?
[02:34] <jrib> Jordan_U_: well it installs suggested packages by default and has a curses interface
[02:34] <shwag> what is linux-image-server  and how do I install it ?
[02:34] <zim> hi all
[02:34] <carl> I installed build-essential but it made no difference.
[02:34] <zim> in this line "ftp $FTP_SERVER <<END_SCRIPT"  what is this doing <<END_SCRIPT
[02:35] <malakhi> Jordan_U_, it installs suggests by default (which i like) and i don't have to remember apt-cache vs apt-get
[02:35] <LjL> shwag: it is the Linux kernel that's used in the Server edition of Ubuntu. "sudo apt-get install linux-image-server" - not sure why you'd do that, though
[02:35] <carl> any other ideas?  (I sure need to install this web based application).
[02:35] <malakhi> Jordan_U_, while it has a curses interface, i never use that feature.

[02:35] <LjL> pagefault: i don't know

[02:35] <Jordan_U_> pagefault: No, there isn't even a server kernel.
[02:36] <kitche> pagefault: by default the kernels in ubuntu are SMP
[02:36] <pagefault> my 386 wasn't

[02:36] <pagefault> I had to get the server image to get SMP

[02:37] <shwag> LjL: I AM using the server edition
[02:37] <pagefault> I am just saying the generic one did not detect my dual cores

[02:38] <bimberi> shwag: actually, I'm really not sure
[02:38] <shwag> LjL: well..i think its just being held back because apt-get wont do a kernel upgrade implicitly
[02:38] <shwag> bimberi: doh.
[02:38] <LjL> shwag: it always does, here
[02:38] <LjL> not the server edition though

[02:48] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: So you just have a theme you don't like? It would really help if you could refrase your problem, if English is not your firs language there are other channels for othere languages

[02:49] <flodine> anyone use pan newsreader who can help me
[02:49] <Jordan_U> LjL: Whas that aimed at me?
[02:49] <jrib> zim: yes, I'm not really sure why.  To me it seems like it should work.  A dedicated scripting channel like #bash might be able to help you better
[02:49] <rbil> umista: just create a launcher that launches Nautilus and it'll open in your dir.
[02:49] <startswithz> hi.  Ok how do I set up a repository?
[02:49] <LjL> Jordan_U: yeah. the guy you were addressing left the channel before you pressed Enter. he's back now, though.
[02:49] <Jordan_U> LjL: If it was I don't know what you mean.
[02:50] <lullabud> Jordan_U:  he means go check out #ubuntu-xgl again.
[02:50] <zim> asked there but its dead
[02:50] <Jordan_U> LjL: Ah, I need to pay more attention / use tab completion :)
[02:50] <flodine> has anyone loaded pan newsreader beta 119 ?
[02:50] <DeepThoughts> Can someone explain why people can't downlad files through sftp when they have access to read them, only when they have access to read *and* write to them?
[02:50] <mirak> is it possible to fake the time and date of an email ?
[02:50] <jrib> zim: k well, if you change "ftp $FTP_SERVER" to "cat" does it go all the way through?

[02:51] <DiaboluZ> hmmm i just made a passwd file, made an .htaccess file and placed it in the directory, but still the site is free available - any suggestions?
[02:52] <AnthonyG> LjL: The modem won't respond to it.
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> I
[02:53] <jrib> DiaboluZ: pastebin your .htaccess maybe
[02:53] <rbil> DiaboluZ: maybe apache isn't setup to use .htaccess?
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> I'm installing VMWareplayer., and I'm at the part where itas asking me how much diskspace to use.
[02:53] <AnthonyG> LjL: The modem does not respond to the command.
[02:53] <IndyGUnFreak> should I just chooe all unpartitioned space?
[02:54] <startswithz> can someone tell me how to set up repositories?
[02:54] <grndslm> what do you guys think the best laptop i could get for around $1100 is??  are amd turion x2s any good?
[02:54] <DiaboluZ> rbil> might be a chance, i'll have a look :)
[02:55] <LjL> AnthonyG, i haven't found out anything more about that. i've read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NO_CARRIER_(modem) but didn't help much
[02:55] <davey486> I'm trying to insall a wireless net adapter on dapper and the article i am reading says that the card needs to be wlan0, right now it is ra0 how do i changed it?
[02:55] <AnthonyG> LjL: Bah....
[02:55] <lumpki> startswithz, you can enable them with synaptic
[02:55] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: Do you still need help? If so could you rephrase your question?
[02:55] <rbil> IndyGUnFreak: I believe vmplayer is talking about how large to make a virtual drive for the o/s you want to run?
[02:55] <lumpki> unless you are talking about unoffical ones
[02:56] <Dreamglider> i jsut tried the latest flash, but everytime i opend sites with flash opjects firefox shut down
[02:56] <jrib> startswithz: maybe take a look at falcon
[02:56] <rbil> IndyGUnFreak: actually vmplayer can't create virtual drives by itself, so not sure what you're confronted with there.
[02:57] <davey486> can i change my wifi card iterface name from ra0 to wlan0?
[02:57] <kitche> Dreanglider: open firefox in console then go to a flash sote and when firefox crashed the console will tell the specific error

[02:58] <redDEADresolve> I am running Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy with Beryl Installed and working great.
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> When I setup Beryl, I set it up as a separate login to load into Ubuntu. I choose to start a GNOME session or a XGL-Beryl session. When I Load into Gnome I want a application to start (brightside) automatically. I added it to my sessions (Under system-->preferences-->sessions). I works great does what it supposed to and everything is cool. But When I load into my XGL-Beryl session brightside also loads and messes up my sys
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> tem.
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> I want to be able to run certain programs at start up for certain sessions.
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> For example
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> -Beryl-manager & a couple of fixes to get Beryl working when I run a XGL session.
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> -brightside when I load into gnome.
[02:58] <redDEADresolve> How do I accomplish this?
[02:58] <jrib> !enter | redDEADresolve
[02:58] <ubotu> redDEADresolve: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[02:59] <redDEADresolve> sorry i didnt want to mush two paragraphs together
[02:59] <Rug> My sound is broken.  I just reinstalled kubuntu (after trying suse, mepis) and it reports an error "no sound devices found".  This same box has been working fine with ubuntu since Hoary.  Any advice?
[02:59] <AnthonyG> LjL: What else can you suggest?
[02:59] <jrib> !sound | Rug
[02:59] <ubotu> Rug: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

[03:01] <grndslm> what do you guys think the best laptop i could get for around $1100 is??  are amd turion x2s any good, relative to core duos & core 2 duos?
[03:01] <burnhamd> ?
[03:01] <st3v3n_r0y> window themes
[03:01] <jrib> st3v3n_r0y: then it isn't a gnome theme issue if you can't get to the gdm login screen
[03:02] <st3v3n_r0y> jrib do you get to the gdm login screen? = yes i do
[03:02] <rbil> DiaboluZ: just like I spelled "line" wrong :-)
[03:02] <noodles12> core duos are better than the x2

[03:03] <samuel> i mean the config file?
[03:03] <Keyseir> I've got a rather complicated RAM issue. I have two 256 chips and a 512, sdram. I originally was getting segfaults on my ubuntu installation, and then I even got it on a livecd. I couldn't even install on the hd, and I was able to install dapper when I removed the 512. However, I never got any errors running memtest86 for a total of 6-7 hours. 'Memtester' finds errors when the 512 chip is in the picture SOMETIMES, but sometimes I change
[03:03] <Keyseir>  the test memory value by maybe 5m and it all changes. Anyone who knows a lot about hardware/ram have an idea?
[03:04] <st3v3n_r0y> any body ?
[03:04] <Naik0> Hey i need some sources? Where should i look?
[03:04] <DiaboluZ> rbil> but what do you mean about the passwd file being somewhere wrong?

[03:04] <bimberi> !easysource | Naik0

[03:04] <Naik0> bimberi: thanks
[03:04] <kitche> zied: javac is part of Java SDK
[03:05] <kitche> zied: or you can compile javac if you download it from the openjdk site
[03:05] <Dreamglider> i installed the beta flash, i get video but no audio !

[03:06] <startswithz> how do I save in the nano editor?
[03:06] <kitche> Dreamglider: probably your sound is being used by another thing for example maybe a sound server
[03:06] <burnhamd> grndsim ive been hooked on macs for the last couple of years but ive hear lenovo has some of the best lappy's and toshiba also i am starting to like some of hp's stuff(mainly because its mac like)
[03:06] <st3v3n_r0y> i dont know how to create user from terminal
[03:06] <burnhamd> dunno about sony of dell though
[03:07] <kitche> startswithz: it's the Write out command :)
[03:07] <jrib> st3v3n_r0y: adduser my_new_user
[03:07] <lumpki> startswithz, ctrl-o i think
[03:07] <Madpilot> startswithz, Cltr+X
[03:07] <burnhamd> im afraid im not much help when it comes to shopping for one
[03:07] <st3v3n_r0y> ok lamme try
[03:07] <kitche> startswithz: nano has a menu at the bottom if you look down at the bottom
[03:07] <lumpki> yep, ctrl-o
[03:07] <davey486> can someone help setup a wifi card?
[03:07] <jrib> st3v3n_r0y: ctrl-o to save, ctrl-x to exist but you are asked to save if you exit without saving
[03:07] <startswithz> that's what I thought, I wanted to make sure since I'm messing with repositories
[03:07] <Naik0> bimberi: i have edgy but i can only choose dapper, hoary or breezy
[03:07] <Dreamglider> kitche, how can i fix it then ?
[03:07] <lumpki> jrib, true that
[03:08] <jrib> startswithz: ^ that was for you :)
[03:08] <kitche> Dreamglider: you using gnome correct?
[03:08] <Dreamglider> kitche, i just installed it, and yea i think i am!
[03:08] <st3v3n_r0y> jrib ok . tnx
[03:08] <startswithz> thanks everyone sorry to be bringing such assinine questions
[03:08] <Dreamglider> misread, yes i use Gnome.
[03:08] <rbil> DiaboluZ: here's a tutorial on .htaccess .... http://www.freewebmasterhelp.com/tutorials/htaccess/3
[03:09] <jrib> st3v3n_r0y: ignore the ctrl-o, ctrl-x stuff, that was for someone else
[03:09] <kitche> Dreamglider: open up a console and do killall esd then restart firefox then you should have sound perhaps but that's a start anyways
[03:09] <rbil> DiaboluZ: notice that the authusrfile points to the .htpasswd file you should place in the same dir with .htaccess
[03:09] <lumpki> hey startswithz, you could always make a backup when you start messing with config files  :P
[03:09] <st3v3n_r0y> jrib which one i will chose?
[03:09] <kishan> hi
[03:09] <bimberi> Naik0: Argh.  Sorry, I didn't realise it hadn't bee updated.  You could change dapper to edgy in your generated sources.list although that might not work for all entries.
[03:09] <Naik0> Hey i am doing a sourcelist now and im using ubuntu edgy, but i can only choose dapper, breezy or hoary wich should i choose? :S
[03:09] <jrib> st3v3n_r0y: what are your choices?
[03:10] <Naik0> bimberi: okok thanks
[03:10] <st3v3n_r0y> ignore the ctrl-o, ctrl-x stuff, that was for someone else ?
[03:10] <st3v3n_r0y> i didnt get it
[03:10] <DiaboluZ> rbil> what? should the .htpasswd be in the same directory? omg...
[03:10] <jrib> st3v3n_r0y: I mean, the comment about ctrl-o and ctrl-x was meant for someone else, but I mistakenly put your name in front
[03:10] <st3v3n_r0y> oh ok
[03:10] <rbil> DiaboluZ: maybe not necessary but you need the correct path to it and it needs to be within the www user space
[03:11] <st3v3n_r0y> lamme try now :)
[03:11] <st3v3n_r0y> brb
[03:11] <Dreamglider> kitche, No go i dont hear anything
[03:11] <rbil> DiaboluZ: when I've used it in the past, I've kept the 2 files together in the directory I wish to password protect
[03:11] <DiaboluZ> ok

[03:13] <Jordan_U> Dreamglider: Flash 9 beta should fix the sound issues with flash.
[03:14] <Dreamglider> Jordan_U, i have that !

[03:18] <lullabud> corevette:  i believe handbrake has a beta linux version.  it's the best.
[03:18] <s0nix> Jordan_U, tryed. no success.
[03:18] <DevC> ok what is the other development package i need for x11? because libx11-dev only puts  /usr/X11R6/ bin, lib, man and I need the include directory for this library
[03:18] <s0nix> lullabud at the boot menu?
[03:18] <lullabud> s0nix:  yeah, where it gives you the option to boot up, check memory, etc.
[03:19] <strabes> lostinc: kalarm i believe. it's a kde app. quodlibet is a music player and it has an alarm clock function
[03:19] <bimberi> Naik0: looks ok.  have you done a 'sudo apt-get update' ?
[03:19] <lostinc> thanks
[03:19] <Naik0> yupp

[03:25] <DiaboluZ> rbil> yes
[03:25] <lullabud> strabes:  either way, there's a wpasupplicant package.
[03:25] <noodles12> pwner: uname -r
[03:25] <strabes> lullabud: then why don't you install it?
[03:25] <rbil> DiaboluZ: and Require ... what is user me ... 2 users?
[03:25] <Dreamglider> strabes, yea
[03:25] <Flannel> zied: did you install sun java from the repositories?
[03:25] <lullabud> strabes:  because i don't use wireless in linux except with kismet. ;-)
[03:26] <strabes> lullabud: ok then
[03:26] <corevette> so..does anyone know how to install handbrake?
[03:26] <strabes> Dreamglider: does it see your wifi network?
[03:26] <DiaboluZ> rbil> actually yes, but i just tried to cut it down to 1 user, still no go
[03:26] <strabes> Dreamglider: 1st things 1st
[03:26] <noodles12> sudo dhclient eth1 said "No DHCPOFFERS recieved" which woudl make sense because i cannot connect anymore
[03:26] <strabes> noodles12: that's cuz you're not connected anymore
[03:27] <lullabud> corevette:  in os x, drag and drop.  in linux, you have to compile from source, i think.
[03:27] <rbil> DiaboluZ: did u use that online utility to create the user/password pair that you then entered into .htpasswd?
[03:27] <Dreamglider> strabes, yes
[03:27] <strabes> noodles12: you would have to be connected before you do the dhclient
[03:27] <rbil> DiaboluZ: did you hit enter after that line in .htpasswd?
[03:27] <strabes> Dreamglider: what happens when you click on your wifi network in nm-applet then
=== st3v2n is now known as st3v3n_r0y
[03:27] <DiaboluZ> rbil> i havn't edited that file manually
[03:27] <corevette> lullabud, how do you compile it....
[03:28] <lullabud> corevette:  there's a script you run that downloads everything, actually.  i forgot the name, but the info is all in the source tgz.
[03:28] <kitche> zied: probably I have never used IBM java
[03:28] <rbil> DiaboluZ: well try editing it manually. I don't know what you're using to create it?
[03:28] <lullabud> corevette:  it's called jam.  that's right.
[03:28] <Dreamglider> strabes, it becomes two dots with a blue 'worm' going in sircle
[03:28] <st3v3n_r0y> sir you there ?
[03:28] <st3v3n_r0y> i forget your id :S
[03:28] <DiaboluZ> rbil> used apaches passwordfile creator... both files have an empty line at the end
[03:29] <zied> Flannel,  yas I did, i am working on a project i need the command javac, this means that i have to install java SDK then  i have to make a path to the same directory as java, i am running on project which has a classpath compatible with ibm java
[03:29] <strabes> Dreamglider: that means it's connecting; it should detect the type of security you have enabled and then ask you for the corresponding information
[03:29] <rbil> DiaboluZ: hmmm, I'm not familar with apache's passwordfile creator, never used it. I just manually create thefiles
[03:29] <st3v3n_r0y> can anyone tell me how to change theme of other user? gnome edgy 6.10
[03:29] <rbil> DiaboluZ: paste the .htpasswd file to pastebin
[03:30] <DiaboluZ> rbil> well only thing it does is to scramble the password... ok...
[03:30] <Jordan_U> corevette: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=114946
[03:30] <rbil> DiaboluZ: yeh, but does it write it in the pair .... username:encrypted_password ?
[03:30] <corevette> jordan_u thank you much
[03:30] <ivx> hey if i did the command  sudo mod ehci_hcd, what would undo that
[03:30] <st3v3n_r0y> is there any way to change theme of other user? gnome edgy 6.10
[03:31] <DiaboluZ> rbil>http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/QjkLcj27.html
[03:31] <wastrel> st3v3n_r0y:  do you have root access?
[03:31] <bimberi> ivx: mod?  you mean modprobe? insmod?
[03:31] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: Logging in as that user would be easiest.
[03:31] <st3v3n_r0y> wastrel,  ofcourse i do
[03:32] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U,  i cant .coz theme gone crazy..
[03:32] <ivx> binberi, i read some thing about getting usb storage devices to work, and it said to that, i do, and it just mad things worse, that command did somthing
[03:32] <Dreamglider> ping me
[03:32] <rbil> DiaboluZ: well I'm still concerned with this line: AuthUserFile "/var/www/.htpasswd  don't think the " is required in that line
[03:33] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U, if i login to that account . that show me nothing .
[03:33] <Eclypse> guys, I was here earlier about a corrupted zip file . . . anyways, one of the files in the archive /can/ be fully recovered . . . but I'm sick of windows BS shareware . . . so, is there any such tool that can recover such files in Linux?
[03:33] <bimberi> ivx: yes, but there's no such command as "mod" - at least on my system
[03:33] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: You could su to that user then run the theme changer as that user, you don't need to log in.
[03:33] <pwner> can someone reccomend a good guide/way to get a realtime kernel going in edgy?
[03:33] <gcbirzan`> hey
[03:33] <kitche> Eclypse: unrar probably
[03:33] <DiaboluZ> rbil> there is no " in that line?
[03:33] <kitche> opps forget that Eclypse try zip
[03:34] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U, su = root right ?
[03:34] <rbil> DiaboluZ:  this was your paste ... http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/MMhH1a23.html
[03:34] <Jordan_U> pwner: Curious, what are you using it for?
[03:34] <pwner> Audio
[03:34] <Eclypse> kitche you're gonna have to be more specifc . . .
[03:34] <ivx> bimberi, sry typed it wrong rmmod ehci_hcd
[03:34] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: No, su <other user's name>
[03:34] <pwner> my fav winapp for music creation (EnergyXT) has its "linux" version beta coming out friday :)
[03:35] <DiaboluZ> rbil> sorry, must be tired, again a little "spell" glitch while typing of the file to the pastebin (can't copy directly from my server)
[03:35] <bimberi> ivx: ah,  'sudo modprobe ehci_hcd' to restart that kernel module
[03:35] <rbil> DiaboluZ: don't like the way that pastebin works, use this one ... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[03:35] <Flannel> zied: Installing the deb will set up all the path stuff for you, including javac.
[03:35] <bimberi> ivx: *restore  (not restart)
[03:35] <kitche> Eclypse: you should be able to extract the file with unzip not sure the exact switch to do it
[03:36] <Ernz> Hello, what can I use to record video in Ubuntu Dapper?
[03:36] <Malician> heya all
[03:36] <Ernz> * From screen.
[03:36] <DiaboluZ> rbil> what do you want me to paste than`?
[03:36] <Jordan_U> pwner: Would it take advantage of the real time kernel, windows certainly isn't real time ( again, curious ) ?
[03:36] <ivx> alright bimberi, thanks, do you have any idea how to get a usb storage device to work
[03:36] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U,  i login as that user on terminal . now what i have to do ?
[03:36] <Flannel> st3v3n_r0y, Jordan_U, use sudo, not su.
[03:36] <Malician> i've got 3d drivers installed and working well (glxgears gives 7000 frames a second) but.. desktop is horrendously slow (moving / resizing windows / scrolling in firefox)
[03:36] <Eclypse> kitche, zip has a -FF command :)
[03:36] <Eclypse> oh man I love linux
[03:36] <Eclypse> :)
[03:36] <Malician> does anybody know what could cause this?
[03:37] <zied> Flannel, Flannel  if i need only jdk tools from ibm is that okey ?
[03:37] <rbil> DiaboluZ: never mind, I didn't know you weren't pasting
[03:37] <st3v3n_r0y> r00t@r00t-server:/home/steven$ sudo r00t
[03:37] <st3v3n_r0y> Password:
[03:37] <st3v3n_r0y> sudo: r00t: command not found
[03:37] <st3v3n_r0y> r00t@r00t-server:/home/steven$
[03:37] <Jordan_U> Flannel: He isn't becoming root, he is becoming another underprivaleged user.
[03:37] <Flannel> zied: it'll install sun's java.  I have no idea if IBMs libraries are compatable
[03:37] <Flannel> Jordan_U: right, use sudo for that
[03:37] <pwner> Jordan_U: it will utilize jack and the alsa stuff iirc....and the reason you need rt kernel is for MIDI latency..you cant acheive a usable latency >12ms or so, without real time kernel
[03:37] <ivx> bimberi, would i maby have to mount it? how do i do that?
[03:37] <bimberi> ivx: not really, my usb storage experiences with Ubuntu have all been simply to plug it in and watch it automount
[03:37] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  don't paste like that.
[03:37] <DiaboluZ> rbil> ok, got any more suggestions why it isn't working?
[03:37] <rbil> DiaboluZ: all I can say is that is should work. Don't know why it isn't? Only thing I can think of is config in apache is incorrect, but you say it is correct
[03:37] <Flannel> st3v3n_r0y: sudo -u r00t
[03:37] <Malician> does anybody know what could cause slow 3d on the desktop?
[03:37] <st3v3n_r0y> i am really sorry
[03:37] <Malician> and i'm not running XGL or beryl or anything
[03:38] <ivx> bimberi, yeah that use to happen in 6.06, not anymore
[03:38] <Malician> the Nvidia drivers appear to be correctly installed
[03:38] <DiaboluZ> rbil> i guess the basic config of apache i fine?
[03:38] <Flannel> st3v3n_r0y: and, you need a command after that.  Or if you want to open a shell as them, sudo -u [username]  -s
[03:38] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  sudo executes a command.  are you trying to execute the command "r00t"?
[03:38] <bimberi> ivx: 'tail /var/log/syslog' and see if it gives you any message on a device (eg. /dev/sda1).  Then mount that.
[03:38] <siXy> Malician, in a termianl run glxinfo | grep direct
[03:38] <st3v3n_r0y> yes
[03:38] <Malician> direct rendering: Yes
[03:38] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  yes to me?
[03:38] <zied> Flannel, thank you again
[03:38] <Malician> sixy, direct rendering = yes
[03:39] <rbil> DiaboluZ: from Apache docs: Note that AllowOverride AuthConfig must be in effect for these directives to have any effect.
[03:39] <st3v3n_r0y> yes to you lullabud
[03:39] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  where is the command "r00t" located?
[03:39] <st3v3n_r0y> sudo -r r00t -s = is works
[03:39] <Flannel> lullabud: r00t is a user, not a command
[03:39] <st3v3n_r0y> lullabud,  is works
[03:39] <DiaboluZ> rbil> it has affect all
[03:39] <lullabud> Flannel:  he just said it was a command.
[03:39] <litropy> quick question: kernel 2.6.19 stable is out. Any way I can just install the patch and keep my current configs?
[03:39] <lullabud> Flannel:  root is a user.  r00t is... who knows what.
[03:39] <st3v3n_r0y> Flannel, now plesae tell me how to change theme ?
[03:39] <Ernz> Help?
[03:39] <st3v3n_r0y> lol
[03:39] <ivx> bimberi, apperently there is a bug, and it says it is an unreadable scsi device, is there anyplace to get 6.06 again?
[03:39] <siXy> then unless you are running on very little ram you should not have too much of a problem. what parts of it appear slow?
[03:39] <Flannel> st3v3n_r0y: theme?  What are you talking about?
[03:39] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: gnome-theme-manager
[03:40] <Malician> moving windows, resizing windows
[03:40] <hanasaki> how can i change the app that is run by firefox for different mime types
[03:40] <Chippy> hey, I just installed the latest nvidia drivers, and I have a pretty bad problem with the screens image tearing, can anyone help me out?
[03:40] <Ernz> I'm trying to record the Ubuntu desktop to a video, and have been completely unsuccessful so far. Anyone have suggestions?
[03:40] <Malician> even if i move a window around slowly it's slow and it tears visually
[03:40] <bimberi> ivx: yes, further down on http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[03:40] <st3v3n_r0y> Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.
[03:40] <noodles12> my wireless connection no longer connects to my network and i used to be able to connect. However, other people in my family have no problem connecting wirelessly with xp. what coudl be the cause of this?
[03:40] <st3v3n_r0y> :(
[03:40] <Malician> it's effectively the same right now as it was in suse with software rendering
[03:40] <st3v3n_r0y> lullabud,  ofcourse .
[03:40] <bimberi> Ernz: istanbul ?
[03:40] <jvai> gn ppl.
[03:40] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U,  isnt working
[03:40] <chronic1> anyone here ever have trouble writing data to a flashdrive
[03:41] <Malician> however, before i installed the 3d drivers the entire system would slow down when i moved a window
[03:41] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: Try just logging in as a safe mode session from the GDM
[03:41] <Ernz> bimberi: The video's that makes are all screwed up, like the codec's gone bad.
[03:41] <chronic1> the cp command completes...but the data sometimes (often) doesn't get written
[03:41] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: Or whatever it is called.
[03:41] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U,  how ? i dont know :S
[03:41] <Ropechoborra> Hi, i want to block an IP adress with iptables. I puted this line in the .sh but didnt work.. what could it be? iptables -A INPUT -s 67.80.42.74 -j DROP
[03:41] <glassman> having trouble setting up edgy onto fakeraid with dmraid, anyone wanna help?
[03:41] <Flannel> Ropechoborra: You might look into firestarter, it's a GUI frontend to iptables
[03:41] <wastrel> chronic1:  the drive doesn't always sync until you unmount because the disk writes are buffered.
[03:42] <Malician> i'll try restarting the computer completely again
[03:42] <Malician> maybe restarting the xserver isn't enough
[03:42] <wastrel> chronic1:  you have to unmount the drive before you remove it.
[03:42] <st3v3n_r0y> sudo -l r00t -s is not working Jordan_U
[03:42] <st3v3n_r0y> what i do?
[03:42] <rbil> DiaboluZ: reading this doc, maybe you need to chown and chmod your password file?  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html#basic
[03:42] <Ropechoborra> Flannel dont got firestarter... cant i do it just with iptables?
[03:42] <st3v3n_r0y> Flannel,  sudo -l r00t -s is not working
[03:42] <chronic1> hmmm -- should be interesting to see how the psp reacts to that
[03:42] <Naik0_> Hey, i want to show my computer and trash on my desk, how do i do to show them on the desk?
=== Naik0_ is now known as Naik0
[03:42] <mpfeif101> Hi guys, can I get some help setting up a network with samba?
[03:42] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  i really think r00t isn't a command.  what are you even trying to do?
[03:42] <glassman> ?
[03:43] <st3v3n_r0y> lullabud, that is a user name
[03:43] <Flannel> Ropechoborra: you can.  I don't know how.  But, you could ask in #iptables, I'm sure they can help you
[03:43] <st3v3n_r0y> not command
[03:43] <bruenig> !icons | Naik0
[03:43] <ubotu> Naik0: Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[03:43] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: why are you doing " sudo -l r00t -s" ?
[03:43] <Flannel> st3v3n_r0y: where did the -l come from?  -u not -l
[03:43] <Ropechoborra> Thanks!
[03:43] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  then running it with sudo isn't going to do much good.  sudo runs a command.
[03:43] <bimberi> Ernz: hmmk.  Regarding that I have no idea, unless there's some way to change the codec it uses.
[03:43] <LjL> st3v3n_r0y: ok, now let me tell you something. whoever told you that "sudo -l r00t -s" was a valid command was making fun of you. "-l" is a sudo option that lists privileges, and "r00t" is just a... slang term for "root", i.e. administrator.
[03:43] <st3v3n_r0y> Flannel,  oh sorry
[03:43] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  as in `sudo command --switch`
[03:43] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  as in `sudo whoami`
[03:44] <Ernz> bimberi: I Read into doing it via swf and vnc, but it gets very complicated!
[03:44] <Flannel> lullabud: no.  Not if he wants a shell, and switches come before the command
[03:44] <st3v3n_r0y> oh yeah its working -u is work
[03:44] <lullabud> Flannel:  even so, the user isn't r00t.
[03:44] <mpfeif101> I posted on the forums, and if someone could take a look at it thatd be really great
[03:44] <lullabud> st3v3n_r0y:  the way i get a root shell is `sudo su -`
[03:44] <Flannel> lullabud: er, I believe it is.
[03:45] <Flannel> lullabud: no.  sudo -s, please don't recommend the use of su
[03:45] <st3v3n_r0y> lullabud,  lol
[03:45] <mpfeif101> I want to replace windows as my default os but i cant if im not able to print or access shared folders

[03:45] <lullabud> Flannel:  what's the difference?  (not in a snide way, but in a curious way.)
[03:45] <bruenig> !hi | Music_Shuffle
[03:45] <ubotu> Music_Shuffle: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:45] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: Is english your first language?
[03:45] <LjL> lullabud: "sudo -i" is shorter and less redundant ;-) why chain together two different commands (sudo and su) that can do the same thing, i.e. switch user?
[03:46] <whyameye> mpfeif101: you are trying to share files/folders amongst what OSes?
[03:46] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U,  no :)
[03:46] <Music_Shuffle> Anyone know what I can do for this annoying little glitch...I just installed Ubuntu on a new machine...and it runs fine, except when I try to reboot.  It refuses to restart in any way/shape/form without the CMOS jumper being switched to a different position than it was at the last reset.  Wtf?  Any help!?

[03:47] <rbil> DiaboluZ:  well, sorry, I'm at a loss. Maybe go to the #apache channel and ask the experts there
[03:47] <mpfeif101> whyameye - I am trying to share folders with the other computers in my network (which use windows xp)
[03:47] <MBohrer14> is there someone that can help me understand how to do a quick format for installing ubuntu... I have created a partition in gparted on my windows HD and gave it 50 gigs.. how much before or after do i give it?
[03:47] <XiXaQ> I want to remove the trashbin icon from view and have it on the places menu instead. How do I do that? The thrash is everywhere, right? On all writable media?
[03:47] <mpfeif101> I am able to get in to the folders, theres just one little glitch
[03:47] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: I don't know, it would be #ubuntu-<two letter country code> like German is #ubuntu-de.
[03:47] <DiaboluZ> #apache
[03:48] <mpfeif101> its like ubuntu doesnt recongize the computers and network as folders at first, i have to keep clicking until eventually the icon turns into a folder and i am able to get in
[03:48] <DiaboluZ> sry
[03:48] <lullabud> LjL:  nifty, i didn't know that switch.

[03:49] <Jordan_U> grndslm: transreflective ?
[03:49] <lullabud> LjL:  i had gotten used to the sudo su thing because redhat didn't keep the shell vars, and the version i use doesn't appear to have -i.

[03:51] <Jordan_U> st3v3n_r0y: Ok, log out, there should be a menue at the bottom right, click it and go to sessions, then choose "failsafe Gnome" and log in as the user that has the broken theme.
[03:52] <st3v3n_r0y> Jordan_U,  lamme try :)
[03:52] <rukuartic> I'm lookin' to build my own edition of Ubuntu (Kinda like Kubuntu and Edubuntu... but with MythTV instead.) I know its a big task, and I'm wondering where I can start reading up on how to do this. Anyone have a few ideas?
[03:52] <grndslm> Jordan_U:  transreflective screens draw energy from the sun so that there is no such thing as glare when you bring a laptop outside...and it makes the screen bright, even outdoors...and i think it uses less battery power too
[03:52] <DevC> what package do I need to get the include source files for x11? libx11-dev doesn't install the includes
[03:53] <glassman> so if i'm trying to get help, should i just hollar about my problem until someone responds or -- is there a system?
[03:53] <wastrel> there's no system
[03:53] <errorlevel> glassman: I believe it is systematic hollaring until someone helps. =)
[03:53] <cafuego_> Just asking, no yelling required.
[03:54] <mpfeif101> lol, well if thats the case, can anyone take a look at my problem? :)
[03:54] <Jordan_U> DevC: sudo apt-get source ?
[03:54] <DevC> I only need the x11 source not all of it lol
[03:54] <XiXaQ>  Hey, this is fun! 
[03:54] <babo> Guys, I'm looking for info on how to make my usb device bootable. There's something in the docs about doing it when the computer isn't usb bootable.
[03:55] <Jordan_U> !grub | babo
[03:55] <ubotu> babo: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[03:55] <babo> Is there an easy way to do this ? I guess I can't just copy a live ubuntu iso onto a usb ha ?
[03:55] <rukuartic> babo: I think, if you can't boot from USB on the computer, you're sunk. Getting the USB drive to be bootable is kinda trivial.
[03:55] <dredhammer> hello is there anyway to see the http requests that my webbrowser is making while surfing the web like in a log?
[03:55] <babo> rukuartic: does it have to be of a certain size ?
[03:55] <XiXaQ> rukuartic, it is?
[03:55] <LjL> dredhammer: read about tcpdump
[03:56] <babo> dredhammer: http live headers ... firefox extension
[03:56] <Jordan_U> babo: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[03:56] <rukuartic> XiXaQ: That is if you can't boot from USB on the computer.
[03:56] <r00t_> a
[03:56] <PipeHtr> so,,,would 20gb be enough for a ubunto install? or too much?
[03:56] <r00t_> Jordan_U, Thank you soooooooooooooooooooo much . its works  :D
[03:56] <rukuartic> babo: I really have no idea, but its like trying to put a round peg in a square hole if you can't boot from USB to begin with.
[03:56] <r00t_> i love you man . you save my day :D
[03:57] <Jordan_U> r00t_: you REALLY should not run as root.
[03:57] <dredhammer> thanks for the info
[03:57] <cafuego_> PipeHtr: that's MORE than enough.
[03:57] <Tux> does anyone here know how to get gimpshop?
[03:57] <LjL> Jordan_U: assuming he's root...
[03:57] <cafuego_> PipeHtr: The basic software is about 2GB
[03:57] <r00t_> Jordan_U,  i never do . i only login as root on terminal
[03:58] <rbil> Tux, don't you have to purchase it?
[03:58] <Tux> rbil i think it's just a mod for GIMP...
[03:58] <LjL> it is indeed, but it's not packaged in ubuntu
[03:58] <Jordan_U> r00t_: Sorry, I assumed that you had run xchat from root so your default nick was root.
[03:58] <r00t_> Jordan_U, when i have to install something :D .
[03:58] <rbil> Tux, yeh, but I thought it was a commercial product?
[03:58] <r00t_> ?
[03:58] <r00t_> no its was r00t
[03:58] <r00t_> :)
[03:58] <rbil> Tux, like a demo, until you paid money.
[03:59] <Tux> rbil i dunno, my friend got it for free leagally i think. anyone else know how to get gimpshop if you can?
[03:59] <PipeHtr> cafuego: Thanks, so perhaps 10-15 would be more appropriate? I am trying to be efficent with this drive..
[03:59] <r00t_> *** No identd (auth) response
[03:59] <r00t_> * r00t already in use. Retrying with r00t_...
[03:59] <Jordan_U> r00t_: Oh, then I am mistaking you for somebody else, what did I help you with again :)
[03:59] <glassman> does anyone know when rmjb is around?  if he's around regularly?
[03:59] <r00t_> r00t@r00t-server:~$ whoami
[03:59] <LjL> rbil: it's free software
[03:59] <r00t_> r00t
[03:59] <Jordan_U> !seen rmjb
[03:59] <ubotu> rmjb is on IRC right now!
[03:59] <corevette> how come in the file browser in the root, all i see are the folders 'home' and 'media'?
[04:00] <r00t_> Jordan_U,  my apache webserver is not working . can you help me with that?
[04:00] <LjL> Jordan_U, it's st3v3n_r0y
[04:00] <r00t_> 80 port isnt listeing
[04:00] <r00t_> LjL,  yes
[04:00] <glassman> seen doesn't help when he's idle
[04:00] <PipeHtr> !lastspoke rmjb
[04:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lastspoke rmjb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:00] <Jordan_U> LjL: That is what I thought, I am just confused about the nicks, ignore my babble :)
[04:00] <LineOf7s> If I have an Ubuntu installation up and running the way I want it, and need to deploy it to another seven machines, it's it possible to just copy over the files (all but /home ?) on top of a standard install?
[04:01] <LineOf7s> it's = is
[04:01] <LjL> r00t_: your realname field does say "root", though
[04:01] <jrib> !hidden | corevette, maybe:
[04:01] <ubotu> corevette, maybe:: Kubuntu Edgy has implemented a new feature that hides most of the filesystem. For more information: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuHiddenFiles
[04:01] <r00t_> LjL,  ya i wrote it :D
[04:01] <silya> http::Proxy "proxy.name.com:3128" - this string I need add to apt.conf if I want use proxy?
[04:01] <Crescendo> Is ubuntuforums.org being slow, or what?
[04:02] <lumpki> LineOf7s, you can just copy over the files, no need to have anything installed
[04:02] <r00t_> Crescendo,  ya its being slow :(
=== Jiraiya is now known as sieste
[04:02] <Crescendo> r00t_, alright, thanks.  Just making sure it wasn't me.
[04:02] <r00t_> hmm wc
=== sieste is now known as Jiraiya
[04:02] <Jordan_U> Crescendo Fine here?
=== Jiraiya is now known as Jiraiya|sieste
[04:03] <Jordan_U> Crescendo: Ubuntu forums is nice and snappy for me.
[04:03] <LineOf7s> Even better lumpki (and I suspected as much) - but starting from scratch it'll be easier to do the initial installation in order to partition the drive etc etc.  Thankyou for the confirmation though.
[04:03] <Megaqwerty> how do I find out what files on my computer are taking up the most space?
[04:03] <Crescendo> Maybe a bad mirror?  If they use mirrors.
[04:03] <VigoSandy> I read the logs, and it is what I suspected, now to fix this before I go back online with Edgy, Plaese explain how I can Shadow Files?
[04:04] <DevC> so there are no X11 source packages to install?
[04:04] <r00t_> r00t@r00t-server:~$ apache2

[04:04] <mirek> hello everybody
[04:04] <r00t_> anyone got idea?
[04:04] <Megaqwerty> anyone? ^^
[04:05] <LjL> r00t_: to bind to ports lower than 1024, programs need to be run as root
[04:05] <Jordan_U> Megaqwerty: !hi|mirek
[04:05] <Jordan_U> !hi|mirek
[04:05] <ubotu> mirek: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:05] <r00t_> LjL,  oh ok lamme try
[04:05] <Jordan_U> Megaqwerty: Sorry, ignore that.
[04:05] <LjL> r00t_: the correct way to start apache is "sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 start"
[04:05] <AlmtyBob> do I need to do anything special when formating a new drive as XFS?
[04:06] <AlmtyBob> or just mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1?
[04:06] <Megaqwerty> Jordan_U: sok
[04:06] <Megaqwerty> can anyone help me clean up disk space? I just need to know how I can find the files that are taking up a lot of space on my HD.
[04:06] <r00t_> tnx LjL
[04:06] <pingu_> AlmtyBob: that should work.
[04:06] <pingu_> The kernel has XFS built in.
[04:06] <r00t_> LjL,  may i have type that everytime when i login ?
[04:07] <sysrage> finally. got X to start using vesa driver. anybody know why on earth savage driver no longer works after the damn system tried to suspend?
[04:07] <r00t_> !php5
[04:07] <ubotu> php5: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (meta-package). In component main, is optional. Version 5.1.6-1ubuntu2.1 (edgy), package size 1 kB, installed size 20 kB
[04:07] <Megaqwerty> please someone help me, I really need it.^^
[04:07] <VigoSandy> r00t: I am most certain you can make it a start up ;bash, but
[04:08] <r00t_> VigoSandy,  thank you
[04:08] <__mikem> does PHP stand for Preprocessed Hypertext Page?
[04:08] <r00t_> ya
[04:08] <pingu_> __mikem: nobody knows what PHP stands for! Though originally it seemed to be Personal Home Page.
[04:09] <Jordan_U> Megaqwerty: filelight
[04:09] <r00t_> its seem php5 wont work on my pc :(
[04:09] <britt> does anybody know of a way I could host a BBS using telnet ports?
[04:09] <lumpki> PHP= Php Hpertext Preprocessor
[04:09] <LjL> r00t_: you shouldn't have to, apache should start automatically. how did you install it? through APT i suppose?
[04:09] <wastrel> Megaqwerty:  have you cleared out your apt cache?
[04:09] <britt> instead of having a login prompt, have the users connect to some program
[04:10] <lumpki> Megaqwerty, filelight is good, i think it's a kde program though
[04:10] <WillySilly> Anyone use DrQueue with Final Cut Pro/Compressor?
[04:10] <lostsync> this may seem dumb but if i see a big, red NOTE TO DEBIAN USERS on a page telling me how to do something i don't really understand and that doesn't mention ubuntu anywhere, should i take note of the info under the big red note?
[04:10] <r00t_> LjL,  that was fine before. after reinstall its wont works. and i reinstalled apache for php only . php wont works
[04:10] <lumpki> Megaqwerty, or you can use "du" on the command line
[04:10] <wastrel> Megaqwerty:  sudo apt-get clean   will free up some space from your apt cache
[04:10] <Megaqwerty> yeah, I've done that.
[04:11] <Megaqwerty> (apt-get clean)
[04:11] <wastrel> lostsync:  it would be on a case-by-case basis :] 
[04:11] <Megaqwerty> but thanks.
[04:11] <Jordan_U> Megaqwerty: filelight still will work in gnome though.
[04:11] <lostsync> wastrel, guess i'll see what works :)
[04:11] <Megaqwerty> right.
[04:11] <Megaqwerty> thanks Jordan_U
[04:11] <r00t_> LjL,  can you help me with php5 configure ?
[04:11] <LjL> r00t_, do you have php symlinks in /etc/apache/mods-enabled ?
[04:12] <r00t_> lamme see
[04:12] <VigoSandy> loysync: that would depend on who authored the page.
[04:13] <r00t_> LjL,  its bash: /etc/apache2/mods-enabled: is a directory
[04:13] <LjL> r00t_: indeed. look *inside* that directory. ls /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
[04:13] <r00t_> cgi.load  userdir.conf  userdir.load
[04:13] <r00t_> LjL,  here is it cgi.load  userdir.conf  userdir.load
[04:13] <r00t_> 3 files
[04:14] <scorp007> hi, is it possible to use apt-get to get a specific version of a package? I.e. i need to downgrade
[04:14] <LjL> r00t_: so you don't have php enabled. do you have libapache2-mod-php5 installed? ("apt-cache policy libapache2-mod-php5")
[04:14] <LjL> r00t_: and is that edgy or dapper?
[04:14] <r00t_> yes
[04:15] <r00t_> edgy
[04:15] <Cuddles_Laptop> evening all.
[04:15] <PipeHtr> anyone know if 10gb would be enough to install dapper?
[04:15] <Cuddles_Laptop> still having networking trouble...
[04:15] <LjL> r00t_: "yes" was about having it installed?
[04:15] <VigoSandy> download is done, lemee get back to repairing.......

[04:19] <r00t_> yes
[04:19] <r00t_> i type it 2 time
[04:20] <r00t_> that why
[04:20] <scorp007> jrib: damn, it doesnt have an old enough version... does that mean i have to manually get it elsewhere?
[04:20] <LjL> r00t_: no, the two commands are different
[04:20] <r00t_> oh
[04:20] <Jordan_U> Shaezsche: Any more than using reiserFS in general no :)
[04:20] <LjL> r00t_: one concerns php5.conf, the other php5.load
[04:20] <noclue> could anyone give me a clue as to how this dual drive setup works on ubuntu?
[04:20] <jrib> scorp007: what package? what version?
[04:20] <r00t_> oh
[04:20] <jrib> LjL: a2enmod didn't work?
[04:20] <scorp007> jrib: scons 0.96.1
[04:20] <Shaezsche> jordan_U i heard it is unstable, why does ubuntu choose ext3 as default?
[04:20] <r00t_> ufffffffffffffff............... i restart the apache but didnt works
[04:21] <zim> ok is there a program that tells me in real time what programs are talking on the network ie: ftp 100 mbit/s
[04:21] <jrib> scorp007: yeah i guess you'll need to get it manually
[04:21] <LjL> jrib: i simply didn't know about its existence. i didn't appear to need to enable it (either manually or with a2enmod) in my own Edgy installation
[04:21] <scorp007> jrib: it seems the official site has the deb package
[04:21] <H3g3m0n> Shaezsche: Theres reiserfs and resier4fs, 4 is the less stable one
[04:21] <wastrel> zim netstat
[04:21] <funkja> I accidently sent the delete key to a shortcut in the "Keyboard Shortcuts" window so I cleared it out and now my delete key doesn't work. Ideas?
[04:21] <Shaezsche> i heard its still prone to data corruption if you dont shut down yoru computer right
[04:21] <Shaezsche> ext takes over 3 gigs to partition a 80gig HD
[04:21] <Shaezsche> thats insane
[04:22] <Cuddles_Laptop> anyone?
[04:22] <Jordan_U> Shaezsche: ext3 is the defacto linux standard, it is verry good at not corrupting files even with a power outage or other incorrect shutdown.
[04:22] <campbch> is it possible to reset sound software? quickly? once in a while i'll lose sound and i'm sure a software reset would do the trick, but it's not worth shutting down and rebooting
[04:22] <campbch> volume's up, mute's off
[04:22] <campbch> yet my speakers protest
[04:22] <noclue> shaezsche you know how to use a second drive ???
[04:22] <Shaezsche> jordan_U better than reiser?
[04:22] <crimsun> campbch: pastebin your ``amixer''
[04:22] <Shaezsche> so with reiser i DO risk data loss
[04:23] <xplic1t> I have an english install of dapper server and I need japanese language support.. fonts, the works.  does anyone know?
[04:23] <thailq>  QUESTION: How can I select different JRE other than gij?
[04:23] <campbch> i don't follow :o
[04:23] <H3g3m0n> Shaezsche: I had reiser4 corrupt 2 different systems, but quite a few people use it, im not sure about reiser3 although Slackware used it by default for a while so its probally not too bad
[04:23] <Jordan_U> Shaezsche: reiser has a bad reputation for being easily corrupted.

[04:25] <scorp007> jrib: i got the .deb file and tried to sudo dpkg -i file.deb, but it gave me the error
[04:26] <jumble> hello again.
[04:26] <scorp007>  scons depends on python2.2; however:
[04:26] <scorp007>   Package python2.2 is not installed.
[04:26] <bruenig> sko0zy, yeah if you know how to do it from synaptic, if you don't I can give you a command to copy and paste that will do it
[04:26] <jrib> scorp007: I mean the old version of scons
[04:26] <campbch> no, i realized that as i was typing and put `` in the konsole
[04:26] <H3g3m0n> sko0zy: You could try copying the raw iPod data from the iPod and using eazytag to rename the files to legit names (i pod scrambles the names)
[04:26] <morphir> where do I find the virtual host config?
[04:26] <scorp007> jrib: oh, well apparently this application fails to run on a newer scons...
[04:26] <sko0zy> bruenig, ya if u can give me the command please
[04:26] <scorp007> its probably the dev's fault...
[04:26] <cyris|> anyone around that runs samba as a domain controller for windows xp clients?
[04:26] <H3g3m0n> sko0zy: But gtkpod is probably easiest
[04:26] <sko0zy> H3g3m0n, thanks
[04:27] <jumble> so i have a simple help question. i find the nuts and bolts of ubuntu very confusing because i dont understand anything about how the OS works, ie the filesystem, the partioning, the shell, etc.etc. all this i understand in windows and it makes things a lot easier. the ubuntu docs don't seem to have this basic information about the OS - do you guys know some online tutorial that can lay this stuff out for me?
[04:27] <kayshun> Say, anyone know how to detatch a process from gnome-terminal to a pty so I can restart gdm without loosing my tar job?
[04:27] <bruenig> sko0zy, sudo sed 's/# deb/deb/g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gtkpod, copy all of that including the &&, it will add the universe repo, update the repos and then download and install gtkpod
[04:27] <strabes> kayshun: add an & after
[04:27] <strabes> kayshun: after the command i mean
[04:27] <cyris|> jumble, and what do you know about how the internals of windows works? closed source :P :D
[04:27] <cyris|> of how* heh
[04:27] <sysrage> can anybody tell me why there are a bunch of xorg.conf's with different timestamps in /etc/X11? what is saving backups and/or modifying xorg.conf?
[04:27] <sko0zy> bruenig, alright dont go anywere lemme do this an ill ask if i have ?
[04:28] <bruenig> sko0zy, I will be here
[04:28] <jumble> i need something in between. i dont understand the internals but i have a basic understanding of how the pieces fit together. with ubuntu im lost. i dont know how the partitions work, i dont know how the shell interacts with the grahics interface, i dont know where the drivers are and how the OS accesses them, or where the root folder is, or just any of the basic nuts and bolts
[04:28] <r00t_> jrib,  what i do now ? its not working
[04:28] <sko0zy> bruenig, just coppy that code all at ounce >?
[04:28] <thailq> oh, I got it
[04:28] <thailq> sudo update-alternatives --config java
[04:28] <bruenig> sko0zy, yep, should ask for the password then will do all that I said
[04:29] <whale> how is the security in the latest edgy eft compared to its previous version ?
[04:29] <campbch> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34901/
[04:29] <sko0zy> bruenig, k
[04:29] <campbch> you said pastebin, but pastebin asploded.
[04:29] <beltain> hmmm that sucks. xchat crashed. Ok so anyway. Can someone please help me get my webcam working. Please.
[04:29] <bruenig> !webcam | beltain
[04:29] <ubotu> beltain: webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[04:29] <kayshun> strabies:  yeah, but the process is already running, and it even if I had, the tar process would still be a child of gnome-terminal, and die when I restart X
[04:29] <jumble> there must be some kind of basic, comprehensive documentation...?
[04:29] <beltain> THANK YOU.
[04:29] <sko0zy> bruenig, i ge the message couldnt find package gtkpod
[04:30] <jrib> r00t_: did you install from ubuntu repositories? (apache and php5)

[04:30] <xplic1t> someone please help.  I have an english install of dapper server and I need japanese language support.. fonts, the works.
[04:30] <campbch> jumble: try tldp.org?

[04:30] <r00t_> jrib,  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=308232
[04:30] <sysrage> bimberi: i've never ran that. does something else run that automagically?
[04:31] <jumble> campbch, this looks like a good start. thanks.
[04:31] <campbch> okies
[04:31] <bimberi> sysrage: i don't know
[04:31] <jrib> r00t_: did you do what azz suggested?
[04:31] <enotee> how do i get my windows mobile pda phone to work with ubuntu
[04:32] <campbch> so what happened with the audiomixer?
[04:32] <r00t_> jrib,  i didnt saw it yet
[04:32] <kayshun> jumble:  Check out the Linux Documentation Project Guides at http://tldp.org/guides.html
[04:32] <campbch> i just need a command that would retstart it, it's working fine and im sure all it needs is a restart
[04:32] <campbch> kayshun: beat ya there :D
=== xFordPrefect is now known as FordPrefect
[04:32] <jrib> r00t_: having both apache and apache2 is a common cause of what you are experiencing, see if that solves your problem
[04:33] <jumble> yup. but thanks to both of you. ive tried to work with linux in the past but i get nowhere 'cause i never understand how the pieces fit together.
[04:33] <crimsun> campbch: hang a sec.
[04:33] <glassman> how can i populate /dev/mapper with dmraid?  dmraid -tay shows my arrays but i can't get them to show up in /dev/mapper.  thanks!
[04:33] <runpain> where ar ethe splash screens at
[04:33] <jumble> i think ive wasted a lot of time trying to NOT understand the OS.
[04:33] <campbch> alright
[04:33] <crimsun> campbch: if you don't address a response to me, I'm liable to miss it completely
[04:33] <bruenig> sko0zy, did you pastebin it? Just open /etc/apt/sources.list and then copy and paste its contents
[04:33] <r00t_> jrib,  i removed that
[04:33] <campbch> alright
[04:33] <sko0zy> bruenig, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34902/
[04:33] <runpain> hello

[04:34] <jrib> r00t_: ps -ef | grep apache
[04:34] <campbch> jumble: concept that helped me immensely, is the fact that everything, EVERYTHING is modular and that it all sits balanced
[04:34] <runpain> where are the files for the splash screen so i can make my own
[04:34] <whale> is it now stable to read and write to NTFS with linux ?  for a storage device ?

[04:35] <noclue> #winehq
[04:35] <r00t_> jrib,  root      8655  8051  0 09:34 pts/0    00:00:00 grep apache
[04:35] <sko0zy> bruenig, u actualy put up with my noobnes with linux
[04:35] <TGPO> zim divide by 1024 not 1000
[04:36] <bruenig> sko0zy, have no idea why it didn't install from that first command. But whatever, got it done eventually
[04:36] <DiaboluZ> I'm still looking for a tool that can count all my data traffic - maybe make some statisctics out of it (how many GB etc) anyone who knows something smart(and light) :)
[04:36] <sko0zy> bruenig, ya man thanks alot
[04:36] <r00t_> Package apache is not installed, so not removed
[04:36] <r00t_> isnt installed
[04:36] <jrib> r00t_: k, what does 'sudo a2enmod php5' do?
[04:36] <Naik0> !icons
[04:36] <ubotu> Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[04:37] <r00t_> This module is already enabled!
[04:37] <zim> so its 7570460 meg 7.5 gig
[04:37] <r00t_> jrib, This module is already enabled!
[04:37] <jrib> r00t_: I don't know then :/
[04:37] <jumble> what is the difference between starting a terminal and using the "real console"?
[04:37] <black_13> what does the problem "could not open default font 'fixed' " mean?
[04:37] <r00t_> :( oh ok
[04:38] <morphir> could anyone tell me where the apache2 config file is located?
[04:38] <r00t_> tnx for your help :)
[04:38] <craigbass1976> I can't get a canon bjc 4000 printer working at all in ubuntu.  Now that I've installed, at least I can add the printer, but printing from an app does nothing, unless the printer is real quiet and using invisible paper and ink...
[04:38] <TGPO> another 1024 for meg to gig
[04:38] <zim> ok
[04:38] <campbch> crimsun: yeah, that works :p
[04:38] <Naik0> how can i make .mp3 files standard for bmp ?
[04:38] <cafuego_> morphir: /etc/apache2 and various subdirs depending on what you're configuring
[04:38] <crimsun> campbch: and there you are.
[04:38] <Naik0> or xmms
[04:38] <H3g3m0n> How are people supposed to empty the trash without the icon? I normally just 'rm -rf ~/.Trash/*'
[04:39] <campbch> hey, it worked
[04:39] <campbch> thanks
[04:39] <cafuego_> H3g3m0n: Don't, just add another disk to the lvm
[04:39] <britt> is tehre anyway i could run some program when someone does a telnet session to some port number other than the defautl one
[04:39] <TGPO> zim I think you need one more 1024
[04:39] <campbch> was that the actual command to reset how it worked? what exactly was wrong?
[04:39] <britt> like a program like for hosting a BBS or something
[04:39] <zim> ty
[04:39] <zim> so its about 7 gig +
[04:40] <TGPO> zim yup
[04:40] <zim> makes life easy
[04:40] <r00t_> jrib, i joined #apache . can they help me/
[04:41] <w3ccv> britt, yes, putting the executable file into the inetd in the proper place,      don't know the syntax right now, but it is fairly easy
[04:41] <DevC> I need the developers X11 package that has the include directory with the source code and libx11-dev didn't have the code in it are their any other developer/development packages for X11 that have the source for X11?
[04:41] <morphir> cafuego, APACHE_SERVERNAME for instance
[04:41] <kitche> DevC:xserver-xorg-dev
[04:42] <DevC> ok thanks :)
[04:42] <cafuego_> morphir: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
[04:42] <runpain> what i want to know is in what directory are the splash files that are shown in the configuration
[04:43] <bruenig> !splash
[04:43] <ubotu> To change the Gnome splash screen, open the gconf-editor and change the key /apps/gnome-session/options/splash-image.
[04:44] <britt> w3ccv: cool. can i have multiple ports open, one for a normal telnet and one for executing some program?
[04:44] <campbch> :o
=== noclue is now known as elephant
[04:45] <morphir> cafuego, see if you can find it there
[04:45] <campbch> crimsun: i just heard a system beep and sound died again
[04:45] <crimsun> campbch: so check your amixer output again
[04:45] <w3ccv> britt, sure, look in inetd see the syntax there., the program must do interactive i/o standard in/out. it can even ixist with two or more ports
[04:46] <campbch> that's why i asked what to look for :o
[04:46] <Lovloss> Every time I run Beryl the "x" in the upper right corner of my internet browser windows vanishes, which means i have to close the windows more manually. Is tehre any setting that fixes that? :/
[04:46] <holy_cow> Lovloss, yes don't use it
[04:46] <Lovloss> ...
[04:46] <holy_cow> beryl and xgl and aiglx are all pre alpha
[04:46] <Lovloss> i like it
[04:46] <holy_cow> they are only tests
[04:46] <Jordan_U> holy_cow: AIGLX isn't
[04:46] <holy_cow> and are only realyl intended for use by developers that can use that and fix it
[04:47] <Lovloss> it seems to work fairly well enough, other than that one issue
[04:47] <holy_cow> Jordan_U, for the average user it still is ... when nvidia releases support for it in their drivers maybe it will become something more accessible
[04:47] <Lovloss> so what, i should have got compiz? or does it matter
[04:47] <holy_cow> Lovloss, *nod* yep you are correct
[04:47] <kitche> holy_cow: umm nvidia has support for it lol
[04:47] <runpain> let try agian where are the image files for splash screens kept on the hard drive
[04:47] <Jordan_U> holy_cow: The average user uses intel integrated graphics
[04:47] <kitche> anyways compiz is more prealpha then beryl is
[04:47] <mheath[laptop] _> Jordan_U, AIGLX is just support for some unique GLX extensions.
[04:48] <Lovloss> Im using nvidia
[04:48] <Jordan_U> mheath[laptop] _: I know
[04:48] <holy_cow> Lovloss, however that doesn't change that its still not meant for general use, and there really isn't much anyone can do to fix such issues
[04:48] <mheath[laptop] _> Jordan_U, AIGLX is fully supported by Nvidia's binary drivers.
[04:48] <kitche> holy_cow: with nvidia you don't even need aiglx or xgl to use compiz or beryl
[04:48] <corevette> what file extension do you save a script as
[04:48] <holy_cow> you can use their bug tracker
[04:48] <runpain> i am using mepis
[04:48] <holy_cow> kitche, i'm aware of what aiglx is
[04:48] <holy_cow> infact
[04:48] <holy_cow> aiglx is the future and its what everyone should be using
[04:48] <morphir> err.. they changed the config setup in ubuntu, or is it because of apache2 ?
[04:48] <holy_cow> i didn't know nvidia already released drivers with support for it tho
[04:48] <holy_cow> thats cool
[04:48] <Lovloss> That makes me sad, though. because windows vista's going to be offering the effects
[04:49] <Lovloss> i dont like them being ahead :(
[04:49] <kitche> holy_cow: you do not need aiglx to run beryl or compiz with nvidia drivers
[04:49] <mheath[laptop] _> Jordan_U, oops, sorry. I meant to say all that to holy_cow, not you. You were on my side!
[04:49] <holy_cow> Lovloss, don't be sad
[04:49] <Jordan_U> kitche: You DO need AIGLX, it is just that you don't have to install it yourself as it is part of xorg now.
[04:49] <w3ccv> corevette, save a script with any name you want. "extensions" don't mean a thing to *nix.
[04:49] <holy_cow> Lovloss, it isn't a product, its a process
[04:49] <holy_cow> Lovloss, besides you shouldn't use glx/berryl
[04:49] <holy_cow> you should use aiglx anyway
[04:49] <r00t_> can anyone tell me where is httpd.conf located ?
[04:49] <Lovloss> well how can i safely unisntall it anyway
[04:49] <holy_cow> glx/beryll are probably dead ends not to be really supported by the majour video vendors
[04:49] <morphir> cafuego, tell, do you find APACHE_SERVERNAME under /etc/apache2/apache2.config ?
[04:49] <mwhite> hello everyone
[04:50] <kitche> Jordan_U: is that why I don't activate aiglx when running nvidia drivers it even says on the nvidia page that you don't need aiglx or XGL to use beryl or compiz with nvidia drivers
[04:50] <Lovloss> it really bound itself to my graphics setup
[04:50] <mheath[laptop] _> corevette, they are traditionally .sh files, but as w3ccv you don't really need one.
[04:50] <runpain> i am using mepis
[04:50] <runpain> let try agian where are the image files for splash screens kept on the hard drive
[04:50] <runpain> what i want to know is in what directory are the splash files that are shown in the configuration
[04:50] <w3ccv> r00t_,  locate httpd.conf will find it for you, or find / -name httpd.conf
[04:50] <holy_cow> Jordan_U, so what is the status of aiglx these days?
[04:50] <holy_cow> Jordan_U, useable?
[04:50] <darnell> whats the command for reconfiguring xserver?
[04:50] <AnthonyG> Is it possible to have wvdialconf scan a symlink instead of ttyS*?
[04:50] <Jordan_U> holy_cow: It is part of vanilla XORG
[04:51] <holy_cow> Jordan_U, really?
[04:51] <holy_cow> neato
[04:51] <Jordan_U> holy_cow: Yes.
[04:51] <holy_cow> is that in edgy?
[04:51] <kitche> holy_cow: you just have to activate it with a ServerFlag
[04:51] <holy_cow> kitche, no kidding? nice
[04:51] <AnthonyG> SmartLink symlinks my modem (ttyS0) as pts/1
[04:51] <Jordan_U> holy_cow: Edgy and any other distro with xorg 7
[04:51] <mwhite> I have a Shared Folder setup and I can see my ubuntu server in my Windows network but I can not get authorized to the share. Where do I setup up users for this?
[04:51] <mschoolbus> i failed horribly at a compiz install on edgy last night :(
[04:51] <sysrage> holy_cow: you aren't the holycow i know, are you?
[04:51] <holy_cow> hey thats pretty cool
[04:51] <darnell> whats the command for reconfiguring xserver?
[04:51] <holy_cow> sysrage, of course i am
[04:51] <holy_cow> there is only one cow :)
[04:51] <holy_cow> welcome
[04:52] <holy_cow> the other nick is another system
[04:52] <sysrage> from efnet?
[04:52] <Cuddles_Laptop> folks, i've been having this problem since i first installed ubuntu a week ago. running edgy on a dell latitude, wlan0 won't connect automatically on boot [wlan0 is a pcmcia card using the r818x driver] . i have to run the kwireless assistant, and then ''sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart'' to get it to work. any suggestions on getting this to work on boot, like it should?
[04:52] <holy_cow> sysrage, #undersomething yes
[04:52] <holy_cow> :)
[04:52] <Jordan_U> darnell: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[04:52] <sysrage> wow.. hey bud
[04:52] <runpain> what i want to know is in what directory are the splash files that are shown in the configuration
[04:52] <holy_cow> so Lovloss we are actually ahead
[04:52] <r00t_> is debain and ubuntu are same ?
[04:52] <beltain> cuddles_laptop you could add it to a startup script
[04:52] <Lovloss> If i uninstall beryl, will i have to reinstall any graphics software? i imagine it wrote over my nvidia drivers
[04:52] <holy_cow> Lovloss, aiglx is far far far more capable than the stuff in vista btw
[04:52] <holy_cow> :)
[04:52] <whale> is WPA hard to do with edgy eft ?
[04:52] <Lovloss> Okay now i want it
[04:52] <holy_cow> synic, hey bro :) watcha doin here?
[04:52] <gottatrieit> Hi everyone and good evening. Can some one help me to navigate through my terminal for a few minutes?
[04:52] <darnell> k
[04:52] <holy_cow> i take it your mucking about?
[04:52] <darnell> i need plow though
[04:52] <darnell> thanx
[04:53] <holy_cow> i thought you were into gentoo and stuff?
[04:53] <mheath[laptop] _> r00t_, They are both based on the same software packaging format, and they share a lot of the same programs. But they are different distributions of different software.
[04:53] <sysrage> i was.. just givin ubuntu a try
[04:53] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, what do you need help with?
[04:53] <sysrage> i don't have time for source based distros anymore
[04:53] <holy_cow> Lovloss, may i humbly recommend a clean install? uninstalling beryll and glx is kinda hard from what i've seen of the install
[04:53] <Lovloss> Oy, there's soooo much stuff to back up though
[04:54] <mheath[laptop] _> holy_cow, no it isn't, you just do it backwards.
[04:54] <Lovloss> thank you mheath. it sounds easier
[04:54] <r00t_> oh aheath
[04:54] <r00t_> tnx
[04:54] <gottatrieit> I was in psyschocat.net/ubuntu and checking the terminal tutorial out. I ran "top" to see what my computer was doing and so forth.
[04:54] <bobbie__4> format your hard drive first then back it up
[04:54] <Lovloss> lol
[04:54] <mschoolbus> gottatrieit: hit ctrl-c if you are stuck in top :)
[04:54] <r00t_> what does apache config file use on ubuntu?
[04:54] <Cuddles_Laptop> beltain, add what exactly?
[04:54] <bimberi> runpain: _what_ configuration?
[04:54] <holy_cow> sysrage, yeah me neither.  ubuntu is a very good balance
[04:55] <holy_cow> sysdoc, you have acces to source if you need it here too btw, you just download the src packages and compile all you want
[04:55] <Lovloss> so aiglx is like beryl, it flips your screen and does that zoom thing?
[04:55] <kitche> Lovloss: aiglx is like XGL
[04:55] <mheath[laptop] _> holy_cow, please be careful before you give people advice! You're likely to turn people away from simple steps and good software. You've already said AIGLX is a buggy horriblly unstable program, when it is very stable, mature, and released, and your telling people simple steps are difficult in favor of complete reinstalls.
[04:55] <mwhite> can anyone help me with Samba?
[04:55] <Lovloss> ...
[04:55] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, and...?
[04:55] <gottatrieit> meheath & mschoolbus: Not stuck in top, but my processes showed one zombie. Should I worry about it and if so, how do I locate it?
[04:55] <holy_cow> mheath[laptop] _, please stoop talking to me and actually get a clue ... say like learning to read what i said
[04:55] <kitche> Lovloss: beryl is like compiz
[04:56] <holy_cow> mheath[laptop] _, i recommend scrolling up
[04:56] <Lovloss> so you mean if i want to zoom  out/in on stuff and make my screen a cube, i *do* need beryl? or compiz
[04:56] <ademan> Lovloss: don't use Xgl, if you have a NVIDIA card use Xorg 7.1 and if you have an ATI card just wait for proper drivers
[04:56] <runpain> system configuration
[04:56] <Lovloss> im currently using xorg
[04:56] <Lovloss> i didnt install glx.
[04:56] <gottatrieit> Sorry folks, I'm a slow typer and can't read and write at the same time. lol
[04:56] <kitche> Lovloss: either one but I would recommand beryl since compiz dis missign a lot of plugins
[04:56] <mheath[laptop] _> holy_cow, if you don't like what I say, feel free to put me on ignore. I was simply recommending that you make sure you're knowledgable about a subject before you give advice.
[04:56] <Lovloss> I just got beryl since it makes my desktop a cube :D~~
[04:57] <holy_cow> mheath[laptop] _, lol screw off
[04:57] <runpain> you know when you set up themes and backgrounds
[04:57] <r00t_> what does apache config file use on ubuntu? ??? anyone?
[04:57] <AnthonyG> Bah....
[04:57] <holy_cow> you don't have a clue clearly
[04:57] <bimberi> runpain: that's just as vague.  Anyway, there is the /usr/lib/usplash directory.  Maybe that's what you want.
[04:57] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, I wouldn't worry about it, unless its consuming a lot of resources
[04:57] <Cuddles_Laptop> running edgy on a dell latitude, wlan0 won't connect automatically on boot [wlan0 is a pcmcia card using the r818x driver] . i have to run the kwireless assistant, and then ''sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart'' to get it to work. any suggestions on getting this to work on boot, like it should?
[04:58] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, however, each line of top represents a program. One of the numbers on that line is a PID, for process ID.
[04:58] <bimberi> runpain: ah, you mean system -> preferences -> theme?
[04:58] <rugbythomas> does anyone know how to reset the repositories in synaptic
[04:58] <runpain> ok thanks agian
[04:58] <craigbass1976> I can't get a canon bjc 4000 printer working at all in ubuntu.  Now that I've installed, at least I can add the printer, but printing from an app does nothing, unless the printer is real quiet and using invisible paper and ink...
[04:58] <Lovloss> I hate that beryl isnt considered good. I love moving my mouse to the corner of the screen and zooming out... but i want to be able to click a 'close' button on the corner of each window instead of using some keyboard shortcut
[04:58] <gottatrieit> mheath: Thanks, it's not by what I can tell.
[04:58] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, after you have the PID of the process you want to get rid of, try running the command "kill <PID>" (replacing <PID> with the PID, obviously)
[04:58] <kitche> Lovloss: beryl is actually good but it's meant to work with kde xfce or gnome really
[04:58] <holy_cow> craigbass1976, is it listed as supported on linuxprinting.org?
[04:58] <craigbass1976> And, the dapper version of ubuntu seems way slower than the edgy that I installed last night on the same box.
[04:59] <craigbass1976> holy_cow, it is
[04:59] <Lovloss> well i *am* in gnome here
[04:59] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, running just "kill <PID>" tries to do a 'friendly' end of the program. That is, it simply ASKS the program to close.
[04:59] <mheath[laptop] _> gottatrieit, if the program is truly a zomby process, it won't respond to that. Then you can use "kill -9 <PID>", which forces the program to close.
[04:59] <holy_cow> craigbass1976, not sure then :/  generally canon is poorly supported on linux.  they work hard not to work with our community
[04:59] <runpain> cant find usplash there
[04:59] <gottatrieit> Ok. I will do that. Thanks again. Catch you all later. I'm having fun slowly learning to use Linux and hope to continue to use it forever.
[04:59] <mikeo> hey how do i disable the mail server?
[05:00] <mikeo> i got an email that was spoofed from my domain name
[05:00] <r00t_> mheath. is apache use httpd.conf or something else?
[05:00] <kitche> Lovloss: how are you trying to start beryl are you logging into gnome then running beryl-manager? or are you doing it another way just wondering sicne I usualyl log in to X then run beryl-manager & in a console
[05:00] <mikeo> and i think it was somehow done through my unsecure ubuntu-server
[05:00] <bimberi> runpain: hm, mepis is probably different
[05:00] <bimberi> mikeo: which one did you install?
[05:00] <Lovloss> kitche: i just type 'beryl' into a terminal and it starts up....
[05:00] <mikeo> ubuntu-server
[05:00] <mikeo> but it has kdebase and gnome installed on it
[05:00] <runpain> ya it is
[05:01] <Pie-rate> WOOOOOOOT! I am currently typing this from a working laptop ubuntu install!
[05:01] <mikeo> and was upgraded to edgy
[05:01] <Pie-rate> yay
[05:01] <Pie-rate> took long enough though
[05:01] <runpain> :(
[05:01] <_MMA_> Is there ANYONE here who knows how to remove a configured network printer from gnome-cups-manager? :) I have one that just WONT go away.
[05:01] <bimberi> Pie-rate: cool
[05:01] <kitche> lovloss: try beryl-manager it might work better :)_
[05:01] <Pie-rate> probably spent 6 hours messing with it
[05:01] <Lovloss> Pie-rate :   :D
[05:01] <bimberi> mikeo: no, which mail server?
[05:01] <mikeo> i dunno
[05:01] <mikeo> i never installed any
[05:01] <mikeo> whatever is installed by default
[05:02] <mheath[laptop] _> craigbass1976, that particular printer works perfectly in Linux
[05:02] <mheath[laptop] _> craigbass1976, however, it may require some additional setup steps.
[05:02] <mheath[laptop] _> craigbass1976, You can't just go through the Ubuntu Add Printer wizard, for some printers.
[05:02] <AnthonyG> I'm getting "No Carrier Errors" even though "Carrier Check=no" , I'm completely out of ideas , The Cn AT commands don't work at all whatsoever :(
[05:02] <Lovloss> kitche: well ill be a monkey's uncle
[05:02] <Lovloss> it *worked*
[05:02] <mheath[laptop] _> craigbass1976, Try taking a look at the notes at http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Canon-BJC-4000
[05:02] <Pie-rate> It can't detect the wifi card though, lspci says its an atheros and the ubuntu wiki says atheros cards should just work out of the box
[05:02] <w3ccv> mikeo, are they relaying through you or just spoofing your address
[05:03] <kitche> Lovloss: beryl-manager starts up the whole beryl system which makes it more complete
[05:03] <Lovloss> OHHH i see
[05:03] <mikeo> i dunno
[05:03] <Lovloss> i wish tehre was some icon for it
[05:03] <mikeo> it was an email from webmaster@mydomainname.com
[05:03] <Lovloss> i dont mind using command lines, its just nice to have it be user friendly
[05:03] <mikeo> how do i tell if its spoofed or not?
[05:03] <mheath[laptop] _> Pie-rate, try taking a look at specific model numbers included in the lspci information. Do a google search for them, see what you can find.
[05:03] <kitche> Lovloss: you can make one
[05:03] <mikeo> oh shit nevermind
[05:03] <Lovloss> Oh! thats right i can :D
[05:04] <w3ccv> mikeo, not much you can do if they are only spoofing - I get lots of that from one site I manage.,
[05:04] <Lovloss> Ill go do that :3
[05:04] <mikeo> lol i was in the to address
[05:04] <Lovloss> cya guys
[05:04] <mikeo> and it was spam
[05:04] <mheath[laptop] _> Pie-rate, Sometimes, although 90% of a given brand/model work out of the box, there will be one weird model/revision that requires that extra set or even isn't (unfortunately) supported.
[05:04] <mikeo> i am the webmaster and must have had autoforwarding configured to my other email
[05:04] <alex-weej> fuck fuck FUCK
[05:05] <mheath[laptop] _> I would like to remind everyone that people of all ages come into this room.
[05:05] <AnthonyG> Watch the language
[05:05] <craigbass1976> mheath[laptop] _, I've picked the bjc600 driver instead of the gutenprint one.  Couldn't understand what else I need to do I guess.
=== bimberi_ is now known as bimberi
[05:05] <alex-weej> disk failure with an ext3 filesystem - any idea of the SAFEST way to recover data?
[05:05] <mschoolbus> never seen a linux room where people dont like swearing :)
[05:05] <photar> Yeah, I've got my baby in my lap right now!
[05:05] <AnthonyG> photar: Tsk Tsk , Monitors are not too good for the eyes you know >:(
[05:05] <Pie-rate> mheath[laptop] _: it detected it properly during install, but it isnt showing up on network-admin gui or iwconfig
[05:06] <photar> AnthonyG, Laptop :)
[05:06] <mheath[laptop] _> photar, I frequented IRC channels just like this when I was around 12 years old.
[05:06] <vader> well, night folks long night for me is about to end
[05:06] <H3g3m0n> alex-weej: Make a raw image of the drive with dd, try fsck, if its rally gone look up autopsy/sleuthkit for data forensics/recovery
[05:06] <Pie-rate> like it listed it with the wired connection during install
[05:06] <AnthonyG> photar: Even worse >:(
[05:06] <photar> mheath[laptop] _, I've been on irc since I was about the same age.
[05:06] <mheath[laptop] _> Pie-rate, supposed 'auto-detection' during install doesn't mean anything.
[05:06] <photar> I'm a total leach though.
[05:07] <photar> I only come to irc when I need help with stuff.
[05:07] <mheath[laptop] _> Pie-rate, Ubuntu auto-detects my laptops wireless during the install, but it requires a lot of additional steps to actually get it working.
[05:07] <feross> !vi
[05:07] <ubotu> Text Editors: gedit (GNOME), Kate (KDE), vi/vim (terminal-based), terminal based: vi/vim, emacs, nano (user-friendly). HTML/CSS editors: !html; Programming: !code
[05:07] <photar> mheath[laptop] _, what kinda laptop?
[05:07] <Pie-rate> Ok, well it *needs* to work somehow, so what are those steps?
[05:07] <mheath[laptop] _> photar, I have a Compaq Presario V5101US.
[05:07] <bimberi> mikeo: still about (I dropped out)
[05:07] <photar> I've got an old 500Mhz iBook, and everything works on it.
[05:07] <bimberi> ?
[05:08] <mheath[laptop] _> photar, Everything works perfectly in Linux (though the wireless does require a bit of extra work)
[05:08] <photar> power management, sleep brightness controlls.
[05:08] <feross> ello.. anyone know how to fix vi so that arrows work in "insert" mode?
[05:08] <photar> Wireless just works too.
[05:08] <cafuego_> photar: Yeah, original airport with orinoco chip
[05:08] <cafuego_> photar: the new stuff all use sbroadcom (which works, but needs firmware files)
[05:09] <photar> My question is about quicktime.
[05:09] <cafuego_> on PPC?
[05:09] <photar> yeah
[05:09] <cafuego_> Pretty much not going to work.
[05:09] <photar> that and divx.
[05:09] <mheath[laptop] _> cafuego_, and is buggy, even with firmware.
[05:09] <cafuego_> mheath[laptop] _: Mine work just dandy
[05:09] <XiXaQ> Where can I get the Ubuntu Experience video with Nelson Mandela in better resolution?
[05:09] <mheath[laptop] _> Just weird, unexplained connection cutouts, unexplained lag, etc.
[05:09] <cafuego_> mheath[laptop] _: Mind you, both 4306, not 4318
[05:10] <mheath[laptop] _> Whereas mine is a 4318 :)
[05:10] <photar> So, I'm pretty much SoL for quicktime and divx?
[05:10] <cafuego_> yup
[05:10] <cafuego_> on x86 those are handled via the windows dlls
[05:10] <mheath[laptop] _> photar, I believe there MAY be some open source projects for quicktime and divx decoding, but you're likely to have mixed results, they may be illegal, and I'm not sure they even exist. Have a look around before you throw in the towel, though :)
[05:10] <cafuego_> and they just can't run on ppc
[05:10] <Freshwaterlarry> Some kind soul.  trying to print from ubuntu 6.06 to windows 2000 printer.   Stuck
[05:11] <DavidW2> Hi. I'm trying to add a module to be initramfs. I tried listing it in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/modules but it doesn't get included
[05:12] <mheath[laptop] _> Freshwaterlarry, take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPPrinter
[05:12] <mheath[laptop] _> Freshwaterlarry, it provides some valuable advice.
[05:13] <holy_cow> sysrage, good to see ya again.  is anyone still on #underhill? i haven't been there for a long time
[05:13] <photar> A friend of mine just told me that on his PB he can play quicktime and divx just fine using mplayer in Gentoo.
[05:13] <runpain> right now i am using redmond splash screen how can i replace the redmond picture with my own picture
[05:13] <sysrage> holy_cow: don't think so
[05:13] <jumble> man, this http://tldp.org/ website is great.
[05:13] <holy_cow> sysrage, *nod* allright, i'm gone, see ya next time
[05:14] <cmweb> Can some one help me install ppp on 6.10? im on a rickity old irc client and its hard to load it right so can you give me a url or something?
[05:14] <mheath[laptop] _> jumble, yep, it's great documentation. Just remember to not blindly follow instructions there; Ubuntu often has simpler ways or its own way of handling the things mentioned in that documentation.
[05:14] <Arrick> IdleOne you are back?
[05:14] <Freshwaterlarry> mheath:  Thank you, I have read and tried with no result
[05:14] <Arrick> wow, been a long time coming
[05:14] <Arrick> where you een hiding?
[05:15] <runpain> right now i am using redmond splash screen how can i replace the redmond picture with my own picture
[05:15] <Pie-rate> mheath[laptop] _: what should i do about getting wifi to work?
[05:15] <mheath[laptop] _> Freshwaterlarry, The test fails to print? Is there any error?
[05:15] <jumble> thanks mheath. im reading it more to get a sense of what the hell is going on in the first place than for the commands.
[05:15] <mheath[laptop] _> Pie-rate, I can't tell you. Like I said, plug the actual specific model number that lspci gives you into google, and see if you can find anything on it.
[05:15] <runpain> where would the file be at on my harddrive
[05:16] <Pie-rate> alright
[05:16] <ninix> anyone have another solution for the LIVECD black screen :(
[05:16] <cmweb> ljl, can you help me out here? im booted into windows because i cant get my edgy to dialup right. Can you help please?
[05:17] <mheath[laptop] _> ninix, Are you trying to just use the LiveCD or install Ubuntu off of it?
[05:17] <LadyNikon> ninix: live cd black screen?
[05:17] <Arrick> IdleOne check pm please?
[05:17] <ninix> i really need to boot the livecd, cause i need dmraid.
[05:17] <Freshwaterlarry> mheath:  I think it fails to open on the window side.  I have been to the windows printer and opened it up for guest printing, and all printing, etc.  I have deleted and reloaded printer several times in ubuntu.  The ubuntu side goes from printing to paused.  No action takes place on printer
[05:17] <ninix> LadyNikon:  yes after all loading, a black screen with no more
[05:17] <LadyNikon> no errors .. nothing?
[05:18] <levander> Okay, dist-upgrading using update-manager failed, and I had to reboot the machine.  Now I get the gdm screen, but can't login.  Can I "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade" to complete the upgrade?  Or, is it just not the same when you are using update manager?
[05:18] <ninix> no errors, no action... no console.
[05:18] <mheath[laptop] _> ninix, If your end desire is to install Ubuntu, you can try using the Alternative Installation ID
[05:18] <mheath[laptop] _> erm
[05:18] <mheath[laptop] _> *Alternative Installation CD
[05:18] <mheath[laptop] _> It has a text mode installation
[05:18] <ninix> mheath[laptop] _: i  really need to boot the livecd, cause i need dmraid.
[05:19] <verbose> does anyone know if the qos built into linksys routers is any good?
[05:19] <mwhite> where can I find the Samba Server Configuration?
[05:19] <Arrick> !samba
[05:19] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[05:20] <Pie-rate> ok, looks like i need the "madwifi" driver, doesn't seem to be in the apt repos
[05:20] <Arrick> !wifi
[05:20] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:20] <cafuego_> Pie-rate: it's in `restricted'.
[05:20] <godlygeek> has anyone had problems with a laptop backlight coming back on after the lid is closed and the light had turned off?
[05:20] <cmweb> Any one on here using 6.10 with ppp? i need help bad im booted into windows because i can not dialup in 6.10
[05:21] <godlygeek> i've only seen it since upgrading to edgy, but i don't have a clue how to debug it further than i have.
[05:21] <Master_Frag> that is a hardware only problem
[05:21] <Master_Frag> i would suggest geting it checked by a laptop technion
[05:21] <cafuego_> Pie-rate: you want the "linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)" package.
[05:22] <godlygeek> no, it isn't.  :-p  it started the day i upgraded to edgy.
[05:22] <godlygeek> i'm absolutely certain that it's not a coincidence.
[05:22] <Master_Frag> what brand of laptop is it
[05:22] <godlygeek> dell inspiron 600m
[05:22] <cmweb> hello, is any one listing? i need desprite help
[05:23] <nickv111> cmweb: What's the proble?
[05:23] <cafuego_> cmweb: What modem do you have?
[05:23] <SilentDis> !ask | cmweb
[05:23] <ubotu> cmweb: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:23] <nickv111> cmweb: What's the problem?*
[05:23] <cmweb> I ALREADY DIDI
[05:23] <nickv111> cmweb: I just joined.
[05:23] <nickv111> cmweb: Now, don't get impacient. We don't have an obligation to help you.
[05:23] <Master_Frag> hmm   something kinda like this happend to me on my Latatude cpx
[05:23] <cmweb> I have a lucent?agree winmodem
[05:23] <SilentDis> cmweb:  i just got here.  people are getting here all the time.  we're happy to help, no need to get rude about it :)
[05:24] <cmweb> it worked fine during 6.06 but i just upgraded to 6.10
[05:24] <nickv111> cmweb: Ooh. Not good news.
[05:24] <Master_Frag> try updateing the display drivers
[05:24] <sl> hi
[05:24] <nickv111> How do I find out what kind of sound card I have?
[05:24] <godlygeek> hm.  it happens in the console, too, not just X-windows.
[05:24] <feross> hey, anyone know why some letters look crappy in when connecting with rdesktop to a Terminal Server?
[05:24] <sl> how can i make a system beep from the command line?
[05:24] <Pelo> cmweb,  a lot of things don'T work in edgy that worked well in dapper, didn't anyone ( ie : me ) tell you that before you upgraded ?
[05:24] <nickv111> My sound card is recognized as a Realtek, but it's actually an ATI SB someting.
[05:24] <sl> from ssh....
[05:24] <cafuego_> sl: write a ^G to /dev/console
[05:24] <godlygeek> am i wrong, or should the graphics drivers only affect stuff done in xorg?
[05:25] <Master_Frag> yes
[05:25] <godlygeek> yes i'm wrong or yes i'm right?  ;)
[05:25] <cmweb> for crying out loud i dont want past news i need answers fast this windows is buggy
[05:25] <beltain> Is there a way to do a text based install from the Ubuntu CD? I am having a problem with video on the target machine and I need to do a text based installed rather than a gui install for the target box. I don't care about the gui, I just need to install it for a server.
[05:25] <nickv111> cmweb: Stop. Nw.
[05:25] <Pie-rate> cafuego_: so, apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
[05:25] <Master_Frag> yes  your right
[05:25] <sl> cafuego_ ah, i want to scare the crap out of a friend who is sleeping, but i am ssh'd into his box.
[05:25] <nickv111> cmweb: Crap, I can't type. Stop. Now. Stop complaining. We will help you in due time if we can.
[05:26] <cafuego_> Pie-rate: Yup, after enabling the restricted repo.
[05:26] <nickv111> cmweb: Impacience doesn't help anything.
[05:26] <SilentDis> cmweb:  I think, at least for me, I'll find someone else to help.  have a great day!
[05:26] <cafuego_> cmweb: and the modem is detected properly under linxu and claimed by the right driver?
[05:26] <godlygeek> at least, i'm PRETTY sure it did it when i was only logged into the console...
[05:26] <beef> how do I join freenode?
[05:26] <feross> beltain: uhm, the server install CD doesn't use gui.. what did you download?
[05:26] <Pelo> cmweb,  /msg me your problem and if I can help I will,  be nice about it
[05:26] <kitche> beef: umm your on freenod
[05:26] <cafuego_> beef: /msg nickserv help register

[05:26] <SilentDis> beef:  you're on the freenode servers right now :)
[05:26] <beltain> feross: target system is a mac
[05:26] <nickv111> Pelo: please don't ask people to msg. Help should be public
[05:26] <Master_Frag> some graphics chipsets have problems with linux
[05:26] <beef> SilentDis
[05:26] <sgorilla80> what can i run to install the codecs, multimedia stuff?
[05:26] <Pie-rate> oh damn i can get it from the cd
[05:27] <beef> thankyou

[05:32] <solid_liq> anyone know where I can get an install guide for xgl or aiglx and beryl on dapper (ATI Radeon Express 200)
[05:32] <Jordan_U> SilentDis: THat is for fglrx, wrong guide
[05:32] <ArrenLex> Could someone suggest an easy way to replace string a with string b in a bunch of files at the same time?
[05:32] <ninix> can i upgrade from ubuntu dapper to ubuntu edgy AMD 64 ?
[05:32] <Master_Frag> well think of it this way    if your going somewere    shut the comp down first      it isent much of a problem

[05:33] <Jordan_U> cmweb: Why so blue?
[05:33] <solid_liq> SilentDis: on their site, there's only info for installing on edgy, not dapper, and it says aiglx is preinstalled on edgy
[05:33] <w3ccv> ArrenLex, SED will do it
[05:33] <sixaxis> I am trying to do something, insert a dvd burner into a computer, will ubuntu recognize it? I already have Ubuntu up and running
[05:33] <ArrenLex> w3ccv: I assume so, but am unsure of the syntax.
[05:33] <mabou> Where should I look if metacity doesn't start after uninstalling compiz?
[05:33] <Pelo> ArrenLex,   check the Add/remove menu   , under system tool category (or whatever it is in english) there is a rename app , part of the thunar file manager , it does exactly what you want
[05:33] <solid_liq> sixaxis: only one way to find out ;)
[05:33] <Jordan_U> sixaxis: It should
[05:33] <angela_816_80085> ubotu, you have helped me before, wanna talk dirty?
[05:33] <Master_Frag> as long as you shut the system down it should not effect the way it runs
[05:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about you have helped me before, wanna talk dirty? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:33] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  ahh, wait, you're right.  I'm running dapper, and have beryl setup myself.  let me locate the guide.  I remember it took a bit of tinkering to get going though.  lotta steps.
[05:33] <ArrenLex> Pelo: KDE.
[05:34] <solid_liq> SilentDis: ok cool, thanks!
[05:34] <bimberi> ninix: yes ...
[05:34] <ademan_> can evolution be used to work with mailing lists?
[05:34] <godlygeek> Master_Frag: a) I like ubuntu because it just works, and "just deal with it" is a shitty solution, and b) i keep it on always, and just shut the lid at night - it comes close to overheating if i don't catch that the backlight came back on quickly enough.

[05:35] <ArrenLex> w3ccv: yes, I know that; that only replaces in standard-in, though.
[05:35] <bimberi> ademan_: yes, but what do you mean?
[05:35] <Pie-rate> should i install fglrx-control? is it as buggy as the wiki makes it sound?

[05:35] <Pie-rate> is there a mod here?
[05:35] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  the guide I had came from the main homepage, http://www.beryl-project.org/.  According to their website, and I quote "Server hard drive disk failed on Sunday, and we're currently trying to rescue it even though it does not look good at all. Apologies."
[05:35] <ArrenLex> angela_816_80085: Kindly stop soliciting cybersex with computer programs here. Thank ou.

[05:35] <solid_liq> SilentDis: ............  always my luck :(((
[05:35] <bimberi> ninix: no you can't, reinstall is the only way afaik
[05:35] <keeganX> SilentDis: In 2.0 its in Add-Ons
[05:35] <ArrenLex> w3ccv: really? I'll try that.

[05:44] <cmweb> ok is their any others?

[05:45] <fbc> Is there anyway to make the network manager applet refresh the wireless AP's?? I lwft my house over an hour ago, and it stills shows my two aAPs.
[05:45] <Pelo> cmweb,  what did you just try and do ?
[05:46] <bimberi> cmweb: there's also wvdial, and the networking applet (System -> Administration -> Networking).  In fact the latter is supposed to be the preferred way but I have had mixed results with it.
[05:46] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  it can't hurt to drop it back in, if anything, it'll get overwritten anyway if they find a backup.  a good stop-gap if anything :)
[05:46] <bimberi> cmweb: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto has more details, in particular about how to get various types of modems working.

[05:47] <Pie-rate> Ok, i'll look into that after i get fglrx working

[05:49] <Master_Frag> try changeing sound system
[05:50] <crimsun> keeganX: because you haven't put forth the effort to get them in.
[05:50] <asparagui> so is herd really coming out today?
[05:50] <keeganX> Isn't it the maintainers job to get them in?
[05:50] <Pelo> herd ???

[05:50] <asparagui> fiesty fawn herd 1?

[05:51] <gpafixit> Does root own all things mounted on boot? (and fat32?)
[05:51] <Pelo> keeganX,  I think you mean audacity , try looking for that it might help,

[05:52] <keeganX> Pelo: No I'm talking about Audacious
[05:52] <Master_Frag> Animal crossing with disgruntled cows perhaps
[05:52] <SilentDis> gpafixit:  root owns all, it is all, it exists as all.  if root can't get to it, it can't be gotten to ;)
[05:52] <Pelo> Master_Frag,  feisty fawn is the code name for the next release I beleive,  never heard fo herd tho
[05:52] <Master_Frag> ohh
[05:52] <Master_Frag> lol
[05:52] <gpafixit> SilentDis: lol .. well I kinda expected that .. but does root have to own fat32 mounted stuff? is gid=46 automaticly root?
[05:53] <poningru> herd 1 is the first alpha quality release on the road to feisty
[05:53] <Master_Frag> but still i thing this would be funny
[05:53] <poningru> !herd 1 is the first alpha quality release on the road to feisty

[05:54] <Pelo> gpafixit,  rightclick,  open with
[05:54] <gpafixit> SilentDis: Yeah, kinda .. I move the files to ext3 directory .. doctor them up so they work like magic, move them back (as user not root) and plop, they are friggin, executibles again ..
[05:54] <Pelo> Elly,  search for rar in synaptic
[05:54] <SilentDis> gpafixit:  ahhhh.  hmm... that's weird.  on fat32, it SHOULD pull from extensions and work...  did you go into properties on the file (on fat32) and choose what app to always open it with?

[05:56] <woodwizzle> Pelo, is nvu just wysywig or does it have good text editing too?
[05:56] <gpafixit> SilentDis: Yes, right click, open with (or add) .. and whomp, executible file .. move it back to ext3 .. do the same thing and perfection .. but it's GOT to be on the fat side so my slacker relatives can get to them when they boot into winblows .. you know? .. its been a thorn and I'm going back home (8000 miles away) in a couple days ..

[05:57] <Pie-rate> damn, those instructions were so simple. i was thinking it'd "just work" :(
[05:57] <SilentDis> gpafixit:  i totally understand.  got a netdisk thingy from ximeta that's in fat32 so the roommates can get to it from their windows box.
[05:57] <woodwizzle> I didn't like screem, I thought it was kinda bloated and messy
[05:57] <gpafixit> SilentDis: is my fstab borking it?
[05:57] <dabaR> cge: permission denied often means you need to run the command with sudo
[05:57] <Pelo> Evil_Elly,  , it is bad form to change your nick in an help channel you miss the highlights,    search for "rar" in synaptic
[05:57] <tychon> Could I get some help with mounting an X-in-1 media reader?
[05:57] <SilentDis> gpafixit:  no idea at this point.  how are you mounting it in fstab?
[05:58] <cge> dabaR: This is Xorg. Unless there have been some serious changes since I last looked, it won't run at all except as root.
[05:58] <mynameisdeleted> has anyone else had problems with a lid close causing the screen to go black till the laptop is rebooted on an intel card?
[05:58] <Evil_Elly> Pelo: I already did. The only real hit (unrar-free) doesn't handle split rar files. I'm wondering if there's something *else* without 'rar' in its name
[05:58] <Evil_Elly> Pelo: also, I'm in console; I can't run synaptic
[05:59] <SilentDis> gpafixit:  the options I'm running for my 2 fat32 drives is defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 - works fine (pulls from extensions)
[05:59] <mynameisdeleted> I fixed this on 5.06, but upgrading to 5.10 undid this

[05:59] <bimberi> mynameisdeleted: yes i did.  I was able to work around it by doing ctrl-alt-F1 then ctrl-alt-F7

[06:00] <_goofy_> im trying to ftp to a friends pc over the internet.....how do i go about doing that
[06:00] <Pelo> tychon,  I think you need something plugged in for it to work ,  try sticking in a flash card or something

[06:00] <SilentDis> gpafixit:  opening mine as well
[06:01] <mynameisdeleted> ideally xorg would support proper power management and lid closing
[06:01] <tychon> It is plugged in.
[06:01] <tychon> dmesg even reports it.

[06:12] <SilentDis> solid_liq: :)  it's fun to play with, that's for sure. neat to watch windows 'wobble' up and such.  does a better job of it than windowblinds and such did on XP, that's for sure.
[06:12] <NoUse> !automatix
[06:12] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[06:13] <SilentDis> NoUse:  from experience, I will say that Automatix is THE DEVIL.  2nd install of ubuntu because of that thing :P
[06:13] <zor0> um.... all it does is use apt.... is there a more detailed explanation of that?
[06:13] <Pie-rate> nice, thanks nouse
[06:14] <noodles12> I'm trying to set-up a network printer and when i go to printers it says " The CUPS server could not be contacted" does that mean it is not installed?
[06:14] <NoUse> zor0 actually it doesn't use apt, it often force installs packages using dpkg
[06:14] <NoUse> zor0 hence the breaking
[06:14] <jumble> how do i figure out which of my hard drives is hd0 for installing the boot loader?
[06:14] <SilentDis> zor0:  true, it uses apt, and changes package files around, switches to dpkg a lot, and generally mucks everything up so you CAN'T use synaptic or apt-get properly after using it.
[06:15] <fbc> Is there a page that dhows new features, bugfixes for 6.1??? Why should I upgrade? Will my wireless card be better supported?
[06:15] <zor0> does the new version do that? it says right in their FAQ that it doesn't force anything
[06:15] <SilentDis> jumble:  usually, it's the Master hard drive on the first IDE controller.
[06:15] <noodles12> ah i closed the wrong channel. DId you gusy get my questio about CUP?
[06:15] <tychon> Celldweller, since it's in .Trash, I'm going to assume you don't want it -- you can force deletion of directories in there by sudo rm -rf *
[06:16] <Celldweller> i get the rm part
[06:16] <Freshwaterlarry> NoUse:  That site only covers print TO ubuntu.  It shows another site which covers unbuntu to windows XP.  finding no help on ubuntu to windows 2000
[06:16] <solid_liq> SilentDis: yeah, I've seen enough youtube videos of it now that I feel stupid for not having taken the time to install it yet (I've *only* been using Linux for a little under 7 years :)
[06:16] <Celldweller> what does the -rf stand for
[06:16] <Celldweller> remove file
[06:16] <Celldweller> ?
[06:16] <jaa6c6> hey is there a trick to get the googlebar to work in firefox in edgy, i'm having a bit of trouble
[06:16] <jumble> can i change that? i have sort of a weird configuration - my "main" hard drive is a SATA drive, im installing ubunto onto a second SATA drive with nothing on it yet, and i have an old IDE drive with some backup files that is the slave IDE drive with the CDROM as the master.
[06:16] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  don't feel bad.  I've been running BSD servers for about that long, and only FINALLY installed ubuntu a few months ago myself rofl
[06:17] <fbc> What's the different between 6.06 and 6.1?? Is it worth it???
[06:17] <NoUse> Freshwaterlarry have you run through the gnome printer wizard? I think that supports windows shared printers
[06:17] <solid_liq> SilentDis: :D
[06:17] <tychon> -f stands for force, which means it won't ask for confirmation, the -r stands for recursive, which causes it to work through directories, removing them and their content.
[06:17] <NoUse> list #automatix
[06:17] <tychon> man rm in bash will give you all the info you want on switches for rm
[06:17] <fbc> SilentDis: What's the different between 6.06 and 6.1?? Is it worth it???
[06:17] <NoUse> zor0 you can use it if you want, just don't expect support from this channel

[06:19] <Freshwaterlarry> NoUse:  Nope.  I am using samba and cups, with firefox .  Should I try with Gnome?
[06:19] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  I get all excited about synaptic, then realize people have been using stuff like that for YEARS now and wanna just crawl under my desk and cry rofl
[06:19] <solid_liq> SilentDis: what I can't stand is when someone calls themself a guru with Linux or Unix admin, then freaks out when there's no X server installed and insists that "whatever moron installed this before, they didn't know what they're doing.  So the first thing I have to do is install X..."
[06:19] <solid_liq> SilentDis: heheh
[06:19] <jumble> silentdis, did that make any sense?
[06:20] <solid_liq> SilentDis: lol
[06:20] <solid_liq> SilentDis: use apt-get and apt-cache instead, I like them MUCH better
[06:20] <solid_liq> SilentDis: and try KDE if you haven't yet

[06:21] <solid_liq> SilentDis: that sucks
[06:21] <SilentDis> jumble:  I just re-read it, what drive is the bios seeing as the primary?  what tries to 'boot' first?
[06:21] <solid_liq> Terminus: bah, real admins use the shell ;)
[06:22] <Pie-rate> What theme is the most minimalistic?
[06:22] <Terminus> solid_liq: errr... it is used on a shell. =P
[06:22] <jumble> i dont know, it lists the IDEs and the SCSIs separately.
[06:22] <solid_liq> Terminus: oh, I thought you were talking about one of the gui tools :D
[06:22] <Terminus> solid_liq: if you pass commands to it, it works almost like apt-get. if you don't, it gives you an ncurses interface.
[06:22] <PlaTiNium> i have a question: Why all IP datagrams have "Don't Fragment Bit" set in Ubuntu?
[06:22] <zor0> solid_liq : HERE HERE for shell usage
[06:22] <solid_liq> Terminus: cool. I may have to try that.  I've been confusing it with a gui tool all along apparently
[06:22] <Pie-rate> ooh i like Gray
[06:23] <Terminus> solid_liq: there're some cases where apt-get would be more appropriate, but for general installation and purging, aptitude works better most of the time.
[06:23] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  let's put it this way.  my neighbors are all at minimum 2 blocks away from me, and they're farmers.  they're lucky if they've got the stereo speakers on the right sides of their system.  it'll be a while before I see dsl/cable or any broadband out here :P
[06:23] <jumble> well. maybe i shouldnt worry about it. does it matter at all where it sticks the boot loader?
[06:23] <tychon> Anyone want to take a stab at helping me with mounting an internal X-in-1 media reader?
[06:23] <SilentDis> jumble:  if it works, LEAVE IT.  rofl
[06:23] <tychon> And could always go with satellite DSL, SilentDis.
[06:23] <solid_liq> SilentDis: ouch, sucks to be you!
[06:23] <SilentDis> tychon:  the 3000ms ping time drove me away from that option
[06:23] <tychon> Hehe.
[06:23] <jumble> i just dont trust that rickety old IDE drive. and i dont like the idea of it possibly putting the boot loader on a slave device.
[06:24] <solid_liq> SilentDis: maybe sprint broadband through their cell system?
[06:24] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  no towers.
[06:24] <craigbass1976> Ubuntu is totally slower than death.  Last night, edgy was running ok, but today after installing 6.06 (needed to try something) I'm a bit shocked
[06:24] <tychon> Well, if you're doing anything streaming or real-time, such as games, it's not that good, but it's much better than 56k for things like browsing the web and IRC.
[06:24] <craigbass1976> What do you all supoose happened?
[06:24] <solid_liq> SilentDis: or that satellite stuff, though it has plenty of latentcy
[06:24] <RaBiD> hey, I have a problem if anyone can help me with it
[06:24] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  trust me, i've checked into EVERYTHING.
[06:24] <solid_liq> SilentDis: that sucks
[06:25] <SilentDis> solid_liq:  i actually play SWG (thank you, cedega), and it runs fine on dialup... just large downloads are what bork me :P
[06:25] <solid_liq> SilentDis: I'm unhappy when I have to settle for 3mb cablemodem, or esp. if I have to settle for 768k dsl heheh
[06:25] <zor0> solid_liq: run your own cable?
[06:25] <RaBiD> logging into an xgl or gnome session with my normal account results in gnome not loading properly
[06:25] <solid_liq> zor0: huh?
[06:25] <RaBiD> I can't see the background image
[06:25] <RaBiD> but if I log in as root it's just fine
[06:25] <SilentDis> zor0:  the $1500 install and $300/month for a T1 to my house is a bit steep in price rofl
[06:25] <RaBiD> how can I reset the gnome settings ack to normal?
[06:25] <solid_liq> zor0: you mean SilentDis run one?  like a point to point T1?
[06:26] <tychon> SilentDis, I've yet to fiddle with Cedega. Still using plain old wine, heh.
[06:26] <Pie-rate> OOOK, now, time for a whole new (probably very hard) project. World of Warcraft + wine!
[06:26] <Naik0> Hey i need help to install ny ATI Radeon 9800 driver
[06:26] <solid_liq> SilentDis: esp. with the pay rates in rural areas I'm sure
[06:26] <zor0> solid_liq: hm... have to make it a T3 and then sell hosting on it to offset the cost
[06:26] <NoUse> Freshwaterlarry yes the gnome printer wizard supports Windows shared printers
[06:26] <SilentDis> tychon:  BIG thumbs up to TransGaming.  games just WORK. :)
[06:27] <solid_liq> zor0: yeah but as he already said, his neighbors are far from interested in tech
[06:27] <Terminus> RaBiD: are you sure? my method cannot be used to recover settings. `rm -rf ~/.gconf* ~/.gnome*`
[06:27] <Shadowpillar> Pie-rate: needs patching
[06:27] <Naik0> somebody with ATI gfx card who can help me?
[06:27] <Celldweller> ok i thhought i had it
[06:27] <solid_liq> Naik0: wazzup?
[06:27] <Shadowpillar> SilentDis: crossover works better than cedega in a lot of cases
[06:27] <tychon> Pie-rate, appdb claims it's gold.
[06:27] <Naik0> solid_liq: can i pm you?
[06:27] <SilentDis> zor0:  if it could make them harvest corn or milk cows faster, i'd be rolling in the money rofl
[06:27] <Celldweller> now it tells me that i do not have permissions to its parent folder
[06:27] <solid_liq> Naik0: ati fglrx drivers?
[06:27] <RaBiD> when I just log into it everything works like the gnome panels and what not, just not the desktop
[06:27] <tychon> Parent folder?
[06:27] <Celldweller> yea
[06:27] <tychon> To .Trash?
[06:27] <Celldweller> yea
[06:27] <tychon> Er.
[06:27] <zor0> no, I mean general hosting, start a colo in the middle of nowhere
[06:27] <Celldweller> i have NOOOOOO idea why
[06:27] <Celldweller> lol
[06:28] <tychon> How could you not have access to your own home folder...?
[06:28] <SilentDis> zor0:  thought about that too.  :)
[06:28] <Shadowpillar> cedega is suffering from the karma bomb they dumped on themselves for fucking the WINE project over IMHO
[06:28] <SilentDis> zor0:  startup capitol would be a pain

[06:30] <Naik0> solid_liq:  yes i did
[06:30] <RaBiD> My gnome is all messed over, the panels work and what not just no background image, no icons, etc
[06:30] <solid_liq> Naik0: you already tried that?
[06:30] <ski-worklap> does running ubuntu in 64 bit mode do anything good if i don't have 4gb of ram?
[06:30] <solid_liq> Naik0: do the option 2
[06:30] <solid_liq> Naik0: that works best
[06:30] <solid_liq> Naik0: are you on amd64?
[06:30] <Naik0> i did all the steps but when i did "sudo aticonfig --initial" command it told me that the command dont exist
[06:30] <ski-worklap> the only thing i can think of are compatibility issues
[06:30] <Celldweller> im not doing anything to my home folder
[06:30] <malt> I tryed to installing phpmyadmin on ubuntu by using sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin and it installed but i couldn't access it by http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ wonder why?
[06:30] <Naik0> intel 4
[06:31] <Celldweller> i downloaded a bunch of iso files of other distros... and i put them in the trash can and they wont go away
[06:31] <solid_liq> Naik0: so option #2 should be straigtforward
[06:31] <TGPO> ski-worklap, I dumped the 64bit and put 32 back on, too many hassles
[06:31] <solid_liq> Naik0: but I only have ATI hardware on amd64, so I can't tell ya for sure
[06:31] <ski-worklap> TGPO, tell me more about the hassles?
[06:31] <tychon> And sudo rm -rf * won't do away with them?
[06:31] <Naik0> check the link that i pm you
[06:31] <Celldweller> no beccause then it says something about desktop and blah blah
[06:31] <tychon> Er.
[06:31] <Celldweller> because its a folder
[06:32] <ski-worklap> i'm wondering if i might want to do a slim 64bit install, with VMs off of that
[06:32] <TGPO> ski-worklap, multi-media issues, wine issues, pretty much anything other than web browsing and word processing was a pain to get working well
[06:32] <tychon> So you're in /home/Celldweller/.Trash, you type sudo rm -rf * and it tells you something about the desktop?
[06:32] <ski-worklap> so my "primary OS" would be a 32bit domU
[06:32] <Celldweller> one second
[06:32] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, i do 'cp (somefolder) /home/(myacct)/Desktop' in the console, but it then says 'cp: (somefolder) omitted' it even does this when i sudo cp.
[06:32] <ski-worklap> TGPO, hmm
[06:33] <ski-worklap> think i might try it anyway
[06:33] <Naik0> solid_liq: did you checked?
[06:33] <solid_liq> Naik0: did I what?
[06:33] <TGPO> ski-worklap, IMHO 64 bit should be relegated to tinkering until support is more generalized for it
[06:33] <Naik0> did you check the site i gave you?
[06:33] <ski-worklap> TGPO, well i do a lot of tinkering
[06:33] <ski-worklap> in particular i want to have a virtual server farm
[06:34] <naik0_> sorry solid_liq
[06:34] <TGPO> ski-worklap, up to you, but after 2 weeks of headaches I gave up on it for the time being
[06:34] <ski-worklap> so i can build my code in nbsd, fbsd, obsd, linux, you name it all programmatically
[06:34] <ski-worklap> but then again, xen3 doesn't support that stuff without pacifica, and i'm not sure i have that... hrm
[06:34] <Celldweller> sweet!, thanks tychon it worked
[06:34] <ski-worklap> by"that stuff" i'm referring to fbsd/obsd

[06:36] <ski-worklap> Naik0, rehash

[07:12] <cmweb> Stop harassing the bots
[07:12] <ArrenLex> cmweb: "there", and yes.
[07:12] <megaqwerty_> does anyone know how I could download all of the packages that could be required for a debian package all at onece?
[07:12] <Madpilot> !msgthebot
[07:12] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[07:12] <lostsync> ArrenLex, fix my sound problems and i'll give you a large trout to slap me with as a reward
[07:12] <lostsync> ;)~
[07:12] <chandu> megaqwerty_,To which package you want
[07:12] <towsonu2003> Madpilot, thanks
[07:12] <ArrenLex> megaqwerty_: apt-get install -d package
[07:12] <megaqwerty_> gnome-network-manager
[07:12] <cmweb> arrenlex, ok i dont like beinr corrected every time i missuse a word
[07:13] <ArrenLex> lostsync: what sound problems are these?
[07:13] <chandu> megaqwerty_, you want to install that ..or you wnat to download deb packages for that and its dependent pacakges
[07:13] <lostsync> aw that was mean
[07:14] <megaqwerty_> chandu: the deb package and it's dependent packages
[07:14] <chandu> megaqwerty_, you can use "apt-get -d install gnome-network-manager" .. this will do download only packages to you /var/cache/apt/archives
[07:14] <chandu> megaqwerty_, Previous command is only to download ..it wont install
[07:15] <Pie-rate> i installed network-manager, but how do i get it to start?
[07:15] <chandu> megaqwerty_, make sure ur /var/cache/apt/archives doesnt contain nay deb files .. so you can get only the pcakges related to what u want
[07:15] <megaqwerty_> chandu: yes, the problem is that I need to give these packages to a friend who is just starting with ubuntu, and he doesn't have internet outside of his wifi.
[07:15] <megaqwerty_> chandu: will this download all dependencies even if I already have these fulfilled?
[07:16] <megaqwerty_> chandu: (on my box)
[07:16] <chandu> megaqwerty_, ok fine ..then you use the aboeve command .. it will download all the packages needed to install gnome-network-manager
[07:16] <megaqwerty_> chadu: okay, cool. Thank you very much!
[07:16] <draeath> Anyone know how to get the screensaver control panel in Kubuntu to show ALL the configuration? It seems that I have no way to specify things like colormap, fading, image/text/video sources etc
[07:16] <chandu> megaqwerty_, most welcome
[07:17] <Pie-rate> I installed network-manager and network-manager-gnome, but how do i get them to run?
[07:17] <megaqwerty_> chandu: it didn't work
[07:17] <Skwid_> when i connect to my computer via ssh, what's the easiest way to get a file to the computer i am actually using ?
[07:18] <chandu> megaqwerty_, didnt work
[07:18] <draeath> Skwid_: scp username@host:FILEPATH localfilepath
[07:18] <megaqwerty_> chandu: downloading all packages. It just tells me "network-manager-gnome is already the newest version."
[07:18] <chandu> megaqwerty_, what you have specified ur repo path in /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:18] <draeath> Skwid_: nevermind, i misread your question
[07:18] <Skwid_> draeath: uh ?
[07:18] <chandu> megaqwerty_, ok ..means in your system its already present
[07:18] <megaqwerty_> chandu: right
[07:19] <megaqwerty_> chandu: I need the package and all of it's dependencies to give to my friend who doesn't have internet right now.
[07:19] <megaqwerty_> chandu: (at least in windows)
[07:20] <megaqwerty_> chandu *linux
[07:20] <chandu> megaqwerty_, ok ..wait for a moment I will b back
[07:20] <megaqwerty_> chandu: k.
[07:20] <andy__> where can i find a list of packages in the latest ubuntu server edition?
[07:20] <MrKeuner> hi, how safe is to remove auto removable packages in synaptic?
[07:21] <pestilence> i have a intel wireless 3945 card, and it doesn't configure properly on boot.  after boot, if i type "sudo ifup eth1" it comes up fine...how do i figure out why it isn't configuring on boot?
[07:21] <xen> hey, I think my man path is messed up...anyone have advice on fixing it?  (ie. man -k strftime returns nothing)

[07:24] <what_if> 32bit
[07:24] <katanaswordfish> k thanks
[07:24] <what_if> channels awfully quiet for having 900 prople

[07:25] <lostsync> make that 900
[07:25] <noodles12> Has anyone gotten a lexmark x6170 printer working?
[07:26] <lostsync> wb :p
[07:26] <ArrenLex> lostsync: sorry. xD
[07:27] <ArrenLex> lostsync: got your audio sorted out yet?
[07:27] <Pie-rate> hmm, wireless networking still isn't working with networkmanager
[07:27] <lostsync> no...i'm pretty sure it's a lost cause at this point.
[07:27] <ArrenLex> lostsync: on an unrelated note, were you once part of *NSYNC? Because that would make sense.
[07:27] <malt> malt@malt-server:/var/www/phpmyadmin$ sudo cp /var/www/phpmyadmin /home/malt
[07:27] <malt> cp: omitting directory `/var/www/phpmyadmin'
[07:27] <ArrenLex> lostsync: symptoms?
[07:28] <malt> when i try to move phpmyadmin why does it auto put a `
[07:28] <malt> where it saids can't find directory
[07:28] <lostsync> i did a minimal install then installed xubuntu-desktop from terminal and i think that for some reason doing it that way made setup fail to detect/configure my audio
[07:28] <ArrenLex> lostsync: No. Installing a -desktop sets you up with everything you would have gotten had you installed from a desktop CD.
[07:28] <cool372> Hey
[07:28] <ArrenLex> lostsync: try: apt-get install alsa-base alsa-utils alsa-oss
[07:29] <lostsync> that's what i thought until all ofth is started happening
[07:29] <dabaR> malt: it can find it, but is omitting it. try -r option.
[07:29] <cool372> anyone know rockstar supernova?
[07:29] <Empiric> any idea /join #suse
[07:29] <ArrenLex> lostsync: then, run "amixer" and pastebin the output for me.
[07:29] <lostsync> i have all three of those packages and in fact have compiled alsa* from source trying to get my semiproaudio interface working
[07:29] <noodles12> dabaR: i checked those printing thing but the thing is they ddin't make a linux driver for my printer =/
[07:29] <malt> dabaR so like sudo cpr?
[07:29] <dabaR> malt: cp -r
[07:29] <dabaR> and no sudo
[07:30] <dabaR> cause you are copying to your own directory, which you have permissions for
[07:30] <sureshot> silly question have you turn on your sound system from cmos if it is built in
[07:30] <ArrenLex> lostsync: yeah, if you've gone as far as compiling it from source I'd say if anything could be done to make it work, it would have come out already. = /
[07:31] <peanutb> how reliable is it to upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[07:31] <lostsync> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34915/
[07:31] <firebird619> My monitors native resolution is 1680X1050, but the resolution it is using is 1280x1084. In System==>Preferences==>Screen Resolution, it doesn't show 1680x1050, but in xorg.conf it lists it. How can I get it to use the native resolution?
[07:31] <ArrenLex> peanutb: that is directly proportional to how nonstandard your system is.
[07:31] <dabaR> !fixres > firebird619
[07:31] <ArrenLex> Or, should I say, inversely proportional.
[07:31] <firebird619> dabaR: Thanks
[07:31] <peanutb> its pretty standard, no wifi,etc.
[07:31] <chandu> megaqwerty_, I hope that same command should work .. you try it out once ...and check your /var/cahce/apr/archives
[07:31] <ArrenLex> lostsync: kindly pastebin the output of "lspci".
[07:32] <lostsync> it's a usb interface
[07:32] <dabaR> firebird619: in particular, the vertical and horizontal refresh rate section. manual entry into .conf file
[07:32] <peanutb> Is automatix as big a problem as it is made out to be?
[07:32] <ArrenLex> !automatix
[07:32] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:32] <ArrenLex> (i.e. yes)
[07:32] <peanutb> ok
[07:32] <firebird619> dabaR: Ok, Thank You.
[07:32] <ArrenLex> lostsync: oh. Ouch. That might be hard.
[07:32] <peanutb> a fresh install it is
[07:32] <ArrenLex> peanutb: are you running gnome or kde?
[07:33] <ArrenLex> peanutb: or another DE?
[07:33] <lostsync> yeah...that's why i was having to compile it via alsaproject's instructions on my device
[07:33] <peanutb> started with xfce, then gnome, then kde
[07:33] <ArrenLex> peanutb: so you're on KDE right now?
[07:33] <peanutb> gnome actually
[07:33] <ArrenLex> peanutb: I was on KDE and I upgraded without problems by doing it in small chunks.
[07:33] <peanutb> how?
[07:33] <lostsync> but onboard and an old ISA card are both also having very similar issues...they are seen as PnP devices but aren't listed in asound/cards or anywhere else
[07:34] <ArrenLex> peanutb: add the edgy line to your sources.list. Then pick a package and apt-get install it directly. It will also install a bunch of stuff with it. When it's done, pick another package to install, etc.
[07:34] <ArrenLex> peanutb: if you're running gnome and don't have anything else esoteric, update should work for you.
[07:34] <peanutb> ok
[07:34] <lostsync> the onboard card is an ESS which is the same thing i have in the computer that just broke causing me to try fighting with this p2 to have a working system until xmas
[07:34] <ArrenLex> peanutb: remember to apt-get install xserver-xorg at the end just in case.
[07:35] <lostsync> i bought an 80gig drive the day my athlon crapped out :/
[07:35] <peanutb> wouldent want to loose that

[07:40] <lostsync> ArrenLex, is there some package i could dpkg-reconfigure to try redetecting my cards?

[07:40] <lostsync> pls stay
[07:40] <lostsync> oh well

[07:42] <MrKeuner> hi, is it safe to remove auto removable packages in synaptic?
[07:42] <ArrenLex> Sorry, that's what I was looking for.
[07:42] <lostsync> hmm
[07:42] <ArrenLex> MrKeuner: if your question is "is it safe to remove autoremoveable packages", yes. If your question is "is it safe to trust synaptic to do this", I would guess yes but have no first-hand experience to back that up.
=== kenThomson3 is now known as kenThomson
[07:43] <therealyertman> I just added a new hard disk to my text only ubuntu server. Went to fdisk it and I find there is no /dev/hdb
[07:43] <dabaR> what is an autoremovable package?
[07:43] <MrKeuner> ArrenLex: first one
[07:43] <dabaR> therealyertman: sudo fdisk -l
[07:43] <MrKeuner> ArrenLex: thanks
[07:43] <sixaxis> hey NoScript should I donwload it from Ubuntu or from FIrefox site?
[07:43] <ArrenLex> dabaR: a package that was installed as a dependency for another package, and the original package has now been removed.
[07:43] <kenThomson> Can someone give me a link on the web where i can find a very extensive yet noob friendly Linux tutorial?
[07:43] <therealyertman> Should the device file be created automatically if the disk is working.
[07:44] <dabaR> therealyertman: ya
[07:44] <lostsync> ok alsaconf tells me it can't find all these modules snd-ess18xx being the exact one i need
[07:44] <ArrenLex> dabaR: Like, if you install the package "relativity" and as a dependency it also installs "libe=mc2", when you remove "relativity", your "libe=mc2" package because autoremovable.
[07:44] <lostsync> how do i get these modules?
[07:44] <dabaR> kenThomson: on what part of Linux?
[07:44] <dabaR> kenThomson: wiki.ubuntu.com
[07:44] <sixaxis> firefox adons should be dl from ubuntu or from firefoxI guess nobody knows
[07:45] <ArrenLex> lostsync: you should already have them, if you're running a recent kernel, I think...
[07:45] <ArrenLex> lostsync: apt-cache search alsa modules only lists 2.4 kernel modules
[07:45] <lostsync> one would think
[07:45] <kenThomson> dabaR: I am pretty new to Linux and want to learn Bash, but i get perturbed by those text-obly hopelessly boring usual tutorials.
[07:45] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: using bash as a shell, or bash scripting?
[07:45] <sixaxis> how may I find out command line for a package?
[07:45] <lostsync> im on edgy...but it's also saying snd-sb16 is missing and i think that's really really weird
[07:45] <ArrenLex> sixaxis: come again?
[07:46] <sixaxis> apt-get find  food?
[07:46] <CharonX> Is there a way to lock down a box so that nobody can log into it for specified periods of time ?
[07:46] <dabaR> kenThomson: hehe, don't say boring text-only and want to learn bash in the same sentence...
[07:46] <dabaR> !cli > kenThomson
[07:46] <kenThomson> dabaR: I am looking for something that would familiarise me with some pretty advanced working of Linux (starting from simple parts that is)
[07:46] <kenThomson> dabaR: :)
[07:46] <ArrenLex> sixaxis: apt-cache search foobar.
[07:46] <sixaxis> thanks
[07:46] <dabaR> kenThomson: start with wikipedia, I think.
[07:46] <kenThomson> ArrenLex: presently both those things mean the same to me (or more properly mean nothing to me) :)
[07:47] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: okay; do you know any programming languages?
[07:47] <kenThomson> ArrenLex: Java
[07:47] <peanutb> how do i start a new session?
[07:47] <kenThomson> ArrenLex: And HTML if you can call it a prog. Language
[07:47] <therealyertman> dabaR Okay it's there I just forgot how Linux specifies disks. I was expecting the master on the second bus to be hdb when of course it's really hdc. Thanks
[07:47] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: also, have you ever seen\used the command line in Windows (assuming you hail from Windows)?
[07:47] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: I don't, and it isn't.
[07:47] <dabaR> therealyertman: I knew that was the issue,.
[07:47] <kenThomson> ArrenLex: Actionscript too! Yes i have used it pretty extensively (in Win)
[07:48] <abes> crimsun: hey... we were talking earlier about that not working flash plugin.... in firefox 2.0 - any ideas?
[07:48] <dabaR> kenThomson: read wikipedia on linux, gnu, fsf, ubuntu, debian, gnome, kde, and click on any link that is given there. You have to get some breadth first, then you can think of depth.
[07:48] <therealyertman> :)
[07:48] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: bash is like the windows command prompt, only it's actually useful.
[07:48] <kenThomson> dabaR: A philosopher on IRC?!!

[07:49] <Parisi_> I hear alot of great things about the new shell, so watch out.
[07:49] <andy__> exit
[07:49] <dabaR> hehe
[07:49] <vinia> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[07:49] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: cd <dir> to move through directories, "ls" to list files in a directory, "mv afile somewhere" to move (if somewhere is a dir) or rename (if somewhere does not exist) files. "cp afile afile2" to copy files. "rm file" to remove files. "rm -r directory" to remove directories. That's a simple primer so you can move around :)
[07:49] <godless> Parisi_:  Does microsoft pay you for this publicity?
[07:50] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: a shell script is essentially putting bash commands into a file, one per line, and then telling bash to execute them all from top to bottom.
[07:50] <kenThomson> ArrenLex: Thanks for the effort!
[07:50] <Parisi_> godless Does the devil pay you to call yourself a godless?
[07:50] <Parisi_> What does that have do to with anything, you see what mean?
[07:50] <ArrenLex> Parisi_: Do we really need to have this argument?
[07:50] <Rob-West> can i install Kubuntu packages in Ubuntu
[07:50] <Rob-West> or do i need KDE
[07:51] <ArrenLex> Rob-West: of course you can.
[07:51] <godless> Rob-West:  You can. You might need to install some of the kde libraries
[07:51] <Rob-West> well i cant find Amarok for Ubuntu but i can find it for Kubuntu
[07:51] <godless> but synaptic is really good at telling you what you need for a given package
[07:51] <vinia> hallo
[07:51] <ArrenLex> Rob-West: "kubuntu" is only ubuntu with different packages installed by default. There is really no distinction between the two systems.
[07:51] <dabaR> haha @ god and microsoft henchemen

[07:52] <godless> I am listening to Amarok in Xubuntu (xfce) atm
[07:52] <ArrenLex> And I'm enjoying Gaim on KDE.
[07:52] <kenThomson> On a side note: My VDU can support 800x600 (@85Hz, it's written in the manual + it works that way in Windows). But on Ubuntu i cant get a frequency above 60Hz at any resolutions? I installed Nvidia's proprietery drivers but that didn't help (and i dont want to use them). What should i do? My Monitor flickers like HELL at 60HZ.
[07:52] <ArrenLex> And wishing kopete had a usable spellcheck. :(

[07:56] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: then you need to adjust your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. I know how to do this with the Debian package because tit offers you the option to do so in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. However, ubuntu has removed this IIRC for some reason. You'd have to google.
[07:57] <ArrenLex> ...tit -> it
[07:57] <dabaR> kenThomson: you need to know the exact make and model of the monitor and then type in "refresh rates <make> <model> into google, then it should get you the horizontal and vertical refresh rates.
[07:57] <dabaR> ArrenLex: you can drxx in ubuntu
[07:57] <godless> Rob-West:  'sudo apt-get install amarok' oughta do the deed, but whatever suits you.
[07:57] <ArrenLex> dabaR: Yay drxx? What means this wonderful acronym?
[07:57] <kenThomson> dabaR: I know the exact make/model, and my Monitor's manual says it can support 85HZ at 800x600
[07:58] <dabaR> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:58] <Rob-West> thats what i used
[07:58] <ArrenLex> dabaR: Yes. But IIRC they took the refresh rate option out of that process.
[07:58] <dabaR> kenThomson: so then do what I said with that info.
[07:58] <ArrenLex> dabaR: To avoid newbies making their monitors go kablewie, I presume.
[07:58] <dabaR> ArrenLex: hm
[07:58] <kenThomson> dabaR: in the configuration wizard, i selected the proper frequencies but they still dont take effect. Ubuntu simply reverts to 60HZ
[07:58] <dabaR> kenThomson: tell me the exact make and model
[07:59] <adele> I have a similar problem
[07:59] <ladyinblack> and i have a simple problem
[07:59] <adele> my resolution is fine at 1280x1024 but the refresh rate is low
[07:59] <kenThomson> dabaR: Compaq mv520:
[07:59] <ArrenLex> dabaR: yes. They took it out.
[07:59] <rageagainstthis> i was wondering if you are able to create share in samba that is composed of different files located on different harddrives and folders
[08:00] <ArrenLex> rageagainstthis: Yes, by using symlinks.
[08:00] <adele> is there a way to change my refresh rate
[08:00] <kenThomson> dabaR: 50-99 x 31-54 (vertical x horizonatal, refresh rates, in Hz)
[08:00] <rageagainstthis> great i will do a search on it
[08:00] <dabaR> kenThomson: pastebin the xorg.conf file, please
[08:01] <ladyinblack> people i need help and i am lame!
[08:01] <EpP> Hey, i want to get a wireless card that can inject packets? Are there any brand new cards that are based on prism 2. It seems all the lists of cards on the net are old and the cards are now v2 or3 and have a different chipset. Where is a place i can get v1 of these cards?
[08:01] <dr-nix> adele: tried the preferences menu (or is it admin?)
[08:01] <Rob-West> Amarok is done
[08:01] <adele> dr-nix yes
[08:01] <Rob-West> and i did it myself
[08:01] <ArrenLex> !symlink | rageagainstthis
[08:01] <ubotu> rageagainstthis: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[08:01] <adele> I have the vesa driver though
[08:01] <dr-nix> oh
[08:01] <dr-nix> what gfx do you have ?
[08:02] <kenThomson> dabaR: now that is a difficult question, as i am running from Knoppix Live CD, i crashed GRUB, and get Error21, everytime i select ubuntu at boottime (becuase i moved the HDDs after installation)
[08:02] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: that's an easy one. You just have to re-install grub.
[08:02] <adele> dr-nix: radeonx1800
[08:02] <dabaR> kenThomson: how do you intend to fix it then? are you fixing the knoppix or ubuntu resolution?
[08:02] <dr-nix> oh, that should be supported by some ati driver no?
[08:02] <godless> ladyinblack:  You will have better luck getting some help if you actually ask a question.
[08:03] <adele> dr-nix: it is but I dont want to install the ATI driver. its a long story
[08:03] <dr-nix> heh'
[08:03] <adele> basically my videocard sounds like boeing 747 if i install ati driver
[08:03] <dr-nix> anyways you should still be able to change your refresh rate..
[08:03] <kenThomson> dabaR: That problem occured in Ubuntu. And i wish to learn a way to solve it, so that when i re-install Ubuntu i can get my resolution/frequency to work correctly
[08:03] <dr-nix> you might have to add a modeline in the xorg.conf though (asuming your talking about X)
[08:03] <ArrenLex> adele: I hear you. If I install fglrx, xvideo freezes my computer.
[08:04] <ladyinblack> i am trying to instal CrossOver Office but i cant make it with the terminal comand..:/
[08:04] <kenThomson> ArrenLex: Talk about Linux being easy!
[08:04] <siXy> adele, the refresh rate is specified in xorg.conf
[08:04] <ArrenLex> Adele: I have long been of the opinion that the ATI Linux development process consists of blindfolding an intern and having him type randomly into notepad, and then shipping it as a Linux driver as it compiles.
[08:04] <adele> i dont think ati drivers are official for linux
[08:04] <ArrenLex> kenThomson: once you and dabaR figure out whatever you're working on right now, let me know and I can tell you how to fix grub :)
[08:05] <dabaR> kenThomson: you need to add two lines to your xorg.conf in the monitor section. first is "HorizSync          50-99", second is "VertRefresh        31-54" or the other way around with the values, but I think that is right.
[08:05] <Rob-West> i need a Perl plugin for Xchat where can i get it
[08:05] <ArrenLex> adele: they sure are. fglrx is.
[08:05] <dr-nix> didn't ATI stop providing drivers around the same time nVidia started to provide drivers for *nix ?!
[08:05] <adele> i think they are just windows drivers re-written for linux or something. at least tahts what i haerd
[08:05] <kenThomson> dabaR: simple copy-paste in gedit will do?
[08:05] <dabaR> adele: same for your refresh rate fix, likely, but find out the exact specs for your monitor.
[08:05] <dabaR> kenThomson: sure.
[08:05] <ladyinblack> :(
[08:06] <kenThomson> dabaR: and where is this .conf file located?
[08:06] <adele> dabar i forgot which folder that file is in.. something etc/X11..?
[08:06] <dabaR> kenThomson: then save, close gedit, and restart X(alt-ctrl-backspace)
[08:06] <dabaR> /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:06] <kenThomson> dabaR: great!
[08:06] <dr-nix> dabaR: hm yeah and if that doesn't work you can add a modeline
[08:06] <firebird619> dabaR: I followed the steps on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto except for using 855resolution, and I am still unable to use the native resolution of 1680x1050. Any other suggestions? Would using the 855resolution fix this?
[08:06] <Rob-West> where can i find a PErl Plugin for XChat
[08:06] <kenThomson> dr-nix: whats that?
[08:07] <adele> so where do I add that modline thing
[08:07] <dabaR> firebird619: no idea, you sure you entered the horizontal and vertical rates?
[08:07] <firebird619> dabaR: Yes.
[08:07] <dabaR> firebird619: and restarted X?
[08:07] <firebird619> dabaR: yes
[08:07] <dr-nix> oh i'd better get going ... my lecture starts soon, oh it's just a line you add (in the screen section)
[08:08] <dabaR> It should work.
[08:08] <dr-nix> with information about a resolution (vert and horiz refresh and so on)
[08:08] <dabaR> hehe
[08:08] <dr-nix> there are generators for it
[08:08] <dr-nix> modeline that is
[08:08] <dabaR> anyhow, I am moving tomorrow morning, I am going to sleep. good luck all
[08:08] <anonymouse> greetings ubus
[08:08] <dr-nix> anyways my lecture starts in few minutes so i'd better get going
[08:08] <dr-nix> later
[08:08] <anonymouse> I am stuck between an apt-get and a hard place
[08:08] <kenThomson> Good bye everyone!
[08:09] <anonymouse> Just did an apt-get upgrade, and when it gets to "setting up ppp" it hangs the system
[08:09] <anonymouse> =(
[08:09] <ArrenLex> Byee
[08:09] <adele> anybody knows the link for that modline thing
[08:09] <Naik0> Could not find a working compiler
[08:09] <Naik0> how do i get a working compiler?
[08:10] <Rob-West> can someone help me with a Perl Script
[08:10] <ArrenLex> Naik0: apt-get install build-essential
[08:10] <Naik0> ArrenLex: dont work
[08:10] <firebird619> Can anyone help me? My monitors native resolution is 1680x1050, but the highest resolution System==>Preferences==>Screen Resolution lists is 1280x1024. However, xorg.conf does list 1680x1050. What can I do to fix this?
[08:11] <ArrenLex> Naik0: could you be more specific?
[08:12] <anonymouse> Anyone here know how to troubleshoot a package install that hangs the whole system?
[08:12] <Naik0> ArrenLex: the packages is not healty
[08:12] <Naik0> bad
[08:12] <anonymouse> I *would* just uninstall ppp, but it looks like some important stuff deps on it
[08:12] <tabasko> firebird619, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:13] <ArrenLex> Naik0: Could you either speak English or paste the exact error, please? I donut understand you.
[08:13] <firebird619> tabasko: I tried that already. no luck
[08:13] <tabasko> hmm
[08:13] <Naik0> i cant translate to english, wait 1 sec
[08:13] <firebird619> I also followed the steps on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto, but no luck. Although I did not try the 855resolution thing.
[08:14] <EpP> Hey, i want to get a wireless card that can inject packets? Are there any brand new cards that are based on prism 2. It seems all the lists of cards on the net are old and the cards are now v2 or3 and have a different chipset. Where is a place i can get v1 of these cards?
[08:14] <Rob-West> can someone help me install a Perl Plugin
[08:15] <Naik0> ArrenLex: the package dont work, it says it corrupt
[08:15] <Rob-West> how do i set permissions
[08:15] <ArrenLex> Naik0: please paste the exact error you get.
[08:15] <Naik0> but its on swedish
[08:15] <Stanislav> hey is it possible to make the Ubuntu remote desktop server to auto accept connections? without having to click Allow?
[08:15] <ArrenLex> Naik0: uhh... try? Maybe I'll recongnise it from the context.
[08:16] <Naik0> !paste
[08:16] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:16] <tabasko> firebird619, what you have in SubSection "Display" section on xorg?
[08:16] <Naik0> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34919/
[08:17] <TheBlunderbuss> Hi there.  Do I need to write the LiveCD to a CDR or can I write to CDRW?
[08:17] <Naik0> ArrenLex: on line 29 it says couldnt find package gtk
[08:17] <jumble> does anyone here use activeperl with ubuntu?
[08:17] <adele> ok can someobdy please walk me through changing my refresh rate?
[08:18] <Stanislav> Anyone know how to make the ubuntu VNC server auto accept connections?
[08:18] <firebird619> tabasko: There are several Subsection "Display" do you want all of them?
[08:20] <ArrenLex> Naik0: what happens if you try "apt-get install g++-4.1"
[08:20] <tabasko> firebird619, no,, but there should be something like:
[08:20] <ArrenLex> Naik0: and that's right, it couldn't find gtk because there is no such package. If you're running gnome, you already have gtk installed anyway.
[08:21] <tabasko> Depth 24
[08:21] <tabasko> Modes "1680x1050"
[08:21] <firebird619> tabasko: yes, there is. It doesn't just list "1680x1050" it lists several other resolutions as well.
[08:22] <ArrenLex> Does anyone wise in the ways of ubotu know how, if the bot has a factoid for a command which is also a package (like g++) to coerce it into spewing the package info rather than the snippet?
[08:22] <luke__> I get this error when installing wpa_supplicant "/home/luke/Desktop/wpa_supplicant-0.4.9/eap.c:908: undefined reference to `scard_set_pin''
[08:22] <luke__> any ideas?
[08:22] <dsdg> halo, is there a way to assign two gateways to an ubuntu lan gateway?
[08:22] <ArrenLex> luke__: Here's an idea for you: apt-get install wpasupplicant
[08:23] <jumble> does anyone have any experience using perl in ubuntu?
[08:24] <firebird619> tabasko: That is all it has under each of the subsection "display"... Depth and then Mode, nothing else.
[08:24] <luke__> ArrenLex, OMFG
[08:24] <luke__> 'ty
[08:24] <ArrenLex> luke__: apt-cache search <terms> is your best friend =P
[08:26] <dsdg> halo, is there a way to assign two gateways to an ubuntu lan gateway?
[08:26] <black_13> what package installs the xorg configurator?
[08:27] <tabasko> firebird619, btw. which graphics card you have and which version of ubuntu, edgy?
[08:27] <luke__> No driver interfaces build into wpa_supplicant
[08:27] <firebird619> tabasko: Edgy and Intel 845GL (i810 driver)
[08:30] <rugbythomas> anyone know how to undo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
[08:30] <abes> hey! this is kind of odd... i removed firefox through synaptic but when i click on the <?> icon (which remained after removal) it still opens firefox - how can i completely get rid of it?
[08:30] <rugbythomas> now none of my games works
[08:30] <black_13_> what package installs the xorg configurator?
[08:30] <ArrenLex> abes: please paste the output of $(which firefox)
[08:30] <ArrenLex> No, wait.
[08:30] <ArrenLex> abes: "echo $(which firefox)"
[08:31] <abes> ArrenLex: /usr/bin/firefox
[08:31] <ArrenLex> abes: and how about "file /usr/bin/firefox"
[08:31] <rugbythomas> i dont know
[08:31] <abes> ArrenLex: /opt/firefox/firefox
[08:31] <ArrenLex> abes: there you go. You installed your own version from mozilla.org.
[08:32] <rugbythomas> i did it based on http://lug.wsu.edu/taxonomy_menu/3/14/90/91
[08:32] <ArrenLex> abes: removing it is easy, just remove the directory: "sudo rm -rf /opt/firefox"
[08:32] <ArrenLex> abes: and then "sudo rm /usr/bin/firefox" to clean up.
[08:33] <abes> ArrenLex: Great! That solves my problem :) Thank you!
[08:33] <ArrenLex> abes: no problem :)
[08:34] <Pie-rate> How do I get DVDs to play on ubuntu? I don't care if its illegal because as far as i'm concerned i purchased my license with the laptop (it came with windows software capable of playing dvds)
[08:34] <ArrenLex> !dvd
[08:34] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[08:34] <abes> ArrenLex: now im trying to get it back on but i get:  /var/cache/apt/archives/firefox_1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.8-0ubuntu0.6.06_i386.deb: unable to create `./usr/lib/firefox/libgfxpsshar.so'
[08:34] <abes> ArrenLex: any idea why would that come up?
[08:34] <Zehrila> Hello everyone!
[08:35] <ArrenLex> abes: that is a weird error, but as an aside, are you aware you're installing firefox 1.5?
[08:35] <ArrenLex> Rather than 2?
[08:35] <ogamiitto> I have reconfigured my network to have a static ip, everything is fine until I reboot the machine then netwrok-admin does not "remember" the dns servers so I have to re-add them by hand (resync the clock...), any clues?
[08:35] <kossoko> bnbn
[08:36] <Zehrila> I'm having a tough time trying to install Ubuntu and some assistance would certainly come handy.
[08:36] <ArrenLex> !ask
[08:36] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:36] <Zehrila> I downloaded the ISO (Ubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10), burnt it to disc, booted from it, checked the disc for errors and all seemed to be well.
[08:36] <kossoko>  I wonder how I can leave hibernation
[08:37] <Zehrila> But when I select the first option while booting i.e. run and install it or something similar...
[08:37] <jerp> ogamiitto, try resetting the router on the next reboot so the whole arrangement syncs
[08:37] <kossoko> I got qd mng
[08:37] <Zehrila> It boots up sort-of-fine but gives an error about themes etc. not working properly while loading the GUI.
[08:37] <kossoko> can smbdy hlp me? please
[08:37] <abes> ArrenLex: Yeah... I know... I need 1.5 first... because I'm testing some stuff :] 
[08:37] <ArrenLex> abes: okay, where are you trying to install it from?
[08:38] <ArrenLex> Whence didst this package hail?
[08:38] <ogamiitto> jerp: i don't think how can this help me, i think is some ubuntu config issue
[08:38] <Zehrila> BTW it's really slow at booting the OS from the disc and once booted, when I click the install icon on the desktop, I wait till eternity and nothing happens.
[08:38] <abes> ArrenLex: thru synaptic
[08:38] <Endymion> hello
[08:38] <kossoko> hello
[08:38] <ArrenLex> abes: yes, but which repository did the package come from?
[08:38] <black_13_> i have installed xorg (or i think i have) but i cant find xorgcfg or xconfigurator
[08:38] <Zehrila> Is there a way to simply install it from disc without first booting into it, since I think my RAM is being an issue here (256MB, with 32 MB being shared with VGA card)
[08:38] <ArrenLex> abes: and the word is "through", you American.
[08:38] <jerp> ogamiitto, I think it's a three minute pause between having stopped and restarting that notifies the ISP to send an initial 'handshake'
[08:38] <MikeyMike> OMG MY GNOME PANEL IS IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SCREEN! HELP!
[08:39] <steddy> slt a tout
[08:39] <abes> ArrenLex: I am canadian :P And i know the word! Just typing fast... and when it comes to the repository i have to check that... one sec
[08:39] <ArrenLex> abes: I am a Canadian as well! Stop shaming our people.
[08:39] <ogamiitto> jerp: other people here in the office have the same config, and works fine :)
[08:40] <MikeyMike> how do you drag the gnome panel?
[08:40] <MikeyMike> mines in the middle of my screen!
[08:40] <mordof> hey.. was wondering what a good iso burning program would be
[08:40] <ArrenLex> !burn
[08:40] <ubotu> CD/DVD Burning software: K3b (KDE), gnomebaker, serpentine, graveman Nautilus cd burner (Gnome), gtoaster, xcdroast, cdrecord (terminal-based). Burning .iso files: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[08:40] <mordof> MikeyMike: click and drag
[08:40] <MikeyMike> that doesnt work!
[08:40] <MikeyMike> click and drag WHERE?!
[08:40] <Endymion> what cd image should i download for intel 64? (the amd64?)
[08:40] <mordof> MikeyMike: make sure it's not locked
[08:40] <Zehrila> mordof: For windows, if you need a quality free program, try CD Burner XP Pro.
[08:41] <abes> ArrenLex: Well... i tried insalling THROUGH apt-get now and i got: unable to create `./usr/lib/firefox/libgfxpsshar.so': No such file or directory
[08:41] <MikeyMike> for the whole PANEL?!
[08:41] <ArrenLex> Endymion: I advise you to run 32-bit ubuntu unless you're perfectly certain you want 64-bit. It's a huge hastle.
[08:41] <MikeyMike> there is no lock option
[08:41] <abes> ArrenLex: E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[08:41] <ArrenLex> abes: that's all well and good, but what repository did this package come from?
[08:41] <Zehrila> Well, anyone with a solution to my problem?
[08:41] <abes> ArrenLex: I dont know...
[08:42] <ArrenLex> abes: okay, let's start like this: please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list minus the comments (cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep -v "#")
[08:42] <mordof> Zehrila: not sure why i would be asking how to burning iso's while in windows in this channel...
[08:42] <Zehrila> Is there a way to simply install Ubuntu from disc without first booting into it, since I think my RAM is being an issue here; the system gets to lag throughout booting and when I click the desktop icon for installation, it hangs. (RAM is 256MB, with 32 MB being shared with VGA card)
[08:42] <InvisiblePinkUni> !lisp
[08:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lisp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:42] <mordof> Zehrila: alternate cd
[08:42] <ArrenLex> Zehrila: to your latest question, you will have to download the alternate CD instead.
[08:43] <jerp> mikey, right button click on it and open the properties, then theres a tab on that first page that lets you position it
[08:43] <Zehrila> mordof: Well, there could be a reason for asking about burning ISOs in windows here, if you're wanting to burn the Ubuntu ISO. =] 
[08:43] <abes> ArrenLex: well... i need a browser for that... one sec... ill upload it to my ftp
[08:43] <ArrenLex> Zehrila: as to your theme error, the theme is cosmetic and doesn't indicate a serious problem with your system. As for what's causing it, I don't run gnome so I don't know; sorry you're having a hard time getting started :(
[08:43] <Zehrila> Otherwise I know, my answer sounded stupid, heh.
[08:43] <mordof> Zehrila: ah, yeah probably
[08:43] <mordof> Zehrila: however i had nero 7 in windows :P
[08:43] <jerp> "Orientation"
[08:43] <Zehrila> Ah alright.
[08:43] <Pie-rate> my laptop dvd drive vibrates a lot when it spins up to full speed
[08:43] <ArrenLex> abes: Oh, right... well, at need, you always have w3c
[08:44] <MikeyMike> I'LL BERB!!!!!!!!!!
[08:44] <abes> ArrenLex: hmmm.... i dont have Add/Remove on the bottom of my Aplications drop-down...?
[08:44] <Zehrila> And thanks ArrenLex.
[08:44] <Zehrila> Guess I'll have to download the alternate CD.
[08:44] <Zehrila> Which brings up another question..
[08:44] <Zehrila> Will the alternative CD have everything this main disc has?
[08:44] <malt> can anybody see www.m4lt.com/phpmyadmin/ ?
[08:45] <ArrenLex> abes: Don't run gnome, can't help you there... the best I can suggest is a pagan ritual with virgin sacrifice.
[08:45] <abes> ArrenLex: works too ;] 
[08:45] <ArrenLex> abes: do you mean, you can't find w3c in your menus? Because that makes sense; it's a console app.
[08:45] <Zehrila> If only I had 1 GB of RAM...=[
[08:46] <roland> malt: yes
[08:46] <Zehrila> Can I borrow it for installation?
[08:46] <malt> nice :D
[08:46] <Zehrila> Heh.
[08:46] <roland> malt: I'm in, now c hanging the password :)
[08:46] <Zehrila> So does the alternative CD have everything the main disc has?
[08:46] <malt> roland lol lies, really?
[08:46] <roland> don't worry
[08:46] <ArrenLex> Zehrila: my old computer had 256mb and ubuntu ran great, even with KDE and all the frills :)
[08:47] <roland> i'll change it back, ok :)
[08:47] <roland> just kidding malt
[08:47] <roland> but I could not resist trying of course
[08:47] <malt> oh :/ scared me
[08:47] <Zehrila> ArrenLex: That's great! I wonder what's the issue my end...
[08:47] <ArrenLex> Zehrila: No. The alternate CD, if I recall correctly, sets you up with a basic, text-mode system. In order to get to what the normal cd offers you, you have to run the command "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
[08:47] <malt> I was like wtf i though i changed all default stuff
[08:47] <abes> !ftp
[08:47] <ubotu> FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: ftpd, proftpd, pure-ftpd, twoftpd, vsftpd
[08:47] <Pie-rate> hmm, still cant get DVDs playing
[08:47] <malt> thought*
[08:47] <roland> malt: you did well
[08:47] <ArrenLex> abes: if it's such a problem you could just paste the lines.
[08:47] <Zehrila> I even checked the CD for errors and it didn't have any.
[08:47] <godless> alternate cd will do a regular installation
[08:48] <Zehrila> Thanks again ArrenLex.
[08:48] <corevette> where are logs for GAIM saved on linux?
[08:48] <godless> it just does a text-mode install
[08:48] <godless> instead of live-booting first
[08:48] <ArrenLex> ~/.gaim/logs, corvette
[08:48] <Zehrila> I better set myself to downloading on dialup again.
[08:48] <kraut> moin
[08:48] <roland> ok does anybody know what the preferred location is to put jdbc drivers on ubuntu?
[08:48] <ailean> is the DVD iso better than the CD one? i.e. does it have more software on it?
[08:48] <godless> (you can also do a text-only system install from the alternate but it is not the only option)
[08:48] <ArrenLex> Zehrila: No need for that... as long as your installation had no errors, the theme error is not related to the CD.
[08:49] <ArrenLex> ailean: Well, yes. But isn't it better to install a basic system and download what you need, instead of downloading everything in existence?
[08:49] <Zehrila> ArrenLex: I see. Well, that's the issue, the installation doesn't start when it boots into the GUI and I double-click on the 'install Ubuntu' desktop icon, heh.
[08:49] <enderak5454> Trk olan varm arkadalar
[08:49] <Zehrila> It simply gets stuck there doing nothing, for which I can't seem to think up a reason.
[08:49] <DARKGuy> Hey :), anybody here uses irssi and knows how to set it up for autoidenting me? it's kind of annoying to write /msg nickserv password at each login :/
[08:50] <Pie-rate> Installed libdvdread3, ran install-css.sh, installed gxine. gxine locks up and has to force quit when i try to use it to play a dvd
[08:50] <Zehrila> Lemme give it one more shot. Wish me luck, folks!
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Pie-rate: how about ogle? Mplayer?
[08:50] <ailean> ArrenLex, depends what you're installing it on. If it's a computer with dial-up internet access, then the DVD is better
[08:50] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey, how do i change/add screensavers from xfce?
[08:51] <rebuilt> i hate broadcom
[08:51] <ailean> Pie-rate, have you tried more than one DVD?
[08:51] <Pie-rate> installing "ogle" now
[08:51] <Pie-rate> no, i haven't
[08:51] <mnepton> DARKGuy: /NETWORK ADD -autosendcmd "/^msg nickserv ident $YOURPASSWORD;wait 2000" Freenode
[08:51] <Pie-rate> i know this one works though
[08:51] <ailean> Pie-rate, I find that Kaffiene is the easiest media player to use for DVDs
[08:51] <DARKGuy> mnepton: Thanks lots! :D
[08:52] <ArrenLex> ailean: kaffiene owns all, but is for KDE.
[08:52] <ailean> Pie-rate, and it's the only one that I can get to work
[08:52] <Pie-rate> ogle works
[08:52] <ailean> ArrenLex, Kaffiene runs on Gnome if you install the KDE libs
[08:52] <ailean> ArrenLex, I'm running Gnome with many KDE apps on it
[08:53] <ArrenLex> ailean: yes, of course, but some people don't want to clutter up their system.
[08:53] <ArrenLex> Pie-rate: glad to hear it.
[08:53] <godless> Hm. conversation just inspired me to read through my .irssi/config... I'm ignoring all sorts of folks I didn't know I was ignoring... :)
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
[08:54] <ArrenLex> ailean: I personally have kept my system delightfully gnome-free and aspire to keep it thusly.
[08:54] <Pie-rate> Package mplayer is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[08:54] <Pie-rate> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source
[08:54] <Pie-rate> E: Package mplayer has no installation candidate
[08:54] <Pie-rate> how do i get mplayer?
[08:54] <ailean> ArrenLex, fine, that's your choice. Pie-rate just wants to get a DVD working.
[08:54] <ArrenLex> godless: Tell me about it. I've ignored everyone who says they're a smoker on here and then I keep wondering who everyone is talking to. It's so freaky.
[08:54] <ailean> why do you do that ArrenLex? :)
[08:54] <ArrenLex> ailean: Yes; I suggested gnome DVD players which might allow him to do that, to avoid KDE dependencies.
[08:55] <ailean> fair enough
[08:55] <Pie-rate> how do i get mplayer?
[08:55] <ailean> through synaptic
[08:55] <ArrenLex> Pie-rate: the same way you get everything! It's a package :)
[08:55] <Pie-rate> aren't apt-get and synaptic the same damn things?
[08:56] <ArrenLex> Pie-rate: synaptic is a GUI for apt-get.
[08:56] <rugbythomas> system working fine before apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx how do I undo it
[08:56] <Pie-rate> apt-get remove xorg-driver-fglrx
[08:57] <Alzi2> Hey. pseudo-transparency doesn't work in ANY app. Nor Konsole, Nor Crystal (kwin theme) wants to display pseudo-transparency. If I try to enable it and I click OK, when I check back, transparency is still not on... it's annoying. I want proper pseudo-transparency. Anyone?
[08:58] <itstaff> hi all do you know how to disable a script from starting at boot time
[08:58] <ArrenLex> Alzi2: a) proper pseudo-transparency, eh? b) How are you trying to enable it?
[08:58] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey, how do i change/add screensavers in xfce i cant find the menu thats usually in gnome?
[08:58] <rugbythomas> Pie-rate thank you, I knew it had to be something easy
[08:59] <GreySim> Anyone know the easiest way to reinstall Grub after installing Windows on a machine that already has Ubuntu?
[08:59] <Pie-rate> So what's a good movie player for gnome?
[08:59] <tabasko> vlc
[08:59] <DARKGuy> mnepton: Eh, it didn't work actually :(
[09:00] <rebuilt> vlc
[09:00] <ArrenLex> !grub | GreySim
[09:00] <ubotu> GreySim: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[09:00] <GreySim> Thanks.
[09:00] <Alzi2> ArrenLex: I mean, working transparency which displays the wallpaper you set, b) By checking 'transparent' in Crystal and selecting the 'Konsole transparent' profile in Konsole, then check the box of transparency in the settings, after which the box is STILL not checked.
[09:01] <jumble> question: how do i add a directory to the path?
[09:02] <tommy> How can I mount a usb hard drive?
[09:02] <tommy> From the cli.

[09:03] <Alzi2> tommy: mkdir /mnt/usbdrive; mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usbdrive; cd /mnt/usbdrive
[09:03] <tommy> i did sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/disk
[09:03] <Alzi2> as root
[09:03] <NuKe_MaNia> how  can install my sound card
[09:03] <tommy> i did
[09:03] <tommy> it says specify the filesystem
[09:03] <tommy> which i have no idea how or what it is
[09:03] <Alzi2> tommy: Then the disk is empty, and with empty, i mean no structure of the harddrive.. (no partitions and stuff)
[09:03] <black_13_> where the hell is xorgconfig?
[09:03] <abes> ArrenLex: http://www.intechent.ca/sources.txt -> sorry for the delay... ;)

[09:04] <ArrenLex> Nice.
[09:04] <rebuilt> its in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:05] <tommy> Is there a way to determine the fs type?
[09:05] <ArrenLex> abes: tell you what. Rather than doing that, just try the command "aptitude -t dapper install firefox"

[09:08] <crys> tommy: have you tried -tvfat
[09:08] <abes> ArrenLex: do u still need the sources file or can I knock it out of my FTP?
[09:08] <rebuilt> tommy: put a space between -t and vfat
[09:08] <tommy> Okay....wow
[09:08] <tommy> I tried it at usbfs
[09:08] <chester> wanna chat w?me??
[09:09] <tommy> for some reason, and that is totally wrong
[09:09] <ArrenLex> abes: considering the link you gave me doesn't even work, I think I can safely say it's not very useful to me :)
[09:09] <abes> ArrenLex: how come the link doesnt work!?!?!
[09:09] <ArrenLex> abes: hell if I know.

[09:10] <NuKe_MaNia> nobody help me HOW I CAN CONFIGURE MY SOUND CARD ( NO SOUND )
[09:11] <Flannel> !sound | NuKe_MaNia
[09:11] <ubotu> NuKe_MaNia: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[09:11] <Alzi2> NuKe_MaNia: What you just said, was 'Please, nobody help me configuring my sound card"
[09:11] <tommy> I am an idiot.
[09:11] <abes> ArrenLex: I know.... just no time to upgrade... :p
[09:11] <ArrenLex> abes: but sufficient time to fool around with old versions of FF? xD
[09:11] <tommy> See, I don't have a GUi.
[09:11] <Alzi2> tommy: We know :D
[09:11] <tommy> On my desktop, so I can't mount it.
[09:11] <abes> ArrenLex: Ill do it later... need to get the browser running (BTW -> unable to create `./usr/lib/firefox/libgfxpsshar.so': No such file or directory)
[09:11] <tommy> But I have a laptop right here...
[09:11] <tommy> And...
[09:12] <tommy> I never even thought about mounting it on this.
[09:12] <tommy> :)
[09:12] <abes> ArrenLex: actually... can i get FF2.0 thru any repository
[09:12] <abes> ArrenLex: ?
[09:12] <ArrenLex> abes: The problem is that little dot at the beginning.
[09:12] <Flannel> abes: Not in dapper, no.
[09:12] <ArrenLex> abes: yes you can. Edgy.
[09:12] <Alzi2> tommy: http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/youare.php
[09:12] <chester> hi arrenlex
[09:12] <ArrenLex> abes: if you want ff1.5, I suggest downloading it from the mozilla people, because the ubuntu package appears to be botched.
[09:13] <abes> ArrenLex: ok... so how do i upgrade to edgy?
[09:13] <ArrenLex> chester: hi chester. o_o
[09:13] <chester> asl pls?
[09:13] <ArrenLex> abes: Well, that's a difficult question to answer. It depends on how comfortable you are with fixing a broken system.
[09:13] <black_13_> rebuilt it isnt
[09:13] <ArrenLex> chester: Uh... the AOL preteen date chatroom is three doors over.
[09:13] <mordof> alright, so i'm trying to wine install photoshop cs2.. i've heard about people getting photoshop to work.. i get through the entire installation, however when i click install.. it fails and says nothing changed, then finished.. anyone experienced this? possibly have a solution?
[09:13] <tommy> Alzi2, I'm proud.
[09:14] <tommy> Now how do I find out what filesystem this is?
[09:14] <chester> cnxa sa ds2rbo ha?? bz??
[09:14] <tommy> Having it mounted automatically now by the wm.
[09:14] <ArrenLex> mordof: the wine appdb seems to indicate Photoshop CS will not work.
[09:14] <CoRnJuLiOx> i've got epiphany, and whenever i try to play a video it opens up xfmedia. how do i get it to open up something else, like mplayer? xfmedia doesn't work right
[09:15] <mordof> ArrenLex: Franks wine app thing has it running :S odd
[09:15] <abes> ArrenLex: hmmm... I am veeery new to Ubuntu... so I think I am not too comfortable with fixing a "broken system"... but on the other hand... I am willing to experiment :P
[09:15] <Flannel> mordof: you might try #winehq
[09:15] <Rob-West> can someone help me change Xchat colors
[09:15] <mordof> chester: unknown, always, i'm in your base eating all your food.
[09:15] <Rob-West> so like all the text is white and the background is black
[09:15] <chester> mordof??
[09:15] <mordof> lol
[09:16] <mordof> you asked asl - that's my response
=== siXy is now known as siXy-isn
[09:16] <ArrenLex> mordof: ah, so it does. Hell if I know.
[09:16] <ArrenLex> mordof: ah, actually, look at the wine version they're running. 0.9.8.
[09:16] <black_13_> rebuilt so you dont have anything useful to offer?
[09:16] <mordof> ArrenLex: hmm.. that's old?
[09:16] <ArrenLex> mordof: it's a well-known fact that nothing ever works in Wine for more than three versions at a time.
[09:16] <ArrenLex> mordof: yes it is. But you should try it.
[09:17] <chester> arrenlex from wer u from
[09:17] <jimmy20013> I upgraded from breezy to edgy using the distro-upgrade option in apt-get and now the Xserver is broken. It doesn't give me any error message, just Xserver failed to start. How do I reconfigure Xserver?
[09:17] <mordof> ArrenLex: repos have 0.9.9... i'm no good at compiling wine to work, lol
[09:17] <ArrenLex> !offtopic | chester
[09:17] <ubotu> chester: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[09:17] <ArrenLex> mordof: try 0.9.9, then, I guess.
[09:17] <XiXaQ> Can I use a webpage as a desktop background in ubuntu?
[09:17] <ArrenLex> mordof: although compiling wine is super easy.
[09:18] <mordof> jimmy20013: that's a huge jump.. gtk gets entirely updated, i wouldn't be suprised if you had to do a fresh install
[09:18] <co_cool> allow
[09:18] <caspar> hello

[09:18] <tommy> Anyone? Filesystem detection?
[09:18] <co_cool> pa kabar

[09:18] <jimmy20013> Flannel:Yeah

[09:19] <caspar> and i don't know where on
[09:19] <jimmy20013> Flannel: How can I salvage it?
[09:19] <mordof> ArrenLex: if i need to compile it to try would you be able to help me out if i run into any problems?
[09:19] <Flannel> mm2000: reboot, select "recovery console" in grub menu
[09:19] <ArrenLex> mordof: I could certainly try.
[09:19] <mm2000> Flannel: ok, thanks
[09:19] <chester> ubuntu rule
[09:19] <Flannel> jimmy20013: well, your first question, reconfiguring.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:19] <ArrenLex> mordof: Actually, no, because I kind of have to slep.
[09:19] <chester> cge pls try
[09:19] <ArrenLex> ep.
[09:20] <caspar> where can i see where firefox is crashing on?
[09:20] <jimmy20013> Flannel: Already tried it and it says xserver-xorg is broken or not installed
[09:21] <caspar> i think it has something to do with flash
[09:21] <Flannel> jimmy20013: well, that would be a good reason as to why it's not working then.  Try... reinstalling it.  You might want to use aptitude, the GUIs a lot nicer to those who aren't entirely sure what theyre doing via apt-get
[09:21] <jimmy20013> I am going to remove the old xserver and try reinstalling it
[09:21] <tommy> Ok, apparently my laptop mounted it as vfat.
[09:21] <Flannel> jimmy20013: remember to purge it

[09:30] <caspar> coz_: i don't know, but this just happend today, and i didn't change annything today
[09:30] <ArrenLex> British.
[09:30] <tommy> Now I need to mount this damned disc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:30] <caspar> coz_: it also happens on www.misfile.com
[09:31] <ArrenLex> abes: grab this with the "wget" command: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-1.5.0.8&os=linux&lang=en-GB
[09:31] <caspar> coz_: i also reinstalled firefox befor i got here
[09:31] <mordof> DARKGuy: yeah, i'm in dapper.. i just installed the wine repo and am getting the updated one from there
[09:31] <poningru> whats wrong?
[09:31] <Inez> what is hi
[09:31] <Inez> what is the tool to enable and disabled services (from init.d) on ubuntu
[09:31] <tommy> I need helps.
[09:31] <coz_> caspar, oepn up a terminal and open firefox there, then go to the page that made it crash and see if any errors have been written
[09:31] <DARKGuy> mordof: Ah, you're right - my repos come from the winehq xD;
[09:31] <Inez> and how can I allow some user to start and stop tomcat?
[09:32] <Pie-rate> they're probably crawling into my brain and breeding there
[09:32] <poningru> Inez: add them as an alias to sudo and then add that command as another alias
[09:32] <Pie-rate> at least they'll probably install linux...
[09:32] <poningru> and then enable that alias
[09:32] <abes> ArrenLex: it's an .exe though....
[09:32] <tommy> Oh screw it.
[09:32] <tommy> I've got a better idea.
[09:32] <poningru> Inez: just search for sudo
[09:32] <ArrenLex> abes: I don't see how it could be o_O os=linux is right there in the URL.
[09:32] <Spee_Der> !wacom
[09:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wacom - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:32] <poningru> tommy: whats wrong?
[09:32] <tommy> LiveCD into Edgy, mount the damned usb disk, mount the damned hard drive.
[09:32] <ArrenLex> Hold up..
[09:33] <tommy> And transfer the data from that.
[09:33] <tommy> :)
[09:33] <DARKGuy> Hm, I have two X servers (kinda, it's just a dual monitor setup without xinerama) so I *think* they should be :0.0 and :0.1, or something like that. What would I need to do for taking a screenshot of both monitors? (like, a widescreen screenshot?)
[09:33] <vaporglow> Does anybody have any advice for a complete 'nix newbie?
[09:33] <Inez> poningru I know what is sudo, but wehat if I want to start and stop tomcat from eclipse?
[09:33] <caspar> coz_: serial 118 error_code 8 Request_code 143 minor_code 3
[09:33] <Inez> poningru and what about remove tomcat from auto startup?
[09:33] <ArrenLex> abes: oh, you forgot quotes. Just grab this: http://ftp-mozilla.netscape.com/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5.0.8/linux-i686/en-GB/firefox-1.5.0.8.tar.gz
[09:33] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: read, inform yourself as much as you can, learn a lot, experiment, and ask when you don't know ;)
[09:33] <tommy> poningru, I cannot mount a usb hard drive from the command line.
[09:33] <abes> ArrenLex: yeah... seemed weird.... dont they have ftp mirror?
[09:33] <tommy> I screwed up my install badly.
[09:33] <caspar> coz_: Gecko recieved an X Window system error
[09:34] <caspar> :|
[09:34] <abes> ArrenLex: yeah... tar.gz seems more useful ;]  thanks!
[09:34] <poningru> Inez: just go to /etc/init.d and remove the tomcat from there
[09:34] <mordof> DARKGuy: hmmm.. print screen only takes one X instance at a time?
[09:34] <coz_> caspar, well we have an error and now we have to find what it means, unless someoneknows it by looking at it you may have to google the problem...
[09:34] <poningru> or better would be to uncomment it from rc
[09:34] <ArrenLex> abes: the link above points to this .tar.gz; you just needed quotes, but wahtever.
[09:34] <DARKGuy> mordof: Ah, I forgot to mention, I have XFCE
[09:34] <abes> ArrenLex: ok... got it :
[09:34] <poningru> but I would just move it to a folder called /etc/noninit or something
[09:34] <jimmy20013> Flannel: Thanks for the help. It is working now
[09:34] <coz_> keep that error  visible and try asking with that error, or goggle that error and see what comes up
[09:35] <DARKGuy> mordof: I tried import -window root img.jpg, but it only takes the first screen
[09:35] <Inez> poningru Is it enought to -x on it (chmod)?
[09:35] <abes> ArrenLex: should i just copy the content to specific folder or should I make it?
[09:35] <luke_> sup folks.  Quick question.  I'm installing themes from gnome-look.org, but I'm not quite sure what the difference between Metacity, Cgwd/Emerald, and GTK2 are, or which I'm using.  Anyone mind explaining please?
[09:35] <mordof> DARKGuy: would there possibly be another command for import to make it span? i dunno i'm not really experienced enough to know that
[09:35] <poningru> Inez: it is enough but it will throw a bunch of errors at startup and will give you slower boot time
[09:35] <nrdb> newbie question, how do I print the output of a terminal command ? where do I pipe it ?
[09:35] <ArrenLex> abes: copy it to /opt, I think.
[09:36] <DARKGuy> mordof: I dunno
[09:36] <poningru> nrdb: what do you mean print? as in the printer?
[09:36] <coz_> DARKGuy, usually you just hit the print screen button... what happens when you do that?
[09:36] <nrdb> poningru: yes
[09:36] <DARKGuy> coz_: nothing
[09:36] <abes> ArrenLex: ok done...
[09:36] <ArrenLex> abes: Yeah, copy it to /opt/firefox-1.5 or something, and then link /usr/bin/firefox1.5 or whatever to /opt/firefox-1.5/firefox
[09:36] <coz_> DARKGuy, mmm   you have ati... and....mmm I am stuck again with that ati thingy... how did you get dual monitor set up?
[09:37] <ArrenLex> That way you can use more than version of Firefox.
[09:37] <abes> ArrenLex: i copied firefox to /opt
[09:37] <coz_> DARKGuy, wait nvidia or ati?
[09:37] <abes> ArrenLex: do i need to include the 1.5?
[09:37] <ArrenLex> abes: you can use whatever names you want.
[09:37] <DARKGuy> coz_: I have nVIDIA Gf4 Ti 4200 and a Trident 9660 PCI... but eh, I could give you my X.org config just so you see? o.o
[09:38] <coz_> DARKGuy,  sorry i was thinking of someone else... ok and how did youget dual monitor set up?  thorugh the nvidia settings?
[09:38] <abes> ArrenLex: what was the link command again?
[09:38] <abes> ArrenLex: ln -s ?
[09:38] <keegan_> So you have the the 4200 in the AGP slot and the Trident in the PCI slot?
[09:38] <DARKGuy> coz_: Nope, googling a lot :P
[09:38] <DARKGuy> keegan_: yep
[09:38] <ArrenLex> abe: sudo ln -s /opt/firefox-1.5/firefox /usr/bin/
[09:38] <coz_> DARKGuy, well dual monitor set up is right in nvidia settings using "twinview"
[09:38] <Pie-rate> what's the best way to move files between my linux laptop and windows desktop?
[09:38] <keegan_> DARKGuy: Wow I never thought of that lol.  I always thought one could would shut off the other.
[09:38] <DARKGuy> coz_: Actually, I just set up two screens in xorg.conf, then in the server layour I place one to the left and other to the right, and relate their positions
[09:39] <DARKGuy> coz_: *layout
[09:39] <ArrenLex> pie_rate: samba.
[09:39] <ArrenLex> !samba | Pie-rate
[09:39] <ubotu> Pie-rate: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[09:39] <[reed] > hmm, why are we talking about Firefox 1.5 here? I just opened this window.
[09:39] <[reed] > 1.5 is old
[09:39] <DARKGuy> coz_: Ah, interesting :P twinview here only works with a CRT, and I have no TV :P
[09:39] <[reed] > use Firefox 2.0 :)
[09:39] <ArrenLex> [reed]  abes is running Firefox 1.5 on Dapper.
[09:39] <coz_> DARKGuy, ok.. wel can  you paste the xorg file anyway.. maye i will see something... if not others can look at it as well
[09:39] <mordof> coz_: twinview will work when the second display is a different adapter?
[09:39] <[reed] > well, he should upgrade
[09:39] <DARKGuy> keegan_: Nope, not at all. you can't have two AGP devices though, but you can have an AGP and a PCI one, but take note that the PCI one will be the one to boot first
[09:39] <abes> [reed] : well I will.... :P
[09:39] <ArrenLex> [reed] : I think he lost his bifocals so he can't jab the keyboard with his arthritic fingers to upgrade.
[09:39] <coz_> DARKGuy, no I have two monitor both lcd and I use twinview
[09:40] <pradeepvglughyd> my monitor runs fine at 85 Hz in windows i am not able to view it  at 85 Hz in Ubuntu anyone tell me what frequencies do i give on my xorg.conf i have a 15'' monitor
[09:40] <[reed] > hah
[09:40] <mordof> DARKGuy: that all depends on the bios
[09:40] <DARKGuy> mordof: Well, mostly :P
[09:40] <[reed] > Firefox 2.0.0.1 and Firefox 1.5.0.9 should be out in December (middle of the month or so).
[09:40] <mordof> coz_: but are they plugged into 2 devices and not just 1 with 2 spots?
[09:40] <keegan_> What Xinerama?
[09:40] <keegan_> about*
[09:40] <[reed] > just fyi
[09:40] <DARKGuy> coz_: o_O I was about to ask what mordof asked
[09:40] <coz_> DARKGuy, is this a dula head card or 2 separte cards??
[09:40] <coz_> dual
[09:40] <mordof> coz_: 2 cards
[09:40] <DARKGuy> coz_: two separate cards
[09:41] <DARKGuy> coz_: an nVIDIA and a Trident
[09:41] <coz_> DARKGuy, OH!  mmm
[09:41] <MeisterZopf> is there a way to use 3 monitors on 2 graphic cards and still be able to use 3d accelleration?
[09:41] <nessumsaR> can anyone else me get the resolution of 1680x1050? I tried to edit the xorg.conf file but it told me I didn't have access
[09:41] <mordof> coz_: twinview is nvidia internal.. i doubt it works with a secondary card
[09:41] <DARKGuy> MeisterZopf: Windows does it, so Linux can, I think
[09:41] <pradeepvglughyd> my monitor runs fine at 85 Hz in windows i am not able to view it  at 85 Hz in Ubuntu anyone tell me what frequencies do i give on my xorg.conf i have a 15'' monitor
[09:41] <DARKGuy> pradeepvglughyd: you'll have to use a modeline editor
[09:41] <coz_> mordof, you may be right... I won't argue with you since I don't really know lol
[09:41] <MeisterZopf> DARKGuy, awesome answer
[09:41] <abes> ArrenLex: ok... now the tricky part... i need to install plugins for java and flash to ff1.5
[09:41] <caspar> coz_: coz? can you help me with fully reinstall firefox so no addons ect with it, so also no flash player ect?
[09:41] <mordof> DARKGuy: however... keep in mind, i once had an mx420 and onboard, and i got my nvidia drivers (windows) to span the taskbar and clone and treat the onboard like it was part of it
[09:41] <DARKGuy> MeisterZopf: <.< im going to search the link :P
[09:42] <mordof> DARKGuy: i would give twinview a try anyway
[09:42] <pradeepvglughyd> DARKGuy,wht is modeline editor how do i get it
[09:42] <MeisterZopf> twinview can't handle 2 devices afaik
[09:42] <mordof> DARKGuy: twinview may act similar to the windows version drivers in that aspect, it may not.. i can't say at all how it might
[09:42] <coz_> caspar, you may be better off asking someone else... only because it is 3:42am FOR ME AND i HAVEN'T SLEPT.. SO i WILL MAKE MISTAKES .. SORRY GUY
[09:42] <nessumsaR> how do i get the resolution of 1680x1050 @ 60Hz?
[09:42] <ArrenLex> abes: apt-get install sun-java5-plugin
[09:42] <coz_> and sorry people for the accidental caps lock although it kinda fit!
[09:43] <DARKGuy> pradeepvglughyd:  http://www.bohne-lang.de/spec/linux/modeline/ there. You just choose your resolution and refresh rate, then add the generated line (last one) inside the Monitor section at the end, just before EndSection
[09:43] <caspar> ok, can someone help me reinstalling firefox, so firefox has no addons when i restart it, all setings reseted ect?
[09:43] <ArrenLex> abes: tell me when that's done; you'll probably have to do some fancy symlinking.
[09:43] <DARKGuy> pradeepvglughyd: Choose wisely and use at your own risk though. I had to do the same with this interlaced monitor :/
[09:43] <caspar> coz_: i think your capslock is on ;-)
[09:43] <nessumsaR> caspar you can remove addons and change settings
[09:43] <coz_> caspar, one simple thing you can do is go to synaptic and look for firefox and click on it and check reinstall
[09:43] <ArrenLex> caspar: temporarily or permanently?
[09:43] <mordof> DARKGuy: zomg no support for widescreen
[09:43] <caspar> coz_: i reinstalled it that way
[09:43] <pradeepvglughyd> DARKGuy, thanks for that
[09:43] <DARKGuy> coz_: mordof: k, let me see the twinview
[09:43] <ArrenLex> caspar: temporarily: start firefox in -safe-mode. Permanently: delete ~/.mozilla
[09:44] <DARKGuy> pradeepvglughyd: Anytime :)
[09:44] <coz_> caspar,  see i told you i couldn't help!!! lol
[09:44] <caspar> coz_: i still had the error
[09:44] <Pie-rate> how do i get ubuntu to accept sftp connections?
[09:44] <Spee_Der> Well, dang. That didn't work either.....
[09:44] <caspar> ArrenLex: i need to delete firefox, then reinstall it
[09:44] <Spee_Der> Hi DARK....
[09:44] <nessumsaR> someone must know how to get widescreen resolutions
[09:44] <DARKGuy> hey Spee_Der
[09:44] <ArrenLex> caspar: try deleting ~/.mozilla first. That will probably fix you
[09:44] <abes> ArrenLex: quick question... once i have all the plugins i need in ff1.5 will they be automatically linked to 2.0 when i upgrade?
[09:44] <DARKGuy> coz_: wait, the twinview is in the nVIDIA X Server Settings? oO
[09:44] <mordof> DARKGuy: it's been a very long time since i used it, and i only used it in ubuntu with a dual head card capable.. so i can't say at all how it may react
[09:45] <Spee_Der> DARK I'm messing with the 2nd monitor and still not able to resize the bloody thing.....
[09:45] <keegan_> nessumsar: have tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[09:45] <ArrenLex> abes: depends how you link them. if you put them into your home directory, yes.
[09:45] <coz_> DARKGuy, mm
[09:45] <Spee_Der> But it fun trying though !
[09:45] <mordof> DARKGuy: in your xorg you may have to do somethin funky, heh
[09:45] <DARKGuy> mordof: ah... well, I don't think it'll work with this trident :/ in Windows it doesn't, at least
[09:45] <caspar> ArrenLex: no still have the problem
[09:45] <mordof> DARKGuy: oh in windows it doesn't work with the trident card?
[09:45] <ArrenLex> caspar: apt-get install --reinstall firefox
[09:45] <DARKGuy> mordof: Nope :P
[09:45] <nrdb> where do I pipe the stdout of a program for it to print (on paper) ?
[09:45] <coz_> DARKGuy, it isan't permanent unless you save it to xorg only for the session
[09:45] <DARKGuy> mordof: it's a 4Mb card :/
[09:45] <mordof> DARKGuy: i'd pretty much say it's a no-go then :P haha..
[09:46] <abes> ArrenLex: wtf.... unable to create `./usr/lib/firefox/libgfxpsshar.so': No such file or directory -> thats what i got while installing java plugin :P
[09:46] <mordof> DARKGuy: if windows nvidia drivers won't do it, linux drivers won't either... as much as i like linux it can only do so much in some aspects
[09:46] <ArrenLex> *blink*
[09:46] <babo> is there any P2P TV for linux ?
[09:46] <coz_> DARKGuy, you can try the twinview f it screws up it reverts back after 10 seconds
[09:46] <babo> not that crappy one ...
[09:46] <ArrenLex> abes: Oh. Okay. apt-get remove --purge firefox.
[09:46] <mordof> coz_: erm.. no it doesn't :P that's normal resolution
[09:46] <coz_> DARKGuy,  just don't hit save to xorg
[09:46] <caspar> ArrenLex: still have the problem
[09:46] <babo> I mean something with sports games etc ...
[09:46] <mordof> coz_: ah ok
[09:46] <ArrenLex> caspar: then something's really wrong with your system.
[09:47] <caspar> ArrenLex: i think i need to have flash removed aswell
[09:47] <coz_> mordof, if you make a change in the settings it gives you 10 seconds and then it revierts for me
[09:47] <DARKGuy> coz_: I see
[09:47] <caspar> ArrenLex: becouse i can brows
[09:47] <DARKGuy> coz_: Might give it a try :P
[09:47] <mordof> coz_: even if you totally re-write your xorg.conf?
[09:47] <ArrenLex> abes: Oh. You're going to have big problems... sun-java5-plugin depends on firefox.
[09:47] <caspar> ArrenLex: browse*
[09:47] <abes> ArrenLex: loll... Package firefox is not installed, so not removed
[09:47] <mordof> coz_: because that's what twinview with multiple cards will take..
[09:47] <coz_> DARKGuy, don't save to xorg file just test it
[09:47] <ArrenLex> Yeah.
[09:47] <ArrenLex> abes: okay, let's try this first... apt-get install sun-java5-bin
[09:48] <DARKGuy> Okay, before that...
[09:48] <ArrenLex> abes: i386-compatible arch, right?
[09:48] <DARKGuy> coz_: mordof: Spee_Der: keegan_ : my X.org: http://pastebin.ca/262221
[09:48] <abes> ArrenLex: im on i686
[09:48] <abes> ArrenLex: if thats what ur asking

[09:49] <coz_> DARKGuy, oh you are using xinerama
[09:49] <ArrenLex> abes: come again?
[09:50] <DARKGuy> coz_: Not right now, but it can, too

[09:52] <DARKGuy> Pie-rate: I want your WoW data :P
[09:52] <nrdb> what is the name of the program that puts up a dialog requester from a bash script ?
[09:53] <mordof> Pie-rate: WoW data?
[09:53] <DARKGuy> mordof: whoah, I didn't know his spamming could cause that -.-'
[09:53] <Pie-rate> world of warcraft
[09:53] <mordof> DARKGuy: yeah
[09:53] <coz_> DARKGuy, I am not sure what to say right now .. honest I am tired.. but even if I wsn't I may not know what to do... what I would probably do is revert back to original xorg.. try twin view soo if it works"by testing" only... but that is up to you sorry i couldn't be of more help
[09:53] <ArrenLex> nrdb: on gnome, zenity. On KDE, kdialog.
[09:53] <mordof> Pie-rate: ah - i dropped that a bit ago, took up too much of my time
[09:53] <caspar> ArrenLex: shall i give you the link?
[09:53] <mnepton> jono: you think you're better than me?
[09:53] <vaporglow> i wish that there was X-Fi support already
[09:53] <ArrenLex> caspar: I don't read French either, my man.
[09:53] <nrdb> ArrenLex: thanks
[09:53] <coz_> see not soo
[09:53] <jono> mnepton, hehe
[09:53] <mordof> DARKGuy: so does /exec -o cat /dev/urandom :P haha
[09:53] <Pie-rate> yeah, it can do that
[09:53] <DARKGuy> coz_: that's okay, it's another alternative and I think it could work
[09:53] <abes> ArrenLex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34925/
[09:53] <DARKGuy> mordof: Lol
[09:53] <coz_> DARKGuy,  can't hurt to try!
[09:53] <TheCarl> does anybody know how to boot up fdisk?
[09:54] <mordof> DARKGuy: it should go away shortly after
[09:54] <ArrenLex> abes: Oh, you have old packages kicking around. Run apt-get remove sun-java5-plugin
=== TheCarl is now known as CarlU
[09:54] <caspar> annyone here who understands french and wants to help me? :D
[09:54] <DARKGuy> mordof: I hope so :P
[09:54] <ArrenLex> abes: tell me when you're done.
[09:54] <coz_> TheCarl, SORRY i DON'T SOMEONE HERE DOES KNOW

[09:54] <coz_> darn capslock... Ok i am defiantely tired i am on my way... have a good one all] 
[09:54] <ArrenLex> Caspar, someone in !ubuntu-fr might be able to help you.
[09:54] <ArrenLex> #ubuntu-fr
[09:55] <caspar> ArrenLex: yes, but then you need to talk french issent that so?:P
[09:55] <ArrenLex> caspar: well, someone's bound to know both.
[09:55] <eloquence_> sup everybody
[09:55] <keegan_> Most European countries speak their native language and english
[09:55] <abes> ArrenLex: ok done...
[09:55] <keegan_> I dunno about france though
[09:55] <liza> hey guys.. do you know anything about this crazy thing called ubuntU?
[09:55] <mordof> caspar: do you need someone to respond to that post or something?
[09:55] <eloquence_> I need some help with the internet... I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 6.06 and my lppie can find a wireless network and connect to it but thats it
[09:55] <caspar> no
[09:55] <ArrenLex> abes: okay, now I'm going to give you your own personal -abes package. This package is your very own. Don't give it to other people because it will give them problems.
[09:55] <ArrenLex> abes: This is a prescription package.
[09:56] <caspar> i need someone to translate it for me mordof
[09:56] <ArrenLex> abes: http://arrenlex.diff.be/sun-java5-plugin-abes_1.5.0-08-0ubuntu1_i386.deb
[09:56] <mordof> keegan_: not alot of people in france speak english
[09:56] <eloquence_> it doesn't go to any sites and cant ping anything
[09:56] <caspar> mordof: i have exact the same problem ;-)
[09:56] <mordof> keegan_: not the average person anyway
[09:56] <ArrenLex> abes: download it and install it with dpkg -i sun-java5-plugin-abes_1.5.0-08-0ubuntu1_i386.deb
[09:56] <keegan_> If you can't read a website because of language...have you tried google translate
[09:56] <eloquence_> less ppl in america speak french
[09:56] <mordof> caspar: i could vaguely find out the vague idea of what's goin on.. but i can't translate it perfectly
[09:57] <mordof> i'm canadian - i should know... but.. meh
[09:57] <keegan_> Not even with google website translation?
[09:57] <keegan_> Do they have French to English?
[09:58] <keegan_> Yep they have french to english
[09:58] <DARKGuy> keegan_: for some languages you don't need much of google translation, unless you want to fully understand it, for example I can get an idea of portuguese and french because of my native spanish, and a bit of german due to my english
[09:58] <abes> ArrenLex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34927/
[09:58] <caspar> mordof: i need to reinstall flash i think
[09:58] <mordof> it's just like understanding programming, lol
[09:58] <ArrenLex> Oh god.
[09:58] <keegan_> I just know english :(
[09:58] <DARKGuy> mordof: Lol, kinda
[09:58] <ArrenLex> abes: Sorry. xD I pulled it from edgy. A moment.
[09:58] <abes> ArrenLex: ;] 
[09:58] <mordof> once you know enough general knowledge about how languages work n stuff... you should be able to pick up any related language and figure out the general idea of what's going on, heh
[09:59] <james> I have written the resolution I wanted to xorg.conf but it seems i still don't have the res and i've restarted.
[09:59] <keegan_> I tried spanish, didn't work out too well
[09:59] <Pie-rate> how do i change the default player for dvds from totem to vlc?
[09:59] <mordof> james: what video card are you on?
[09:59] <james> X1900XT
[09:59] <Pie-rate> nice
[09:59] <mordof> alright then, not what i can help with, heh
[09:59] <DARKGuy> keegan_: spanish is like english, the thing isthe order of the  adjectives, subjects, and such. Once you dominate that, then it becomes easy ;)
=== eloquence_ is now known as eloque
[10:00] <Pie-rate> james: you going to fold with that?
[10:00] <james> fold with a video card?
[10:00] <Pie-rate> yes
[10:00] <mordof> nice card though
[10:00] <mordof> are you gpu folding on it!?
[10:00] <mordof> everyone in here should be folding, lol
[10:00] <mordof> (team 33 if you're not - start now)
[10:00] <mordof> soo much power
[10:00] <james> i don't fold heh
[10:00] <Pie-rate> BLASPHEMY. team 32 for the win.
[10:00] <mordof> pfft, team 33 is top
[10:01] <james> and if i did it probably would be for xtremesystems or anandtech
[10:01] <keegan_> fold for the [h] orde
[10:01] <Pie-rate> ocforums owns you!
[10:01] <ArrenLex> abes: actually, there's a better way to do this.
[10:01] <mordof> DARKGuy: folding@home.. protein folding research
[10:01] <vaporglow> newbie question: I plan on switching from xp to either ubuntu linux or some variant of freebsd.  since im using xp right now, unsurprisingly my HDDs are formatted NTFS. when my live cd iso finishes downloading, and i boot the disc, what will my HDDs show up as? at all? read-only?
[10:01] <DARKGuy> mordof: Ah!
[10:01] <ArrenLex> abes: does the file "/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so" exist?
[10:01] <mordof> eloque: do you have a static IP?
[10:01] <DARKGuy> mordof: thanks :P
[10:01] <mordof> eloque: if so did you define the DNS addresses?
[10:01] <james> i want to fix this resolution problem than go to sleep have to wake up at 4:40 and it's 1:01
[10:02] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: Nope, you'll have to add them editing the fstab, but that should not be a problem if you can come back here :)
[10:02] <keegan_> james: does your monitor support your resolution you set?
[10:02] <abes> ArrenLex: yes
[10:02] <mordof> DARKGuy: team 33 :P
[10:02] <james> yes, i run 1680x1050 in windows
[10:02] <DARKGuy> mordof: got it xD
[10:02] <Pie-rate> team 32.
[10:02] <ArrenLex> abes: brilliant! ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so ~/.mozilla/plugins
[10:02] <First|Laptop> vaporglow: you will have to resize your windows partition(s) to make room for linux on that drive(s)
[10:02] <ArrenLex> (as normal user, abes)
[10:02] <eloque> i dony have a static ip
[10:02] <mordof> DARKGuy: team 33 is the winning team
[10:02] <ArrenLex> abes: that should be sufficient.
[10:03] <mordof> Pie-rate: which is team 32? is that the aussies
[10:03] <eloque> its a cafe i go to ... a wireless internet cafe
[10:03] <Pie-rate> don't just blindly join whatever team is winning...
[10:03] <eloque> since at home i can only use wireless dialup
[10:03] <First|Laptop> vaporglow: ubuntu automatically mounts all your windows drives so you can access the files
[10:03] <james> after i changed the settings i restarted x logged back in and it still didn't have the option.
[10:03] <mordof> Pie-rate: i didn't, i read hardocp daily and a friend is folding for them too
[10:03] <Pie-rate> team 32 is ocforums.com
[10:03] <mordof> ahh
[10:03] <DARKGuy> ack
[10:03] <mordof> you're 3rd aren't you?
[10:03] <Pie-rate> i think so
[10:03] <DARKGuy> How do I remove the pc speaker from the devices permanently :/ ?
[10:03] <keegan_> james: have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:03] <caspar> ok, can someone help me re-install flash in firefox
[10:03] <Pie-rate> might be 2nd
[10:03] <Pie-rate> cant remember
[10:04] <eloque> i'm currently residing in saudi arabia and there aint much saudis here that know linux... and i haven't found any other americans that can help so i am kind of in a nutshell
[10:04] <DARKGuy> Mom's gonna kill me if this thing keeps beeping
[10:04] <Pie-rate> lol
[10:04] <james> keegan_: no, what does that do? I am a linux noob
[10:04] <vaporglow> oh, im not installing to this system, not without backups of files. just previewing. ill probably get an old pc to install on until im comfortable with linux enough that i dont have to wory about hosing my main box
[10:04] <mordof> Pie-rate: i also made a php app that made a graph of computing power through the entire folding project.. it grabbed the website and parsed it all - because that info isn't in the DB
[10:05] <First|Laptop> vaporglow: ok. there's a large faq in the ubuntu wiki that will help you out when you do.
[10:05] <caspar> ArrenLex: van you help me re-install flash?
[10:05] <keegan_> james: its setting up your xserver again.  so you pick what videocard, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and resolutions all in a little selection thing in the terminal
[10:05] <keegan_> james: then after that just restart x and hope it follow the settings you provided
[10:05] <eloque> any ideas mordof?
[10:05] <ArrenLex> caspar: rm ~/.mozilla/plugins/*flash* && sudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-nonfree
[10:05] <james> keegan_: thanks
[10:06] <keegan_> casper: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[10:06] <james> what x server drive should i use for a ATi X1900XT?
[10:06] <slicky> hey.. iv installed a win game with wine.. but the game says that it cant find the gamedisc, anyone know how to fix this?
[10:06] <mordof> Pie-rate: you said not to blindly join, why did you join your team?
[10:06] <vaporglow> is there any consensus on what the best file system format for HDDs are if you plan on dual booting linux and xp?
[10:06] <keegan_> james: if you installed your ati drivers then the one says ati I would presume, I've never owned an ATi card before
[10:06] <abes> ArrenLex: it doesnt work...
[10:06] <abes> ArrenLex: dont worry... ill do it myself....
[10:06] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Find what is making it beep rather than disable speaker.
[10:07] <abes> ArrenLex: I am pretty sure i can work it out...
[10:07] <ArrenLex> vaporglow: You must have Windows on an NTFS partition and strongly suggested to have Linux on ext3, with a third fat32 partition for sharing files.
[10:07] <Pie-rate> i joined team32 because i frequent ocforums.com
[10:07] <abes> ArrenLex: thanks for all the help :] 
[10:07] <keegan_> Its the man trapped in the speakers
[10:07] <ArrenLex> abes: I hope so, as I ahve to go :)
[10:07] <ArrenLex> Good luck!
[10:07] <mordof> Pie-rate: yeah, oc is 3rd, oc Aussies are 2nd, HardOCP is 1st
[10:07] <ArrenLex> abes: no problem. Stop living in the past, man.
[10:07] <ArrenLex> The sixties are OVER.
[10:07] <EdLin> vaporglow: it doesn't matter, but if you want to access your GNU/Linux paritition from Windows you should make it ext3 (or ext2 - but it's more reliable with ext3's journaling.)
[10:07] <keegan_> HardOCP fold for the [H] orde
[10:07] <Pie-rate> i dont really fold much any more, my main box doesn't anyway, and its probably 75% of the computing power i have
[10:07] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: almost every terminal window -.-'
[10:08] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: I found how to remove it though, with xset b
[10:08] <vaporglow> okay
[10:08] <Spee_Der> Okies
[10:08] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: thanks though xD
=== _steve is now known as steve
[10:08] <mordof> keegan_: i just bought a new dual core 4200+ that both cores are gonna be folding for team 33, heh
[10:08] <ArrenLex> Wheee.
[10:08] <Pie-rate> woah...
[10:08] <vaporglow> wtf
[10:08] <Spee_Der> I'm still muckin' about with my xorg.conf for dual monitor setup.....
[10:08] <Pie-rate> what the hell?
[10:08] <mordof> keegan_: and plan on getting a new gen ati for gpu folding when it comes out as well
[10:08] <vaporglow> that was... interesting
[10:08] <james> it's asking me video card's bus identifier how do i get that?
[10:08] <Hobbsee> !netsplit
[10:08] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: What's your problem anyways?
[10:08] <Pie-rate> ooooooooook
[10:08] <Spee_Der> nice netsplit eh
[10:08] <Seveas> Hobbsee, the bots also split ;)
[10:08] <vaporglow> im so confused lol
[10:09] <keegan_> mordof: Take it the horde
[10:09] <james> keegan_: I just got a Intel E6600 @ 3.2Ghz :-) that won't be folding
[10:09] <caspar> alot of dc's :P
[10:09] <mordof> keegan_: oh it will be, heh
[10:09] <mordof> Pie-rate: was that about the netsplit? i have all joins/quits, etc ignored, hehe
[10:09] <keegan_> I have an old p3 as of now, so no folding for me either, I need all the cycles I can get
[10:09] <Hobbsee> Seveas: heh
[10:09] <mordof> james: why won't it be folding?
[10:09] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: I'm using dual head video card and I can not change the resolution for screen 1, the 2nd monitor from 640x800 to desired resolution.
[10:09] <eloque> bah... i will never be able to connect to the net from ubuntu
[10:09] <Pie-rate> yes
[10:09] <Pie-rate> it was
[10:09] <james> mordof: idk, I just don't
[10:09] <Spee_Der> No biggy though....
[10:10] <vaporglow> actually.. maybe i dont need to dual boot. the only reason i was thinking of keeping xp was for gaming. is it feasible to emulate windows for gaming successfully?
[10:10] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: I think that's fixable
[10:10] <ArrenLex> Well, goodbye, all
[10:10] <ArrenLex> *save*
[10:10] <mordof> james: but.. it's for a good cause, and you don't even notice it i promise
[10:10] <ArrenLex> vaporglow: to some extent. Check out wine and cedega.
[10:10] <keegan_> vaporglow: as of now I would keep that extra partition if you game a lot.
[10:10] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: I'm sure it is, with more study and work.....
[10:10] <mordof> james: i have 2 instances running on each for of my core duo lappy and i never notice any performance hit
[10:10] <Pie-rate> i noticed it and thats why i dont run it on my main box
[10:10] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Did you see my xorg.conf ?
[10:10] <dbe_> Which is the latest stable version of Ubuntu that is usable for serios server hosting?
[10:10] <Spee_Der> No, I did not.
[10:10] <Pie-rate> but i might just be weird
[10:10] <keegan_> vaporglow: sometimes it can be very stressful setting up games on wine
[10:10] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Okay, gimme a sec
[10:10] <Spee_Der> Ok
[10:10] <EdLin> vaporglow: there's a commercial program, cedega, that can to a certain extent. Check their website to see if it's supported first.
[10:10] <ArrenLex> Sorry, forgot my quit message:
[10:11] <EdLin> (the game)
[10:11] <james> mordof: cause i am greedy and want my system to myself :-D
[10:11] <mordof> james: all 1% of it?
[10:11] <mordof> james: cause that's on average what you will use :P
[10:11] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: I agree with keegan_ , hell, I can't even play CS 1.6 no-steam :( WoW works, Furcadia works, Tibia works (natively!) UT2004 works, NFSU works (kinda), Diablo II has issues installing but it works... it depends
[10:11] <vaporglow> hmmm
[10:11] <Pie-rate> if you game as much as i do you probably use 50% of your computing power
[10:11] <mordof> DARKGuy: diablo 2 is in the gold list, it works and installs flawlessly
[10:11] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: and it can be very, very frustrating :(
[10:11] <mordof> DARKGuy: what version of wine are you using?
[10:12] <EdLin> vaporglow: learn to play enigma and nethack. :)
[10:12] <Zoomba> hello
[10:12] <DARKGuy> mordof: weird. 0.9.26. It just hangs before copying the files :/ and does nothing
[10:12] <cyzie> dsnyders, there? still hdd error ?
[10:12] <Zoomba> what image should i download for IA64?
[10:12] <DARKGuy> mordof: it worked with wine 0.9.X though
[10:12] <mordof> DARKGuy: the wine in the repos is about 15 versions behind
[10:12] <InvisiblePinkUni> I'm using Ubuntu and have emacs installed. how do i find the "the path to your Lisp system" and "the path of your slime directory" ?
[10:12] <Pie-rate> gaming as much as me is NOT advisable. please do not try that, kids at home.
[10:12] <mordof> Pie-rate: lol
[10:12] <DARKGuy> mordof: yup, mine are from winehq
[10:12] <DARKGuy> mordof: so I'm with the latest :p
[10:12] <keegan_> I use to be a big gamer till my system went out of style 5 years ago
[10:12] <keegan_> :(
[10:12] <mordof> DARKGuy: hmm.. yeah i just tried photoshop cs2 and it didn't work
[10:12] <james> Pie-rate: I just don't get it why should i use my bandwith and my hard earned computer to help fold proteins. from the people i talk to it about there mainly concered about rankings....
[10:12] <DARKGuy> mordof: see :P
[10:13] <mordof> DARKGuy: but they never said it would anyway, heh
[10:13] <DARKGuy> mordof: I really want that program to work :(
[10:13] <chuckkh> anyone know about ubuntu-musique?
[10:13] <vaporglow> DARKGuy: think i would have any problems running graphic intense games emulated on a Pentium D 2.8ghz ?
[10:13] <DARKGuy> mordof:  lol
[10:13] <keegan_> Does folding help for a good cause though?
[10:13] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: as long as you have a damn good video card with the correct drivers, not at all
[10:13] <mordof> keegan_: yeah.. it's cancer research
[10:13] <Pie-rate> yeah the rankings are bull imo, what matters is that you're contributing to a project that saves lives
[10:13] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: I can run the Quake 4 demo from iD softwre (native version) in my 933Mhz & GeForce4 Ti 4200 128Mb without much problems
[10:14] <mordof> james: the rankings are just to get people hyped about it, it doesn't matter WHY they contribute, just that they do
[10:14] <chuckkh> the ubuntu-musique repositories don't seem to exist anymore, but I'm being referred to them
[10:14] <chuckkh> and I don't know French
[10:14] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: and WoW works here with default settings, I don't think you'll have problems running. Installing them is mostly the problem
[10:14] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: And configuring the system to make them work -.-'
[10:14] <mordof> james: if fake useless ratings get people into folding more, then it's a good thing :P and that's what happens mostly
[10:14] <InvisiblePinkUni> !sbcl
[10:14] <ubotu> sbcl: A Common Lisp compiler and development system. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:0.9.14.0-2 (edgy), package size 8157 kB, installed size 28008 kB
[10:14] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: but once they work, you're set :D
[10:14] <vaporglow> fun
[10:14] <Pie-rate> furthermore, it hardly uses any bandwidth, literally unnoticeable unless you're on dialup
[10:14] <InvisiblePinkUni> !slime
[10:14] <ubotu> slime: Superior LISP Interaction Mode for Emacs. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:20060618-1 (edgy), package size 548 kB, installed size 1452 kB
[10:14] <EdLin> InvisiblePinkUni: you've installed slime, right? The docs in the /usr/share/doc (I guess /usr/share/doc/slime or some-such) show how to set it up. The "lisp system" is your lisp interpreter, the slime directory is where your source files will live I believe. You'll need to specify these in elisp in your ~/.emacs file
[10:15] <InvisiblePinkUni> EdLin: i dont have slime :o i only have sbcl
[10:15] <keegan_> One day Linux will be reconized in the gaming world..
[10:15] <DARKGuy> vaporglow: However if you want to spend some bucks, cedega is a good alternative for games that don't work very good in WINE (WoW plays awesomely there)
[10:15] <Pie-rate> .... i learned lisp a while ago. lots of irritating stupid parenthesis.
[10:15] <EdLin> InvisiblePinkUni: sbcl must have installed slime as a dependency.
[10:15] <vaporglow> I haven't been able to find out whether my video card is supported either. Its a nVidia geforce 7300 LE
[10:15] <kandinski> I am trying to install the nvidia binary driver with nvidia's own installer, but it says I should not be running xorg. How can I shut down xorg?
[10:15] <keegan_> You can get cedega from a friend of mine called bit t.
[10:15] <keegan_> haha
[10:15] <P2500> Heh.
[10:16] <DARKGuy> keegan_: Yup. Hell, I even laugh when my friends come home and go like, "I kill X, run a server, and I have the whole CPU for myself :D"
[10:16] <DARKGuy> *run a script
[10:16] <P2500> Yes. But compiled for 64-bit?
[10:16] <EdLin> InvisiblePinkUni: slime is a very nice emacs IDE for lisp, you really *want* to get it running.
[10:16] <InvisiblePinkUni> EdLin: i want to learn lisp...
[10:16] <InvisiblePinkUni> EdLin: but i'm using Dapper, and cant find slime ....
[10:17] <EdLin> InvisiblePinkUni: those errors are from slime, not sbcl.
[10:17] <Pie-rate> i dont see why anyone would WANT to write anything in lisp
[10:17] <emxppp1> !info slime dapper
[10:17] <ubotu> Package slime does not exist in dapper
[10:17] <EdLin> slime is DFSG non-free
[10:17] <EdLin> so it might be in multiverse
[10:17] <InvisiblePinkUni> EdLin: oh ok
[10:17] <keegan_> Its hard to understand someone with a lisp imagine someone writing with one
[10:18] <DARKGuy> lol keegan_
[10:18] <vaporglow_> !&*(^@!!!!
[10:18] <Spee_Der> That was cute keeg
[10:18] <james> brb
[10:18] <vaporglow_> stupid university network and 3 am resets
[10:19] <vaporglow_> now i have to start downloading the ISOs again.. transfer broke
[10:19] <vaporglow_> they were almost done
[10:19] <emxppp1> vaporglow_: wget -c ... ?
[10:20] <vaporglow_> emxppp1: im on xp right now, was downloading the live cd for ubuntu and kubuntu
[10:20] <kandinski> I run a centrino laptop but I have a -386 kernel. Do I need a generic one? How do I change it for a generic one?
[10:20] <keegan_> Nothing kills me more then when my internet goes out and I have to install a brand new huge file again
[10:20] <emxppp1> vaporglow_: i am sure xp also has tools for resuming aborted http downloads
[10:20] <vaporglow_> but the university LAN forces you to reauthenticate at 3am
[10:20] <EdLin> wget and bittorrent both have ways of resuming interrupted downloads
[10:21] <keegan_> wget is just too much work.
[10:21] <keegan_> on windows
[10:21] <vaporglow_> and any transfers going on when the network boots you are considered done (at least by firefox)
[10:21] <EdLin> keegan_: wget -c <paste URL>
[10:21] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: If it helps any, I am using the MGA400/450 dual head card with appropriate drivers. I think it is perhaps the monitors as each is different as well as my understanding of what I'm doing or trying to do.
[10:21] <zorglu_> q. recently my download of ubuntu iso via bittorrent went to 1.2mbyte/s to 300kbyte/s, any body experiences the same thing ?
[10:21] <EdLin> keegan_: how's that too much work?
[10:21] <loca|host> can anyone tell me why my bugreport is still unconfirmed since one week ? https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/73119
[10:21] <keegan_> typing all that compared to a click of a button
[10:21] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Ah, sorry, I forgot to give you my xorg.org - by the way, can you paste yours so I try to guide you?
[10:21] <keegan_> May the jury rest its case
[10:22] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: No problem. Let me finger out how to post mine.
[10:22] <vaporglow_> unfortunately the only way i can get bittorrent to work is by tunneling out to a friends ssh server (which is down right now)
[10:22] <Spee_Der> !pastebin

[10:23] <emxppp1> EdLin: right
[10:23] <keegan_> Oh I use the shell when I have too
[10:23] <vaporglow_> earlier.. before i got booted.. i was asking if anybody knew if nVidia geforce 7300LE was supported, i have not been able to turn up an answer
[10:23] <EdLin> keegan_: well, it's up to you. Is "wget -c" too much trouble or is re-downloading 700M too much trouble?
[10:23] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Most notable stuff you'll find there are the two Device, Monitor and Screen sections, and the ServerLayout at the end. But you can do something similar with just two Monitor and Screen sections I *think*
[10:24] <keegan_> Both are just things I don't even want to think about...
[10:24] <emxppp1> EdLin: vaporglow_ is the one with the aborted download
[10:24] <keegan_> Just scares me

[10:25] <emxppp1> vaporglow: commandline url download tool
[10:25] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: you got the dual monitor stuff working, or you just have resolution issues ?
[10:25] <zorglu_> !wget | vaporglow
[10:25] <dreamer> zorglu_: any preferences ?
[10:25] <ubotu> wget: retrieves files from the web. In component main, is standard. Version 1.10.2-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 226 kB, installed size 1952 kB

[10:25] <lostsync> wget is indespensible
[10:25] <zorglu_> dreamer: personnaly i dont burn cd :)
[10:26] <vaporglow> ill go luck it up
[10:26] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Dual monitor works fine. Resolution for screen1 or monitor # 2 is stuck in 640x800 mode.....
[10:26] <EdLin> vaporglow: wget is very powerful, though you can use it fairly simply too to do common tasks
[10:26] <dreamer> zorglu_: ok :)
[10:26] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Thanks for the pastebin, I will print it and look it over, thanks much.
[10:26] <zorglu_> dreamer: well i did burn a few cd with k3b and it worked well
[10:27] <dreamer> ok, not in the repo's though
[10:27] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Try something: Welcome :) you can try something: First, backup your xorg.conf (sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.org /etc/X11/xorg.org.backup01 or something similar), then edit it (sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf) and do this:

[10:27] <zorglu_> dreamer: it seems there
[10:27] <Spee_Der> I always have a backup DARK.... :)
[10:28] <caspar> ok finaly i solved the problem
[10:28] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Choose a resolution you know it works on both monitors, like, let's say 800x600. Then in both Screen sections, remove the other resolutions and just leave it like "800x600" alone, and try to see if it works (if you see my xorg.org, that's what I did for forcing the 1024x768 res)
[10:28] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Nice :)

[10:30] <First|Laptop> what's the best way to access nix files from windows over a wireless network?
[10:30] <First|Laptop> hopefully, it's not samba
[10:30] <ubotu> k3b: A sophisticated KDE CD burning application. In component main, is optional. Version 0.12.14-0ubuntu7 (dapper), package size 3941 kB, installed size 8376 kB
[10:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about coffee - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:30] <zorglu_> dreamer: as the bot is down, i checked and k3b is in the dapper repository 0.12.14-0ubuntu7
[10:30] <tuna-fish-> First|Laptop: I used dc++...
[10:31] <emxppp1> First|Laptop: you can run sshd on the linux machine and use winscp to connect to it
[10:32] <First|Laptop> hmm
[10:32] <daxxar> How can I convert a ssh-key from putty to the format openssh understands?
[10:32] <H3g3m0n> First|Laptop: Samba's by far the easiest, whats wrong with it?
[10:32] <dreamer> zorglu_: yes I have it installed
[10:32] <dreamer> see haw it werks :)
[10:32] <InvisiblePinkUni> EdLin: slime and sbcl are running "This could be the start of a beautiful program" :)
[10:32] <InvisiblePinkUni> EdLin: thanks :)
[10:32] <daxxar> Ah, I think I found out how. :)
[10:32] <First|Laptop> H3g3m0n: I've always heard horror stories about samba being a b***ch to setup
[10:32] <dreamer> zorglu_: under >>Multimedia :)
[10:32] <zorglu_> :)
[10:33] <H3g3m0n> First|Laptop: Its fairly easy, at least for me it was
[10:33] <First|Laptop> hmm
[10:33] <EdLin> InvisiblePinkUni: np
[10:33] <First|Laptop> i'll check it out tomorrow
[10:33] <H3g3m0n> First|Laptop: If you just doing basic file sharing anyway, in fact i think you might beable to share files in nautilus by right clicking on the folder
[10:34] <nothlit> If you want samba to be as easy to set up as windows shares then you have to change the security from user to share. Otherwise it will take some more work
[10:34] <nothlit> H3g3m0n, that still requires nfs/smb
[10:34] <First|Laptop> H3g3m0n: it's not there by default
[10:35] <frandavid100> hi
[10:35] <frandavid100> do you know what to do with a translated .po to get to try it on the actual program?
[10:35] <First|Laptop> hmm
[10:35] <First|Laptop> well, thanks
[10:35] <First|Laptop> i need to hit the sack otherwise i'll never get up in the morning
[10:36] <First|Laptop> going from swing shift to day shift in one days time is rough
[10:36] <emxppp1> First|Laptop: if you don't mind seeing the files only in one application (winscp), install openssh-server on linux and use winscp on windows
[10:36] <First|Laptop> ok
[10:36] <H3g3m0n> nothlit: Does the rightclick require any actual setup or just apt-get install samba?
[10:37] <H3g3m0n> Normal Samba is really not that hard to setup, unless your trying to setup a domain for a large network or something
[10:37] <H3g3m0n> Just find an example smb.conf file and your all set
[10:37] <eilker> what is symlink ? is it exactly equalevent to shortcut in windows ?
[10:38] <nothlit> I think it ties into the whole sharefolder thing in the gnomepanel shared folders entry, which automatically asks you you either install smb /nfs or both
[10:38] <babo> guys, I can't tar a directory ... ?  tar -cf /mydir/ file.tar
[10:38] <H3g3m0n> eilker: Its similar but much more powerfull
[10:38] <eilker> H3g3m0n: i cant find info and how to for it...
[10:39] <emxppp1> H3g3m0n: i had performance issues with samba. tried different socket options but it remained slow (~ 2MByte/sec over a Gbit link)
[10:39] <H3g3m0n> eilker: system links are files that explorer reads and follows, where as the linux ones are built into the basic file system, so you can systemlink stuff and applications will read the file it points to rather than the systemlink file itself
[10:39] <InvisiblePinkUni> babo: make it -> tar -cf file.tar /mydir/
[10:39] <epswing> babo: tar -cvf mydir.tar mydir/
[10:39] <epswing> i think
[10:39] <nothlit> If you want to set up samba theres a guide at help.ubuntu.com/community, but all you have to do is add you share under share folders and set your password with smbpasswd, or lower the security setting to share
[10:39] <epswing> damn you Pinky :P
[10:39] <vaporglow> anybody have any advice on external data storage with linux? i need to backup all my data before i reformat drives to work with linux. should i get something like a western digital mybook 500gb, or should i get an enclosure and an internal drive to install in it? which is going to be easier to implement with linux? or did i just ask a really stupid question?
[10:39] <nothlit> One thing to remember is you samba accounts have to correlate to user accounts
[10:39] <babo> k thanks
[10:39] <InvisiblePinkUni> babo: when you use -f flag the filename must follow immediately
[10:39] <H3g3m0n> eilker: If you are ok with the console 'ln -s sourcefile destinationfile', otherwise im sure theres an easy way to do it in nautilus or other filemanagers
[10:39] <babo> InvisiblePinkUni, ahh thaks
[10:40] <InvisiblePinkUni> epswing: me starting to get hang of linux :p
[10:40] <nothlit> vaporglow, on the linux side its the same, just usb mass storage, its automounted with gnome-volume-manager
[10:40] <nothlit> but getting your own enclosure is far cheaper, but it will take a little more work, some people may feel uncomfortable about it
[10:40] <nothlit> you sound like you know what you're doing though
[10:40] <H3g3m0n> emxppp1: I use 'socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_SNDBUF=8192 SO_RCVBUF=8192', but I don't use it under windows very often
[10:41] <vaporglow> :)
[10:41] <emxppp1> H3g3m0n: the client machine wasnt windows, it was linux
[10:41] <InvisiblePinkUni> babo: :)
[10:41] <glitch-> I was wondering which image to download for IA64
[10:41] <nothlit> Anyone have a preference for braseros/bonfire or gnomebaker?
[10:41] <eloque> can somebody help me with what i can do to connect to wireless? i dunno what the domain servers are for my dial-up (through wireless router)
[10:41] <eilker> H3g3m0n: may i create a symlink for my windows drives ? i wanna have a shortcut in my kde desktop
[10:41] <emxppp1> H3g3m0n: maybe i should have tested with a windows client :)
[10:41] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: what is the modeline statement in your xorg for ?
[10:42] <H3g3m0n> eilker: Yep that should work fine, just make a link to their mount points
[10:42] <emxppp1> H3g3m0n: i used exactly that socket options
[10:42] <InvisiblePinkUni> eilker: is the drive mounted?
[10:42] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: That's for setting my black and white Multilite right monitor to 1024x768 @ 43Hz interlaced (t's the max res this monitor can take)
[10:42] <eilker> InvisiblePinkUni: yes it is
[10:42] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: you don't need it :P
[10:43] <H3g3m0n> emxppp1: I use samba under linux too, (well cifs) never had any speed issues, otherwise there is NFS which is the native file sharing
[10:43] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: And it's also for the Compaq monitor for using 1024x768 at 75hz
[10:43] <InvisiblePinkUni> yes... then you can ....
[10:43] <abes> Hey! You know how when u install an app it makes a command which when you type "which command" shows you the directory - how do you link directories to commands?
[10:43] <H3g3m0n> emxppp1: Don't actually know, just got them from an example ages ago
[10:43] <discoloda> question: does the dapper liveCD have a way to install without going to X?
[10:43] <nothlit> Is there any diff between the most basic install on the alternate cd and the server cd? Do they both install ubuntu-minimal or does one install ubuntu-standard?
[10:43] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: I don't think you need those - unless you want to force refresh rates
[10:43] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Just curious is all, thanks.
[10:43] <discoloda> i am unable to get the liveCD to run X :(
[10:43] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Welcome :P
[10:43] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: I'm still editing mine.....
[10:43] <emxppp1> H3g3m0n: if it was a linux only environment, i would use nfs too. but there are some windows machines.
[10:43] <eilker> H3g3m0n: mount point ?  you mean this ? this is my c drive in windows /dev/hda1
[10:44] <pequatre> hi. i'm searching for the name of an utility which helps you create an "offline repository" on a CD that i think i heard of on planet-ubuntu. Does it ring a bell to someone here ?
[10:44] <nothlit> abes you have to change your $PATH variable to include your new dir
[10:44] <InvisiblePinkUni> if you are using GNOME its quite simple... just right click on the mount point in Nautilus, and create a shortcut
[10:44] <H3g3m0n> eilker: thats the raw device. not the mount point, check in /media
[10:44] <DARKGuy> Spee_Der: Heh, good luck :) remember to just delete the uneeded resolutions and leave both Screen sections with the same res in all the depths shown
[10:44] <abes> nothlit: how do i change $PATH to
[10:44] <SilentDis> hello :)
[10:44] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Right.
[10:44] <abes> nothlit: to "firefox"?
[10:44] <Spee_Der> bbiab
[10:44] <nothlit> abes, you can see your $PATH by echo $PATH and you can set it to something new export PATH="stuffhere".... oh thats not what you want to do
[10:45] <SilentDis> Beryl + subscription to Digital Blasphemy = staying up way too damn late finding the 'perfect' skydome :P
[10:45] <nothlit> just make a symbolic link to your application in /usr/local/bin or put it in there
[10:45] <eilker> H3g3m0n: /media/hda1      is it ok ?
[10:45] <H3g3m0n> emxppp1: Make sure your using cifs not smbfs in fstab, its apparently heaps better with caching and such
[10:45] <H3g3m0n> eilker: yep
[10:45] <firepol> hi, im planning to buy 2 computers for a very small company. they'd like to try ubuntu + openoffice for writing letters and secretary work... what hardware is more STABLE with ubuntu? an AMD Sempron, an AMD 64 or a Celeron D?
[10:46] <vaporglow> are there any issues with usb 2.0 support on linux?
[10:46] <H3g3m0n> emxppp1: Also actually mounting the drives rather than using the built in smb:// stuff in nautilus, never really used it so dunno how good it is
[10:46] <os390> somebody can indicate to me in that diretory is installed openssl
[10:46] <SilentDis> firepol:  purely from a thermal prospective, i'd say the Celeron D.  if cooling is not a problem, then I'd go with the AMD 64
[10:46] <abes> nothlit: all i want to do is this: when i type "which firefox" i get nothing in return although i have firefox up and running - now i just need to hook up the directory to that command so all shortcuts work properly
[10:46] <nothlit> firepol, cpus are pretty well supported but running any os in 64 bit will complicate things
[10:46] <gavin> os390: did you "whereis openssl" in terminal?
[10:46] <H3g3m0n> firepol: All those cpus should run fine
[10:46] <eilker> H3g3m0n: sudo ln -s  /media/hda1    /home/user/Desktop     // is it ok ?
[10:46] <glitch-> I was wondering which image to download for IA64
[10:47] <H3g3m0n> eilker: Looks fine to me
[10:47] <SilentDis> firepol:  duh, business.  yeah, stay the heck away from 64bit cores for now rofl
[10:47] <firepol> ok, so if i want to save some energy a celeron D is better,. also for the cooling, which will make it more stable apparently?
[10:47] <nothlit> abes, firefox should already be in PATH
[10:48] <firepol> what about motherboards? are there chipsets that perform better than others?
[10:48] <H3g3m0n> eilker: Although the sudo bit is probally not required
[10:48] <abes> nothlit: ok... its not... can u tell me how to add it?
[10:48] <nothlit> abes, ubuntu automatically installs it, you can't get the gecko engine without it in ubuntu
[10:48] <SilentDis> firepol:  computers don't do well in heat in general.  if it's an 'office' environment you're probably fine.  if it's anything else, well... that'll be based on your needs
[10:48] <nothlit> abes type echo $PATH  and show me what comes up
[10:48] <eloque> linux
[10:49] <abes> nothlit: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games
[10:49] <nothlit> abes, anyways, you can always just put the full path of the application in your shortcuts, for example /usr/bin/firefox -newpage %s
[10:49] <nothlit> abes, ok ls /usr/bin | grep firefox
[10:49] <firepol> thanks guys, i will switch these guys to ubuntu and make them appreciate it ;)
[10:50] <discoloda> is there a reason the liveCD would not load X properly? (i get as far as a blue screen)
[10:50] <SilentDis> firepol:  when i build boxen for customers for businesses, i tend to stick with Intel chips for heat/reliability issues.
[10:50] <eilker> H3g3m0n: thank you, i created two symlink for my both drives in windows, lastly is it symbolic link or system link ?
[10:50] <abes> nothlit: ok... what now? i have firefox, firefox.ubuntu, mozilla-firefox, mozilla-firefox.ubuntu
[10:50] <firepol> SilentDis, i was thinking the same...
[10:50] <SilentDis> firepol: when it's for individual users, I do go with AMD, as you'll get more 'bang for the buck'
[10:50] <firepol> ;)
[10:51] <nothlit> then firefox is already in your path , and the variable is correctly installed
[10:51] <gavin> I'm having major problems with the Xubuntu LiveCD and alternate CD. I just booted Ubuntu LiveCD and alternate fine (as far as my limited RAM would take me), but the Xubuntu LiveCD crashes before it loads the kernel (it doesn't show the progress bar) and the alternate CD doesn't boot at all. I'm on an old Thinkpad. Can anyone help?
[10:51] <gavin> I'm also booted into my mutant Xubuntu/Ubuntu right now, so my HDD is fine.
[10:51] <firepol> SilentDis, do u think a mainboard with integrated vga+lan+audio, 2 hard disks and a celeron D will work well with a 350 Watt power supply? or is better 45' watt?
[10:51] <nothlit> that means the problem lies elsewhere
[10:51] <H3g3m0n> eilker: Its a symbolic link because of the -s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link you use it when linking to files on the same device
[10:52] <firepol> well, sorry for these questions, but if something will go wrong people will think ubuntu sucks, i dont want it ;)
[10:52] <SilentDis> firepol:  you're saving yourself a bit with the integrated video, but I'd still go for at least a 400 in a box with 2 HDs in it
[10:52] <eilker> H3g3m0n: thank you very much
[10:52] <H3g3m0n> eilker: nps =)
[10:52] <firepol> SilentDis, perfect, thanks dude
[10:53] <SilentDis> firepol:  when it comes to business, it's gotta be 100% uptime, period.  all safe bets :)
[10:53] <gavin> firepol: You aren't planning on "fooling" them by leaning the tables in Ubuntu's direction, are you?
[10:53] <nothlit> rofl 100% uptime is only for servers
[10:54] <firepol> gavin, leaning the tables? what do u mean?
[10:54] <firepol> i will make them save $$$ for M$ licenses
[10:54] <SilentDis> nothlit:  you'd be surprized.  if you give 100% uptime (or, as near as physically possible with a desktop) in the design (never make a guarntee, of course) people do notice and thank you for it later :)
[10:54] <nothlit> otherwise we'd all be installing debian stable on our desktops
[10:55] <H3g3m0n> BSD ;)
[10:55] <Lynoure> nothlit: I'd even take that further and say it is for services. Cannot promise a single piece of hardware not to randomly fail on you.
[10:55] <SilentDis> nothlit: heh, I still run BSD on my server boxes lol
[10:55] <nothlit> open or free
[10:55] <babo> is there any good voip channel ?
[10:55] <_glitch-> I was wondering which image to download for IA64
[10:55] <H3g3m0n> Although there is Debian GNU/kFreeBSD =)
[10:56] <H3g3m0n> _glitch-: just go with the normal 32bit image
[10:56] <SilentDis> my home server box currently runs FreeBSD 5.4, last I SSHed into it and checked it had been up for 4 months hehe
[10:56] <blufox> I found a bug in the ubuntu's heartbeat package and fixed it too , whom should i report to ? ... and can i contribute as a developer to Ubuntu?
[10:56] <nothlit> H3g3m0n, i thought the ports system was supposed to be > all, why would you run an apt packaging system instead
[10:57] <vaporglow> if i get a pci card to add more SATA2 ports to my box to use with external harddrives, can i expect to find linux drivers for it?
[10:57] <_glitch-> H3g3m0n:oh? intel processors aren't supported?
[10:58] <nothlit> It's weird but I had far more stability with gentoo than with ubuntu, and I fiddled a lot more with gentoo. I haven't touched the kernel in ubuntu yet.

[10:59] <gavin> Anybody have problems with Thinkpads and Xubuntu?
[10:59] <_glitch-> H3g3m0n:(or not yet?)
[10:59] <ZooKast> Thanks _glitch- ;-)
[10:59] <H3g3m0n> nothlit: I had the exact opposite, everytime i tried to update the world progs would die
[10:59] <dreamer> damnit, xorg.conf keeps putting a wacom-tablet instead of my usb-optical-mouse
[11:00] <emxppp1> gavin: running xubuntu dapper on a thinkpad t43 here. no problems.
[11:00] <H3g3m0n> _glitch-: ubuntu ia64 returns some results but i carn't see anything final
[11:00] <SilentDis> firepol:  from a purely personal experience, I've always offered Linux as an option to businesses, even showed them the $125 savings on cost of the box, and the best I've been able to do is get them to put it on a second partition... which, of course, they never use.  if you've gotten them to agree to a Linux box in the first place, you're way ahead of me lol
[11:00] <Agent_bob> is there any way to keep xfce from setting the -bg to white when it's loading ?
[11:01] <gavin> emxppp1: Have you tried either of the edgy CDs?
[11:01] <emxppp1> gavin: no, not yet
[11:01] <firepol> SilentDis, my strategy is to install linux and give them support. once they're used to it they should be fine
[11:01] <SilentDis> firepol:  then again, *I* use the linux partition when they break it rofl
[11:02] <Agent_bob> ?
[11:02] <SilentDis> firepol:  i wish you the absolute best of luck :)
[11:02] <firepol> SilentDis, anyway im explaining them the benefits and costs (support)... so at the end maybe they'll buy windows anyway... i will just show them the 2 possibilities
[11:02] <ZooKast> H3g3m0n: the fact is that i dont file any ia64 images on the mirrors, is there a special place to get it? i looked thru the wiki but didnt found much about ia64 or intel on it :(
[11:02] <ZooKast> H3g3m0n: s/file/find/
[11:02] <firepol> SilentDis, they also need a file server. for that one i'll install ubuntu or debian
[11:02] <discoloda> firepol, i wish more people where this brave :)
[11:03] <firepol> discoloda, i explained them that openoffice is not that complicated, only different
[11:03] <H3g3m0n> ZooKast: I'm poking around now, there is launch pad entries, im thinking its server only at this stage
[11:03] <SilentDis> firepol:  oh yeah.  no way I'd recommend a MS product in that reguard.  they'll never 'see' it, and samba does so much better of a job hehe
[11:03] <firepol> i told them,. for writing letters or similar, they'll cvall me mayybe 5 times, to solve the basic issues, then once they're used to it, they'll be fine
[11:04] <ZooKast> H3g3m0n: thanks for looking, i'm heading there too
[11:04] <tx22> Guys, i submitted a post and no ones replied for a day. I feel that my idea is a good one and want people to comment on their feelings regarding my idea. please visit it and tell me what you think... http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=308963
[11:04] <discoloda> i mean more IT consultants being brave enough to pitch it, my last it job was with a consulting firm, the guy in charge was a MS nut :(
[11:04] <firepol> well, we'll see, maybe i'll write a blog about this experience if they decide ubuntu ;)
[11:04] <SilentDis> firepol:  :D
[11:04] <firepol> i work 50%, so i need to do something fort the missing 50% (giving linux support is the idea)
[11:04] <gavin> Why might my CD suddenly stop booting from a bootable CD (it was working fine 2 days ago)? The CD runs up and everything, but my system just boots normally as if it wasn't a bootable CD.
[11:05] <Agent_bob> does anyone here know if it's possable to set xfce so that it doesn't change the bg to white while loading ?
[11:05] <SilentDis> as I said, the best I've been able to get is to install linux on a seperate partition on the drive for the customer.  they never touch it.  they then break windows badly, call me in, and I spend 5 min inside linux fixing it.  at this point, it's more of a 'backdoor' tool for me in a lot of cases lol
[11:05] <H3g3m0n> ZooKast, _glitch-: I don't think its an official port http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/daily-live/current/
[11:05] <jumble> you crazy guys still up?
[11:06] <DARKGuy> jumble: we're like Chuck Norris, we don't sleep - we wait :P
[11:06] <SilentDis> jumble:  barely.  the sleep zombies are munching on me now
[11:06] <emxppp1> jumble: its 11:07am here
[11:06] <gavin> And we're not all on American Standard Time.
[11:06] <jumble> im trying to install some perl modules now that ubuntu seems to be installed, and im getting tons of inexplicable errors.
[11:06] <Agent_bob> SilentDis gets used more if there is only one partition
[11:06] <firepol> SilentDis, the pc will be used by 2 girls. i will maybe install AIGLX and compiz, so they'll benefit some cool graphic effects and love linux for that ;)
[11:06] <DARKGuy> firepol: lol, nice tactic
[11:07] <discoloda> heh
[11:07] <DARKGuy> firepol: "Wooooow look at teh windowz become transparent :D!"
[11:07] <firepol> maybe they'll shot the pc to customers, which will call me to install that for them too ;)
[11:07] <SilentDis> firepol:  lol Beryl always gets 'em ;)
[11:07] <jumble> you guys have any experience with perl and ubuntu?
[11:07] <sjaakmans> Hello
[11:07] <ZooKast> H3g3m0n: i was looking for it everywhere, thanks a lot for your help! :)
[11:07] <firepol> DARKGuy: lol
[11:07] <sjaakmans> Can somebody help me with dri drivers for savage?
[11:08] <firepol> DARKGuy: but u know, personally i dont care, but girls u know, they'll like it for sure
[11:08] <H3g3m0n> ZooKast: nps, theres also http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases for nondaily builds, but no edgy in those
[11:08] <H3g3m0n> And somthing called ubuntu 'alternative'
[11:08] <firepol> is it possible with gnome to change wallpaper automatically every 30 minutes? (i use KDE and i have no idea if with gnome it's possible)
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[11:09] <jumble> i guess thats a no... ?
[11:09] <DARKGuy> firepol: and that's a good thing ;)
[11:09] <ZooKast> H3g3m0n: ok, tnx
[11:09] <H3g3m0n> firepol: Doesn't seem to be a option in the wallpaper panel, theres probably a whole heap of other ways to do it though
[11:09] <DARKGuy> actually, linux girls, that rocks
[11:10] <nothlit> Firepol yeah you have to use scripts, wp-tray doesn't work atm
[11:10] <DARKGuy> brb
[11:10] <firepol> so KDE is more advanced on that point. well not important, i was just curious
[11:10] <jumble> does anyone know what the libc6-dev package is?
[11:11] <emxppp1> jumble: header files (.h) for the standard C library
[11:11] <H3g3m0n> I saw a few posts about setting it to automatically grab wallpapers from FlickR, never tried it since FlickR doesn't allow images in my resolution
[11:11] <jumble> ok, maybe that was the problem.
[11:11] <jumble> i never imagined this would be so f*ing complicated...
[11:11] <SilentDis> !libc6-dev | I know ALL:
[11:11] <ubotu> libc6-dev: GNU C Library: Development Libraries and Header Files. In component main, is optional. Version 2.4-1ubuntu12 (edgy), package size 1808 kB, installed size 7872 kB
[11:11] <emxppp1> jumble: you need them if you want to compile anything
[11:12] <Keyseir> I just reinstalled edgy eft and my sound isn't working. It worked before so I doubt it's a hardware compatibility problem. What should I check?
[11:12] <emxppp1> jumble: maybe you should install the build-essential package
[11:12] <nothlit> sudo aptitude install build-essential <- package for compiling
[11:12] <jumble> ok. how do i do that?
[11:12] <nothlit> thats pretty much all you need to do before you can start
[11:12] <jumble> ok. how would i know to do that? just wondering. is that something in the documentation?
[11:12] <nothlit> its really simple :)
[11:12] <emxppp1> jumble: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:12] <jumble> its simple 'cause i have you guys to tell me!
[11:12] <nothlit> by reading guides or the ubuntu wiki
[11:13] <nothlit> a lot of stuff people ask here is answered on the wiki
[11:13] <SilentDis> jumble:  welcome to OSS.  the community is your support, and we're happy to help ;)
[11:13] <ALVAN> hi all
[11:13] <jumble> i guess i havent been reading them closely enough...
[11:13] <dreamer> damnit, anybody here experience with K3b cd-burning?  it puts 2 seconds before every track, how can I override this ?
[11:13] <emxppp1> jumble: you want to learn about package management in ubuntu
[11:13] <jumble> where in the guides/wiki is this info?
[11:13] <Keyseir> reinstalled edgy, sound was working before, now it isn't. Advice?

[11:13] <ALVAN> i do fdisk -l and see my usb partition as fat-16 on /dev/sda1
[11:13] <variant> dreamer: insert pregap = no
[11:14] <dreamer> variant: where ?
[11:14] <nothlit> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OtherWaysToInstall?highlight=%28build-essential%29
[11:14] <ALVAN> but when i try tu mount it with mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 usb
[11:14] <variant> dreamer: in the burning prefs
[11:14] <ALVAN> itsays /dev/sda1 special device doesnt exists? why this
[11:14] <variant> dreamer: I'm not at my box just now so I can't check

[11:15] <Spee_Der> DARKGuy: Thanks. I got it working with some research, now I need shower and to get to work.... Cheers and thanks for the help.
[11:15] <variant> ALVAN: you don't need to specify the filesystem
[11:15] <jumble> !uboto
[11:15] <variant> ALVAN: it will, just specify the dir
[11:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uboto - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:15] <ALVAN> variant, but why will not or in the dir i want ?
[11:15] <variant> mount /dev/sda1 /media/usbwhatever

[11:15] <ALVAN> no is not
[11:15] <ALVAN> variant,  is not
[11:16] <variant> ALVAN: when you plug it in does it not appear, automaticaly mounted? if not you should enable gnome-volume-manager in the sytem prefs
[11:16] <jumble> ok. everythings getting bookmarked, in the hopes that one day i won't be as full of hate for my new OS as i am today.
[11:16] <ALVAN> variant,  it is not autmaticaly mounted
[11:17] <SilentDis> jumble:  he knows all, sees all.  if you know the 'basics' of your question (you can strip it to 1 word), usually, just !<that word> will get you SOME sort of info.  and if ubotu can't figure it out, someone's always here to help :)
[11:17] <ALVAN> but why i msut enable automatically i cant mount manually ?
[11:17] <jumble> i think my main problem is knowing the word to put in.
[11:17] <ALVAN> is so strange on other distro i can do that here i cant ?
[11:18] <SilentDis> jumble:  as always, just ask, and someone in here will more than likely be able to help, or direct you to a page for more help :)
[11:18] <jumble> for that i am most appreciative.
[11:19] <nothlit> ALVAN, gnome-volume-manager should have already mounted it in /media if it has been plugged in
[11:19] <Keyseir> sound debugging advice please?
[11:19] <SilentDis> !sound
[11:19] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

[11:22] <SilentDis> keyseir:  are you using the digital output on the card?
[11:22] <Keyseir> SilentDis, It worked fine before I reinstalled edgy, but now I'm not getting any sound.
[11:22] <ALVAN> so i think is already mounted ..hm but where in /proc/bus/usb ?
[11:22] <Keyseir> SilentDis, Digital output?
[11:22] <ALVAN> how can this be ?
[11:22] <SilentDis> keyseir:  single cable going from sound card to an amp of sorts, then to a bunch of speakers
[11:22] <Keyseir> SilentDis, No. I've only got it hooked up to a set of speakers... and I've checked the speakers
[11:23] <bimberi> vernes: Perhaps a small script with 2 lines.  'cd /path/to/dir' and './app'.  put it in /usr/local/bin and make links to it.

[11:24] <eilker> !tty
[11:24] <ubotu> To get to the tty terminals 1-6, use the keystroke ctrl + alt + F1-F6 respectively (Alt+F7 will get you back to your graphical login).

[11:30] <MZM> Seveas: OK. Open OOo writer, Insert-> Picture-> From file. Choose any pic. Inset-> Caption. As caption text type "foo - bar is - crash", Click OK and tell me result
[11:31] <maghat> jumble: it's just my opinion, but that's not an appropriate problem set for perl. You could get a LOT better performance from any non-interpreted language

[11:31] <fyrestrtr> hrmm...
[11:31] <andyshack> evening folks. im just about to install ubuntu server and i was wondering if 6.06.1 is the way to go or just use 6.06 ?
[11:31] <factorx> fyrestrtr, ok thanks
[11:31] <jumble> i agree. i didnt right the damn programs though, i just have to verify that they work.
[11:31] <vaporglow> does anyone know if eSATA is supported in linux?
[11:31] <Keyseir> SilentDis, Holy crap that was it
[11:31] <jumble> write, rather.
[11:32] <fyrestrtr> paul0: strange, I have never run into your issue. Do you have any weird network setup?
[11:32] <SilentDis> keyseir:  roflmao
[11:32] <maghat> jumble: sorry that's none of my business anyway, but I had to say it ;)
[11:32] <Keyseir> SilentDis, I don't know how that got messed up, but it was lurking in the background
[11:32] <Keyseir> SilentDis, I appreciate the support mang
=== eloquence_ is now known as eloque
[11:32] <paul0> fyrestrtr: no afaik
[11:32] <jumble> thats fair. i'd like to kill the man who wrote the damn thing in the first place, he's more or less thrown my semester down the tubes.
[11:32] <SilentDis> keyseir:  any time, glad you're up  and going.  it's always the 'simple' stuff ;)
[11:32] <Seveas> MZM, works lik a charm
[11:32] <Keyseir> SilentDis, Yar.
[11:32] <fyrestrtr> paul0: edgy? dapper?
[11:32] <maghat> jumble: so you had to actually read through piles of perl code you didn't write?
[11:32] <paul0> fyrestrtr: edgy
[11:32] <[A] ndy80> hi
[11:32] <jumble> i tried to read through as little as possible.
[11:32] <H3g3m0n> vaporglow: afaik eSata is just normal sata but external
[11:32] <jumble> with mixed results.
[11:32] <MZM> Seveas: Edgy w OOo 2.04 ubuntu2?
[11:33] <Seveas> MZM, yup
[11:33] <Seveas> 32bit
[11:33] <fyrestrtr> paul0: try removing it, and re-installing it. When you remove make sure you have --purge
[11:33] <jumble> the code itself isnt excessively long, but knowing nothing about the language or the environment and starting from scratch on a lot of fronts (perl front, linux front, etc.) has been excessively time consuming.
[11:33] <fyrestrtr> paul0: if that doesn't work, then we can tackle it.
[11:33] <MZM> Seveas: asme here, but 100% crash
[11:34] <[A] ndy80> I've a little problem... on some ubuntu PC, users authenticate with LDAP. The problem is that they cannot access /dev/dsp because they have no rights. If I do a chmod 666 /dev/dsp, changes are lost when I reboot machine. Is it possible to have always permission set to 666 ?
[11:34] <Seveas> MZM, were the "" supposed to be part of the caption or not?
[11:34] <paul0> fyrestrtr: ok, doing --purge remove mysql-server
[11:34] <SilentDis> keyseir:  i spent an hour when I first setup banging my head against the desk, reading and rereading the faq for setting up the nvidia binary driver, each time, skipping over the requirement of the restricted modules.  *blush*
[11:34] <fyrestrtr> MZM: are you running xgl/aiglx ?
[11:34] <MZM> Seveas: nope
[11:34] <Seveas> MZM, ok, then I did it right ;)
[11:34] <maghat> jumble: I imagine, yes :|
[11:34] <[A] ndy80> (I anticipated I have LDAP authentication just because I do NOT want to add every user on ebery machine to sound group)
[11:34] <MZM> fyrestrtr: what it has to do w AIGLX/Beryl?
[11:35] <fyrestrtr> I've had it crash/hang when that is on.
[11:35] <Zaggynl> is writing to ntfs safe now?
[11:35] <MZM> fyrestrtr: other captions work OK, except for caption containing two dashes
[11:35] <maghat> Zaggynl: not as far as I know
[11:35] <H3g3m0n> Zaggynl: Not really, theres ntfs-3g though
[11:35] <SilentDis> zaggynl:  i remember seeing something about doing that, some group finally had it working... hang on...
[11:36] <SilentDis> !ntfs
[11:36] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[11:36] <emxppp1> [A] ndy80: you could set up a udev rule for /dev/dsp
[11:36] <SilentDis> !fuse
[11:36] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[11:36] <Seveas> Zaggynl, for some value of safe...
[11:36] <Zaggynl> I have two hdds, one ide with linux and another sata one with windows
[11:36] <Zaggynl> I'm kinda running out of diskspace on the ide one, so I want to start using the sata one
[11:36] <Zaggynl> in linux that is
[11:36] <paul0> fyrestrtr: even whem i try to remove it, it tries to restart apache and give another error, without removing mysql-server
[11:37] <maghat> hmmm I've played with NtfsFuse a few months back... pretty messy stuff
[11:37] <[A] ndy80> emxppp1: how?
[11:37] <H3g3m0n> Zaggynl: There are drivers that allow you to read linux ext under windows, you could bootwindows an copy files from there although the ntfs write support is usable
[11:37] <SilentDis> Zaggynl:  here I am with over 1TB of disk space though... so i'm not one to ask about such things.  windows gets 20gb and gets to like it, damnit.  :P
[11:37] <emxppp1> [A] ndy80: edit /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules  (look at the end of the file, there are some examples)
[11:37] <Zaggynl> :D
[11:38] <ailean> okay, i have a strange problem. when i flick to beryl, some applications don't respond to keyboard input. i just had it with XChat, but there it's happened with Firefox before.
[11:38] <fyrestrtr> paul0: it tries to restart apache?
[11:38] <Zaggynl> I've got about 500 GB of diskspace, but my linux hdd is only 80 :/
[11:38] <paul0> fyrestrtr: er, restart mysql, sorry
[11:38] <jumble> ok, time for me to get some sleep. i woke up today deciding i wouldnt sleep until this was done from start to finish, and it definitely wouldn't have happened without this channel. thanks.
[11:38] <fyrestrtr> MZM: could it have something to do with your encoding?
[11:38] <maghat> jumble: congrats :)

[11:39] <SilentDis> zaggynl:  between file servers, external arrays, other computers I have access to, i am well over 1TB of fully accessable drive space at this point... and yes, there's a LOT that's full rofl
[11:39] <jumble> we'll see! the damn thing is running at least, i might be back tomorrow trying to figure out why it doesnt work. although if that happens, my most likely next course of action is to tell the programmer to go fuck himself.
[11:39] <Zaggynl> A terrabyte, ugh
[11:39] <MZM> fyrestrtr: I was running OOo w en_US UI and used only latin chars. And it should not crash eaven if I was using chineese text ;)
[11:39] <Zaggynl> That's sweet
[11:40] <SilentDis> Zaggynl:  some of that is 'cheating' of course.  the media PC has 320gb on it, but it eats itself alive regularly.  :P
[11:40] <apossebom> anybody can answer if lvm can work equals raid0 ?
[11:40] <Zaggynl> ;o
[11:41] <H3g3m0n> I was setting up Gentoo fileserver for a friend, he had almost 2 TB =)

[11:41] <SilentDis> H3g3m0n:  the media pc would be happy for a week, i fear.  rofl
[11:41] <H3g3m0n> =P
[11:41] <jumble> damn, thats a lot of pron.
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[11:41] <SilentDis> I really need to just cave in, buy that thing a real TV tuner card, and throw MythTV on it I think :P
[11:41] <jumble> porn
[11:42] <H3g3m0n> Wasn't even raw dvd rips either, normal compressed avi's
[11:42] <jumble> sounds like a hero. every age needs a hero.
[11:42] <fyrestrtr> your "friend" needs a companion.
[11:42] <apossebom> how to i reconfigure a network with a dpkg-reconfigure ?
[11:42] <ekimus> hello, is there anything special about /var in a separate partition. It seems dhclient writes to /var/run then /var is mounted and appearantly networking is broken because of the order. did anyone else expirience similiar behaviour?
[11:43] <jumble> the more you need a companion, the harder it is to get one.
[11:43] <LinuxHelp> How can I stop the ubuntu loading screen from disappearing when I have an rc2.d script that takes particularly long to load (like several minutes)?
[11:43] <SilentDis> jumble:  try 100gb of MP3s (most stuff I own and have ripped myself), tons of movies i've ripped, etc.  and as I said, the media PC croaks weekly because windows doesn't handle that stuff that great :P
[11:44] <fyrestrtr> SilentDis: invest in a NAS device.
[11:44] <jumble> hello, someone actually sent me a message on a personals website. thats some odd timing.
[11:44] <jumble> if i had that much music i wouldnt do much else.
[11:44] <SilentDis> fyrestrtr:  nah, I need to manage my data better, not 'band aid' the problem with more space rofl
[11:45] <jumble> but, she's ugly and far away. alas.
[11:45] <fyrestrtr> SilentDis: attach the NAS to your linux machine, share the files to Windows clients over samba, and use mythtv :)
[11:45] <umista> all i want is to load up my raid drive everything i read is all about installing linux onto raid but not just to load it
[11:45] <ailean> jumble, and we know that all the studs hang out in #ubuntu . . .
[11:45] <jumble> where else?
[11:46] <SilentDis> fyrestrtr:  I would think a 320gb drive would do fine if the media box was actually running mythtv.  right now it's got an ATI AIW card in it, running the ATI software, so it's bloat bloat bloat on top of more bloat on top of windows.  :P
[11:47] <SilentDis> speaking of that... might as well ask:  can anyone recommend a good TV tuner card that has good support in Linux?
[11:47] <SilentDis> I'll throw it on my x-mas list and pray.  rofl

[11:50] <SilentDis> bimberi:  duh, thank you :)
[11:50] <JohnFlux> hey all
[11:50] <H3g3m0n> There are like 4 guys in there
[11:50] <bimberi> SilentDis: np :)
[11:50] <JohnFlux> sometimes my second network card is eth1 and sometimes it's eth2.
[11:50] <JohnFlux> it seems totally random
[11:50] <JohnFlux> it changes on boot up
[11:51] <JohnFlux> today it's on eth2.  so i have an eth0 and an eth2
[11:51] <JohnFlux> any one know what that might be? :)
[11:51] <sod75_> JohnFlux: sure there isn't a eth1 too ?
[11:51] <JohnFlux> ifconfig  eth1
[11:51] <SilentDis> JohnFlux:  nothing a good heavy hammer can't fix.  *snicker*
[11:51] <JohnFlux> eth1: error fetching interface information: Device not found
[11:52] <JohnFlux> i think it must be some race condition in the new edgy startup tools
[11:52] <JohnFlux> the parallel boot stuff
[11:52] <JohnFlux> actually that doesn't really make sense hmm
[11:54] <SilentDis> ooo... when you get REALLY tired, like after staying up for 20 hours straight, using nicotiene and caffeene to stay awake, the letters in irc chat start to hop around and dance in all sorts of weird ways!  O.o
[11:54] <eilker>  i have 512 mb ram, and 1 gb swap, i am gonna install vmware server, this memory is enough for me ? or do i need to buy more ram ?
[11:54] <SilentDis> on that note, i'm gonna go to bed ;)  g'night all :)
[11:54] <umista> is SDA1 for usb drives or sata drives?
[11:54] <fyrestrtr> buy more ram.
[11:54] <vaporglow> night SilentDis
[11:54] <vaporglow> sleep well
[11:54] <paul0> eilker: with qemu i use ~128mb for emulating linux
[11:54] <umista> man i have 4gigs or ram
[11:55] <JohnFlux> umista: um why?
[11:55] <paul0> umista: whoa!
[11:55] <JohnFlux> umista: your os will only see 3GB max of that
[11:55] <umista> trying to mount my sata
[11:55] <umista> yea and on my mobo bios it say i only have 3, but i heard that some board will say 3 but use all thre
[11:56] <umista> i get this error
[11:56] <umista> mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1,
[11:56] <umista> three>four
[11:56] <JohnFlux> umista: file -s /dev/sda1

[11:56] <H3g3m0n> umista: Both SATA, SCSI, USB, and also sometimes ide
[11:56] <eilker> fyrestrtr: what i wanna learn is, having 1 gb swap doesnt make things easy ?? addition to 512 mb ram
[11:56] <JohnFlux> tuna-fish-: oh uh yeah I should get with the tiems
[11:56] <JohnFlux> times
[11:56] <umista> wht does file -s /dev/sda1 mean?
[11:56] <JohnFlux> tuna-fish-: and I run 64bit myself ;-)
[11:56] <JohnFlux> umista: run that command and paste the output please
[11:57] <eilker> paul0: i use kubuntu
[11:57] <umista> /dev/sda1: writable, no read permission
[11:57] <JohnFlux> umista:   ls -la /dev/sda1

[11:58] <umista> brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 2006-12-01 11:47 /dev/sda1
[11:58] <H3g3m0n> umista: Also check the partitions are what should be on there with 'cfdisk /dev/sda' (make sure you don't change it though =)
[11:59] <JohnFlux> umista: oh heh
[11:59] <JohnFlux> umista: did you run mount as root?
[11:59] <JohnFlux> umista: with sudo
[11:59] <umista> yea
[11:59] <JohnFlux> umista: do:     sudo file -s /dev/sda1
[11:59] <umista> tryint to mount my raid 0 sata drive
[11:59] <JohnFlux> oh wait
[11:59] <JohnFlux> umista: this is raid?
[11:59] <umista> yea
[12:00] <umista> lol
[12:00] <JohnFlux> umista: do:     sudo file -s /dev/sda1          anyway
[12:00] <JohnFlux> umista: how did you create the raid setup?  hardware or software?
[12:01] <umista> in disk manager is says that i have a sda1 drive with 149gig space which is same size of my raid drive

[12:01] <bamboozle> hi! can some1 help me plz? i'm using dapper and i need to compile some s/w with a customized version of g77. but i don't want to downgrade the compilers (i need gcc-4xx for other s/w).
[12:01] <bamboozle>  i installed gcc-346 in my home and ran the sequense configure; make; make install for the new s/w. everything was ok until i tried to run the program. it's searching for libs of gcc-346 which are only in my home. if i copied then somewhere (where?) would it solve the problem?
[12:02] <elsebasbe> hi, if I had 3 processes called tell.exe, update.exe and another one *.exe, using all my cpu,could it be viruses?
[12:02] <tuedel> hi. any vnc- or xserver-specialists here?
[12:02] <tuedel> when i logged on to my second x-session (:1) via vnc from my local pc, i played around with it an minimized all windows (including the console, so now i've only got a blank grey window). how can i bring the console back?
[12:03] <elsebasbe> I suspect they where running via wine
[12:03] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: where are they on your hd?
[12:03] <JohnFlux> bamboozle: do export PATH=path_to_gcc-346_binary;$PATH
[12:03] <JohnFlux> bamboozle: replacing the path_to..  bit with your path
[12:03] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: dunno
[12:04] <bamboozle> JohnFlux, already done that
[12:04] <JohnFlux> elsebasbe: in linux?
[12:04] <JohnFlux> bamboozle: hmm
[12:04] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: oh sorry, misunderstood you there. yes, they where on my hd
[12:04] <elsebasbe> JohnFlux: yeah
[12:04] <elsebasbe> JohnFlux: ubuntu..
[12:04] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: yes, but where?
[12:04] <tuna-fish-> find them
[12:04] <iwkse> is still free to instal xen on edgy?
[12:05] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: might reveal a lot
[12:05] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: /home/elias/.wine/Program Files/
[12:05] <tuna-fish-> hmmm...
[12:05] <elsebasbe> and then {00000000-07DA-3081-{-{003d}
[12:05] <elsebasbe> and now Opera doesn't work..
[12:06] <JohnFlux> bamboozle: you might need to update /etc/ld.so.conf   to also point to the right place
[12:06] <iwkse> !xen
[12:06] <ubotu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[12:06] <JohnFlux> bamboozle: and maybe modify the link in /etc/alternatives/gcc
[12:06] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: any thoughts?
[12:06] <JohnFlux> bamboozle: not sure sorry
[12:06] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: I'm getting mixed stuff on that
[12:07] <bamboozle> JohnFlux, thanx anyway
[12:07] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: aha?
[12:07] <_ph00> does Evolution mail client send metadata with mail? what info? any link, suggested readings?
[12:07] <tuna-fish-> if it was in system32 it would definately be a trojan
[12:07] <elsebasbe> yeah
[12:07] <JohnFlux> umista: did you do that file commanD?
[12:07] <bliss_> hi
[12:07] <bamboozle> bye, ppl
[12:07] <umista> yea got this

[12:08] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: I'd probably just delete the files
[12:08] <JohnFlux> hmm
[12:08] <tuna-fish-> and kill the processes
[12:08] <bliss_> can some someone please recommend a good cd/dvd buring  software
[12:08] <elsebasbe> hm, now when I think about it, a friends msn sent me a link to a file that googled out to be a virus..
[12:08] <tuna-fish-> but dunno
[12:08] <JohnFlux> umista: well, it's ntfs alright
[12:08] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe:what all are you running on wine?
[12:08] <overrider> so im having this wierd thing: i cant connect to google.com. i can ping it, and when i connect to it via the pc of my neighbour, i can get to it, but from my ip at home i cannot open www.google.com anymore. curl www.google.com results in "curl: (52) Empty reply from server". is there any command i can use to clear the cash or something?
[12:08] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: now nothing
[12:09] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe:but do you usually use it for im clients or web browsers or something
[12:09] <JohnFlux> umista: echo p | fdisk /dev/sda    and check sda1  is marked as ntfs
[12:09] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: but usually when there is a file that I can't open I run it through wine :/
[12:09] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: nope
[12:09] <elsebasbe> never done
[12:10] <JohnFlux> umista: echo p | sudo fdisk /dev/sda    and check sda1  is marked as ntfs
[12:10] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: hmmm.. in theory a windows virus could run under wine like that
[12:10] <umista> Unable to open /dev/sda
[12:10] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: that was my thought too
[12:10] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: a bit clumsy of me :)
[12:10] <JohnFlux> umista: try the sudo one
[12:11] <Zaggynl> I like those new msn viruses which popped up latetly
[12:11] <Zaggynl> Clicking the link does exactly...nothing x-D
[12:11] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: never heard of it happening. well, it's a first. must be a hostile environment for the poor virus, not even a explorer.exe to restore it after it is gone ;)
[12:11] <elsebasbe> Zaggynl: linking you to a *.pic or something?
[12:11] <umista> dame
[12:11] <umista> same
[12:11] <Zaggynl> the exact message was:
[12:11] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: haha :D
[12:11] <Zaggynl> is this you? (emoticon) http://link.to.pictar
[12:12] <elsebasbe> Zaggynl: mine was like: check http://<similar link to what you had>
[12:12] <JohnFlux> Zaggynl: that's been around for over a year at list
[12:13] <Zaggynl> tisk, stupid it's still around :<
[12:13] <Zaggynl> brunch time!
[12:13] <JohnFlux> umista: i don't know why it doesn't mount.  it's ntfs  but you should have ntfs drivers installed
[12:13] <JohnFlux> umista:   sudo mount -t ntfs  /dev/sda1   /mnt/somewhere
[12:13] <ben_underscore> tuna-fish-: i've run an infected virus file under wine once, it was really funny
[12:13] <elsebasbe> lol, I got explorer.exe running too :D
[12:14] <umista> yea i have two other drives working fine
[12:14] <JohnFlux> umista: where somewhere is wherever you are mounting to
[12:14] <JohnFlux> elsebasbe: duuuuude
[12:14] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: unreal
[12:14] <falarcon> hola
[12:14] <elsebasbe> doh, forgot to check where it was hiding before I killed it
[12:14] <JohnFlux> elsebasbe: you know you can use  ps  to get the pid of a  process
[12:15] <JohnFlux> elsebasbe: then look in /dev/<pid>    for information
[12:15] <JohnFlux> uh
[12:15] <JohnFlux> elsebasbe: then look in /proc/<pid>    for information
[12:15] <JohnFlux> useful files in there are  environ   cmd   etc
[12:16] <elsebasbe> JohnFlux: ah okey, but to late now where I stoped it :/

[12:16] <ubotu> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot use this to build 32 bit environments on a 64 bit box
[12:17] <seth_> JohnFlux, a bit easier, I think, to use the  pidof  command.
[12:17] <JohnFlux> seth_: hmm yes
[12:18] <sheriff> i'm using dapper and how  can connect to a xp machine? i have a switcher and the other machine is connected to that switcher and it also has the internet but i cannot see that machine?
[12:18] <davvs> when i upgraded to edgy emacs got a really weird font, how do i fix this? anybody has idea?
[12:18] <JohnFlux> sheriff: what's a switcher?
[12:19] <sheriff> i have an adsl modem which has 4 outputs and it works like a router
[12:19] <elsebasbe> got a few file in the system32 dir too!
[12:19] <seth_> JohnFlux, he meant a switch  :)
[12:19] <elsebasbe> :D
[12:19] <sheriff> seth : yeah switch thats right :)
[12:19] <seth_> have to go, I'll reconnect from the office.
[12:20] <sheriff> JohnFlux : so is it possible to connect to that machine's shared folders?
[12:20] <tuna-fish-> elsebasbe: working for new ways for windows and linux to co-operate: now you can run windows viruses on linux too!
[12:20] <JohnFlux> sheriff: on the windows machine you need to get the ip
[12:20] <elsebasbe> tuna-fish-: it could be a big hit!
[12:21] <sheriff> JohnFlux: i know the ip address
[12:21] <JohnFlux> sheriff: it will tell you in the network properties in the control panel
[12:21] <burwaco> hello everyone !
[12:21] <elsebasbe> I should write a HowTo
[12:21] <JohnFlux> sheriff: on the linux machine, in konqueror go to     smb://<ip>
[12:21] <JohnFlux> burwaco: yo
[12:21] <burwaco> lolo 
[12:21] <JohnFlux> sheriff: uh or i guess you use gnome
[12:22] <JohnFlux> sheriff: not sure what it is in gnome sorry
[12:22] <sheriff> JohnFlux : i installed smp4k
[12:22] <burwaco> it's openweek isn't it ?
[12:22] <JohnFlux> sheriff: i have no idea what that is
[12:24] <sheriff> JohnFlux : http://smb4k.berlios.de
=== yama_awa` is now known as yama
[12:26] <sheriff> JohnFlux : i know that machine's ip address so then do i have to do anything else?
[12:26] <JohnFlux> sheriff: probably not
[12:26] <JohnFlux> sheriff: why not just use konqueror?
[12:27] <sheriff> JohnFlux : i have it
[12:28] <sheriff> JohnFlux : when i type smb://ip-address it returns with nothing i mean no folder is shown
[12:29] <JohnFlux> sheriff: hmm, i take it of course that you are sharing folders on the windows machine?
[12:30] <sheriff> JohnFlux: yeah i can see those folders on xp but on ubuntu cannot see them
[12:30] <burwaco> how do you add a cdrom to apt-cache again ??? I did "apt-cache add cdrom" but box didn't like it...
[12:32] <burwaco> "apt-cache add /media/cdrom" gives me "E: Unimplimented" ....
[12:32] <emxppp1> burwaco: apt-cdrom add
[12:33] <burwaco> emxppp1: , nice, thx
[12:33] <eragon_> hello, any idea how to change ident ?
[12:33] <stefg> Plastical surgery and a fake driving license ?
[12:33] <emxppp1> stefg: lol
[12:33] <eragon_> lol
[12:33] <eragon_> ...
[12:33] <eragon_> I mean in linux :)
[12:34] <Cammy> Heyas
[12:34] <infidel> anyone here know the internals of ubuntu
[12:34] <emxppp1> eragon_: what ident do you mean? the ident daemon?
[12:35] <emxppp1> eragon_: of the full name of the user account?
[12:35] <eragon_> emxppp1, no I want to change reply
[12:35] <eragon_> like now I have eragon
[12:35] <eragon_> i'm running oidentd but it's not working as it should
[12:35] <eragon_> I have global {reply "rico"}
[12:36] <eragon_> in my .oidentd.conf
[12:36] <eragon_> but it's not working....
[12:36] <emxppp1> eragon_: hmm. dunno. i use fakeidentd, i don't care about the ident reply.
[12:37] <eragon_> hm
[12:38] <Cammy> Could anyone help me, I want to install ubuntu onto my G3 Mac
=== CarNagE__ is now known as Carnage\
[12:39] <miyik> qualche italiano?
[12:39] <stefg> Cammy: get the alternate Install CD for PPC , make a small OS9 partition (you'll need it) aND THEN JUST INSTALL IT :-)
[12:39] <miyik> ho bisogno di aiuto
[12:39] <LacunaV> I'm having trouble figuring out which driver in linux-restricted-modules makes my wireless kill switch work. Trying to find the name of it so I can install it on another dist that doesn't have linux-restricted-modules. Any idea how I can do this?
[12:39] <stefg> oops, hit caps
[12:39] <miyik> qualche italiano?
[12:40] <stefg> !it
[12:40] <ubotu> Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[12:40] <Cammy> stefg: Is the CD available in the download section of the main site?
[12:40] <Cammy> I just couldn't find any reference to a PPC version there
[12:41] <stefg>  Cammy: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download
[12:41] <Cammy> Yeah, that's where I was... so it's the same download no matter which hardware you're installing it on?
[12:41] <stefg> No, of course not
[12:42] <stefg> Where are you on planet earth, Cammy ?
[12:42] <emxppp1> stefg: just curious, what is the OS9 partition good for?
[12:42] <Cammy> I found it
[12:42] <Cammy> Australia
[12:42] <Cammy> I just had to click the links and it expanded...
[12:43] <Geza> hallo everyone!
[12:43] <Cammy> Found the PPC version, download from Australia, sweet :)
[12:43] <Geza> mya you help me with edgy grub problem?
[12:43] <Geza> may you help me with edgy grub problem?
[12:43] <Cammy> Thanks, stefg
[12:43] <stefg> Macs don't have a BIOS, so yu need the os9 controlapplets to set your PRAM, like the video modes, and various other aspects
[12:44] <burwaco> my old armada 7800 and xubuntu are pretty close to make me have diarheea again...
[12:44] <emxppp1> stefg: oh..
[12:44] <Cammy> I hope it'll run alright on my iBook
[12:44] <Cammy> Crappy 800x600 resolution
[12:44] <stefg> i heard iBooks are well supported and people have fun with ubuntu on it
[12:45] <Cammy> Sweeeet
[12:45] <stefg> i'd rather go for dapper, tho.
[12:45] <emxppp1> Cammy: not much. well, my pentium 3 800 notebook has the strange resolution of 1024x600 :)
[12:45] <definate> Anyone know how I can get Evolution to run in the tray, and have the icon change when there is email to be read?
[12:45] <Cammy> It's just too hard for me to upgrade my iBook, the RAM is rare and expensive, it can't run OSX, and OS9 is totally unsupported these days
[12:46] <Cammy> That IS a strange resolution
[12:46] <Cammy> Then again I grew up using 640 x 256
[12:46] <stefg> Cammy: How much RAM do you have in there?
[12:46] <Cammy> 64mb
[12:46] <stefg> Uh,oh...
[12:46] <emxppp1> Cammy: you might try xbuntu instead of ubuntu. is uses xfce instead of gnome.
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[12:46] <Cammy> That's why I chose Ubuntu, probably the best choice for low RAM
[12:46] <Cammy> Okay
[12:46] <stefg> no real way for a graphical desktop... you could try xubuntu
[12:46] <Cammy> I hope there's a PPC version of that too then
[12:47] <Math^> hello all
[12:47] <maghat> Cammy: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop :)
[12:47] <webben> I played a movie with realplayer and then shut it down but the sound won't stop.
[12:47] <emxppp1> Cammy: oh, with 64mb ram even xfce won't run (the live cd). i guess you have to install from the alternate cd.
[12:47] <webben> There's no realplay process anymore. What can I kill?
[12:47] <Math^> can somone tell me how to connect to my shared folder from windows to ubuntu?
[12:47] <Cammy> maghat: I don't know how to do that
[12:47] <FriedCPU> for low ram system, maybe fluxbuntu, fluxbox instead of gnome/kde/xfce.  not sure if there is a ppc release though
[12:47] <apokryphos> Cammy: there is, yes.
[12:47] <webben> Math^, samba
[12:47] <apokryphos> but perhaps there won't be in the future
[12:47] <Cammy> Thanks FriedCPU, I'll look it up
[12:47] <Math^> webben, I've installed it
[12:47] <Cammy> Oh :(
[12:48] <maghat> Cammy: you type the command into a Terminal Window (in ubuntu)
[12:48] <Cammy> Would 128mb be alright for ubuntu though?
[12:48] <Math^> webben, when I want to connect and type my passwd it will not connect
[12:48] <webben> Math^, oh
[12:48] <Cammy> maghat: I have MacOS9
[12:48] <webben> Math^, that could be a lot of things :(
[12:48] <Cammy> There are no terminal windows
[12:48] <Math^> oh
[12:48] <Morgan> Math: You need to know the password for your Windows Guest account.
[12:48] <Math^> I use the same name and passwd as in linux
[12:48] <maghat> Cammy: sorry, I thought you had ubuntu
[12:49] <stefg> Cammy: just another 64MB (so you've got 128 in total) would make a big difference... an old 64MB strip shouldn't be too expensive
[12:49] <Geza> I installed ubuntu on 2nd drive, and grub to 1st drive's MBR. Everything looks good, but grub may not find /boot directory
[12:49] <Math^> ooh
[12:49] <emxppp1> Cammy: it would be enough for xubuntu. for ubuntu (gnome based) 128mb is too tight.
[12:49] <Math^> i need to set-up a geust ?
[12:49] <webben> Math^, I'd doublecheck the password settings for the share folder on windows
[12:49] <Morgan> If it isn't set you might not need a password at all.  Just try typing GUest as the username and leaving the password field blank.
[12:50] <maghat> Cammy: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/6.10/release/
[12:50] <Cammy> stefg: Unfortunately there's only one RAM slot
[12:50] <burwaco> doe any of you guys have a compaq armada 7800 (PII 300mhz laptop) ???
[12:50] <Math^> Morgan, it doesnt work :(
[12:50] <Cammy> So I'd need to find a 128MB 100pin SD RAM chip
[12:50] <emxppp1> maghat: no. on an older machine edgy is not recommended.
[12:50] <emxppp1> maghat: it is a g3 mac with 64mb ram.
[12:51] <Geza> or I dont, know why, but I can see "Grub loading Stage1.5 GRUB loading, please wait..."
[12:51] <webben> How can I restart the sound for Gnome?
[12:51] <Geza> and there is a propt
[12:51] <Geza> and there is a prompt
[12:51] <Cammy> I can't even find the right RAM on eBay, and no computer shops around here sell it
[12:51] <Geza> and nothing else happens
[12:51] <stefg> Cammy: ah, i see... but even 128 MB SO-DIMMs are around 50 $/EUR.... should be worth it
[12:51] <Math^> someone dutch in here?
[12:51] <stefg> !nl
[12:51] <ubotu> Nederlandstalige ondersteuning voor Ubuntu (en vers gezette koffie) is te vinden in #ubuntu-nl
[12:51] <Math^> ja
[12:52] <Math^> obotu jjij bent ook van 't forum he
[12:52] <burwaco> lekker
[12:52] <Morgan> Math: Are you running a firewall?  If so you may need permissions to access the IP address of the Windows machine you're trying to access.  I've found when I need to access Windows printers through Samba, it uses the guest account.  Network folder access worked out of the box for me but I'm guessing it's the same principal.
[12:52] <maghat> emxppp1: what's the difference between edgy or dapper??? *6 months* lol
[12:52] <Math^> Morgan,
[12:53] <bilss_> hi
[12:53] <emxppp1> maghat: edgy definitely consumes more ram
[12:53] <Cammy> stefg: I'll pay for one if I can just find one, no one has 100 pin SD RAM in Australia
[12:53] <Math^> I need to view my shared directory in linux
[12:53] <Math^> not the shared folders in windows
[12:53] <emxppp1> maghat: and the difference is 4 months, btw
[12:53] <burwaco> emxppp1: I dissagree
[12:53] <Math^> i cant connect to linux
[12:53] <bilss_> running K3B but it cannot find writer which is connected to usb ?
[12:53] <webben> Math^, oh ... then check the shared folder settings in linux
[12:54] <Math^> k
[12:54] <stefg> Cammy: look for a broken (intel) notebook.... you might get it at the price of its RAM :-)
[12:54] <Math^> webben, I'll take a look, thnx :)
[12:54] <maghat> Cammy: There is no linux that you could use comfortably (being used to MacOS 9) with that little RAM. Sorry about that...
[12:54] <webben> Math^, what windows are you connecting from btw?
[12:54] <Math^> XP
[12:54] <webben> Math^, and is this via domain or via workgroup?
[12:54] <Math^> domain
[12:54] <webben> Math^, ah XP shouldn't be /too/ bad.
[12:54] <Math^> and workgroup I gues
[12:54] <Math^> no, but I'm a noob u know :P
[12:54] <webben> Math^, hmm ... you need to make sure the machines are in the same workgroup then
[12:54] <Math^> when it comes to networks
[12:55] <Math^> thats ok
[12:55] <[A] ndy80> Hi
[12:55] <Math^> all the same :)
[12:55] <webben> Math^, I'm not much better. I hack at them until they work then try and forget about them.
[12:55] <Math^> blol
[12:55] <Cammy> Ill have to look into the laptop thing, thanks
[12:55] <Cammy> And yeah, it's a shame 64mb isn't enough for a comfortable Linux experience
[12:55] <maghat> emxppp1: I am talking about Xubuntu RAM usage, not Ubuntu's Gnome memory hogging. There is no noticeable difference between the two last releases in Xubuntu's memory usage as far as I have experienced.
[12:55] <webben> Math^, Does your Linux machine appear when you go browsing local network in Network Places?
[12:55] <burwaco> if edgy is not suited for older machines, why is there a xubuntu edgy release ?
[12:56] <Cammy> I wonder if QNX is available for PPC
[12:56] <Math^> webben, no
[12:56] <[A] ndy80> a simple question: in ubuntu 6.06 if I use qt3 applications, the application theme is fine, rounded ecc... If I run qt4 application the theme is ugly! It looks like the old tcl/tk interface (for progress bar, checkbox ecc...) how can i fix this?
[12:56] <Math^> maybe I can search for it
[12:56] <maghat> burwaco: exactly
[12:56] <emxppp1> maghat: ah okay
[12:56] <Math^> webben, WindowsXP found my linux-pc :D

[12:58] <tuna-fish-> Dumb scripting question: I want to have the name of every file in current dir and it's subdirs fed into the stdin, is there an easy way?
[12:58] <Math^> webben, in my search results I can see: laptop server(Samba, Ubuntu) (laptop) and just laptop with message unknown
[12:58] <maghat> It'a Mobile Pentium 4 1.7GHz with 1 Gb RAM btw, but it's still old ;)
[12:58] <[GuS] > ailean, i always say hi in french.. so please....
[12:58] <tuna-fish-> not possible with find, I think.
[12:58] <[GuS] > don't bother me :P
[12:59] <i7ch> "find ."
[12:59] <emxppp1> tuna-fish-: find .
[12:59] <burwaco> maghat: you don't have a clue what old is, have you...
[12:59] <ailean> [GuS] , well i've never seen you in my life, so don't bother me with that. you know the rules
[12:59] <emxppp1> tuna-fish-: or find . -type f   if you only want the regular files
[12:59] <tuna-fish-> dumb me.  I meant every file but a file whose name does NOT match the regulart expression. perhaps i should go to sleep
[12:59] <[GuS] > ailean, the rules don't say i can't say hi in other language
[01:00] <[GuS] > so DON'T bother me :)
[01:00] <webben> Math^, ah at least it sees it ... that's a start
[01:00] <i7ch> tuna-fish-, find the files that do match, then do a generic "find .", and pipe them to diff
[01:00] <apokryphos> [GuS] : this is an English only channel. If you can, please stick to English, yes.
[01:00] <emxppp1> tuna-fish-: find . | grep -v your_reg_exp
[01:00] <webben> Math^, there is a #samba channel, you might try asking there
[01:00] <i7ch> ...or what emxppp1
[01:00] <i7ch> said
[01:00] <ailean> [GuS] , they say that it's an english only channel
[01:00] <tuna-fish-> emxppl: thanks
[01:00] <[GuS] > apokryphos, sorry, but i am in many channels, so i do a mass msg.
[01:00] <apokryphos> [GuS] : ok, please don't.
[01:00] <ailean> [GuS] , well you don't need to say high
[01:00] <tuna-fish-> now whu didn't i think of grep...
[01:00] <[GuS] > i don't speak french then
[01:01] <ailean> high? ;) hi
[01:01] <[GuS] > ailean, i will, sorry :)
[01:01] <maghat> burwaco: I'm an IT consultant from Portugal so yes, I know.. I was just kidding ;) Still, I have successfully installed Mepis 3 Linux on 300MHz Celerons with 128Mb RAM. Less RAM and it was just too slow.
[01:01] <[GuS] > i always say hi.
[01:01] <Math^> webben, alright, thnx :)
[01:01] <[GuS] > is that bother you, ignore me
[01:01] <[GuS] > :)
[01:01] <i7ch> any idea? setting gnomebaker as default cd burning app?
[01:01] <burwaco> apokryphos: don't start flame war, ubuntu means "beeing human to one another"...
[01:01] <ailean> [GuS] , I might . . . :P
[01:01] <[GuS] > Good then
[01:01] <ailean> heh
[01:01] <LacunaV> I'm having trouble figuring out which driver in linux-restricted-modules makes my wireless kill switch work. Trying to find the name of it so I can install it on another dist that doesn't have linux-restricted-modules. Any idea how I can do this?
[01:02] <stefg> i7ch: type 'gnome-volume-properties' in a terminal
[01:02] <apokryphos> burwaco: I think you have an odd definition of flamewar, since that certainly wasn't starting one. We welcome discussion in other languages (I'm in two other locoteam channels myself), but they should be in the appropriate place.
[01:02] <[GuS] > so everybody happy and  will continue saying Hi in any language :D
[01:02] <maghat> I wish Gnome had a K3b clone!!!!!
[01:02] <apokryphos> burwaco: we can't moderate the discussion in the channel if we're not aware of the language, and we try to keep the languages to their respective demarcations. I don't think that's unreasonable.
[01:02] <apokryphos> maghat: there is one around somewhere
[01:02] <apokryphos> maghat: but it doesn't seem half as mature
[01:02] <i7ch> thanks stefg
[01:03] <jesusr> hi
[01:03] <stefg> maghat: i run k3b in gnome... except that you need the kde-lang-files and libs there's nothing wrong with it
[01:03] <Math^> webben, there's nobody there
[01:03] <Math^> :/
[01:03] <burwaco> apokryphos: the guy just said "hi"...
[01:03] <Math^> I mean... nobody act
[01:03] <maghat> I also wish Gnome had smaller widgets. It's just too "big" for 1024x768 resolution.
[01:03] <jesusr> how could i see all process and all users?
[01:03] <maghat> stefg: I know that :)
[01:03] <jesusr> under shell, of course
[01:03] <apokryphos> maghat: http://beranger.org/index.php?article=1221
[01:04] <apokryphos> burwaco: correct
[01:04] <Cammy> Can't you customise the look of Gnome?
[01:04] <Cammy> Add custome widgets?
[01:04] <apokryphos> of course you can
[01:04] <apokryphos> ubotu: themes
[01:04] <ubotu> Find your themes at: http://www.gnome-look.org - http://art.gnome.org - http://kdelook.org - http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/58/ - http://www.guistyles.com - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/ - Also see !changethemes and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
[01:04] <Cammy> custom
[01:04] <maghat> I usually have K/X/Ubuntu installed on the same machine
[01:04] <Cammy> I hope there's a nice looking theme for 800x600 resolutions
[01:04] <apokryphos> maghat: so why do you need a k3b-GTK replacement? :P
[01:04] <maghat> aprokryphos: thanks, nice link
[01:05] <apokryphos> Cammy: themes are generally resolution-independent
[01:05] <apokryphos> ubotu: tab | maghat :)
[01:05] <ubotu> maghat :): You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[01:05] <hastesaver> How do I configure whether or not /tmp gets cleared at boot?
[01:05] <maghat> aprokyphos: because I don't like graphical toolkit promiscuity :D
[01:05] <jonah1980> thoggen is a really cool dvd ripper but then how can you burn the ogg file to a dvd to play on dvd player?
[01:05] <apokryphos> maghat: looks pretty clear to me. Nice little quick options. Edit it to have whatever you want
[01:05] <apokryphos> only one click to burn DVD, CD ISO, etc
[01:06] <maghat> apokryphos: You mean K3b ?
[01:06] <Cammy> Are they vector widgets or bitmap?
[01:06] <apokryphos> maghat: yes
[01:07] <Cammy> I'm sorry but I really don't know much about Linux yet, please excuse my ignorance
[01:07] <dm_> Hello. I want to crop a small area from a .ps or .pdf file and save as a new gs/pdf on ubuntu. The package pdftk doesn't seem to support this. Where can I find some info about those operations? Does anyone know an irc channel for postscript/ghostscript related things?
[01:07] <apokryphos> Cammy: no problem
[01:07] <apokryphos> Cammy: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[01:08] <maghat> apokryphos:  I know K3b very well, I just wish it was native gnome. I mean, I can make it look like a gnome app, but it doesn't feel like a gnome app (because it isn't)
[01:08] <stefg> Cammy: watch out.... a lot of eye-candy and 64MB of RAM are mutually exclusive...
[01:08] <scheuri> g'day all
[01:08] <hastesaver> dm_, I don't know, but I think the package flpsed might help. Take a look
[01:08] <apokryphos> maghat: kde apps are like that; they're allergic to ugliness!! </troll>
[01:08] <maghat> maybe I should go back to slackware and worry about more basic stuff :D
[01:09] <Cammy> Thanks apokryphos
[01:09] <Cammy> stefg: I'm determined to find a 128MB SO-DIMM now
[01:09] <maghat> apokryphos: so you are a fellow kubuntista
[01:09] <apokryphos> indeed
[01:09] <infidel> maghat, i did
[01:09] <[A] ndy80> oh... just a little bug: if you install qt4, qt4 designer, qt4 assistant ecc.... these application are not added to the Application Menu
=== _glitch- is now known as glitch-
[01:10] <maghat> apokryphos: So am I. KIO Slave forever lol
[01:10] <stefg> Cammy: good idea... and then take the xubuntu-alternate installer to build a swift and nice xubuntu machine out of your iBook :-)
[01:10] <hastesaver> Is it possible to specify that /tmp does not get cleared at boot? (IIRC, Mandriva had this option...)
[01:10] <apokryphos> w00t
[01:11] <maghat> infidel: and you does it feel?
[01:11] <dm_> hastesaver: Thank you. I'll have a look ...
[01:11] <infidel> maghat, back linux
[01:11] <maghat> infidel: it's been like... 10 years since my slackware days
[01:11] <infidel> maghat, back to linux
[01:12] <burwaco> I'm getting the xubuntu alternate cd now formy armada 7800, 7 minutes left...
[01:12] <infidel> maghat, lol which version?
[01:12] <Cammy> Okay :)
[01:13] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> hey guys, my friend just installed ubuntu server edition which does come with gnome by default. however, he also has the ubuntu desktop cd
[01:13] <maghat> infidel: I don't know, I used to install it from a 50+ 3.5" disk pile!
[01:13] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> what i want to know is where are the gnome packages on the install cd
[01:13] <infidel> maghat, wow my first slackware was 3.2
[01:13] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> im not a ubuntu guy, i know slackware better
[01:14] <maghat> infidel: but I remember the kernel version: 0.9.13 was a very good one..
[01:14] <stefg> burwaco: i have an Armada700 running xubuntu... nice lil' box.. the first linux install ever i did, where i didn't have to touch a single config after the default install. Everything just worked out of the box
=== tunga is now known as pAxpAcis
[01:14] <infidel> maghat, damn that a while back
[01:15] <hastesaver> hubb4hubb4hubb4, do "apt-cdrom add" and then the cd becomes a repository and apt-get install will install from the cd if available
[01:15] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> oooh nice
[01:15] <maghat> infidel: I even shelled out $150 for a 4Mb RAM upgrade so I could run XWindows... aahh, C programming in Emacs on a 40MHz 486 from AMD lol
[01:15] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> that helps
[01:16] <infidel> maghat, you still code?
[01:16] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> also something else funky with the box is that i get no output from 'lspci'
[01:16] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> under ubuntu
[01:16] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> but under knoppix 5.something, i get the proper output
[01:17] <maghat> infidel: Yes, it's my job actually, even if I tend to do it less because of managerial duties
[01:17] <infidel> maghat, you still enjoy it?
[01:17] <dm_> hastesaver: I checked flpsed but there's no function crop or similar. You only can add text to an existing ps doc.
[01:17] <dm_> Does anyone know another ps editor/cropper?
[01:18] <maghat> infidel: I still enjoy coding, but I tend to enjoy easier/faster development tools as I grow old. I'm 33 btw
[01:18] <maghat> infidel: and there is a lack of those on Linux
[01:19] <infidel> maghat, yeah i get that from a lot of coders
[01:19] <hastesaver> Not from Real Programmers (TM), though ;-)
[01:19] <maghat> infidel: r u a coder too?
[01:20] <infidel> maghat, i think that's what pushes people away from open source
[01:20] <infidel> maghat, i wished
[01:20] <maghat> infidel,  that and a lack of a dominant language to program in
[01:21] <infidel> maghat, what about c
[01:21] <apokryphos> as so many people say, we need a vbscript of Linux
[01:21] <apokryphos> there's some talk in KDE of trying to push for python; by making it the primary scripting language
[01:21] <infidel> real make a vb for linux
[01:22] <infidel> qt is visual c++ right?
[01:22] <scheuri> vb for linux? as if there not enough languages...
[01:22] <infidel> lol
[01:22] <scheuri> infidel: no, it is NOT visual c++...its "just" c++
[01:22] <maghat> infidel: c is the best. But the development cycle is somewhat slow because of diy memory management and the lack of GUI standard
[01:23] <apokryphos> scheuri: no, as in "an equivalent of vbscript on Windoze"
[01:23] <apokryphos> i.e. a primary higher-level language
[01:23] <infidel> maghat, yeah wish i knew more about coding
[01:23] <scheuri> hm...
[01:23] <infidel> scheuri, did not know that
[01:23] <maghat> infidel: there is an equivalent of VB for linux. it's gambas. Very nice, but not cross-platform ( no Windows version possible)
[01:23] <scheuri> infidel: easy...that is why I told you...;)
[01:24] <kaminix> I have a quick question. I'm about to download Edgy, and want a CD which can install a very basic system, allowing me to choose between xubuntu, kubuntu, ubuntu and edubuntu after install by downloading Desktop Packages. Do I want the Alternate CD or the Server CD?
[01:24] <scheuri> maghat: not cross-platform? perfect match...;)....vb isnt either
[01:24] <maghat> infidel: actually gambas is targeted at amateur programmers
[01:24] <apokryphos> but then there's efforts like kross in Koffice
[01:24] <apokryphos> which is pretty dang good too, I guess
[01:24] <infidel> maghat, is it a good language to start with?
[01:25] <maghat> scheuri: that's a good tag line, but every business user in my country runs Windows
[01:25] <TheMafia> does dist-upgrade upgrade the enter distribution to the next versino, ie from dapper to edgy?
[01:25] <scheuri> wait wait...how can be a language for amateur programmers? I mean...it is too easy to read/write? is it not able to do system stuff?
[01:25] <hastesaver> TheMafia, no.
[01:25] <apokryphos> TheMafia: it's not recommended, for this release.
[01:25] <scheuri> !upgrade
[01:25] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:25] <apokryphos> TheMafia: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[01:25] <scheuri> maghat: may I ask where you from?
[01:26] <infidel> maghat, what country?
[01:26] <maghat> infidel: I haven't done any actual coding with gambas, I have read the source code for some examples and it is nice and simple. But if you are an absolute beginner I strongly suggest you try Python
[01:26] <sleng> hey I cant login to the cvs.sourceforge.net server, it prompts for a password and kick me after 2trys
[01:26] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> hatesaver: do you know of any reason why lspci wouldnt be giving me any output in ubuntu, but knoppix does?
[01:26] <carl_> I've booted up with my usb flash memory device plugged in and I see that it is mounted at /media/usbdisk  Question:  How do I umount it, (in order to safely remove)?
[01:26] <maghat> scheuri: Portugal, in the EU
[01:26] <carl_> I'm new to the 2.6 kernel.
[01:26] <hubb4hubb4hubb4> Portugal!
[01:26] <infidel> maghat, ok good idea
[01:26] <scheuri> maghat: oh, portugal is completely MS? wow....I surely do not want to join EU then...;)
[01:27] <apokryphos> Europe is generally a lot more accepting of Open Source than America, for sure.
[01:27] <carl_> Do you just yank it out? or does one need to first umount usbdrive?
[01:27] <maghat> scheuri, Completely MS client side, not on the server side
[01:27] <scheuri> maghat: wow...harsh
[01:27] <stefg> carl_: right click on the device icon on the desktop and choose 'remove'
[01:28] <TheMafia> where can I read if edgy is ready for my machine or not, I remember someone saying it was quite problematic a few weeks back
[01:28] <stefg> !hardware
[01:28] <ubotu> For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[01:28] <carl_>  stefg Do not have a "device icon' on my desktop
[01:28] <carl_> oh... I do.
[01:28] <stefg> :-)
[01:28] <carl_> It's behind another icon
[01:28] <sod75_> TheMafia: updates have had some issues, clean installs were genreally speaking fine
[01:28] <carl_> didn't see it :)
[01:28] <maghat> scheuri, the portuguese (like many other europeans) are communication addicts. They are addicted to cell phones and MSN Messenger. Yes, I'm serious ;)
[01:29] <stefg> !offtopic
[01:29] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:29] <TheMafia> sod75_, thanks, I want to try xgl, is that in edgy?
[01:29] <sleng> hey I cant login to the cvs.sourceforge.net server, it prompts for a password and kick me after 2trys
[01:29] <scheuri> maghat: I know THAT actually...:)....msn everywhere....literally

=== C3__P is now known as Misterius
[01:29] <hastesaver> maghat, so? Gaim works with MSN :-)
=== ubuntu is now known as phlasphy
[01:29] <TheMafia> thanks
[01:29] <maghat> The Mafia, I'be been running edgy for a week now, at it seems better than Dapper in all respects
[01:29] <Martyo> where do I put my SSH private key file so I can connect to my remote linux web server? I tried /home/<username>/.ssh/ but when I connect to my server using SSH it doesn't use the key
=== SpComb^__ is now known as SpComb
[01:30] <carl_> Next Question:   I notice that it is mounting the usbdisk ro.  How can I remount it rw?
[01:30] <hastesaver> Martyo, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys works
[01:30] <TheMafia> maghat, did you do a full install or upgrade?  I want to try an upgrade.  Being a former redhat person I am excited to upgrade and it work :)
[01:30] <stefg> TheMafia: you might want to know that on my system the installation of the latest nvidia-beta-drivers and beryl broke openoffice on edgy
[01:30] <ncncncncnc> Got an ubuntu recovery question; I have an ext2 hd which (after an interrupted dist-upgrade) will boot but not start gdm (I can use a shell there, but hardware recognition is very limited; no USB access); but I can't mount it under knoppix to copy those files to a USB (won't recognize file type).
[01:30] <apokryphos> Martyo: there's a nice howto on ssh keys at http://hacks.oreilly.com/pub/h/66
[01:30] <Martyo> hastesaver: thanks, I'll try that now
[01:31] <Martyo> apokryphos: thanks
[01:31] <sod75_> Martyo: if it's not the default name ( i believe "Identity" ) you can specify to use it with ssh -i your_key hostname
[01:31] <carl_> In other words, How can I write to the usbdisk?
[01:31] <maghat> hastesaver: Yes, but it doesn't do the fancy things people like in MSN.. voice and video chat, cute animated avatars, silly smileys and the works lol
[01:31] <sleng> Is there something im missing im trying to download e17 from the sourceforge cvs server but i cant login
[01:31] <hastesaver> maghat, I would consider that a feature ;-)
[01:32] <maghat> TheMafia: full install of Ubuntu edgy, then installed Xubuntu and Kubuntu on top of it. Great so far
[01:32] <maghat> hastesaver: mostly everyone else wouldn't though
[01:32] <netpython> maghat, kopete does
[01:33] <maghat> netpython: kopete is a lot better than Gaim, at least MSN wise. But not nearly everything the newer MSN does
[01:33] <stefg> ncncncncnc: have you tried to dpkg --configure -a from the command line? that should finish (if possible) the dist-upgrade
[01:33] <apokryphos> yeah. At least kopete has webcam support now
[01:33] <netpython> maghat, and what about bitlbee?
[01:34] <apokryphos> it's still not quite perfected though, unfortunately.
[01:34] <maghat> have you actually tried to use MSN messenger? I mean, it FEELS a lot better to use than either Gaim or Kopete
[01:34] <scheuri> apokryphos: well, some people think that was not a good idea...to implement this feature
[01:34] <netpython> forutunately there's allways work to do:-)
[01:34] <apokryphos> scheuri: why do you think that?
[01:34] <scheuri> apokryphos: weeeeelll....people get to SEE each other...;)
[01:34] <apokryphos> maghat: I actually hate a *lot* of stuff regarding msn messenger's usability
[01:34] <ncncncncnc> stefg: I've tried continuing with apt-get in various forms; I'll give that a go.
=== dm_ is now known as dm_|afk
[01:34] <apokryphos> maghat: *especially* the latest one
[01:34] <maghat> netpython: I don't know about bitlbee, gotta check it out.
[01:35] <discoloda> who said anyone wants to see me?
[01:35] <Martyo> sod75_: thanks, that worked
[01:35] <apokryphos> scheuri: how awful!
[01:35] <netpython> maghat, haven't used msn messenger for a long time, does it still have adware?
[01:35] <scheuri> apokryphos: well, it MIGHT be...;)
[01:35] <apokryphos> netpython: it does
[01:35] <maghat> apokryphos: I agree, but it's still *fun* to use
[01:35] <netpython> apokryphos, that's not so good though....
[01:36] <hastesaver> apokryphos, that link doesn't mention how to use ssh-agent, or what it is. (I don't know myself; too lazy to look it up). Also there is no need to use authorized_keys2 and the like, you can just append to authorized_keys
[01:36] <scheuri> netpython: well, if I'd be hars I said yes...with adware...called microsoft windows...but, well...I am in a good mood...so I wont say anything
[01:36] <maghat> netpython: Yes it does. Even more now, but you barely notice it.
[01:36] <apokryphos> hastesaver: sure... but it's very straightforward, and works just fine.
[01:36] <burwaco> !nl
[01:36] <ubotu> Nederlandstalige ondersteuning voor Ubuntu (en vers gezette koffie) is te vinden in #ubuntu-nl
[01:37] <netpython> maghat, yeah if you have a nice chat with someone it's not that irritating i guess
[01:37] <carl_> Never mind.  I just ejected and unplugged and plugged it back in again and it mounted rw this time, (aparrently - was able to write to it this time).
[01:37] <apokryphos> I've got a quite comprehensive ad-blocker list in my Konqueror, too, I see :P
[01:37] <carl_> Thanks all.
[01:37] <hastesaver> apokryphos, so I can continue using the manual "cat >> ..." method and there is no risk in not learning ssh-agent? Nice to know that :-)
[01:38] <apokryphos> having an extra authorized_keys2 won't kill you, trust me :P

[01:40] <poolkey172> Hi does anyone know how to remove KDE session data ? I want it so that it doesnt remember my previous state
[01:40] <maghat> That's why I use KDE more, even if crashes on me a lot more than Gnome. It feels faster, smarter, funnier.
[01:40] <sleng> sod75_: you know what port sourceforge uses_
[01:40] <sod75_> sleng: no, sorry

[01:45] <apokryphos> !sound
[01:45] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[01:56] <ndlovu_> hi all. If I'm using a centrino duo processor, is there any point in installing the 686 smp kernel, or is generic as good?
[01:56] <sfeddy> How do you set the environment variables for LD_LIBRARY_PATH when you start a command ("python wxPyDemo.py") by clicking on a link on the desktop?  The wx library is not on the ordinary path.
[01:56] <maghat> raghu206: look for an option called "CLONE" copy. That should ignore the cd contents and copy the whole thing blindly
[01:56] <burhan> ndlovu_: with generic, your duo will be running solo
[01:57] <infidel> where is the ubuntu source code?

[01:59] <variant> KomiaPoika: did you specify the default gateway?
[01:59] <KomiaPoika> variant: i just did now, let me see if that fixes it
[02:00] <maghat> raghu206: you mean actually watch the video in linux?
[02:00] <variant> KomiaPoika: route add default gw <ip>
[02:00] <w3ccv> KomiaPoika, do you have a default router - use netstat -rn  to see

[02:00] <stojance> I just created a new user and it doesn't allow executing firefox (Permission Denied). How do I fix this?
[02:01] <maghat> Try totem, but Im not sure it can do VideoCD. If it doesn't i know MPlayer does (sudo apt-get install mplayer)
[02:01] <cyzie> how do i check whether my current sata disk partition is in primary or extended??
[02:01] <sod75_> cyzie: gparted is a nice gui partitioning tool
[02:01] <raghu206> maghat, thanks for ur help
[02:02] <maghat> raghu206: :)
[02:02] <cyzie> sod75_, how about cli ?
[02:02] <w3ccv> cycom, sudo fdisk
[02:02] <sod75_> cyzie: cli , try cfdisk
[02:02] <stojance> can someone help? ^^^
[02:02] <cyzie> sod75_, thanks
[02:03] <dcordes> stojance: you can most likely solve this by giving that user access to your firefox folder
[02:03] <stojance> ok
[02:03] <maghat> raghu206: I've just checked and I think totem does read VideoCD, so give it a try first.
[02:03] <raghu206> maghat, ok
[02:03] <abo> to install the Eclipse CDT (c++) plugin, I download the deb package from the eclipse site and install it using dpkg -i or is there an aptitude way to do it?
[02:04] <stojance> Details: Failed to execute child process "firefox" (Permission denied)
[02:04] <maghat> abo, why don't you install from Eclipse itself?
[02:04] <mypapit> fakap !!!!
[02:04] <cyzie> sod75_, othe rthan cfdisk is there any other cli ?
[02:04] <dcordes> stojance: you can also change the rights of your new user
[02:05] <mamzers555> when will gnome 2.16.2 be available in edgy?
[02:05] <stojance> I did! I enabled everything!
[02:05] <maghat> cyzie: fdisk
[02:05] <dcordes> stojance: to be honest: i don't know too much about user rights
[02:05] <dcordes> take a look at the wiki
[02:06] <abo> maghat, where from in eclipse?
[02:06] <sod75_> stojance: did you install ff from the repositories, then it should be available for all users
[02:06] <stojance> I kinda fixed it, I added gksudo to the launcher and now it works, but it asks for the password
[02:06] <stojance> ok
[02:07] <maghat> I don't have eclipse installed on my edgy box, but I usually install plugins from within eclipse, search for plugins in the menus (far right side)
[02:09] <maghat> abo, I'm apt-getting eclipse right now

[02:29] <[pC] Molitov> hey all
[02:29] <[pC] Molitov> whats the minimum requirments to run Ubuntu smootly?
=== selphie72 is now known as rainyrhythm
[02:30] <diskus> ~512MB of ram
[02:30] <diskus> depends on what you want to do with it
[02:30] <[pC] Molitov> just an average user laptop
[02:30] <sysrage> i have it running smoothly on a p3 900 laptop with only 384 mb ram.
[02:30] <DevC> IdleOne: that looks like them :o
[02:31] <diskus> Well I guess 256MB of ram is enough for just surfing and openoffice
[02:31] <[pC] Molitov> laptop is about: 700mhz, 128mb of ram
[02:31] <IdleOne> DevC,  well give it a shot
[02:31] <[pC] Molitov> and yes its old
[02:31] <diskus> [pC] Molitov: you can try xubuntu
[02:31] <diskus> !xubuntu
[02:31] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[02:31] <maghat> yes, 512MB to be comfortable, 1GB to be at ease.
[02:31] <sysrage> 128mb would suck even with win 3.11
=== yama is now known as yama_away

[02:32] <diskus> [pC] Molitov: gnome is more like XP, xfce4 is more like 2000 :P

[02:33] <sysrage> mount hdc1 in /home/ftp

[02:36] <CoRnJuLiOx> i've got 10 gb apportioned for my /home dir, and 7 of it is used
[02:36] <jrib> CoRnJuLiOx: have you tried apt-cache search baobab?
[02:36] <CoRnJuLiOx> i wanna know whats taking up space
[02:36] <CoRnJuLiOx> jrib: nope
[02:36] <jrib> CoRnJuLiOx: (it's in gnome-utils)

[02:37] <IdleOne> CoRnJuLiOx, open a terminal and type du -h /home
[02:38] <CoRnJuLiOx> sysrage: any way to dump this to a file and re-order the entries according to filesize?

[02:38] <jrib> CoRnJuLiOx: what happens
[02:39] <CoRnJuLiOx> bash: baobab: command not found
[02:39] <jrib> CoRnJuLiOx: are you using edgy?
[02:39] <CoRnJuLiOx> 6.06

[02:43] <IdleOne> DevC,  ahh ok then
[02:44] <emxppp1> CoRnJuLiOx: no obscure gnome tool needed. just the good old find command.
[02:44] <DevC> but when I do that and enter my sudo password it says I'm not authorized and denies me
[02:44] <sysrage> enter pass of the user you're logged in as
[02:44] <constrictor> after installing Edgy server how do i get a graphical user interface is it ubuntu-desktop or gnome-desktop

[02:45] <jrib> ubotu: tell DevC about sudo
[02:45] <sysrage> sudo != su
[02:45] <thevenin_> !sudo | DevC

[02:48] <CoRnJuLiOx> :-( i still cant find baobab.
[02:48] <bezibaerchen> constrictor: yes, it was
[02:49] <jrib> DevC: you should probably do sudo checkinstall anyway
[02:49] <diskus> I didn't like ubuntu-server at all, there's some strange default settings, like some curses problem, last time I tried it
[02:49] <jrib> CoRnJuLiOx: did the 'baobab' package install?
[02:49] <finferflu> CoRnJuLiOx: what is baobab?
[02:49] <CoRnJuLiOx> nope
[02:49] <thevenin_> diskus: what version did you try
[02:49] <jrib> ubotu: tell DevC about checkinstall
[02:49] <CoRnJuLiOx> searching for it in synaptic brings nothing up
[02:49] <emxppp1> DevC: why building from source anyway? isn't there a package?
[02:49] <thevenin_> because i was not happy with ubuntu server 6.10
[02:49] <constrictor> have you installed a GUI with it?
[02:49] <jrib> CoRnJuLiOx: pastebin your sources.list please
[02:49] <diskus> thevenin_: well it was more than 6 months ago, don't remember what version was it, maybe 5.10
[02:49] <mirek> hello
[02:49] <CoRnJuLiOx> where do i get my sources list?

[02:50] <diskus> thevenin_: anyway I prefer debian for servers, mostly because I have some extensive knowledge about debian :P
[02:50] <thevenin_> ya
[02:50] <DevC> emxpppl: not for allegro you have to compile it for all unix ones if you want to keep it uptodate

[02:53] <diskus> xenoix: hmm.. you have same setup in windows, like 192.168.0.2 as ip?
[02:53] <xenoix> well
[02:53] <xenoix> in windows it hass it automatically assign it
[02:53] <bezibaerchen> constrictor: no, nothing beneath webmin, as my opionion is, that servers shouldn't need gui at all

[02:57] <thevenin_> DevC: sudo passwd
[02:58] <apokryphos> thevenin_: please do not advise that. Please link to the FAQ or entry on the faq
[02:58] <apokryphos> *entry on the wiki
[02:58] <thevenin_> ok, but may i ask why
[02:58] <chronic1> DevC: do NOT set a root passwd
[02:58] <DevC> why?
[02:59] <apokryphos> thevenin_: yes. Because Ubuntu by default uses the sudo model, and has the su model disabled by default. Hence, we recommend the sudo model.
[02:59] <apokryphos> DevC: read those links.
[02:59] <chronic1> DevC: ubuntu is setup so that you do not need a to use root
[02:59] <diskus> xenoix: nope, don't know anything about cable
[02:59] <thevenin_> thank apokryphos
[02:59] <diskus> xenoix: but I guess you have to read a bit more about dhcp
[03:00] <xenoix> well
[03:00] <xenoix> if you know how to do wireless
[03:00] <xenoix> im not complaining
[03:00] <DevC> ok....guess that is handy since I don't have to log in as root to update and upgrade just do sudo....it is much easier....forget I asked

[03:19] <Lapfunc> what's the best tool for making and restoring images of partitions?
[03:19] <eloque> sup everybody... where in ubuntu can i find all the installed programs?
[03:19] <ezenu3> dbe, that hasn't been released yet. still in development
[03:19] <apokryphos> eloque: a list of the installed programs?
[03:19] <thevenin> eloque: most likely /etc/
[03:19] <apokryphos> eloque: dpkg -l
[03:19] <dbe> Lapfunc, GNU PARTED to make and testdisk to restore
[03:19] <sod75_> dbe: that's the next one, currently in developpement
[03:19] <eloque> there are some programs that i just installed thru the add remove thingy but they dont show up??
[03:20] <eloque> do i have to reboot?
[03:20] <apokryphos> thevenin: no, that's just for some applications' configurations.
[03:20] <eloque> i want a graphical list not like in the terminal
[03:20] <apokryphos> eloque: no, you don't have to reboot. What did you install?
[03:20] <thevenin> yes, realize that now after saying it
[03:20] <apokryphos> eloque: ........check the gnome menu.
[03:20] <sod75_> eloque: no, no reboot needed, but you may have to add the menu item yourself for some apps
[03:20] <Lapfunc> dbe: oh parted ghosts drives?  didn't know that
[03:20] <eloque> i installed gnome chm viewer
[03:20] <eloque> i think
[03:21] <eloque> some other things
[03:21] <dbe> Lapfunc, You want the latest version of testisk to restore if you want to be able to list the files in the partitions from a list
[03:21] <masura> hih
[03:22] <apokryphos> eloque: alt+f2 -> gnochm
[03:22] <apokryphos> for the gnome chm viewer
[03:22] <Rprp> Hmmm, can somone help me? If i play games the sound comes 3 seconds later :/
[03:22] <Lapfunc> dbe: can't find any ghosting functionality in the parted manual...
[03:23] <dbe> Lapfunc, PARTED to create and testdisk to restore as said...

[03:23] <dbe> Lapfunc, testdisk <--- package.
[03:23] <Lapfunc> dbe: i don't see any creation of partition images in the parted manual either
[03:23] <buddhi> need help compiling g-wrap
[03:23] <buddhi> please
[03:23] <Lapfunc> maybe we're not on the same page here
[03:24] <eloque> i installed gnome chm viewer but cant see it anywhere
[03:24] <poolkey172> eloque: run it from the terminal
[03:25] <Lapfunc> dbe: you think i want to create partitions and repair them don't you?
[03:26] <eloque> sorry to ask this... but how do i run it from terminal?
[03:26] <dbe> Lapfunc, I think you want to making and restoring images of partitions.
[03:26] <buddhi> if you have it in the synaptic manager
[03:26] <buddhi> you should be able to search in the synaptic manager
[03:26] <dbe> Lapfunc, You want like Norton Ghost or what?
[03:26] <buddhi> if you installed it through synaptic manager i.e.
[03:26] <Lapfunc> does anyone use any ghost software like ghost for linux or partimage?  i'm using partimage at the moment, but when i restore my root partition from an image, hardware settings are missing.
[03:26] <buddhi> then you will see a list of installed files there
[03:27] <Lapfunc> dbe: there's nothing about images at all in either parted or testdisk manuals
[03:27] <McMadd> Hello all, I've got a fully configured Ubuntu machine which I need to replicate (clone) to a lot of other identical machines. Been goofing around with Ghost but it won't work. Any suggestions? (I'm not a Linux guy yet, so maybe there's an easy answer :-)

[03:27] <LacunaV> Anyone have any experience on what modules are in linux-regis
[03:27] <dbe> Lapfunc, I moved / to /tmp when I was running / as system so you should be able to tar / to /image.tar.gz for instance and untar it when you feel for it.
[03:28] <buddhi> how do I compile g-wrap 1.9.6 on ubuntu 5.10
[03:28] <Lapfunc> dbe: hm...
[03:28] <Lapfunc> dbe: interesting
[03:28] <buddhi> I need to do this to compile gnucash
[03:28] <buddhi> 2.0.2
[03:28] <dbe> LacunaV, Untar it in the partitions mountpoint after you have removed the files. I have not tried this but is kind of sure that it works.
[03:28] <LacunaV> Anyone have any experience on what modules are in linux-restricted-modules? I'm trying to isolate which module is making my wireless kill switch work.
[03:28] <Seatux__> anyone here is using a D Link router, specifically a wireless one?
[03:29] <LacunaV> Sorry for the accidental spammingx2
[03:29] <dbe> Lapfunc, If nothing else, boot a live cd and make the operation from there (100% safe).
[03:29] <Lapfunc> dbe: sounds like it would work.  i'll try it, thanks :)
[03:30] <McMadd> I think my question might be related to the discussion of dbe and Lapfunc...

[03:32] <dxdemetriou> if I have one program created with checkinstall and later it is on repos, must I remove the previous first or it did it alone the apt-get?
[03:33] <ProN00b> McMadd, you can use dd (elementary linux utility) with netcat (swiss army knife for networking) to copy the whole disk/partition over
[03:34] <dbe> McMadd, Tar / (root), boot a live cd, remove the files from the partition (except the tar file), untar the file in the partition. And you are not a Linux guy soon, you are a GNU/Linux guy soon.
[03:34] <Lapfunc> would that work if you move it to dissimilar hardware though?

[04:05] <wy> Hi, I want to know how to reinstall grub, because I'm going to reinstall windows XP in the first partition and it will remove grub.
[04:05] <apokryphos> ubotu: grub | wy
[04:05] <ubotu> wy: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[04:05] <apokryphos> also, more generally:
[04:05] <crys> xamox: screen might do what you wish (if I understand what you are tyring to achieve)
[04:05] <finferflu> I love that bot
[04:05] <apokryphos> wy: take a look at the FAQ (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions) as linked to in the channel /topic
[04:05] <finferflu> :D
[04:06] <xamox> crys:  alright, thx I'll look into it.

[04:07] <wy> apokryphos: Thank you very much!
[04:07] <xamox> crys:  do I have to run screen first, or is it possible to run screen on a process that is already started?
[04:08] <zOap> I updated firefox to v2 through one of the scripts available. Now I can't get java to work,I'm using dapper... anyone know what to do?
[04:09] <crys> xamox: I'm not aware of how to attach to an already running process in that way - so my answer is yes; you need to start screen first
[04:09] <xamox> crys:  alright, thx.
[04:10] <wy> And another question. I want to disable the touch pad buttons on the near end of my Thinkpad because I will sometimes trigger it by mistake. But I don't want to disable the touch pad. How can I do that?

[04:41] <Joakim> But it was something wrong with the source code in Wine
[04:41] <hastesaver> riazi, but the flags you set have to be "global" -- they can't be part of the script, because they have to be accessible when you call it the next time

[04:54] <LadyNikon> LjL: no clue.
[04:54] <egoleo> what language
[04:55] <Phoenix7477> a wide variety, but i think its mostly written in c++..
[04:55] <LadyNikon> egoleo: i think there is a ubuntu dev channel. That may be a better place to ask.
[04:55] <febuiles> Any language you like, Ubuntu is not a monolithic project a but a set of packages packed into a distribution.
[04:55] <LjL> LadyNikon: well, it isn't written in any specific language. Most Gnome programs (and the Gnome/GTK libraries themselves) are written in C, while it's mostly C++ for KDE. Many Ubuntu-specific thingies are written in Python. And then more.
[04:55] <LjL> Phoenix7477: i doubt that
[04:55] <Joakim> Ah, C++ :D
[04:55] <LjL> oh, and Linux is C
[04:56] <kaptengu> nothing is written in assembler?
[04:56] <egoleo> and can i get the channel
[04:56] <kaptengu> nvm
[04:56] <aberry5555> does anyone know how to make m4a work in rythmbox?
[04:56] <LjL> kaptengu: small parts of Linux and Grub, i suppose
[04:56] <netpython> kaptengu, payloads are
[04:56] <infinito> does anyone know a way to execute a command through ssh in a remote machine but in the background?
[04:56] <kaptengu> ok
[04:56] <soundray> infinito: man screen
[04:57] <LjL> infinito: append & to the command
[04:57] <DevC> odd I didn't get the XVidMode when I got those packages :o does that mean Ubuntu don't have it:o
[04:57] <febuiles> aberry5555:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[04:57] <riazi> where is xorg.conf located?
[04:57] <infinito> LjL: what i want is to execute the command in background and then disconnect without waiting for it to end
[04:57] <LjL> riazi: /etc/X11
[04:57] <LjL> infinito: then you want screen, or cron
[04:57] <riazi> thnx
[04:57] <vdepizzol> Why there isn't anymore disks-admin in edgy? Ubuntu Edgy can mount everything automatically?
[04:58] <emxppp1> infinito: screen is definitely worth a look. very nice tool.
[04:58] <soundray> DevC: what's XVidMode?
[04:58] <aberry5555> febuiles, I have installed the majority of these but I cant find the multiverse plugins in the repositories
[04:58] <LjL> aberry5555: perhaps you haven't enabled multiverse? ;)
[04:59] <LjL> but, i seem to recall some of the stuff mentioned on that page is not in Edgy
[04:59] <emxppp1> infinito: you can start a text application in it, then detach the screen session and even log out. later you can login and reattach the screen session.
[04:59] <DevC> soundray: it is a x11 thing that lets me change vid modes when making allegro games
[05:00] <soundray> !info xvidtune | DevC
[05:00] <Archngel> re everyone
[05:00] <ubotu> xvidtune: X client - xvidtune. In component main, is optional. Version 1:1.0.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 17 kB, installed size 100 kB
[05:00] <aberry5555> ljl, how do you do that?

[05:08] <stapel> hi, anybody here?
[05:09] <jfrench> Hey all, Please tell me if I'm being overly optimistic, but is there a site, that can tell me what hard ware is compatible with ubuntu, As ive been using Ubuntu since Hoary, but ive never upgraded, and im about to buy a new computer, and I want to make sure what i buy will work
[05:09] <mirek> ahoj
[05:09] <jfrench> sup
[05:10] <mirek> hello
[05:10] <t-minus10> is there any release date for a development release of feisty?
[05:10] <DARKGuy> !feisty
[05:10] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is pre-alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[05:10] <vdepizzol> Why there isn't anymore disks-admin in edgy? Ubuntu Edgy can mount everything automatically?
[05:10] <febuiles> jfrench: in ubuntuforums.org you can find a section of the forum dedicated to HW compatibility.
[05:11] <sambagirl> does seveas still involved with Ubuntu?
[05:11] <marco> ,
[05:11] <sambagirl> is?

[05:11] <stapel> I want to buy a wireless card for my laptop, which brands are safe?
[05:11] <davin> how come dapper is unable to mount my fat32 partition?
[05:13] <febuiles> stapel: Atheros cards usually work out of the box if you have madwifi-ng drivers installed.
[05:13] <stapel> febuiles: thanks
[05:14] <stapel> how does belkin fare?
[05:14] <DevC> soundray: is there a dev pack for getting the developers libraries (header files and such) for xvidtune? I need them for allegro to compile
[05:14] <diskus> I wonder where is /etc/ld.so.conf in Ubuntu by default, doesn't seem to be in /etc
[05:14] <davin> nevermind works now
[05:14] <BeeRockxs> hi there, i'm having problems with my networking after installing ubuntu in a dual boot config with windows. It's from the nforce chipset, and I can't reach the network
[05:15] <DARKGuy> DevC: Wait, xvidtune isn't something for tuning the X video, instead of being a library to develop games with? don't you mean XVidMode or XRandR ?
[05:16] <stapel> any comments on belkin wireless cards for laptops...
[05:16] <DevC> DARKGuy: that is what I said but soundray pointed to xvidtune....I need xvidmode for allegro but I don't know where to get it...any ideas?
[05:16] <febuiles> stapel: you can probably google it and see other users experience with it
[05:16] <jenda_> Hello, I'm having trouble with Beryl - the window borders don't appear, and some windows (gnome-terminal) are blank. It's an nVidia machine and I'm running without XGL or AIGLX.
[05:16] <thevenin> stapel: a friend of mine has one, it is pretty good, never used linux on it though.
[05:16] <steffl> BeeRockxs: I had a similliar problem once, maybe you should shut down windows completely, rather than putting it into hibernation
[05:16] <Flibberdy> jenda_: have you got emerald installed?
[05:16] <BeeRockxs> steffl: I did shut down completely.
[05:16] <DARKGuy> DevC: No idea, but maybe it's in the repositories if you have universe & multiverse activated. Try apt-cache search xvid | grep 'allegro' and see what does that output
[05:17] <jenda_> Flibberdy, yep
[05:17] <constrictor> suggestions on what mail server to use?
[05:17] <jenda_> Flibberdy, and restarting it doesn't help
[05:17] <steffl> hm
[05:17] <umarmung> DevC: try libxxf86vm-dev
[05:18] <Flibberdy> jenda_: have you checked beryl settings manager to see if beryl is set as your WM and emerald as your decorator?
[05:18] <eloquence_> i love chickenwings
[05:19] <jenda_> Flibberdy, yep
[05:19] <jenda_> Flibberdy, several times ;)
[05:19] <DevC> umarmung: thanks....there is one last thing I've been cache searching for but can't find Xcursor
[05:19] <Flibberdy> then I am stumped jenda_, try #beryl ;)
[05:20] <DevC> nevermind I was typoing the search found it :D
[05:20] <jenda_> Flibberdy, will do.
[05:20] <BeeRockxs> anyone have an idea what might cause the nforce5 network adapter not to work correctly?
[05:20] <eloquence_> which is better ubuntu or kubuntu?
[05:20] <eloquence_> like in terms of the look feel and power
[05:21] <eloquence_> as well as the programs that can be run on each and the utilities
[05:21] <BeeRockxs> eloquence_: both can run the same programs
[05:21] <Crescendo_> After upgrading to Edgy, links in Xchat open with the Mozilla browser instead of Firefox.  What went wrong?
[05:21] <febuiles> eloquence_: they only differ in using GNOME/Kde
[05:21] <BeeRockxs> Kubuntu just comes with a KDE desktop by default, Ubunto comes with Gnome.
[05:22] <r00t_> eloque,  ubuntu
[05:22] <r00t_> kubuntu both are same :D

[05:23] <netpython> Crescendo, have you set the default applications in system ---> default applications?
[05:23] <BeeRockxs> anyone have an idea?
[05:23] <rmbl> i think there are no nvidia linux drivers for the 8800
[05:23] <r00t_> febuiles,
[05:23] <zylche> jfrench, check guru3d?
[05:23] <febuiles> r00t_: ?
[05:23] <zylche> although you won't find anything to do with linux drivers on the front page, maybe the forums if you are /very/ lucky..

[05:30] <r00t_> sorry :)
[05:30] <xuepia> hi all, Im experiencing a strange behaviour of my xubuntu pc: after one day of activity I notice swap usage increases till it reachs the whole swap space and my system becomes unresonsive... what should I do?
[05:31] <agent> Raphael: try searching for tab extensions
[05:31] <marlun> febuiles, ok, thanks

[05:31] <enry183> anybody know if its possible to trasform an internal hard disk (idee) in a external one usb
[05:32] <enry183> ?
[05:32] <njan> enry183, yes
[05:32] <NoUse> xuepia find out what is using so much memory using something like top or htop
[05:32] <njan> enry183, you can buy caddies for it from ebay for a few pounds/dollars/whatever.
[05:32] <enry183> wow
[05:32] <Raphael> febuiles: found it.. what do I do with it? change the number?
[05:32] <xuepia> NoUse I think init, logd and udevd....
[05:33] <enry183> there is a web site tha explicate it?
[05:33] <febuiles> Raphael: Yes, doble click it and set its value to 3
[05:33] <Archngel> can anyone tell me why I cant log to edgy server from xp station even if im using same user name than when im logged in local on server
[05:33] <NoUse> but those wouldn't max out your swap file, take a look at top
[05:33] <multiseat> is anybody here able to help me with an xserver problem (I think it is a bug).... a xephyr problem actually?
[05:33] <Raphael> febuiles: it works now. thanks
[05:33] <xuepia> but, I wasnt able to scroll process list down because the pc was too slow :)
[05:33] <NoUse> xuepia close X and it from the console
[05:34] <eloquence_> netpython, gnome look i guess cuz i am running ubuntu with gnome
[05:34] <Archngel> I get message user not found when I try to log in

[05:34] <netpython> eloque, there's a lot of art there, you might try deviantart as well
[05:34] <photar> Hey, I'm trying different vnc clients to connect to a mac server I have and the only one that connects correctly is xtightvncviewer is there some setting that xtightvncviewer uses by default that makes it work with macs that I could enable on Krdc? I want to use krdc cause it is the only one I've seen that supports scaling down the window.
[05:34] <multiseat> where should I go to find somebody that knows about this?
[05:35] <eloquence_> deviantart has gnome themes?
[05:35] <njan> enry183, it doesn't really need explanation. You buy the caddy, you put the hard disk in and close the caddy, it's a USB hard disk.
[05:35] <wy> febuiles: Thanks. It works!
[05:35] <Pelo> eloquence_,  a few but try I think it www.art-gnome.com
[05:35] <febuiles> np
[05:35] <njan> enry183, http://www.digital-fusion.co.uk/Inu_products/INU_ProdDetailsL4.asp?ref=M4392103
[05:36] <njan> enry183, ^ something like that
[05:36] <BeeRockxs> anyone know why my nforce5 network port does work in windows, but not in linux? It looks like the driver etc. loads fine, but i just get "network unreachable"when trying to ping anything
[05:36] <Pelo> multiseat,  try looking it up in the forum
[05:36] <wy> Why can't my Ubuntu display more than 1024x768 on my T60 which has a 1400x1280 screen?
[05:36] <febuiles> wy: do you know what chipset it uses?
[05:36] <photar> multiseat, I have some xserver exp.
[05:36] <photar> multiseat, whats your problem?
[05:36] <Pelo> wy,  edit the xorg.conf file to add the resolution you need
[05:36] <netpython> BeeRockxs, dhcp or statix ip ?
[05:37] <wy> Pelo: I thought it's because of the driver so I installed an ATI driver
[05:37] <BeeRockxs> netpython: neither work.
[05:37] <xuepia> NoUse: could it be amule eating up so much swap space? it's the only thing I'm running...
[05:37] <multiseat> my problem is that xephyr doesn't seem to work with some programs (mostly kde programs). I programmed a basic helloworld in python that crashes my xephyr session
[05:37] <NoUse> xuepia possibly, I've never used it so I don't know much about it

[05:38] <multiseat> w=Label(root, text="Hello, world!")
[05:38] <netpython> BeeRockxs, what does ifconfig say ?
[05:38] <multiseat> this line (I am using Tkinter) crashes X

[05:39] <multiseat> other programs crashes X too: amarok, skype, amsn
[05:39] <Rprp> Well, AMSN is very slow by me, how can i fix that?
[05:40] <BeeRockxs> netpython: I can't get you the exact output right now, but it did not show any error messages when using static IP, and with DHCP it didn't get a response from the network.
[05:40] <Pelo> ...
[05:40] <netpython> lol
[05:40] <multiseat> any ideas photar?
[05:40] <r00t_> what the ?
[05:40] <Pelo> network split , don'T worry about it
[05:40] <kraut> perfect time to join the proxy...
[05:41] <Rprp> Well, AMSN is very slow by me, how can i fix that?
[05:41] <BeeRockxs> netpython: some googling suggests that it has something to do with dual booting, networking did work in the live CD, before I installed windows.
[05:41] <r00t_> 1000 user on this channel :O
[05:41] <r00t_> whatz up with server :S
[05:41] <netpython> net split
[05:41] <netpython> BeeRockxs, i doubt it has naything to do with dual booting
[05:41] <febuiles> Rprp: Slow as in internet-slow or as an overall slow application?
[05:42] <netpython> BeeRockxs,what does dmesg grep eth0 or eth1 say?
[05:42] <netpython> BeeRockxs,what does dmesg | grep eth0 or eth1 say?
[05:42] <maghat> BeeRockxs: yes can't be dual booting

[05:43] <Rprp> if i scroll it take ages before i can see the contactpersons
[05:43] <febuiles> Rprp: aMSN is written using Tcl/Tk, not the best combination available. Have you thought about using Gaim or Kopete?
[05:43] <Rprp> Gaim?
[05:44] <maghat> Rprp: AMSN? Please try Gaim or Kopete
[05:44] <Rprp> Oke,
[05:44] <Rprp> Well
[05:44] <Rprp> How can i delete amsn?
[05:44] <michaelpo> my winxp compaq presario 2819ap laptop, failed to boot the ubuntu live cd.. help..
[05:44] <BeeRockxs> netpython: ?
[05:44] <multiseat> gaim is great.... only it has no cam support that I know of
[05:44] <Rprp> if i do apt-get remove amsn it says 'amsn is not found'
[05:44] <maghat> Gaim in Ubuntu, or Kopete in Kubuntu, they are installed by default in each
[05:44] <multiseat> (but I don't know much)
[05:44] <Pelo> michaelpo,  fails how ?
[05:44] <eloquence_> i used GAIM
[05:44] <eloquence_> but aMSN seems better
[05:45] <febuiles> multiseat: It doesnt yet, someday when gaim-vv is ready it'll be supported :D
[05:45] <maghat> Rprp: depends how you installed it? was it via apt/synaptic?
[05:45] <eloquence_> i wish there was something like MSN Live Messenger
[05:45] <wy> I added the resolutions to xorg.conf. But I still can't switch the resolutions.
[05:45] <Rprp> synaptic
[05:45] <netpython> BeeRockxs,well i assume something is not right with either the hardware (modules) or the ip isn't set correctly
[05:45] <michaelpo> pelo. it stop halfway... while booting... while detecting hardware...
[05:45] <multiseat> but on the other hand gaim is vastly supperior... you can use multiple accounts and protocols (I am chatting using gaim right now)
[05:45] <diskus> !ldconfig
[05:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ldconfig - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[05:46] <Cows> how do i grep some line from all the .php
[05:46] <Rprp> Well
[05:46] <Cows> recursively
[05:46] <multiseat> are you ther photar?
[05:46] <eloquence_> whatever
[05:46] <eloquence_> windows makes things easier
[05:46] <dv_> it lacks advanced, protocol-specific stuff
[05:46] <Rprp> In Synatptic there isnt amsn installed
[05:46] <eloquence_> linux gives more power
[05:46] <Rprp> wtf
[05:46] <eloquence_> now we cant have it all
[05:46] <Pelo> michaelpo,  could be your cd is borked,  make another one
[05:46] <febuiles> Cows: man grep :D
[05:46] <Rprp> But In Internet -> Amsg i see amsn
[05:46] <Cows> no
[05:46] <eloquence_> linux is leet but windows is easy
[05:46] <Cows> not man grep
[05:46] <diskus> Anyone knows where should I specify lib paths to libs in Ubuntu, it should be /etc/ld.so.conf, but there's no such file in 6.06
[05:46] <Cows> i couldnt make the command work
[05:46] <dv_> so for jabber, psi is better, for icq I'd use licq
[05:46] <BeeRockxs> netpython: The IP is fine, the same one works correct in Windows. In syslog, I find this about eth0:

[05:46] <maghat> eloquence_: use Skype, there is a native version for Linux, that looks almost exactly like the Windows version
[05:47] <eloquence_> skype?
[05:47] <Rprp> But In Internet -> Amsg i see amsn
[05:47] <eloquence_> msn works on skype?

[05:47] <BeeRockxs> and some stuff from dhcclient about not receiving and DHCPOFFERS
[05:47] <dawnfading> anyone familiar with incorrect free space when mounting external storage?
[05:47] <maghat> eloquence_:  *OR* email micro$oft and request a Linux version of MSN. I've done that and they even replied to me. Really...
[05:47] <febuiles> Rprp: try running: "sudo apt-get remove amsn" or remove it manually from Synaptic?
[05:47] <netpython> BeeRockxs,that's the same driver as i have loaded here
[05:48] <netpython> BeeRockxs,what does route say?

[05:50] <multiseat> does anyone know where can I ask about an xorg problem? (#xorg is dead right now)

[05:50] <Pelo> michaelpo,  try looking up your laptop model in the forum
[05:50] <maghat> Pelo: it was polite, they basically said that the number of linux desktop users they estimated, wouldn't provide enough advertisement revenue to compensate for the development of a Linux version *AND* the lack of a standard installation procedure and diversity of distributions would make it a support nightmare. It was an elaborate answer...
[05:50] <Rprp> And, how can i remove only the 'mozilla-browser' if i do apt-get remove mozilla-browser it removes azureus etc etc etc
[05:51] <Pelo> maghat,  sounds like a good one
[05:51] <netpython> maghat,vendor lockin
[05:51] <michaelpo> i cant find the model in the forum... what does that mean?
[05:51] <Rprp> And, how can i remove only the 'mozilla-browser' if i do apt-get remove mozilla-browser it removes azureus etc etc etc
[05:51] <michaelpo> pelo: i cant find the model in the forum... what does that mean?
[05:52] <Pelo> michaelpo,  that no one else has reported a problem,  try searching for something else like brand name or chip set or something like that
[05:52] <maghat> Pelo, they even mentioned Gaim as an alternative, although it "wouldn't provide the advanced audio and video features of MSN"
[05:52] <febuiles> Rprp: If its a dependency for one of those programs you can't do anything about since they'll need it to run properly.
[05:52] <maghat> Yes, but as it is, Linux also promotes vendor lock-OUT
[05:52] <DARKGuy> Yay!
[05:52] <Rprp> k
[05:52] <DShepherd> anyone here running solely edgy on a macbook?
[05:52] <Crescendo_> After upgrading to Edgy, links in Xchat open with the Mozilla browser instead of Firefox.  What went wrong?
[05:52] <DARKGuy> I got Diablo II working in WINE :)
[05:52] <febuiles> Rprp: deleting your ~/.amsn will delete all the stored information btw, to erase the executables you gotta see where you installed it
[05:52] <michaelpo> how do i find the brandname of chipset? unscrew my laptop?
[05:52] <febuiles> DShepherd I am
[05:53] <Pelo> maghat,  very professionnal them
[05:53] <Rprp> Oke
[05:53] <michaelpo> pelo: how do i find the brandname of chipset? unscrew my laptop?
[05:53] <maghat> DARKGuy: HOW DID YOU DO THAT??? :D
[05:53] <Pelo> michaelpo,   brandname OR chipset
[05:53] <Rprp> and last question :p Mozilla-browser is the standerd broswer, how can i change this to firefox"
[05:53] <maghat> sorry for yelling, I got excited :p
[05:53] <DShepherd> febuiles: do you mind me asking you some questions.. I am thinking about buying a macbook.. :-)?
[05:53] <netpython> maghat, how did you have that in mind?
[05:53] <michaelpo> brand name is compay presario 2819ap...
[05:53] <febuiles> DShepherd: go ahead :D
[05:53] <Wanderer> hmm, has the source-o-matic died?
[05:53] <DARKGuy> maghat: xD I just installed it in mom's computer (WinXP) and just copied the whole folder to my Linux one, then wine "Diablo II.exe" -w and it's all done :P
[05:54] <michaelpo> pelo: brand name is compaq presario 2819ap...
[05:54] <DShepherd> febuiles: how easy was it to setup?
[05:54] <Pelo> michaelpo,  just try searching for presario , or  just 2819ap
[05:54] <DARKGuy> Blizzard games are a bliss to play in Linux
[05:54] <maghat> DARKGuy: w00t, I gotta try that out :|:|:|
[05:54] <noodles12> when setting up, how much space should i give my / andhow much for home? or should i keep both on the same partition?
[05:54] <febuiles> DShepherd: fairly easy, you can find a lot of guides to install everything specially if you're gonna use Ubuntu.
[05:54] <noodles12> i have a total of 29 gb
[05:54] <eloquence_> see windows doesnt suck as bad does it  huh maggot?
[05:54] <BeeRockxs> netpython: I guess I'll just plug in my old pci network card.
[05:55] <DARKGuy> maghat: Definitely :)
[05:55] <DShepherd> febuiles: what doesnt work with a defualt install of ubuntu ?
[05:55] <netpython> BeeRockxs, yes so did i too plug in my 3com spare pci network card
[05:55] <michaelpo> searching in the laptopforum? yes done that... its not there...
[05:56] <Rprp> febuiles: i removed ~/.amsn, but still the icon is in Internet -> Amsn
[05:56] <maghat> netpython: I am a developer, and I wish I could port some of my apps to Linux, but unless I code in Java (which I think sucks royally) deployment is a real nightmare, dependency/distribution/permissions/support wise..
[05:56] <maghat> DARKGuy: does it run smoothly?
[05:56] <michaelpo> pelo: searching in the laptopforum? yes, done that... its not there...
[05:56] <febuiles> DShepherd: You have to download the drivers for the wireless card, extended resolution (1280) and some other stuff, but all of this you can find it on Synaptic
[05:57] <febuiles> Rprp: as I told you, to delete executables if you didnt install using Synaptic (apt) you'll have to manually erase it.
[05:57] <Pelo> michaelpo,  try searching the whole ubuntuforum, not just the laptop one
[05:57] <DARKGuy> maghat:36fps according to /fps :)
[05:57] <netpython> maghat, fair enough, LOKI does it though i believe
[05:57] <DARKGuy> maghat: DirectDraw (2D) of course
[05:57] <michaelpo> pelo: oh... ok..  will try that now... thanks..
[05:57] <netpython> no directx needed?
[05:57] <DARKGuy> netpython: Nope, this is just WINE emulated
[05:57] <febuiles> DShepherd: The hardest part to get working was the IR-control and the iSight (built in camera), those 2 required downloading a new kernel, patching and recompiling
[05:57] <maghat> netpython: I don't think LOKI exists anymore
[05:57] <netpython> cool if it works
[05:57] <WizCraker> is there a 6.10 release for the server ?
[05:57] <DShepherd> febuiles:wow...
[05:57] <DARKGuy> maghat: It exists, he's just in the underground
[05:58] <michaelpo> can i ask dumb irc question? how do you guys put the username of ppl you helping at the beginning? type it out?
[05:58] <michaelpo> or is it automatic?
[05:58] <noodles12> i just type it out
[05:58] <febuiles> DShepherd: Yes, it's not funny specially if you're beginning but apart from that you can probably get anything else working in 30 minutes or so.
[05:58] <michaelpo> or something?
[05:58] <Joakim> OT: DARKGuy: Do you know C++?
[05:58] <soundray> michaelpo: I type the beginning and complete with the tab key
[05:58] <thoreauputic> michaelpo: thorea <hit tab key>
[05:58] <nolimitsoya> maghat, if your apps are selfcontained, i dont think dependencies are a problem, and you never have to worry about it anyway, since both the distribution and dependecy part would be handled by the motu:s of the repsective distribution. permissions are also a nonissue, and i dont realy see the problem with supporting it either, as long as its the same code, but compiled for elf instead of coff
[05:58] <noodles12> michaelpo: i use gaim so there isn't anything but i think some other clients u can hit tab to autocomplete
[05:58] <febuiles> DShepherd: When the repositories provide 2.6.18 you shouldnt have to do all of that tho.
[05:58] <nojohnao_> Would someone be willing to help me with Compiz? The how to for Compiz +ATI isnt going so well
[05:58] <DShepherd> febuiles: ok. you know if fiesty should have better support?
[05:59] <DShepherd> febuiles: ah ok.. kool
[05:59] <michaelpo> oic... cool... thanks...
[05:59] <maghat> I actually bought CIV:Call to Power for Linux. Unfortunately when I tried to install the game 1 year later it would always crash missing some libs...
[05:59] <rainyrhythm> anyone uses ipw2200 ?
[05:59] <Pelo> later folks
[05:59] <soundray> noodles12: are you sure gaim doesn't have autocomplete? Is it disabled perhaps?
[05:59] <wy> What's the key for switching resolution in Xorg?
[05:59] <DShepherd> febuiles: you runninq a macbook or a pro?
[05:59] <netpython> maghat, l used to play enemy territory and americas army a lot on freebsd and linux
[05:59] <DShepherd> running*
[05:59] <febuiles> DShepherd: macbook
[05:59] <rainyrhythm> wy: ctrl+alt+numpad +
[06:00] <privat> hay
[06:00] <rainyrhythm> as in plus in numpad
[06:00] <DShepherd> febuiles: does the remote thingy come with the macbook?
[06:00] <privat> you crazy
[06:00] <noodles12> soundray: i havn't foudn it yet, is it a plugin perhaps?
[06:00] <febuiles> DShepherd: Yes, but as I told you, as of today you have to patch the kernel, I hope it'll be fixed for the next release.
[06:00] <wy> rainyrhythm: I haven't a numpad...
[06:00] <michaelpo> noodles12: i'm using winxp gaim portable.. tab works... that's great
[06:01] <soundray> noodles12: I just used gaim once on the live CD, and I seem to remember I just used TAB... maybe my memory fools me

[06:01] <fuffal0> the system i'm trying to install ubuntu on now freezes during boot at "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel" (just sits there, let it sit for hours and was still there) - any ideas?
[06:01] <DShepherd> febuiles: ok kool...
[06:01] <maghat> Linux needs a DirectX clone, OpenGL just doesn't cut it especially with the new visual effects.
[06:01] <noodles12> lame! rawr.. ok i'm gonna fidn it
[06:01] <Chousuke> maghat: wine :P
[06:01] <rainyrhythm> oh.. then i have no idea
[06:01] <trumpetmic> anyone using ubuntu server and willing to help me get up and running with it?  I'm clueless these days when it comes to booting into a CLI.  (used to use gentoo, but it's been years and I like GUIs now)
[06:01] <diskus> wine is not an option
[06:01] <maghat> fuffal0: are you sure the CD drive is working ok?
[06:01] <Chousuke> Though wine is just DX on top of OGL
[06:01] <fuffal0> maghat, yessir
[06:01] <r00t_> !video driver
[06:01] <soundray> fuffal0: booting of the live CD or the fresh install?
[06:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about video driver - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:02] <DShepherd> febuiles: other than the other stuff you had to recompile... is there anything that works.. but is kinda clunkly?
[06:02] <fuffal0> soundray - both i think?
[06:02] <Crescendo_> After upgrading to Edgy, links in Xchat open with the Mozilla browser instead of Firefox.  What went wrong?
[06:02] <fuffal0> the live cd is the install cd isn't it?
[06:02] <diskus> wine doesn't even have full dx support as far as I know
[06:02] <rainyrhythm> again... anyone using ipw2200 wireless module ?
[06:02] <fuffal0> the hard drive is blank - and i'm trying to boot up to perform a fresh install
[06:02] <velusip> Holy smokes, this channel is out of control!
[06:02] <maghat> Wine sux even more than OpenGL, because it's always behind Microsoft. The way for Linux is to get *ahead* of Microsoft!
[06:02] <netpython> Crescendo, setup your preferred default applications?
[06:02] <soundray> fuffal0: got you. You need to look into bootoptions, probably noapic and nolapic
[06:02] <CarlFK> maghat, so stop trying to run ms programs :)
[06:02] <soundray> !bootoptions | fuffal0
[06:02] <ubotu> fuffal0: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
[06:03] <febuiles> DShepherd: So far everything's been working great, as a personal thing I had to remap some keys but that's it.
[06:03] <fuffal0> i actually tried that, but it didn't help - altho i may have entered them in in the wrong spot
[06:03] <r00t_> soundray, hey can you tell me where can i get video driver ?
[06:03] <noodles12> this is lame, my gaim doesn't have it. i'm using 2.0.0 beta 3.1 =
[06:03] <soundray> r00t_: no
[06:03] <eloquence_> now i just cant wait to get GTA:SA working on linux
[06:03] <eloquence_> woohoo
[06:03] <maghat> CarlFK: I will if you can get me decent non-shooter games for Linux :p
[06:03] <DShepherd> febuiles: ok.. hmm.. well thanks for your time. Your answer did help alot. I appreciate it
[06:03] <CarlFK> maghat, get a ps2 :)
[06:03] <eloquence_> so then technically, noodles12, its not lame its laim
[06:03] <febuiles> DShepherd: no prob.
[06:03] <noodles12> lol
[06:04] <fuffal0> for the boot options do i just type them at the end of the long boot string that i see when i go into the boot options?
[06:04] <soundray> DShepherd: so, are you buying?
[06:04] <soundray> fuffal0: yes
[06:04] <maghat> CarlFK: I have a PSP thank you. Can't play Civ4 or Neverwinter on it... or any other console
[06:04] <trumpetmic> anyone using ubuntu as a web and or file server?
[06:04] <soundray> fuffal0: have you used the "check CD" (or similar) entry?
[06:05] <CarlFK> trumpetmic, I am.  install u-server, then install apache and nfs-server
[06:05] <maghat> trumpetmic: no, I use Fedora for that, but Ubuntu can't be too different. Why?
[06:05] <wy> Which kernel are you using for Core Duo processors?
[06:05] <DShepherd> soundray: i want to.. sounds attractive.. and I like mac hardware.. pretty slick.. so right now.. its a yes.. plus i dont want to  pay for an OS that needs vaccine every 5 minutes..
[06:05] <michaelpo> another dumb irc q... is it possible to detect reply to my question only? lets say i asked a question.. then i go read the webforum... then i come back... how do i avoid scrolling up and down to find if anyone answered my question?
[06:05] <febuiles> wy: 2.6.17 works just fine
[06:05] <Rprp> Where can i change the standard webbrowser?
[06:05] <CarlFK> wy, all the 686 kernels are configed for smp - they just use one if you only have one
[06:06] <DShepherd> febuiles: why didnt you dual-boot?
[06:06] <trumpetmic> maghat and Car1FK, I'm wanting to install an easy to use GUIfied linux distro with out of the box easyness in terms of serving
[06:06] <soundray> DShepherd: I'm tempted, too. The iMacs are really quiet. My PC is a right old howler.
[06:06] <wy> I see. I was looking for linux-image-*-smp and there is none.
[06:06] <trumpetmic> ubuntu desktop is easy... just windering if the server version could be just as easy
[06:06] <netpython> Rprp,  System --- >  preferences ----> default applications
[06:06] <Koot> i downloaded the iso image and burned it, can i test drive it without installing it? ive never used linux before but ive seen the term live boot cd's used alot
[06:06] <Rprp> k, thnx
[06:06] <netpython> np
[06:07] <nolimitsoya> Koot, just restart your computer with the cd in the drive
[06:07] <febuiles> DShepherd: To be honest I tried Mac OS X for 1 month and couldnt get used to the mac-way of doing things, but if you wanted to dual-boot you could just use Bootcamp (provided by Apple)
[06:07] <Koot> and it wont mess up my windows xp install?
[06:07] <CarlFK> trumpetmic, you can also install apache and nfs on the desktop.  it isn't recomended for a 'professional' job, but in general it will be just fine
[06:07] <febuiles> DShepherd: Actually, all the guides out there will tell you how to dual or triple boot.
[06:07] <nolimitsoya> Koot, make sure you have bott priority set up for cdrom in bios. if you dont know what that means you probably dont need to :)
[06:07] <soundray> Koot: no, not unless you tell it to
[06:07] <NoUse> Koot its a live cd
[06:07] <vdepizzol> Koot, no hard-drive will be used
[06:07] <Koot> ok, ya im quite hardware and configuration savvy
[06:07] <vincent_> #xubuntu
[06:07] <DShepherd> febuiles: no i dont want to dual-boot.. i have tried a mac. its nice. but i just like ubuntu a bit more.. i just wanted to know your reason..
[06:07] <Koot> thank you for the answers
[06:07] <maghat> trumpetmic: are you looking to serve any dynamic content? (PHP/JSP maybe with database backend). What kind of file sharing are you thinking? I am guessing SMB shares for Windows users
[06:08] <trumpetmic> Car1FK, thanks for the tip.  I might just try that
[06:08] <thoreauputic> Koot: make sure you have the "desktop" Cd
[06:08] <Koot> ya thats the one i downloaded
[06:08] <thoreauputic> ok
[06:08] <rainyrhythm> anyone knows how to get an older version of the package ?
[06:08] <Koot> is there a irc client in the distro by defualt?
[06:08] <trumpetmic> maghat: yes, I want to share files with windows computers.  I'm serving with PHP MYSQL and Apache
[06:08] <nativow> Can anyone help me set up Eclipse?
[06:08] <thoreauputic> Koot: yes, gaim does IRC
[06:08] <febuiles> DShepherd: It's nice to have it installed though since the firmware updates are only provided as .dmg
[06:08] <Koot> ok thank you
[06:09] <soundray> rainyrhythm: what package?
[06:09] <DShepherd> febuiles: oh.. hmm.. something to thing about.. thanks for the info
[06:09] <maghat> if you check the Ubuntu download page, there is an alternative CD you can download that lets you make custom installation scripts
[06:09] <EkUmBa> does anyone know,how i can fix my dvd player,that play the dvds too slow....normal movies work
[06:09] <rainyrhythm> soundray: err.. ipw2200 ?
[06:09] <michaelpo> did anybody answer my question? "another dumb irc q... is it possible to detect reply to my question only? lets say i asked a question.. then i go read the webforum... then i come back... how do i avoid scrolling up and down to find if anyone answered my question?" i scrolled up and down... could find any...
[06:09] <febuiles> DShepherd: no porb.
[06:09] <wy> What's the name of the progam that did the disk partitioning in the installation?
[06:09] <Geoffrey2> I'm beginning to wonder if Flash for linux is simply never going to work properly on my computer.....I can't even load up the Adobe page that verifies your version without Firefox coming to a complete halt
[06:09] <vdepizzol> wy, gparted
[06:10] <soundray> rainyrhythm: do you mean ieee80211-source ?
[06:10] <febuiles> michaelpo: that depends on your IRC client, you can probably set it up to beep when your name's mentioned
[06:10] <febuiles> Geoffrey2: Have you tried to install flash through Synaptic?
[06:10] <soundray> Geoffrey2: it could be that you have competing plugins. Check about:plugins
[06:10] <wy> vdepizzol: It can resize partition now. Amazing!
[06:10] <rainyrhythm> i'm not sure..
[06:11] <soundray> rainyrhythm: start over and describe the problem.
[06:11] <vdepizzol> wy, :)
[06:11] <Geoffrey2> febuiles, I'm trying the flash 9 beta, Synaptic obviously won't have that yet
[06:11] <Trist_an> I have a question regarding GRUB. On Dapper there was no progress bar and there was a list of action performed during the booting operation. Now there is only the progress bar. Is it possible to have both progress bar and the booting operations?
[06:11] <orkid> good afternooon
[06:11] <synjet> hi.. I have seen on forums and experienced probs with ipw2200 working in edgy eft.. can anybody please point me to a cure/soln?
[06:11] <orkid> what sort of probs
[06:12] <michaelpo> i just got back to the irc game because of linux.... used to use mirc 10 years ago before icq, msn, ym....
[06:12] <rainyrhythm> soundray, i'm connecting to my school wireless which is hidden and using some wiered PEAP authanication
[06:12] <synjet> It doesnt get activated, not does it recognize n/w.. even ifup doesnt get it to work
[06:12] <michaelpo> this time i am using gaim....
[06:12] <CarlFK> I used a live cd to setup linux soft raid md0 on hda6 and hdc6 - then installed dapper on md0. 4 months later the ext3 fs wont mount, and fsck fixed about 1000 problems and I loose about 25% of my files.  (yay for backups)  I installed dapper on the same thing, coppied over a few configs from /etc, and now my md0 fs seems to be doing the same thing.  anyone know what I can look at for a cuase?
[06:12] <Geoffrey2> soundray, I presume I'm looking for conflicting flash plugins?
[06:12] <soundray> Geoffrey2: yep
[06:12] <orkid> n/w ?
[06:13] <rainyrhythm> on gentoo i managed to get it work (after days of trial and error and lack of support)
[06:13] <soundray> rainyrhythm: I've tried that once, and gave up for lack of time :(
[06:13] <synjet> orkid: sorry, I meant network.. any wireless newtwork
[06:13] <wy> I see the problem. My Xorg is not using the ATI driver
[06:13] <soundray> rainyrhythm: if you get yourself knowledgeable about wpasupplicant, there is a chance, though, that you might get it up & running.
[06:13] <synjet> orkid: I have seen the soln provided in forums, but couldnt get it to work.. hence was wondering if it is a widespread prob that anyonhe here has been experiencing..
[06:13] <soundray> !info wpasupplicant | rainyrhythm
[06:13] <rainyrhythm> but the catch is when i update to the latest version (1.2) it breaks again
[06:14] <orkid> synjet, sorry, don't have wireless
[06:14] <soundray> rainyrhythm: this isn't the best channel to ask about gentoo
[06:14] <rainyrhythm> i have to stick to version 1.1.2 to continue..
[06:14] <synjet> !ipw2200
[06:14] <orkid> synjet, you could try getting drivers from intel (if that's not already how it's being done)
[06:14] <mgu> hi, I lost my GRUB stage1/stage2 files, how can I recreate them?
[06:14] <CarlFK> gentoo = generally too much hassle :)
[06:14] <rainyrhythm> sorry.. but now my friend is trying out this distro..
[06:15] <synjet> orkid: I have ipw2200, ndiswrapper etc. and it worked flawlessly in dapper, but edgy broke it
[06:15] <rainyrhythm> so i thought can get the older ver of ipw2200 to make it work
[06:15] <orkid> synjet, did you upgrade or fresh install?
[06:15] <soundray> mgu: use grub-install
[06:15] <mgu> soundray: that hangs
[06:15] <synjet> orkid: upgrade :)
[06:16] <soundray> mgu: have you tried the after-Windows-rescue instructions?
[06:16] <soundray> !grub | mgu
[06:16] <orkid> synjet, freshinstall might fix it (if you're willing).
[06:16] <mgu> soundray: yes, not worky; I really just need to create the stage files
[06:17] <mgu> soundray: I can copy GRUB into MBR from the GRUB console; grub-install doesn't work somehow
[06:17] <Geoffrey2> soundray, nope, I only see one listing for Flash, libflashplayer.so, Shockwave Flash 9.0 d78
[06:17] <synjet> orkid: I guess I have no choice.. thanks anyways.. just a question: have you experienced frequent crashes of FF/Opera in Edgy compared to dapper?
[06:17] <crys> svn ci
=== igor is now known as igcek
[06:18] <soundray> mgu: during install, the stage files are copied from /lib/grub/ ... does that help?
[06:19] <coldfire> i've been unable to find a package for freenx on edgy.. does anyone know if a package exists?  the install script fro nomachine's tarball doesn't even work
[06:19] <mgu> soundray: I tried them already, but they apparently don't work
[06:19] <soundray> Geoffrey2: what architecture are you on?
[06:19] <mgu> soundray: I need to squeeze in my partition info, I think
[06:20] <soundray> mgu: did you sudo the install command?

[06:20] <burwaco> Hello, I have just terminated a fresh install from the xubuntu edgy alternate cd, I'd like to install blackbox how do I progeed ? install x-window-system, the blackbox ?
[06:20] <Trist_an> I have a question regarding GRUB. On Dapper there was no progress bar and there was a list of action performed during the booting operation. Now there is only the progress bar. Is it possible to have both progress bar and the booting operations?
[06:20] <orkid> synjet, i'm running feisty now, and in feisty FF gives me problems on some websites (sailinganarchy.com for example)
[06:20] <orkid> synjet, sorry i couldn't be of more help. good luck
[06:20] <mgu> soundray: yes, I've also tried it chrooted to the partition, and as root;
[06:20] <febuiles> burwaco: If you're already running XFCE you should havent X installed, just apt-get install blackbox?
[06:21] <synjet> orkid: np, I appreciate the response

[06:21] <gostview> is there a method to uninstall a game which was install with a installer.sh?
[06:21] <thoreauputic> burwaco: you'll need the universe repository

[06:22] <gostview> febuiles> yap, but this is the method to INSTALL, I ask a way to UNinstall it
[06:22] <thoreauputic> burwaco: ok then just install blackbox :)
[06:22] <NoUse> gostview those games are usually put in /usr/local/games
[06:22] <soundray> Geoffrey2: the plugin works well here. It's strange that you get crashes...
[06:22] <burwaco> I did that, but x isn't there yet...
[06:22] <febuiles> gostview: sorry, misread as usual in me :d
[06:22] <gostview> NoUse> so...? will I remove the dir?
[06:22] <rainyrhythm> nvm then.. cya all

[06:23] <burwaco> thoreauputic: no, I installed from the alternate cd, command line only
[06:23] <febuiles> burwaco: Then yes, you have to download X first and then Blackbox
[06:23] <gostview> NoUse> ok, ... hope you right! tnx
[06:24] <burwaco> thoreauputic: apt-get install x-window-server ?
[06:24] <thoreauputic> burwaco: ah I see - then install x-window-system-core and a terminal emulator at least
[06:24] <Rprp> Well, i cant change my standard browser in default applications?

[06:25] <NoUse> Ksi you can't the live dvd is static
[06:25] <febuiles> burwaco: xterm or something
[06:25] <burwaco> xterm .
[06:25] <Ksi> aw, no fun....
[06:25] <thoreauputic> burwaco: well, I assume you haven't installed anything yet that will run in blackbox - so you need xterm or something
[06:25] <burwaco> febuiles: then run blackbox from xterm ?

[06:26] <thoreauputic> burwaco: no, you can run startx to run blackbox, assuming it's the only window manager

[06:28] <seymore> hi all
=== igor is now known as igcek
[06:29] <febuiles> burwaco: startx like that but only after you've installed X
[06:29] <burwaco> wow
[06:29] <thoreauputic> burwaco: also I suggest installing the "menu" package
[06:29] <thoreauputic> burwaco: linux is case sensitive ;)
=== zloc is now known as zloc|afk
[06:30] <burwaco> thoreauputic: ok, X runs, blackbox just started working by itself too, linux rules
[06:30] <thoreauputic> burwaco: :-)
[06:30] <DinmO> I disagree!
[06:30] <Geoffrey2> oh, when I install the flash 9 beta, can the flashplayer.xpt file stay there, or should that be removed or renamed?
[06:30] <burwaco> thoreauputic: I know linux is case sensitive, but I had a distro once that wanted startX

[06:34] <Rprp> yeah, it was not in the manager
[06:34] <Ksi> thx
[06:34] <Rprp> I did rm -R ~/.amsn
[06:34] <Rprp> :p
[06:34] <LjL> malsyned: i solved that in Dapper by removing the "resolvconf" package. i doubt that's a clean solution however
[06:34] <wy> thoreauputic: It doesn't work either
[06:34] <thoreauputic> malsyned: hackish way is to make /etc/resolv.conf read-only
[06:35] <febuiles> Rprp: that only removes your personal info, to delete that shortcut I'm guessing Gnome has a menu editor of some kind :D
[06:35] <thoreauputic> wy: define "doesn't work"
[06:35] <thoreauputic> !doesn't work
[06:35] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[06:35] <wy> thoreauputic: may be that's because it is not a gtk program. It's a Qt program
[06:35] <LjL> wy, is it a console program that you're trying to run?
[06:35] <LjL> wy: hm. shouldn't be an issue... i think
[06:35] <wy> LjL: No. It's the ATI control panel
[06:35] <thoreauputic> wy: umm - makes no difference
[06:36] <burwaco> thoreauputic: ok, looks like I have a gui running here, with the x-window-system can I use the S3 driver from xserver-xorg-video-s3virge, or is that titts and apples ?

[06:37] <wy> thoreauputic: the ati control panel with ATI driver. It's in the menu but it hasn't permission to change /etc/X11/xorg.conf. So I must sudo it
[06:37] <thoreauputic> burwaco: if X is running, why are you looking for drivers? Or is the detected one not right for you?
[06:37] <febuiles> Rprp: Try Settings -> Menu editor or something? <--- not usign Gnome

[06:48] <seymore> i have ubuntu edgy, with beryl/xgl
[06:48] <battlesquid> i think i have messed up /etc/passwd :-/ "$ sudo vi /etc/passwd" outputs "sudo: uid 1000 does not exist in the passwd file!" i've googled but all i find is LDAP related, and I'm not using that. i edited the file and added group entry for one user to 1000,1002 and i think that's the problem... but now i can't edit the file to correct it. anyone able to help me?
[06:48] <wy> I see. "sudo" didn't work. I can only success if I do "sudo su" first

[06:49] <qos> thoreauputic, i already tried to mount it ... but he still wants to get the cd... i will try to remove the lines. thx
[06:49] <LjL> wy: unrelated tip - you can use "sudo -s" rather than "sudo su", and "sudo -i" rather than "sudo su -"
[06:50] <thoreauputic> qos: you will need to point the sources at the iso image of course
[06:50] <wy> LjL: It seems it's because some permission is missing from the current user?
[06:51] <wy> Although I'm sudoer, are there privilige missing from sudo?
[06:51] <LjL> wy: i don't think... if you can use "sudo su", you can use sudo. you need to be in the "admin" group to use sudo (type "groups" to check, but i bet you are)
[06:51] <gnat_x> i'm running xubuntu edgy, and i was trying to play a cd, and it wasn't working. so i checked to make sure there's an audio cable, checked dmesg to make sure the cd drive is found (hdc), and added the xmms-cdread package; still no music is there another lib or something that i need. should i try with a different app maybe?
[06:51] <thoreauputic> wy: sounds more like you need root environment - hence sudo -i

[06:58] <Shaezsche> i installed network manager with Automatix and it has a few annoying features. Is there a way to set it NOT to automatically connect me on login??
[06:58] <LjL> battlesquid: besides, you should always use "vipw" to edit /etc/passwd (well, you should just use the "adduser" and related commands actually, but ;)

I've tried booting into the "live/install" mode, the "check cd mode" but it always freezes around the same time ("mounting root filesystem" or "uncompressing linux kernel") I've tried passing it debian-installer/probe/usb=false and noapic nolapic - but it's still not working - any suggestions would be great
[06:58] <Shaezsche> network manager without automatix will auto connect
[06:58] <febuiles> globe: did you try to use loadkeys in console?

[06:58] <Shaezsche> very annoying
[06:59] <LjL> battlesquid: no. "adduser <username> <groupname>"
[06:59] <globe> febuiles: no...I haven't
[06:59] <febuiles> do a man loadkeys and use it with your prefered layout
[06:59] <battlesquid> LjL, well but i need my user to have multiple group affiliations
[06:59] <globe> febuiles okay, will this util change the layout that it boots with?

[07:00] <LjL> battlesquid: yes, that'll do that. just use that command multiple times
[07:00] <wy> Strange. Change language no longer works in the login screen
[07:00] <battlesquid> LjL, oh i see. thanks
[07:01] <febuiles> globe: I think it does but I'm not 100% sure, if it doesn't you could always add it to your .bashrc or w/e your shell is.

[07:07] <fuffal0> i've been trying to get this ubuntu cd(6.06) to boot, but can't figure it out.  I've tried booting into the "live/install" mode, the "check cd mode" but it always freezes around the same time ("mounting root filesystem" or "uncompressing linux kernel") I've tried passing it debian-installer/probe/usb=false and noapic nolapic - but it's still not working - any suggestions would be great
[07:07] <AnthonyG> Bah, I'm so close to getting my modem setup, I managed to get wvdialconf to recognize it :D
[07:07] <NoUse> fuffal0 how did you download the disc?
[07:08] <fuffal0> nouse i ordered them from the ubuntu site
[07:08] <LinAsH> powr-tok, see if user has privileges to use audio device with users-admin
[07:08] <synjet> powr-tok: tried system-->prefs-->sound and see if the options are properly configured..
[07:08] <fuffal0> the cd works fine on other machines,  and other cd's work fine in this machine - so i don't think it's a media issue
[07:08] <fabiim> hi my java in firefox is not working ( firefox 2.0 , ubuntu edgy , java5-plugin installed) i think that's the problem , i'm not being able to see an .jsp page ( that's java right?)
[07:08] <NoUse> fuffal0 do it could be a drive issue for that specific machine
[07:08] <wy> How can I add things to start into the keyboard shortcut?
[07:09] <fuffal0> nouse, is there any way i can test/fix said issue?
[07:09] <AnthonyG> fabiim: I believejsp is a Javascript page
[07:09] <AnthonyG> fabiim: Is Javascript enabled?
[07:09] <synjet> wy: system-->pref-->keyboard shortcuts
[07:09] <fabiim> AnthonyG:  i'll check it out .
[07:09] <fuffal0> jsp means java server page, and has nothing to do with your browser :)
[07:10] <maynoth> um are there any dangers to enabling the universe and multiverse  repositories???
[07:10] <dv_> hm, not really.
[07:10] <AnthonyG> Yes , The danger of non-freeware
[07:10] <wy> synjet: but the programs there are fixed. I want to add more
[07:10] <AnthonyG> O_
[07:10] <synjet> maynoth, no, just that they arent supported I guess
[07:10] <dv_> unless you get problems with copyright issues
[07:10] <dv_> and/or patent ones
[07:10] <dv_> not relevant for private use, usually
[07:10] <NoUse> fuffal0 if its a hardware issue you can't really fix it, you could try downloading and burning another disc also
[07:10] <fabiim> AnthonyG: yes it is
[07:10] <AnthonyG> fuffal0: Shows how much I know about Java XD
[07:11] <AnthonyG> fabiim: Mr.Fuffal0 says its a Java server page.
[07:11] <dv_> all of this only matters for distribution, thats why they are disabled by default
[07:11] <fuffal0> it's confusing, there's about ten different terms all witht he word java in it
[07:12] <AnthonyG> fuffal0: I drink Java.... Just another thing to confuse me :(
[07:12] <fabiim> yeah i just saw it on google now , i'm trying to look for problems with those in firefox .
[07:12] <fuffal0> but a jsp file, in general, means it's a serverside script that is going to output an html file
[07:12] <r00t_> hello
[07:12] <AnthonyG> PHP is better for those things :)
[07:12] <fuffal0> well, that's another argument but
[07:12] <r00t_> i got problem with automatix
[07:12] <r00t_> 2
[07:12] <AnthonyG> Faster to say the least , Bah , Offtopic
[07:12] <fabiim> fuffal0: it ain't doing no output though =(
[07:12] <LjL> !automatix | r00t_
[07:12] <powr-tok> LinAsH, Yeah, I've got permissions.... :(
[07:12] <ubotu> r00t_: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:12] <fuffal0> php and jsp both output html, so a browser should have no problem with it
[07:13] <fuffal0> well, i should say, "in general" they both output html
[07:13] <fabiim> =)
[07:13] <r00t_> gpg: can't open `jriddell.key': No such file or directory
[07:13] <r00t_> LjL,
[07:13] <fuffal0> fabiim, what site isn't working for you?
[07:13] <powr-tok> synjet, seems fine.
[07:13] <LjL> !gpgerr | r00t_
[07:13] <ubotu> r00t_: Getting GPG errors after adding custom repositories? Read the top section of http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:14] <r00t_> nl ?
[07:14] <LjL> r00t_: but, if it's about automatix, you really should be asking in #automatix... or even better, avoid using it ;)
[07:14] <powr-tok> synjet, I mean the settings seemed ok, but it's still not working
[07:14] <cberlo> Can anyone suggest why flash might be killing my firefox?  Using LTSP on Edubuntu, opening a page with any flash content causes firefox to just disappear (crash).
[07:14] <LjL> r00t_: netherlands
[07:14] <fabiim> fuffal0:  http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/netacad/index.html , when i try to login it gives me nothing , just an url : http://cisco.netacad.net/cnams/public/Checker.jsp
[07:14] <r00t_> english ?
[07:14] <synjet> powr-tok: so multimedia files or flash in browser doesnt produce any sound?
[07:14] <powr-tok> synjet, nope...
[07:14] <powr-tok> synjet, nothing seems to.
[07:15] <r00t_> dude its showing gpg: WARNING: nothing exported
[07:15] <r00t_> gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
[07:15] <powr-tok> it was working fine under Redhat 9
[07:15] <fuffal0> fabiim, it looks like checker.jsp is their script that determines if you have a valid login or not - it's not your browsers problem, it's your login/password/their problem :)
[07:15] <r00t_> not GPG
[07:15] <r00t_> maybe i dont
[07:15] <LinAsH> powr-tok, try to install mplayer and try to play an audio file using different audio output (alsa, oss, esd...)
[07:15] <powr-tok> I seem to get a bunch of ALSA lib errors, about no such device etc...
[07:15] <fuffal0> unless, they have some weird javascript that is required that you have turned off, but from looking at it i doubt it
[07:16] <LjL> r00t_: well, perhaps it's the same thing as the GPG error, perhaps it isn't. ask in #automatix
[07:16] <NoUse> r00t_ GPG is compatible with OpenPGP
[07:16] <fabiim> fuffal0:  no , it works on ie . i'm sure . I have to run vm-ware , windows , every time i want to use that page , boring! :(
[07:16] <synjet> powr-tok: looks wierd.. thise selective behaviour.. the drivers are fine if the drums are working..
[07:16] <LjL> r00t_: i'm pretty sure just reading ubotu's link will help you anyway
[07:16] <r00t_> LjL,  no one on automatix :(
[07:16] <LjL> r00t_: too bad... it's still not supported on here, though
[07:16] <malsyned> So I can't uninstall resolvconf, because it's not installed.  and I could make that file read-only, but as you say it's a hack.  Is there any other way to keep dhcp from overwriting my resolv.conf?
[07:16] <r00t_> ok
[07:16] <nagyv> how can I check if I have support for hid devices in the kernel?
[07:16] <synjet> powr-tok: just wondering.. play a video and see what error is spitted out.. and are you using alsa or osd?
[07:17] <NoUse> nagyv if you are using the normal ubuntu kernel, you do
[07:17] <r00t_> :(
[07:17] <battlesquid> LjL, i tried booting the server into recovery mode as you suggested, but was unable to log in with my user :-( you suggested booting with "init=/bin/sh" what do you mean by that?
[07:17] <powr-tok> synjet, not sure... I think it's ALSA.... Im running KDE ATM
[07:17] <r00t_> its my bad luck
[07:17] <r00t_> root@r00t-server:/home/r00t# gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv KEY
[07:17] <r00t_> gpg: "KEY" not a key ID: skipping
[07:17] <nagyv> NoUse: I use Dapper, with its normal kernel
[07:17] <r00t_> LjL,  its showing me error
[07:18] <cberlo> fabiim: Have you tried changing your user agent and/or installing IE4sLinux?
[07:18] <maynoth> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Repositories
[07:18] <LjL> battlesquid: i mean, pass that as a kernel parameter. in the Grub menu, hit "e", and you'll be able to edit the kernel command line. if there's an "init" parameter already, change it to say "init=/bin/sh", otherwise just add it
[07:18] <maynoth> are those instructions safe
[07:18] <maynoth> to delete all the old main repositores
[07:18] <LjL> r00t_: perhaps you should actually read what it says there
[07:18] <maynoth> and replace them with muliverse and universe
[07:18] <maynoth> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Repositories
[07:18] <NoUse> nagyv then you have hid in kernel
[07:18] <LjL> r00t_: specifically, the " (replace KEY with the key ID) "
[07:18] <battlesquid> LjL, thank you, i will try to do that!
[07:18] <maynoth> I dont want to bugger up my ubuntu box
[07:19] <r00t_> LjL,  with what key ?
[07:19] <LinAsH> powr-tok, then it may come from the arts daemon, what's the results under gnome ?
[07:19] <fabiim> cberlo: what's my user agent ?
[07:19] <fabiim> browser?
[07:19] <powr-tok> LinAsH, the same...
[07:19] <LjL> r00t_: with the appropriate key for the repository. which i'm guessing is Jonathan Riddel's key -- which is listed later on the same page
[07:19] <gravygoat> Anyone feel like discussing a networking problem I'm having in Edgy?
[07:19] <r00t_> oh
[07:19] <synjet> maynoth: yes they are (in the sense I havent had any probs, neither have I read anyone crashing their system)
[07:20] <cberlo> fabiim: what identifies your browser as being "Firefox on Linux" etc.  You can change that (depending on what browser you're using)
[07:20] <bradley> is there a setting to allow songs to overlap, instead of having one completely finish before the next one starts?
[07:20] <cberlo> fabiim: I missed what you said you're using (if you said)
[07:20] <synjet> gravygoat: wireless?
[07:20] <levander> My dist-upgrade to edgy is hanging on the message "Starting PCMCIA services...".  How do I tell my machine now to start PCMCIA services?
[07:20] <maynoth> okies

[07:20] <maynoth> thank you
[07:20] <fabiim> cberlo: firefox 2.0  , i think i can change
[07:20] <fabiim> i'll try
[07:20] <nagyv> levander: ctrl+c
[07:20] <levander> nagyv: doesn't work
[07:20] <cberlo> fabiim: there's an extension for that.
[07:20] <levander> nagyv: i need to edit a config file somehwere
[07:20] <Gasten> If I can't draw on a paper, is there any point in getting a drawing tablet to use with Inkscape?
[07:20] <LjL> levander: man update-rc.d -- i guess the script involved is /etc/init.d/pcmciautils
[07:21] <cberlo> fabiim: Try your site as IE6 or Netscape 7 on Windows... it may pass the "detection" the site is using.
[07:21] <powr-tok> LinAsH, hmmmm... i think it might be a permissions problem after all.... it looks like my NIS username is causing a problem...
[07:21] <KJ-ro> hi there .. i am back.. again.. this time from Home....
[07:21] <levander> LjL: PCMCIA isn't started by any of the scripts in rc2.d - it's being started in dist-upgrade.
[07:21] <jdhoreotg> how difficult is it to reinstall GRUB to the MBR if you've overwritten it?
[07:21] <KJ-ro> anyone could help me correct a firewall startup script ... pls ....
[07:21] <KJ-ro> firewall based on iptables...
[07:21] <fabiim> cberlo: oh ok , if it doesn't work ,  you said something about Ie on linux , what's the name of that?
[07:21] <gravygoat> I have a sshd problem if anyone wants to take a stab at answering
[07:21] <levander> KJ-ro: i'd try being more specific with question
[07:21] <nagyv> hello! Is here someone who could help me with bluetooth? I would like to use my SonyEricsson as a remote controller, I have found a site to set up my controller (http://stefans.datenbruch.de/k750i/remote.shtml), but something is wrong. In syslog I get the following error: HID create error 2 (no such file or directory) Any ideas?
[07:22] <cberlo> Gasten: From the sound of things, no.  If you can't draw, more technology ain't gonna help.  :)
[07:22] <Gasten> cberlo: :D
[07:22] <levander> nagyv: it sounds like you need a device file created in the install process?
[07:22] <cberlo> fabiim: ies4linux is the right name -- basically loads IE6 under wine automagically for you.
[07:22] <LjL> levander: i see. in that case, you... ugh, perhaps you could try killing the process for /etc/init.d/pcmciautils... are you upgrading from dapper to edgy?
[07:22] <levander> LjL: yeah, dist-upgrade'ing to edgy
[07:23] <levander> LjL: yeah, i can try that
[07:23] <gnat_x> where would i go to edit the menu in xfce? i want to add something to the multimedia category
[07:23] <gnat_x> ?
[07:23] <nagyv> levander: sorry, could you please give a more digestible advice? :) (both my english and my computer knowledge is limited)
[07:23] <KJ-ro> levander -> well i cant.. really .. i want to do the following: when i enable firewall .. after all the rules are loaded ... i want to enable ip_forwarding (echo 1 > /proc/....)
[07:23] <LjL> levander: (i assume you know that you "should" be using update-manager rather than apt-get) - anyway, https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/boot-troubleshooting.html third paragraph
[07:23] <nagyv> levander: actually, I can connect to the phone or from the phone, even can send files, just the remote controller function does not work
[07:23] <KJ-ro> levander > and my script is prety complicated... (i got it from a forum... tryed to adept it.. but it's not working as it should...)
[07:24] <riddlebox> hrmmm for some reason mysql doesnt want to start now, anyone having any trouble with it as well?
[07:24] <maynoth> wish me luck
[07:24] <gravygoat> I am having an issue with SSHD "going to sleep" where it won't accept connections until I sit down locally at the machine and do something.  Anyone know if networking functions are supposed to "sleep" after inactivity?
[07:24] <levander> LjL: yeah, i'm using update-manager
[07:24] <powr-tok> wooo!!! it's working.... it was just a permissions problem after all.... god damn NIS! :)
[07:25] <AnthonyG> Watch the language ;)
[07:25] <levander> nagyv: well, my guess based on your error message is that a device file needs to be created, i've never done what you're doing, so I really don't know
[07:25] <wsmith> Is there a development metapackage that depends on gcc, make, binutils, etc?
[07:25] <LjL> Ubotu, tell wsmith about build-essential | wsmith, see the private message from Ubotu
[07:25] <levander> nagyv: why not post a question in the forum you got the script from?
[07:25] <thoreauputic> wsmith: build-essential
[07:25] <wsmith> LjL, that's the name of it. couldn't remember for the life of me, and packages.ubuntu.com wasn't any help
[07:25] <Lam_> what package(s) do i install to get amarok visualations?
[07:25] <nagyv> levander: it's a personal site, and I already wrote him, but he is probably busy
[07:26] <levander> nagyv: my next guess would be to post something on arstechnica.com forums
[07:26] <cberlo> Can anyone suggest where I can track down my issue with flash in firefox?
[07:26] <KJ-ro> so anyone whit scripting knowledge ... could spare the tieme to look over my script and .. guide me a little... ???
[07:26] <AnthonyG> Hm.... This brings up a question, Does build-essential have all binutils? Such as GAS, Or only g++ and gcc?
[07:26] <ArrenLex> cberlo: Issue?
[07:26] <nagyv> Lam_: amarok-engines
[07:26] <LjL> wsmith: well, a trick (if you need something like this again in the future) could be "apt-cache rdepends gcc"
[07:27] <Lam_> nagyv: thanks
[07:27] <cberlo> ArrenLex: Flash crashes Firefox when I hit a site that has flash while using a Thin Client on Edubuntu.
[07:27] <cberlo> ArrenLex: Using the actual server works fine.
=== stefg_ is now known as stefg
[07:27] <thoreauputic> AnthonyG: apt-cache depends build-essential suggests not - binutils can be installed of course
[07:27] <ArrenLex> cberlo: what version of Flash?
[07:28] <jdhoreotg> how difficult is it to reinstall GRUB to the MBR if you've overwritten it?
[07:28] <gravygoat> Not to be a pest but asking one more time - is anyone here familiar enough with sshd and other networking services to answer a question about them?
[07:28] <ArrenLex> jdhoretog: super easy if you have access to a Linux system of any sort, including a livecd or rescue cd.
[07:28] <thoreauputic> gravygoat: sshd should not "go to sleep"
[07:28] <LjL> thoreauputic, AnthonyG: binutils is depended upon by gcc, which is depended upon by build-essential
[07:28] <jdhoreotg> (gravygoat): i am a bit
[07:28] <cberlo> gravygoat: Depends on the question:  fire away
[07:28] <battlesquid> LjL, i tried adding init=/bin/sh as you suggested to the kernel line in grub and booted using that. then the ubuntu bootup screen is showing, but it stops after about 5% on the progress indicator. two lines were OK: "loading essential drivers" and "mounting root filesystem" then nothing more :-(
[07:28] <ArrenLex> jdgoretog: like, one command easy.
[07:28] <thoreauputic> LjL: aha
[07:29] <jdhoreotg> (ArrenLex): i have Ubuntu 6.10 installed and i have the 6.10 and 6.06 bLiveCD's
[07:29] <AnthonyG> LjL: I have build-essential , Therefore I have the other binutils correct?
[07:29] <cberlo> ArrenLex: 7
[07:29] <LjL> battlesquid: hmm, perhaps it has just started by the splash screen isn't going away. try Alt+F2 (and if it doesn't work, try again Alt+F1) - or remove the "splash" parameter and add "nosplash"
[07:29] <ArrenLex> cberlo: try 9. Flash 7 is a nightmare.
[07:29] <thoreauputic> AnthonyG: dpkg -l binutils  will tell you - sounds like it, yes
[07:29] <LjL> AnthonyG: i bet you do. anyway, "apt-cache policy binutils" will tell you
[07:29] <cberlo> ArrenLex: I'll give it a go.  Thanks.
[07:30] <gravygoat> cberlo: sshd is installed and works - in fact I am ssh'd into the box right now.  However after a while of inactivity, the ssh daemon stops taking incoming connections.  I get no response, not a RST packet or anything.  After I get a chance to sit down and log in it starts working again
[07:30] <levander> LjL: manually killing process running /etc/init.d/pcmcia worked, thanks
[07:30] <ArrenLex> jdhoreotg: then pop in one of those liveCDs and boot from it. Open a terminal and mount your ubuntu's filesystem into a directory. Chroot into that directory. Run sudo grub-install /dev/<firstdrive>
[07:30] <AnthonyG> LjL: I refuse to reboot until I have a modem solution , But it's good to know I can apt-get them if they are not installed. Yet that needs an _internet connection_ :(
[07:30] <cberlo> Okay, can't help you there.  Sorry.
[07:30] <ArrenLex> jdgoretog: where first drive is /dev/sda if you're on sata or /dev/hda if not.
[07:30] <malakhi> gravygoat, will the box answer a ping when ssh is "sleeping"?
[07:30] <ArrenLex> sata -> scsi I guess
[07:31] <thoreauputic> AnthonyG: ah yes, the modem driver catch-22

[07:31] <ubotu> For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[07:31] <jdhoreotg> cool...thanks, ArrenLex, also, will it auto-config for all my partitions or will i have to do that manually?
[07:31] <ArrenLex> cberlo: why do you need to restart irc for that? xD
[07:31] <Ban_Evader> wow , in chinese! that doesnt sound easy
[07:31] <WizCraker> I just installed 6.10 server and it never asked me to make a password for root.  is there a default one so I can change it?
[07:31] <Ksi> #ubuntu-hk
[07:31] <thoreauputic> !root
[07:31] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:31] <cberlo> ArrenLex: Because I'm using my laptop to test this and it's on a different subnet...
[07:32] <ArrenLex> jdhoreotg: It will use the partitions from last time.
[07:32] <AnthonyG> I wonder what would happen if I deleted root....
[07:32] <ArrenLex> cberlo: have they changed since GRUB last worked?
[07:32] <KJ-ro> where to paste ??? (i forgot how to check)
[07:32] <jdhoreotg> sweet
[07:32] <zooork> once I edit /etc/passwd what should I do to enable my changes?
[07:32] <synjet> ksi: "/join ubuntu-hk"

[07:32] <gravygoat> some one asked a moment ago if the box responds to pings when SSHD seems to go asleep.  Not certain as I have filtering in place so that I can't ping from where I am
[07:33] <zooork> once I edit /etc/passwd what should I do to enable my changes?
[07:33] <fabiim> cberlo: ie4linux , does it exist on repositories ?
[07:33] <ArrenLex> (sorry, jdhoreotg, that was for you. Have they changed since grub last worked?)
[07:33] <ArrenLex> Sheesh, could you possibly get a name HARDER to spell, jdhoreotg?
[07:33] <cberlo> fabiim: Nope.  google it.  It's a "tatanka" site or something to that effect.
=== bubi is now known as bubi^lernen
[07:33] <thoreauputic> gravygoat: does  telnet host.you.have 22   return anything ?
[07:33] <levander> zooork: don't edit /etc/passwd normally, use "passwd" and add user script, etc.
[07:33] <jdhoreotg> GRUB is currently installed and working with Ubuntu 6.10 and WinXP and i was thinking about installing Vista later in the evening
[07:33] <cberlo> fabiim: installs by script
[07:33] <AnthonyG> For anyone willing to assist with this last battle of the modem, I have a full explanation here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=309659
[07:33] <thoreauputic> gravygoat: where host etc is the box for sshd of course
[07:33] <fabiim> cberlo: thanks =)
[07:34] <AnthonyG> So very close , Everything works, wvdialconf even detects it :'(
[07:34] <gravygoat> thoreauputic: I get no packets returned.  I've sniffed it.
[07:34] <WizCraker> thoreauputic: thanks that helped.
[07:35] <malakhi> gravygoat, does the box have any sort of powersaving running on it?
[07:35] <levander> gravygoat: you know there is #iptables if you want to try that
[07:35] <thoreauputic> gravygoat: so what are you using for filtering? maybe your firewall script is causing problems?
[07:35] <KJ-ro> so here is the script that i'm trying to tweek: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34975/
[07:35] <ArrenLex> jdhoreotg: you will have to add those systems manually AFAIK to /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:35] <levander> gravygoat: nevermind, misread question
[07:35] <jdhoreotg> crap
[07:35] <gravygoat> thoreauputic: it's just the DSL router in front of the box.  It's not configured to pass ICMP back to the host.
[07:35] <KJ-ro> aaaa.. error...
[07:35] <KJ-ro> no that's the config file,....
[07:35] <KJ-ro> :))
[07:36] <ArrenLex> jdhoreotg: it's really not hard. Just add entries like http://arrenlex.diff.be/win for it.
[07:36] <thoreauputic> gravygoat: and port 22 is forwarded, right?
[07:36] <battlesquid> LjL, well although nosplash = command not found, at least it allowed me to see what the kernel reports. "Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!"
[07:36] <gravygoat> thoreauputic: it's very wierd.  When I came into to work this morning I could not connect.  I called and had my wife sit down and log in and then I could connect.  I am connected right now in fact.
[07:37] <jdhoreotg> yeah, i can never remember that though...and there's really no palce on the web to find it...so thanks
[07:37] <nolimitsoya> gqview wont do animated .gif:s, anyone know of a lightweight imageviewer that doo?

[07:37] <nolimitsoya> trappist, ill check it out. thank you :)
[07:37] <thoreauputic> gravygoat: does your iptables script run on login? Or equivalent of course ...
[07:38] <jdhoreotg> thanks for all your help, ArrenLex
[07:38] <gravygoat> thoreauputic: it is almost as if there is a power management setting or something else putting the daemon to sleep, or the network card to sleep or something, but I don't know where to check.  I don't have iptables running currently.
[07:38] <KJ-ro> OK: this one is the script file... if anyone could take a look at it... pls..: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34976/

[07:39] <LjL> battlesquid: you can fix it, you're just passing the wrong parameters. i don't really remember them by heart, without rebooting... on my machine, the kernel linux is "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda2 ro quiet splash"  --  i guess i should make it "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda2 ro init=/bin/sh"   to boot like that
[07:39] <daidungsi> how can i run a image without remove it to /usr/bin
[07:39] <thoreauputic> nolimitsoya: you can make a launcher I guess - or just set "animate" as your default for gifs
[07:40] <LjL> daidungsi: come again?
[07:40] <thoreauputic> nolimitsoya: in nautilus for example make the properties open gifs with "animate" - it works for normal gifs too
[07:40] <Lam_> is there a program that can read the id3 tag on an mp3 or music file and rename the file according to a specific format?

[07:46] <LjL> battlesquid: i'll pastebin my /etc/passwd (a fairly default one) so you can check what might be wrong in yours
[07:46] <kandinski> thoreauputic: I am installing the nvidia driver, and it needs x to be stopped. I should have asked that.
[07:47] <wy> synjet: Is there a way to use double click to open it? I've tried to modify the preference. But there is only options for web browsers etc
[07:47] <thoreauputic> kandinski: yes :)
[07:47] <bayzider> synjet: I installed he plug in but im still geting a totem error
[07:47] <LjL> battlesquid: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34977/

[07:47] <thoreauputic> kandinski: heh :)
[07:48] <synjet> bayzider: restart FF, that might help.. if not, then there is something else that I have no idea of
[07:48] <warren282> anybody can help me plesae?
[07:48] <LjL> battlesquid: you can see that, normally, the first user (the one Ubuntu was installed with) has UID 1000 and GID 1000 (GID 1000 being the group that's named as the user itself - check /etc/group). also, in order to use sudo, that user must be a member of the group "admin" - check that it exists in /etc/group and make sure the user's a member of it

[08:01] <battlesquid> LjL, it appears remount command is not available on that box
[08:01] <malakhi> JNeverMind: same motherboard?
[08:02] <NoUse> enyc let me find it
[08:02] <JNeverMind> yes
[08:02] <enyc> NoUse: okay ;-)
[08:02] <LjL> battlesquid: wait, the command is "mount", "remount" is an option... what's it saying exactly?
[08:02] <JNeverMind> i only want to swap the cpu
[08:02] <malakhi> JNeverMind: then it should just work.
[08:02] <battlesquid> LjL, sorry i misread
[08:02] <JNeverMind> just wnat to know its not going to mess with my ubuntu
[08:02] <JNeverMind> ok great!
[08:02] <WizCraker> ekimus: gives no suck file or directory... I'm guessing the install failed someplace?
[08:02] <pwner> hello everyone...sorry to bother but i need some command line help :p
[08:02] <ekimus> WizCraker: you have a /etc/apache2 directory?
[08:03] <JNeverMind> what is it pwner
[08:03] <thoreauputic> pwner: just ask - people will answer if they know
[08:03] <pwner> if i have a zipped package on my desktop, what command do i use to install it once extracted
[08:03] <KJ-ro> people i am not joking... i really can't turn off F10 key from gnome-terminal ..... any idea how i could solve this problem of mine ???
[08:03] <nolimitsoya> pwner, depends on what type och package you have downloaded
[08:03] <beerockxs> which kernel should I use with an Athlon64 for optimal performance, when I have not installed the 64Bit Ubuntu?
[08:03] <thoreauputic> pwner: it depends - what does it unzip as?
[08:04] <trappist> pwner: depends on the package.  but usually, once you're in the extracted directory, you'd say ./configure;make;sudo make install
[08:04] <ekimus> pwner: what's the content, source code, deb file - that depends
[08:04] <nolimitsoya> beerockxs, generic
[08:04] <pwner> .tar.bz2
[08:04] <pwner> it unzips to a folder
[08:04] <beerockxs> nolimitsoya: not k7? also, it's a dual core Athlon64
[08:04] <nolimitsoya> pwner, that doesnt say anything about the content
[08:04] <WizCraker> ekimus: no
[08:04] <thoreauputic> pwner: read the README in the folder
[08:04] <nolimitsoya> beerockxs, no, not k7. -generic has obsoleted all other kernels
[08:04] <enyc> NoUse: waiting patiently and optimistically ;-)
[08:04] <thoreauputic> pwner: assuming there is one - or INSTALL
[08:05] <ekimus> WizCraker: does "dpkg -l|grep -i apache" tell you that apache is even installed?
[08:05] <KJ-ro> people i am not joking... i really can't turn off F10 key from gnome-terminal ..... any idea how i could solve this problem of mine ??? (i don't know if i sent this text... sorry for resending)
[08:05] <nolimitsoya> hm... does the -generic kernel have smp support?
[08:05] <pwner> install by running "make" then "make install".
[08:05] <thoreauputic> KJ-ro: why do you need to turn it off? Using mc or something like that?
[08:05] <nolimitsoya> KJ-ro, what do you mean by 'cant turn of'?
[08:05] <ekimus> nolimitsoya: i think since 6.06 all kernels are smp
[08:05] <nolimitsoya> ekimus, good :)
[08:06] <pwner> ..thats from the readme...but im too dumb to know how to POINT terminal to this folder
[08:06] <thoreauputic> KJ-ro: or use another terminal - xterm, urxvt. aterm, Eterm...
[08:06] <trappist> nolimitsoya: yes
[08:06] <NoUse> enyc https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy/+source/vino/+bug/65795
[08:06] <synjet> KJ-ro: see system-->pref-->keyboard shortcuts
[08:06] <nolimitsoya> pwner, cd <folder> navigates. then just type './configure' 'time make' and 'make install'
[08:06] <ekimus> nolimitsoya: easy way: boot it "cat /proc/cpuinfo" if there are n (where n > 1) then: yes :)
[08:06] <thoreauputic> pwner:  cd ~/Desktop/folder-name
[08:07] <ubu>  /join #ububtu-se
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> ekimus,trappist, thank you. :)
[08:07] <thoreauputic> pwner: you will need build-essential to compile
[08:07] <WizCraker> ekimus: no doesn't give me any output.  Just goes back to the prompt.
[08:07] <fabiim> god dam eve on linux iexplorer really sucks
[08:07] <KJ-ro> thoreauputic > yes .. MC .. want to exit from editor and popup window comes out... (only xterm is working properly.. but that one has crapy fonts)
[08:07] <battlesquid> LjL, thanks a lot!
[08:07] <thoreauputic> pwner: what are you trying to compile/install ?
[08:07] <RedLance> Is the i686 kernel the right one for an Athalon XP 2400+?
[08:07] <pwner> thanks
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> RedLance, no. use -generic
[08:07] <LjL> battlesquid: you're welcome :)
[08:07] <pwner> thore: dssi-vst
[08:07] <illution> hi
[08:08] <illution> how work pt-get download-only
[08:08] <illution> ???
[08:08] <illution> how work apt-get download-only
[08:08] <thoreauputic> pwner: no idea what that is :)
[08:08] <pwner> setting up music related stuff :p
[08:08] <fdoving> illution: it'll download the .deb file to /var/cache/apt/archives/ and don't install it. download-only.
[08:08] <pwner> im using ubuntu for music (f all goes well)
[08:08] <MarcN> illution: apt-get -dy install foo    will download the packages for foo, but not install
[08:08] <RedLance> nolimitsoya, I'm not using Edgy yet, I'm still on Dapper...does that make a difference?
[08:08] <thoreauputic> KJ-ro: yes, gnome-terminal has some weird ideas - blame Havoc Pennington ;)
[08:08] <nolimitsoya> pwner, under normal circumsteces you should never have to compile anything
[08:09] <illution> i have error with this option
[08:09] <thoreauputic> KJ-ro: can you exit by hitting ctrl-D or something?
[08:09] <illution> apt-get -download-only xchat
[08:09] <illution> E: Option -download-only: l'item configuration doit tre spcifie avec un =<val>.
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> RedLance, i dont think so... anyway, if there is no -generic, you should use -k7
[08:09] <RedLance> nolimitsoya, Yeah, that's what I thought.  Thanks!
[08:09] <KJ-ro> i installed Beryl Manager and since then f10-opens poup menu, can't get rid off it...
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> RedLance, either way, real world performance benefit over 386 is neglible
[08:09] <pwner> these are not in repositories...apprently or i havent found a repository that has these
[08:09] <LjL> illution: "apt-get --download-only install xchat" i think it is
[08:09] <ekimus> WizCraker: well then you don't have apache, without any warranty: "apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server-5.0 mysql-client-5.0 phpmyadmin" that should be about it for a lamp server
[08:09] <z0idberg> Does anyone now anything about Feisty Herd 1? It's supposed to be released today, right?
[08:10] <ekimus> WizCraker: DON'T copy and paste that! read about those packages first
[08:10] <thoreauputic> illution:  sudo apt-get -d install <package> I think
[08:10] <RedLance> nolimitsoya, Yeah, I've heard that too, unless you run stuff that uses the extensions... MMx and what not
[08:10] <thoreauputic> LjL: sorry missed your answer to illution
[08:10] <apokryphos> z0idberg: not yet released
[08:10] <sombra> need help with 32bits libraries because of programs which not running correctly
[08:11] <LjL> thoreauputic: no problem. though IMHO you shouldn't spoil the fun of having people type the 20-characters-long version of options ;-P
[08:11] <thoreauputic> LjL: hahah :D
[08:11] <anno2002> Can someone advise? While attempting to install xubuntu, my computer shows a black screen and no activity
[08:11] <WizCraker> ekimus: any clues why choosing the option in the original install did produce a lamp install?   btw using 6.10
[08:11] <z0idberg> apokryphos: Okay, thanks.
[08:11] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, try safe graphics mode
[08:11] <apokryphos> z0idberg: if you're on the announce list you'll get the news straight away
[08:12] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, if that doesnt help, get the alternate install cd for ubuntu, do a cli install, and apt-get xubuntu-desktop
[08:12] <anno2002> nolimitsoya: I have tried that, I see a flickering "_" and the top left hand corner and no activity
[08:12] <sombra> <nolimitsoya> u know about 32 bit layer on 64?
[08:12] <nolimitsoya> sombra, that should just work as is
[08:12] <ekimus> WizCraker: nope sorry, I can't compete with most of the ubuntu gurus, I'm still used to work in command line and do stuff by myself. Thou I wish I could get away from that :)
[08:12] <nolimitsoya> sombra, unless you are running itanium..
[08:12] <z0idberg> apokryphos: Hmm... is it a mailing list?
[08:13] <arno_> Hi all. Anyone knows if ekiga has a dedicated channel somewhere?
[08:13] <apokryphos> z0idberg: yes; join at lists.ubuntu.com
[08:13] <anno2002> nolimitsoya: does it matter whether i use ubuntu or xubuntu alternate install cd?
[08:13] <sombra> <nolimitsoya> but i have a program not doing the same in 64b and 32
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, i dont think there is a xubuntu alternate.
[08:13] <apokryphos> arno_: #ekiga ?
[08:13] <anno2002> right
[08:13] <arno_> #ekiga
[08:13] <apokryphos> arno_: /join #ekiga
[08:13] <WizCraker> ekimus: thanks for your help.  I'll research those packages and see if that works or not.
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, anyway, cli install is just a cli install
[08:13] <arno_> :)
[08:14] <anno2002> nolimitsoya> what does "cli" mean?
[08:14] <nolimitsoya> sombra, if you are using x64 ubuntu, you might run into some problems
[08:14] <LjL> anno2002: command line interface
[08:14] <apokryphos> ubotu: cli
[08:14] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[08:14] <anno2002> Right got it
=== Iain is now known as Psychobudgie
[08:14] <sombra> <nolimitsoya> i know
[08:14] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, a cli(=command line) install will leave you with a command prompt and no x
[08:14] <ekimus> WizCraker: it should be a fast one I'm sure the wiki and forums have a few guides. and from what I saw ubuntu will configure most of the stuff for you so that you can start playing around..
[08:14] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, its one of the install options on the alternate cd
[08:15] <anno2002> nolimitsoya> then after that i install xubuntu?
[08:15] <r00t_> r00t_,
[08:15] <enyc> NoUse: thank you thank you ;-)
[08:15] <First|Laptop> i installed samba, but it's not letting me login to it remotely. it prompts me for a username/password, but it's not accepting my user account. how can i add an account to samba so i can access my shares?
[08:15] <thoreauputic> anno2002: xubuntu-desktop
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, yes, then you just type 'sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop' and reboot :)
[08:15] <Lam_> First|Laptop: on your computer with the samba server on it, $ sudo smbpasswd -a [username] 
[08:15] <enyc> First|Laptop: 'sudo smbpasswd -a <username>" I think
[08:16] <anno2002> nolimitsoya> thanks
[08:16] <nolimitsoya> anno2002, np :)
[08:16] <z0idberg> apokryphos: Thanks, I'll check that out

[08:23] <patrick_king> pakito: do you still need help on flash
[08:24] <mwe> is it possible to limit sshd to only allow local network access or do you need iptables rules for that?
[08:24] <JunkeyWRK> hi, i tried to boot with an ubuntu cd yesterday on an old dell machine (733mhz,512ram,20gig).  it went thru some configuration/startup stuff then the screen went black with a solid underscore cursor, machine froze.  had to unplug the pc.  it does this consistantly.  this machine has on board vid as well as a vid card.  could this be the problem?  does anyone have any suggestions?  btw, i tried a knoppix boot cd and that seems to work.  thanks.
[08:24] <boink> trying to do an install?
[08:25] <boink> use the alternate cd install
[08:25] <JunkeyWRK> either boot with it or install
[08:25] <JunkeyWRK> dont matter, i just wanna try it out
[08:25] <boink> but you want to install ubuntu on that box?
[08:25] <JunkeyWRK> sure
[08:25] <boink> maybe try xubuntu instead of ubuntu
[08:25] <boink> and use the xubuntu alternate cd instead
[08:25] <JunkeyWRK> that's a lighter version?
[08:26] <boink> yes
[08:26] <JunkeyWRK> k
[08:26] <boink> no gnome, no bloat
[08:26] <pip> hello,anyone uses stardict ?
[08:27] <unfun> What is the differnce between ubuntu, kubuntu and xubunut, im using ubuntu but I keep hearing about this other stuff.
[08:27] <cello_rasp> JunkeyWRK: old dells are well known in not showing the live cd properly.
[08:27] <cello_rasp> it
[08:27] <Joakim> And then World of Warcraft is installed!
[08:28] <zniavre> ubuntu is gnome Kubuntu is kde Xubuntu is xfce
[08:28] <boink> kubuntu is using kde
[08:28] <boink> xfce is a much lighter window manager
[08:28] <botxj> yes, hat zniavre said
[08:28] <botxj> what*
[08:28] <boink> I use xubuntu on an old sony vaio laptop
[08:28] <kc76> I guess I forgot my root password. Is their any way to retrive it or reset it. I am using Ubuntu Breezer. I was trying to add users to Samba.
[08:28] <cello_rasp> its the integrated intel graphics at fault. you'll probably need to reconfigure x.org once you have installed ubuntu
[08:28] <JunkeyWRK> cello, you know of ways around the typical problems?  or just try the xubuntu?
[08:29] <JunkeyWRK> ah
[08:29] <cello_rasp> Junkey: install ubuntu or whatever in text only mode
[08:29] <pip> unfun, did you visit ubuntu offical site ?
[08:29] <cello_rasp> gnome should be fine with those specs by the way.
[08:30] <JunkeyWRK> hrm...well...im new to ubuntu/linux...do you have a direct url that walks you through that?
[08:30] <JNeverMind> is there a way to make a keyboard shortcut or else just a shorter string to type in for "sudo shutdown -h now"
[08:30] <JNeverMind> like keyboard shortcut or else make something up like this sudo sd

[08:32] <gOldZahN> how can i turn it higher than 800x600?
[08:32] <math_> can somebody tell me how I can bring back the user-list in xchat?
[08:32] <math_> its gone
[08:33] <cello_rasp> JunkeyWRK: can't find one. Simple way to remember: install in text only.... you will at least get a working system even if the graphics are bad.   Then on install, IF the video is still playing up, go to ctrl-alt-f2, and login. then reconfigure x.org. it shoudl detect the right settings properly
[08:33] <math_> gOldZahN, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:33] <math_> can somebody tell me how I can bring back the user-list in xchat?
[08:33] <math_> its gone
[08:33] <gOldZahN> okaY thX i will try cYa
[08:34] <cello_rasp> JunkeyWRK : what _math said:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:34] <nomin> JunkeyWRK, I think regular ubuntu dapper will run just fine on that machine.
[08:34] <math_> omg... where's my user-list
[08:35] <cello_rasp> yeah, it will be happy with all the desktops. You won't get Beryl or compiz on the integrated graphics card tho...

[08:38] <imsickurdcure> great coz win xp is already installed

Using GIMP for joining the two screens horizontally makes my computer so slow I have to kill the X server -.-'. Is there a way using any CLI command for joining two images horizontally one next to other?
[08:38] <TC`> i having trouble conecting my win latop throught my ubuntu desktop (with two ethernet cards) to internet, the laptop is conected to ubuntus one etherned card and the other ubuntu ethernet card is onnected to internet with static ip
[08:39] <florent_> imsickkurdcure : yes
[08:39] <nomin> imsickurdcure:  you probably need to shrink the windows partition to make room for linux
[08:39] <imsickurdcure> fat32 or ntfs?
[08:39] <nomin> imsickurdcure, you can only shrink ntfs
[08:39] <imsickurdcure> how do i shrink it
[08:39] <nomin> imsickurdcure, xp is usually formatted in ntfs but it can be formatted into fat32
[08:39] <florent_> fat32 or NTFS : both
[08:39] <JNeverMind> right on ubuntu fired right up with that new cpu
[08:40] <imsickurdcure> my hd is already ntfs
[08:40] <JNeverMind> and its passive cooling! nice and quiet now
[08:40] <florent_> use Partition Magic or other software
[08:40] <imsickurdcure> any free software i could use
[08:40] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Yeah, gparted
[08:40] <florent_> QParted
[08:40] <nomin> imsickurdcure, in control panel, admistrative settings (or something like that), then disk management.
[08:40] <florent_> GParted
[08:41] <samadhi> tc, have you seen this:  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Share-the-Internet-connection-from-the-command-line-34834.shtml
[08:41] <nomin> imsickurdcure, if I were you I would let windows shrink the ntfs partition
[08:41] <imsickurdcure> gparted is an ubuntu app or windows?
[08:41] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, If you do the ubuntu install on the hybrid live cd and choose partition when it asks you you'll be fine.
[08:42] <amee2k> hi everyone
[08:42] <imsickurdcure> im sorry im new at this, what is the hybrid cd
[08:42] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Gnome/linux/ubuntu app, you can get it when you boot off the live cd.
=== stefg_ is now known as stefg
[08:42] <tenwattmindtrip> Can anyone direct me towards information on how to update my BIOS? I have a ASUS K8V bord (AMD64).. I have a ROM to update it, but no clue how to do so in Ubuntu.
[08:42] <nomin> imsickurdcure:  just make sure to back up any data you have before messing around with the partitions.  Something might go wrong.
[08:42] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, If you got the normal cd then that's what you need.
[08:42] <tenwattmindtrip> board*
[08:42] <florent_> imsickurdcure, why won't you read documentation on the webste ?
[08:42] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Just stick it in and boot off it.
[08:42] <imsickurdcure> yeah, i just downloaded and burned it
[08:42] <wolfgang> hi, i want to install vsftpd, but I can`t run the make -- what`s the problem?
[08:42] <amee2k> which package contains the man pages for libbz2 ? (hint: it is not libbz2-dev)
[08:43] <TC`> i having trouble conecting my win latop throught my ubuntu desktop (with two ethernet cards) to internet, the laptop is conected to ubuntus one etherned card and the other ubuntu ethernet card is onnected to internet with static ip
[08:43] <nomin> imsickurdcure, which version of ubuntu did you download?  Was it dapper?
[08:43] <RedLance> tenwattmindtrip, You won't update your BIOS from Ubuntu...you'll need to make a DOS boot disk, and on that disk, copy the ROM installer program
[08:43] <imsickurdcure> 6.10
[08:43] <florent_> dapper
[08:43] <imsickurdcure> i think thats the latest
[08:43] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: yes it is
[08:43] <nomin> isn't 6.10 edgy?
[08:44] <florent_> yes, sorry
[08:44] <thevenin> ya
[08:44] <imsickurdcure> lemme check
[08:44] <thevenin> 6.10 == edgy eft
[08:44] <nomin> imsickurdcure, since your new you should download 6.06 which is Dapper LTS  (Long Term Support)
[08:44] <wolfgang> who of you know about installing vsftpd ?
[08:44] <gOldZahN> hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:44] <imsickurdcure> ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[08:45] <imsickurdcure> is that the right version?
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, that'd be fine. just burn it, and reboot with the cd in your drive
[08:45] <nomin> imsickurdcure, 6.10 is the latest version but it's not as stable as 6.06.  I'm using 6.06 now because I'd rather have everything work right without too much tinkering.
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, make sure you burn it as an image, and not just put the file on a cd
[08:45] <kandinski> how do I get mouse cut-and-paste support for termianls?
[08:45] <samadhi> TC`, sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 ; sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
[08:46] <kandinski> (for ttys)
[08:46] <imsickurdcure> would you suggest I install 6.06
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> nomin, edgy i very stable at this point, and more polished. that would be the release for a new user who want as much as possible to work ootb
[08:46] <gOldZahN> 	hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:46] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: i would but thats all opinion
[08:46] <imsickurdcure> is the 6.10 like a beta?
[08:46] <stefg> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, no, 6.10 would be the best choice for a normal user, imho
[08:46] <kandinski> nolimitsoya: I am in x and glx hell
[08:46] <samadhi> TC`, and then you'll either need a dhcp server (dhcp3-server for example) or set up a static connection on your laptop
[08:46] <nomin> imsickurdcure, I would recommend 6.06 because that one has long term support but people are saying that 6.10 has been better than expected.
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, no, its a stable release. just not a lts release
[08:47] <wolfgang> do you know how to install vsftpd`
[08:47] <wolfgang> ?
[08:47] <kandinski> 6.06 worked for me stupendously, 6.10 is giving me lots of frief
[08:47] <kandinski> but ymmv obviously
[08:47] <gOldZahN> 	hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:47] <stefg> 6.10 has issues with openoffice, so it's no-go
[08:47] <imsickurdcure> alright, so after i boot with the cd, i'll choos the option "install"
[08:47] <latoo> is there a Beryl repo mirror?
[08:47] <noodles12> if i was going to use a linux to act as a server to replace my router and firewall, would i search under " linux server" or "linux as router" or what is more accurate term for this?
[08:47] <etsorbme8> using ubuntu 6.06 on a dell d600 laptop will halt on boot up when using the battery, however will boot up fine when connected to ac power
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> kandinski, yes, thats why trying out edgy first is a very good option, imo :)
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, yes
[08:47] <DARKGuy> Greetings! I'm having a trivial problem here... I wonder if any of you can help: I use a script using "import" for taking a screenshot of both X displays (:0.0 and :0.1). Using GIMP for joining the two screens horizontally makes my computer so slow I have to kill the X server -.-'. Is there a way using any CLI command for joining two images horizontally one next to other? (I hate to repeat :( )
[08:48] <imsickurdcure> what options should i choose after that
[08:48] <nomin> imsickurdcure, but you can use the apps before installing it just to see what it's like.
[08:48] <kandinski> nolimitsoya: my problem is I upgraded from dapper, which worked, and now I am in edgy, unable to work
[08:48] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: you might not plainly see an option that says install
[08:48] <RedLance> noodles12, I was just on www.howtoforge.com and I say an article on setting up Ubuntu as a gateway server, such as what you want
[08:48] <thevenin> but you will haft to just hit enter when you se and ubuntu screen
[08:48] <imsickurdcure> will it give me an option to partition or shrink drive c
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> kandinski, as i said, trying egdy first, and reverting to dapper in case of trouble, would be the best aproach for a new user :)
[08:48] <gOldZahN> 	hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:48] <noodles12> RedLance: thanks i'll check it out, have you done this?
[08:48] <nomin> on dapper there is an icon on the desktop in the live session you click to start the installation process.  It's pretty straightforward.
[08:48] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: yes it will
[08:49] <Umgan> hola
[08:49] <imsickurdcure> great
[08:49] <stefg> DARKGuy: I'd search the imagemagick docu... or sudo apt-get install 1G-of-RAM
[08:49] <kandinski> nolimitsoya: I am considering the option to go back. but I am still hopeful.
[08:49] <RedLance> noodles12, No, I use coyotelinux as my firewall
[08:49] <latoo> Where can we get Beryl since their drive crashed?
[08:49] <nomin> nolimitsoya, I think a stable release is better for a new user.
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, after booting you will be in a live environment. clicking the install icon on the desktop will give you a wizard, helping you to perform the installation
[08:49] <thevenin> nomin: sorry i didnt know you were talking liveCD
[08:49] <RedLance> noodles12, That's www.coyotelinux.com
[08:49] <strabes> gOldZahN: update your video card drivers and add them into your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:49] <imsickurdcure> after the installation, will it give me an option which OS to boot on startup
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> nomin, edgy is a stable release
[08:49] <strabes> imsickurdcure: partitions in linux don't have letter names
[08:49] <DARKGuy> stefg: lol, I tried the info and man pages of imagick... nothing relevant :( and that apt-get needs money which I don't have :P
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, yes it will
[08:49] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Start installing then when it asks you

[08:50] <grimeboy> Ahh, clicked enter wrong time

[08:50] <nomin> nolimitsoya:  but there are some people who have mentioned problems with it.
[08:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 3d - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:50] <gOldZahN> thx@strabes
[08:50] <TC`> thanks
[08:50] <imsickurdcure> should I defrag first my drive C before i shrink it
[08:50] <imsickurdcure> or no need
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> nomin, and the same is true for dapper. edgy is a stable release, period.
[08:50] <strabes> gOldZahN: by "them" i meant the proper resolutions.
[08:50] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: not really any need
[08:50] <thoreauputic> imsickurdcure: yes, defrag first
[08:50] <kandinski> can anyone help me in enabling mouse support for ttys?
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, defragmentation is a must if you are planning on resizeing
[08:51] <noodles12> Redlance: is that just a firewall? or does it act as a dhcp server also?
[08:51] <stefg> imsickurdcure: defragging is a good measure... especially if it's ntfs
[08:51] <thevenin> thoreauputic: why may i ask
[08:51] <RedLance> noodles12, It's a firewall, DHCP server and I have it as a proxy too
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, you will be looking as severe data loss if you dont, and having a full backup is always a good idea
[08:51] <w0jtas> hi, i have 5 ips for my servers, do i have to set it in my linux configuration ?
[08:51] <thevenin> i dont defrag before resizing NTFS never gave me any trouble
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> thevenin, good for you :)
[08:51] <RedLance> noodles12, But it won't do file or printer serving, or webpages or anything like that
[08:51] <kandinski> thevein: depends on how full and how old is your disk
[08:51] <imsickurdcure> quick question, how much drive space should I allocate for ubunto when I shrink drive c
[08:52] <thevenin> no i dont mean it like that, if i can learn something new it would be good
[08:52] <thoreauputic> thevenin: my understanding is that stuff can be isolated on the drive and cause problems - but personally I have only linux here anyway
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, that depends on how much you need. ;)
=== deesine is now known as dee|away
[08:52] <RedLance> noodles12, And it only needs minimal hardware
[08:52] <noodles12> RedLance: i'm new to this, it says i need 2 PCI network cards?
[08:52] <imsickurdcure> i only have a 40g hard drive
[08:52] <kandinski> thevenin: old disks han be half full but using sectors spread over all the disk
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, minimum 5gb, id say, for / and /home
[08:52] <thevenin> ya
[08:52] <imsickurdcure> will 10 or 15g be good enough
[08:52] <noodles12> i was planning on using my old laptop  but i guess i didn't know what iw as doing
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, 10-15gb will be fine
[08:52] <thevenin> but old HD == low capacity
[08:52] <thevenin> so i dont bother with them
[08:53] <RedLance> noodles12, Yes, as opposed to the old ISA cards...as long as your network cards are newer then like 8 years, they should be PCI
[08:53] <nomin> imsickurdcure, 10 gigs should be enough.  Depends on how much stuff you are planning on installing and saving.
[08:53] <RedLance> noodles12, It dosen't support laptops
[08:53] <stefg> ubuntu needs about 4 Gig Minimum, but of course you've got to add space or a separate partiton for your /home-dirs
[08:53] <thoreauputic> imsickurdcure: 15 g would be better of course :)
[08:53] <imsickurdcure> now, when I boot windows, will windows see that 10-15g or will it be hidden on xp
[08:53] <noodles12> RedLance: why do you need two?
[08:53] <nomin> imsickurdcure, things will be simplest if you tell ubuntu to use LVM.
[08:53] <thoreauputic> imsickurdcure: windows likes to think nothing else exists
[08:54] <thoreauputic> ;)
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, if you format with the standard ext3 file system, you can use ext2ifs to access it from windows
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> nomin, i dont think advicing a new user to get into lvm partitioning is a good idea :)
[08:54] <RedLance> noodles12, Well, one connects to the internet, and then the other is what connects to the computers on your side.  That way, they are physically seperated from the net...
[08:54] <St3althy> hey all
[08:54] <St3althy> i need help installing ubuntu
[08:54] <thoreauputic> +1 re lvm
[08:54] <strabes> St3althy: !ask
[08:55] <strabes> !ask > St3althy
[08:55] <nomin> nolimitsoya, why not?  During installation you MUST tell it how to partition the ubuntu installation.  LVM is simpler imho.
[08:55] <Kervan> Hello why i cant see this page with opera : http://www.schroederdesign.com/ahmetaslan/launcher_turk.html
[08:55] <thoreauputic> ie don't use lvm until you are more comfortable
[08:55] <imsickurdcure> last question, ubunto can run windows apps right? how do i do that
[08:55] <derFlo> hi
[08:55] <nomin> nolimitsoya, that's how mine is now.  I think it's easier, it's just one partition plus a swap.
[08:55] <noodles12> OH. so how would i use my "linux server" to replace my router and only use the old linksys as an access point?
[08:55] <kandinski> imsickurdcure: install wine
[08:56] <strabes> imsickurdcure: the answer to that question is "partially" - use wine
[08:56] <imsickurdcure> from the repository
[08:56] <zspada15> how do i add something to the startup scripts that has to be run with root privelages?
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> nomin, with the ubiquity installer you can just let the installer do all the partitioning and formating decisions for you. that will save a new user loads of time and grief, figuring out how linux partitioning works :) besides, lvm wont save much later trouble in his case, since we are only looking at 10-15gb partitions
[08:56] <RedLance> noodles12, After you set up Ubuntu or Coyotelinux on the "server", then your "server" would connect to your cable modem or DSL or wahtever you have, and then your Linksys would connect to the "server"
[08:56] <noodles12> o0o0o0o0o
[08:57] <imsickurdcure> alright, i'll give this a shot and thanks for your help
[08:57] <imsickurdcure> later
[08:57] <imsickurdcure> :D
[08:57] <mwe> how do you control if sshd is started when booting?
[08:57] <strabes> mwe: sudo apt-get install bum
[08:57] <noodles12> RedLance: for some dumb reason i kept thinking i was going to attach it to the router and not inbetween the router and modem =/ so either way i would need a machine with two network cards
[08:57] <strabes> mwe: that's boot up manager
[08:57] <mwe> strabes: well it doesn list ssh
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> nomin, the real advantage of lvm would be disk spanning later on, with jfs or xfs filesystems. with this little data, a full backup and reinstall wont be much hassle when upgrading
[08:57] <RedLance> noodles12, Correct.  You need 2 network cards.
[08:57] <strabes> mwe: isn't there an option to show all processes
[08:58] <mwe> strabes: let me check
[08:58] <RedLance> noodles12, It's possible to do it with only one network card, but it's really complicated and not as safe

[08:59] <Ferret_> Hi there,  is there a version of crossover office available for PPC versions of linux?
[08:59] <RedLance> noodles12, Because, if you have one network card, then if someone is trying to "hack in", it's easier for them to get to your inside network, as they don't have to go through your firewall, they can go around it
[09:00] <St3althy> i just put the cd in and there is no option to install onto the pc
[09:00] <mwe> strabes: it's odd. /etc/init.d/ssh is there but I can't find it in bum :|

=== bubi is now known as Bubi^away
[09:05] <nolimitsoya> firefoxjedi, if you are lucky, though most older systems cant boot from usb flash. get your self a new cdrom, theyre cheap anyway :)
[09:05] <St3althy> i need help with installation
[09:05] <RedLance> noodles12, Yes, it is a completly different architecture.  And yes, there are versions of Linux for Sun

[09:06] <mr_daniel> under ubuntu I have found at least three programs, which are able to search for bad clusters in a fat16 device (mp3-player, ...)
[09:06] <mr_daniel> but
[09:06] <RedLance> vader, What's up with your server?
[09:06] <noodles12> RedLance: um. Ultra Creator 10 ?
[09:06] <mr_daniel> I am searching for a program which is also able to mark 'bad clusters or blocks' a non writeable
[09:07] <mr_daniel> I a such program available?
[09:07] <thevenin> bbl
[09:07] <RedLance> noodles12, Ahh...so it's an Ultra 10.  It has what's called a Sun Ultra CPU, not x86 at all...
[09:07] <nolimitsoya> mr_daniel, would that be sort of pointless if its a nonrw anyway?
[09:07] <vader> I cannot get any Linux distro on it RedLance it goes into kernel panic after seeing the compressed image

[09:07] <dm_> Hello. I want to crop a small area from a .ps or .pdf file and save as a new gs/pdf on ubuntu. The package pdftk doesn't seem to support this. Where can I find some info about those operations? Does anyone know an irc channel for postscript/ghostscript related things?
[09:07] <mr_daniel> the point is: I have a mp3-player and I have found 8 bad blocks
[09:08] <neemz> how can I disable the installer from auto detecting network hardware?
[09:08] <Jules98> I have trouble with gdm: if I give "/usr/lib/gdm/gdmgreeter", I got a popup saying that the gdm version is different and that I have to restart gdm or reboot. Even after several reboot, the situation stays the same. Any clue how to start?
[09:08] <RedLance> noodles12, Read here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ultra_series
[09:08] <mr_daniel> now I want to 'mark' them
[09:08] <mwe> strabes: ok. I suppose you can still use it in edgy, right?
[09:08] <mr_daniel> I a such thing possible?
[09:08] <mordof> alright.. um, I have 2 sound cards, but only 1 actually works on my laptop.. i have HDA Intel Alsa Mixer, and Realtek ALC883 OSS Mixer... the Realtek is the one that my speakers play out of, and i'm not sure why the other is there... but HDA Intel is my default and i need to change that
[09:08] <strabes> mwe: i believe so
[09:08] <vader> RedLance, and that is with noapic noalpic noagp pic=bios I have come to the conclusion that Linux will not go on this thing
[09:08] <RedLance> noodles12, Then read here: http://www.debian.org/ports/sparc/
[09:09] <mordof> can anyone help me change my default audio from HDA Intel to Realtek ALC883? heh
[09:09] <RedLance> vader, And you said it's a dual cpu Pentium 200?
[09:09] <zylche> Can someone help me? My flux capacitor can't function well within a zmachine. It's talking about imploding neutrons. I need your help to save the universe, please send $25 to 457B Scam Artist Lane, New York, New York immediately, there's no time to waste!
[09:09] <St3althy> ok i am so stuck i dont see an install command
[09:10] <RedLance> zylche, What HAVE you been feeding your Mr. Fusion?
[09:10] <St3althy> ahh i think i found it
[09:10] <mwe> strabes: I just installed openssh. maybe it will show in bum on next boot or something. the ssh script is not listed now which is odd since I think it's supposed to list anything in /etc/init.d/ and all the others show
[09:10] <noodles12> RedLance: thank you ,i never would've found out what it was
[09:10] <neemz> is there a way I can stop the installer from trying to autodetect hardware?
[09:10] <nolimitsoya> St3althy, its on the desktop
[09:10] <RedLance> noodles12, I have a few old Sun boxes, myself...they are neat to play with
[09:10] <zylche> Yes, but he doesn't think that nachos provide a healthly diet. I'm thinking of killing him in the night and feeding him into an unstable wormhole.
[09:10] <nolimitsoya> neemz, i think youll be better of using gentoo if you want that kind of control :)
[09:11] <vader> RedLance, I even tried Gentoo and it did the exact same thing lol
[09:11] <RedLance> vader, And you said it's a dual cpu Pentium 200?
[09:11] <vader> yes RedLance

[09:12] <vader> just under 1 gig and I have tested it
[09:12] <vader> 768 or someting
[09:12] <mordof> nevermind i got it figured out
[09:12] <RedLance> vader, Lotta RAM for such an old box...
[09:12] <mordof> apparently the game iw as trying to play can't use the sound card while rythmbox was

Even after several reboot, the situation stays the same. Any clue where to look for? I have already re-install the package...
[09:15] <finalbeta> How do I download the source code from a package thourgh apt-get?

[09:16] <nolimitsoya> ok, beryl server for ubuntu is still down. (http://ubuntu2.beryl-project.org/) does anyone know of a reasonably uptodate mirror?
[09:16] <RedLance> noodles12, Debian should be as easy as Ubuntu once you have used Ubuntu for a little while
[09:16] <vader> RedLance, I have downloaded 6.2 RH
[09:16] <RedLance> vader, Did it work?
[09:16] <tyrone> nolimitsoya: /join #beryl
[09:16] <noodles12> RedLance: I've only got about a month under my belt >.< but will give it a try, downloading the first cd right now
[09:16] <vader> RedLance, dont know yet
[09:16] <tyrone> nolimitsoya: see the motd there
[09:17] <gOldZahN> vader, can i give me pls a direct link to download it?
[09:17] <nolimitsoya> tyrone, thank you :)

[09:17] <etsorbme8> how to go about logging startup /  bootup on laptop
[09:17] <gOldZahN> vader, *can you
[09:17] <RedLance> noodles12, What are you downloading, exactly?
[09:17] <Lynoure> tyrone: easiest way might be to run it from mains only and to plug the charger into a thing that measures a powor consumption of any electric device
[09:17] <vader> gOldZahN, sudo apt-get install alien
[09:17] <gOldZahN> vader, big thx
[09:17] <vader> np
[09:18] <sioux> what's alien?
[09:18] <florent_> a softwar efor convert rpm to de
[09:18] <vader> gOldZahN, then you will do sudo alien -d <package name>
[09:18] <florent_> deb file
[09:18] <RedLance> noodles12, Also check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems for more Sun info
[09:18] <florent_> !alien
[09:18] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[09:18] <florent_> sioux... it's ok  ?
[09:19] <budluva> any wireless gurus around?
[09:19] <gOldZahN> vader, <package name> includes the path, right?
[09:19] <zylche> ubotu, yeah, it could analprobe the computer
[09:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about yeah, it could analprobe the computer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:21] <budluva> gave up?
[09:21] <budluva> lol why?
[09:21] <RedLance> noodles12, Those look like torrent files for the source code...what you want is an install CD...cancel that download...
[09:21] <vader> because I could only join my home network nothing open and no other network period
[09:21] <noodles12> lol damn i suck
[09:21] <budluva> vader, you have a laptop?
[09:21] <vader> budluva,

[09:21] <vader> yup

[09:26] <kolAfash> my problem is, that i have no cd-drive in the pc, so i can't directly use the cd
[09:26] <kolAfash> or is there a way, to install ubuntu from a network source like a samba share or from the internet?
[09:26] <thoreauputic> Chest: if gnome runs, you *must* have xserver-xoeg installed

[09:58] <stapel> is there a way that I can browse the contents of my mobile phone via bluetooth in nautilus?
[09:58] <Nerd42> tried that
[09:58] <neemz> you can force the cd driver open using a paperclip normally :p
[09:58] <jordan_> should have worked
[09:58] <jordan_> lol
[09:58] <Nerd42> well
[09:58] <Nerd42> this isn't "normal" this is the iBook G3
[09:58] <Nerd42> which is definatly not "normal"
[09:58] <jordan_> get the mac book pro
[09:58] <Nerd42> i'd call it "junk"
[09:58] <jordan_> pretty sweet
[09:59] <JNeverMind> does APM need to be turned on in bios to be able to set hd to spin down after a timeout ?
[09:59] <neemz> the cd drive should open by the button at startup
[09:59] <sysrage> every cd drive worth a damn has the paperclip hole

[10:00] <Nerd42> oh yay the paperclip worked !! LOL
[10:00] <jordan_> haha
[10:00] <CarlFK> FreshPrince, apt-get install openssh-server ?
[10:00] <jordan_> good idea
[10:00] <JNeverMind> freshprince try #belair
[10:00] <Nerd42> i guess a pen doesn't work and a paperclip does
[10:00] <JNeverMind> lol
[10:00] <neemz> :)

[10:00] <Nerd42> well
[10:00] <Gh0sty> paperclip? this is still ubuntu channel, right?
[10:00] <Nerd42> the button doesn't work people
[10:00] <stapel> is there a way that I can browse the contents of my mobile phone via bluetooth in nautilus?
[10:00] <Gh0sty> or did i end up at #windows? :/
[10:00] <FreshPrince> CarlFK, yes.. but then start it.. that the other user can come in to my pc..

[10:01] <Clippy> It looks like you're writing a letter.  Would you like some help with that?

[10:02] <sysrage> or is there somethin like redhat's service command

[10:03] <Nerd42> Unfortunately I don't even have MS office on my puter
[10:03] <stapel> aah, I'm feeling loved again
[10:03] <FreshPrince> CarlFK, how?.. in my archlinux.. it works with /etc/rc.d/ssh start
[10:03] <neemz> how long does it usually take the ubuntu installer to copy the packages over?
[10:03] <neemz> i've been waiting ages
[10:03] <MarcN> sysrage: type a little more /etc/init.d/whatever stop/start/etc
[10:03] <neemz> and its only at 76%
[10:04] <CarlFK> FreshPrince, that should do it too.
[10:04] <CarlFK> fredrin, er no.
[10:04] <Clippy> stapel, It looks like you are writing a love letter.  Would you like to insert some clipart?
[10:04] <CarlFK> fredrin,  /etc/init.d/ssh start
[10:04] <FreshPrince> CarlFK, ok thx
[10:04] <thoreauputic> neemz: depends how fast your system is I guess
=== Clippy is now known as lostsync
[10:04] <neemz> its a laptop so the harddisk is pretty slow, but the dvd drive is fast and so is the cpu
[10:04] <lumpki> hey stapel... search in synaptic for bluetooth, lots of stuff in there
[10:04] <stapel> :-*
[10:05] <matason> I think Ubuntu has detected my wireless card wrong - how do I go about changing it?
[10:05] <sysrage> reminds me of another thing i noticed. why on earth doesn't ubuntu have /etc/inittab?
[10:05] <stapel> yeah, I did I found this: http://blogs.gnome.org/view/jamesh/2006/10/05/0  looks promising
[10:05] <neemz> ubuntu uses upstart now
[10:05] <sysrage> upstart eh?
[10:05] <MarcN> sysrage: mine does!
[10:05] <thoreauputic> sysrage: because edgy uses "upstart" which is an init replacement

[10:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uboto wireless - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:05] <Gh0sty> it has inittab :p
[10:06] <lostsync> why would sudo echo ninja >> /etc/apt/sources.list give a permission denied error?
[10:06] <Gh0sty> just doesnt use it :p

[10:06] <ubotu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[10:06] <thoreauputic> !upstart
[10:06] <sysrage> ty. i'll research upstart
[10:06] <zylche> lostsync, It's the filesystem trying to stop the ninja from infiltrating the system and taking control. It's a security measure.

[10:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about entering dynamic address in smb.conf - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:07] <gilberto> how can i link /dev/scd0 as cdrom?
[10:08] <lostsync> gilberto, use ln -s /dev/scd0 /dev/cdrom
[10:08] <lostsync> i think
[10:08] <sysrage> that'd do it
[10:09] <Archngel> thoreauputic, if I could get an answer it would be easier,, cant find what im looking for and nobody answer
[10:09] <lostsync> Archngel, what's your question?
[10:09] <thoreauputic> Archngel: usually means no-one currently knows
[10:10] <Seeker`> what is the question?
[10:10] <gilberto> lostsync, file aready exist...and sound juicer tel me "no cdrom in the drive"...
[10:10] <matason> I need to change from Atheros AR5212 to Intel Pro Wireless?
[10:10] <FreshPrince> CarlFK, ok the package is openssh-server?.. not only openssh ?
[10:10] <matason> Can I do this?

[10:10] <sysrage> freshprince: that's correct
[10:11] <nekr0z> Hi there! does anyone know a way to discover services using jabber in Gaim?
[10:11] <FreshPrince> thx
[10:11] <thoreauputic> FreshPrince: openssh-server - but installing just "ssh" will pull it in too
[10:11] <FreshPrince> ah ok
[10:11] <LordMetroid> I installed java but the plugin part still doesn't work...
[10:11] <FreshPrince> then start it with /etc/init.d/ssh start ?
[10:11] <Seeker`> matason: what do you mean by change?
[10:11] <FreshPrince> is that right ?
[10:11] <sysrage> samba by default listens on all interfaces. you shouldn't need to 'enter dynamic address'. but the question really doesn't make sense
[10:11] <neemz> once you aptget the ssh server it automatically starts
[10:11] <thoreauputic> FreshPrince: it will start on install anyway, but yes
[10:12] <lumpki> FreshPrince, it should start when you install it
[10:12] <matason> Seeker`: Ubuntu thinks I have an Atheros Wireless network card
[10:12] <FreshPrince> ok
[10:12] <CarlFK> FreshPrince, yup
[10:12] <FreshPrince> thx
[10:12] <FreshPrince> :)
[10:12] <FreshPrince> htx a lot! :D
[10:12] <FreshPrince> *thx
[10:12] <matason> But it's a Intel ProWireless
[10:12] <Seeker`> where does it say that it is an Atheros?
[10:12] <matason> In device manager
[10:12] <matason> But I can't seem to change it there
[10:12] <neemz> the installer seems to be stuck on "97% cleaning up" yet my room doesn't look any tidier....

[10:15] <dslovin> oh well, thanks for your help
[10:15] <Slike> hi, I recently started a lug at my school and I'm considering to name "plugged". But I want to be sure (English is not my mother tongue) that "get plugged" as a slogan means "get connected" (or something like that), is that correct?
[10:15] <jordan_> well
[10:15] <Gh0sty> no irc at work, you are going to have to work actually now :o
[10:15] <VonGuard> it worked great until today, i left my home network, and now in the wild, I can't see any other networks to join
[10:15] <dslovin> haha i know
[10:15] <jordan_> wireless chip sets are good
[10:15] <rukuartic> sysrage: working's bigger than broken

[10:15] <hoelk_> anyone know where to set klick behavior in kubuntu like in windows (click to select files, dubleclick to open)
[10:15] <hoelk_> ?
[10:15] <VonGuard> it jsut shows my home network, with is 50 miles away. i know there are other networks i can join here
[10:15] <sysrage> rukuartic: then it will work, but a lot of space will be wasted because it will copy the partition table
[10:16] <neemz> is there a button you can hit during startup to stop your computer from trying to detect hardware and load drivers?
[10:16] <budluva> rickyfingers, ?
[10:16] <nekr0z> hoelk_: Try the mouse settings, it was somewhere there.
[10:16] <lostsync> Slike, i think you've chosen an excellent name.  Proceed :D
[10:16] <rukuartic> sysrage: how would you recommend doing it?
[10:16] <rickyfingers>  budluva:  in the address bar type sftp://your-site-ip-or-domain-name
[10:16] <sysrage> rukuartic: back up the files you need and reinstall ;)
[10:16] <kandinski> how long a paste is acceptable here?
[10:16] <VonGuard> is there some sort of corruption of a config file that could cause my wireless preferences panel to ignore all networks?
[10:16] <VonGuard> they don't appear in the drop down menu
[10:16] <hoelk_> nekr0z,  thx
[10:17] <rukuartic> sysrage: how much space are we takling about, and can you fix it later?
[10:17] <sysrage> rukuartic: parted *may* be able to resize the partition after the dd if you want to try it that way
[10:17] <Slike> lostsync: that name contains some sort of an acronym + it gets its english conotation (if correct)
[10:17] <rickyfingers>  budluva:  then it'll ask you for you password/passphrase (same one you use for ssh)
[10:17] <budluva> rickyfingers, all i have installed on the server is ssh

[10:17] <rickyfingers>  budluva:  no, in my experience, ssh server comes as a suite with sftp, scp, ssh services. they all listen to the same port
[10:18] <sysrage> rukuartic: if it's ntfs i doubt parted will be able to resize, but partition magic may be able to
[10:18] <kandinski> I thought sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx was enough
[10:18] <rickyfingers>  budluva:  ergo, they're  all the same service
[10:18] <rukuartic> sysrage: heh I figured something like that. Much appreciated for your help :3
[10:19] <budluva> rickyfingers, cool
[10:19] <budluva> thanks
[10:19] <rickyfingers>  budluva:  just discovered it for myself last night.
[10:19] <rickyfingers>  budluva: excellent way to manage a web site I think
[10:20] <Slike> lostsync: great, thanks! i got some diffusive results from online translation engines, i wanted to be sure..even though it always felt right :P
[10:20] <budluva> rickyfingers, yeah
[10:20] <lostsync> Slike, good luck with your project.  :)
[10:20] <Slike> thx :)
[10:21] <abo> anyone can help me with eclipse automatically building c++ using CDT?
[10:21] <rickyfingers>  budluva: who knows, maybe trying that interface with rails would help it make more sense.  Rails is still kind of inscrutable to me, maybe because I just haven't spent enought time working on it.
[10:21] <derFlo> hi
[10:22] <zention> you can run ssh on different ports but the SFTP SCP runs over an encyrpted SSH session
[10:23] <derFlo> is there any possibility to get my music onto my sony walkman (nw a 1000) on linux/ubuntu? its the only thing what prevents my of a win-less life :(
[10:23] <zention> derFlo: what does the sony use to communicate?
[10:23] <derFlo> a program
[10:23] <sysrage> mount it!
[10:23] <derFlo> and it only works on win
[10:24] <zention> derFlo: :) usb, memory cards... ?
[10:24] <derFlo> i can transfer the songs only with that program
[10:24] <derFlo> it can be mounted
[10:24] <zention> derFlo: the hardware not the software

[10:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about htaccess - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:24] <derFlo> but it does not help, the program must create libraries else i cannot play the songs.
[10:24] <zention> derFlo: just mount and copy over then
[10:25] <derFlo> i tried
[10:25] <neemz> does anyone know the command to goto interactive startup when booting?
[10:25] <zention> derFlo: have you analyzed the libraries?

[10:25] <alex-weej> derFlo: i know it sounds harsh but you have to realise how difficult it is to reverse engineer these things. if you're super bothered, you could take it back for a refund and get one that works OOTB on Ubuntu!

[10:27] <bthornton> Quick non-directly-Ubuntu question: I know hooking up two IDE hard drives on the same cable can hurt performance, but if two drives are connected and only one is being used (i.e. the other has a foreign OS and is never "touched"), will that also hurt performance?  In other words, does it only hurt performance when both are accessing through the same cable?
[10:27] <budluva_> if i have an ati card in my laptop, which is the best driver for me? the one from ati.com or ubuntu's packaged one?
[10:27] <zention> we2by: are you using pam?

[10:29] <we2by> I use passwd
[10:29] <budluva_> zention, what would you suggest?
[10:29] <macd> bthornton, 2 ide drives on the same channel wont hurt performance
[10:29] <macd> budluva, use the ATI one
[10:30] <thoreauputic> we2by: well, tell us the password and your IP and I'm sure someone will help ;P

[10:40] <Unf1> no ideas on Koffice not upgrading? I thought about just rebooting  (hopefully) to Edgy and messing with it later. I really don't use Koffice at all.
[10:40] <Unf1> Rarely, anyway.
[10:40] <zention> tenzin: there is a python app 2mp3.py

[10:41] <ActivE> Hi, my media players cannot recognise samba paths and hence cannot stream video directy from windowsPC's. Any ideas how i might fix this?
[10:41] <Sutur> sysrage: I'll give it a shot.
[10:41] <zention> matason: rmmod <module>
[10:41] <sysrage> active: mount them
[10:41] <Unf1> bah, I'll just try rebooting and hoping for the best. I'm brave. Or stupid. Probably the second one.
[10:41] <Unf1> hehe
[10:42] <Unf1> Don't be surprised if I'm back in here asking, though. We'll see.
[10:42] <matason> zention: Thanks I'll man rmmod :)
=== mikm[headless]  is now known as Crankymonky
[10:42] <ActivE> sysrage yes that would work, however im sure that i have been able to achieve this before without mounting the drives.

[10:42] <tenzin> alecjw, zention: thx for the tip
[10:42] <sysrage> if the media app doesn't support it, then no you didn't. but ok then
[10:42] <Slayer84> Ive got a problem with my acer travelmate 2350. When i use the function keys, to switcht to an external monitor. The computer freezes.
[10:42] <Sutur> sysrage: Nearly. But it didn't extract the files. Why wont "rar x *.rar" work?
[10:42] <matason> zention: Hmm OK - thanks for getting me started :)
[10:43] <zention> matason: lsmod to show the modules - then work out which is the correct modle and add to /etc/conf.d/modules.autoload.d
[10:43] <sysrage> because rar doesn't allow wildcards
[10:43] <Slayer84> Only way thing i can do, is a reboot.
[10:43] <alecjw> linux_kid: i get that on my pentium laptop. just ignore it and get on with your life :)
[10:43] <St3althy> hi all i am installing ubuntu, but when i got to the partitian part, it didnt find anything. do i need to remove partitions first using windows cd?

[10:43] <Slayer84> St3althy: Nope
[10:43] <matason> zention: excellent - thanks :)
[10:43] <alecjw> St3althy: do you want to keep windoze or not?
[10:44] <gopp_> should I find problems in upgrading
[10:44] <Slayer84> St3althy: u just let ubuntu do it for. If u dont want to preserve the windows partions that is
[10:44] <gopp_> what benfits do I get from upgrading
[10:44] <Sutur> I don't know I just make a folder for each set but nothing was in them. In the first folder there were all the other folders repeated.
[10:44] <Sutur> sysrage: I don't know I just make a folder for each set but nothing was in them. In the first folder there were all the other folders repeated.
[10:44] <linux_kid> alecjw: thanks
[10:44] <gopp_> does the new ubuntu update support ntfs write

[10:44] <geokok> hi. i want to add this repo (deb http://gandalfn.club.fr/ubuntu edgy dev) but i dont know how to find the public key to add
[10:44] <Slayer84> gopp_:  No ntfs write
[10:44] <St3althy> alecjw: no
[10:44] <sysrage> f'Sutur: oh i think i know why they got repeated, but don't know why extract failed
[10:45] <St3althy> i just want windows GONE and 100% unbuntu
[10:45] <gopp_> I just have two things, ubuntu ntfs, and my radeon 9550 slow
[10:45] <FreshPrince> how can i search packages with apt ? apt-search <package> ?
[10:45] <gopp_> the draging of windows or switchngs apps is slow in gnome
[10:45] <Sutur> I'll go over it again.
[10:45] <gopp_> or even xfce
[10:45] <alecjw> gopp_: yep, but it's still experimaental and not recommended. dunno how to use it though. i recommend that uou use ext3 or fat to transfer files between linux and windows
[10:45] <Slayer84> FreshPrince: apt-cache search
[10:45] <zention> FreshPrince: apt-cache
[10:45] <gopp_> Slayer84 what the best way
[10:45] <sysrage> Sutur: for i in *.rar; do mkdir $i.dir && cd $i.dir && unrar x ../$i && cd ..; done  ?
[10:45] <alecjw> St3althy: just select "erase entire disk" then
[10:45] <gopp_> alecjw oh
[10:45] <Slayer84> gopp_: Reformat
[10:45] <gopp_> Slayer84 what the best way to update it
[10:46] <gopp_> so don't install on top of it
[10:46] <St3althy> alecjw: where? i am step 5/6 asnd it says manual partitian
[10:46] <gopp_> but I will lose my desktop
[10:46] <gopp_> or update on top of it
[10:46] <gopp_> hmm
[10:46] <geokok> any clue how to find a repos public key?
[10:46] <Pie-rate> i followed all the directions i could find on the world of warcraft howto, it crashes like this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35020/
[10:46] <Slayer84> gopp_: from dapper to edgy? Reformat. U might have succes in upgrading bur i wouldnt count on it
[10:46] <we2by> zention, thanks
[10:46] <Sutur> sysrage: Nope. What is "for"? No manual entry...
[10:46] <alecjw> St3althy: go back to the auto parititon thing. instead of selecting manaual, select erase entire disk
[10:46] <gopp_> Slayer84 how is support for ati radeon 9550
[10:46] <sysrage> sutur: man bash
[10:47] <CarlFK> gopp_, there is a driver to let win access ext2/3
[10:47] <zention> we2by: I still don't advise but if you must :)
[10:47] <St3althy> alecjw i can only choose manual
[10:47] <St3althy> there is no auto
[10:47] <we2by> zention, I'm tired typing my long password
[10:47] <Slayer84> gopp_: hmm i think my boddy has such a card, i think it is okay
[10:47] <sysrage> sutur: but if you don't understand, man bash probably won't help you understand. it's a basic loop
[10:47] <CarlFK> !fs-driver
[10:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fs-driver - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:47] <Slayer84> gopp_:  the suport that is
[10:47] <we2by> by setting my password to pp is easier to type
[10:47] <alecjw> gopp_: is there any important data on the ntfs disk which you cant back up ont you linux parititon for a while?
[10:47] <we2by> ops
[10:48] <CarlFK> hmm... you used to.
[10:48] <Slayer84> gopp_:  U should try looking into FUSE for the ntfs write
[10:48] <fuffal0> what's a common partition setup for ubuntu server?  i was thinking of something like / (root) 7gigs, swap 2gigs, ~therest /var - is that reasonable? (i plan to log to this server from other servers, hence the larger /var)
[10:48] <Sutur> Yeh I understand vaguely what you're doing but I'd never be able to get the syntax right myself.
[10:48] <alecjw> St3althy: sorry. dunno what to do then
[10:48] <CarlFK> gopp_, www.fs-driver.org It provides Windows NT4.0/2000/XP with full access to Linux Ext2 volumes (read access and write access).
[10:48] <Spee_Der> Good evening world.....
[10:48] <CarlFK> fuffal0, is there anything wrong with the defaults?
[10:48] <Slayer84> Anyone who knew how to fix the monitor problem?
[10:48] <zention> we2by: and much easier to crack that is the point - you are connected and the reason linux has less viruses is not because of some great inbuilt secuirty but because the users don't tend to circumvent it
[10:48] <Slayer84> Should i reconfigue something in xorg?
[10:48] <CarlFK> fuffal0, not sure why you want a larger /var
[10:49] <fuffal0> carl, because it's housing log files for a bunch of servers, as well as some vmware files
[10:49] <fuffal0> which i was going to put in var
[10:49] <Sutur> sysrage: Don't worry mate. I'll just do it one by one. But thanks anyway.
[10:49] <Rorviker> Can someone point me to a decent ftp client for ubuntu with SSL support? I have tried to wine FlashFXP and it works fine but it hangs when it list directories.

[10:49] <sysrage> ok
[10:49] <gopp_> CarlFK wow is that free
[10:49] <alecjw> CarlFK: and /var/ww is where all of the http docs are
[10:49] <Slayer84> Rorviker: Hmm Gft?
[10:50] <Slayer84> Rorviker: GFTP
[10:50] <CarlFK> gopp_, free, and Open Source
[10:50] <sysrage> rorviker: if you want a GUI, they all suck. yafc rocks though if you can handle CLI :)
[10:50] <febuiles> ^^
[10:50] <Rorviker> sysrage: I could probally ut I want GUI
[10:50] <Red_Death> Hey guys
[10:50] <Rorviker> Slayer84: Dont think gFTP had ssl support? Atleast I didnt find the option there
[10:50] <Chewy954> Lnks234
[10:50] <we2by> zention, I know what I'm doing
[10:50] <zention> Rorviker: konqueror, mc, nautilus
[10:51] <Red_Death> I'm running ubuntu 6.06, and every once in a while, all sound stops and it just beeps for a while, then goes back to normal
[10:51] <sysrage> rorviker: well i used to have flashfxp working in wine. but that was over a year ago. newer versions may be broken
[10:51] <CarlFK> fuffal0, the vmware files will soak up gigs fast.  why not have one big partition?
[10:51] <Red_Death> anybody have any ideas on why it does that?
[10:51] <zention> we2by: it will happen anyhow - as the platform gets more popular people will want to circumvent more for convenience
[10:51] <alecjw> gopp_: if it's possible to reformat the ntfs disk (ie it isnt running windows), i recommend that you format it in fat32 or ext3. you need a special program to open ext3 drives in linux, so fat is better, as you don't need to install those drivers - useful if you want to use it on a computer which isnt yours
[10:51] <matason> zention: I couldn't locate /etc/conf.d/modules.autoload.d?
[10:51] <Slayer84> Rorviker: No i think you are right. (Just checked:-) )
[10:51] <rickyfingers> Rorviker: what about ssh? Try opening File Browser, click Go->Location... and type sftp://your-site-address
[10:52] <zention> matason: try without conf.d
[10:52] <sysrage> sftp != SSL enabled FTP
[10:52] <we2by> zenit, I don't have any service running where some one can login

[10:53] <Enselic> When I hold down Shift, I cannot move my mouse. What could cause this?
[10:53] <zention> s/the/then/
[10:53] <Red_Death> Slayer84: lemme open it up and check, I know it's five channel but I'm only using one, brb
[10:53] <matason> Ok thanks - I can't find that either but I keep looking :)
[10:53] <Slayer84> Red_Death: Wait!
[10:53] <fbc> Is there any way to get BCM4318 working in edgy eft?
[10:54] <Red_Death> Slayer84: back, it's a soundblaster live! it's from my dell xps from 1998
[10:54] <Slayer84> Red_Death:  Just open a terminal and type "lspci" then look after the card
[10:54] <BlackHawk> gn8
[10:54] <Red_Death> Slayer84: it was easier for me to look in the case, all I had to do was turn a light on :P, but i'll do that
[10:54] <Red_Death> Slayer84: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 07)
[10:54] <Rorviker> richiefrich: WHen I did what you suggested I did just get an error that told me Nautilus cannot open blabalbalbalba
[10:55] <Slayer84> Red_Death:  Hmm i think that the soundblaster is pretty well supportet.... Is it when u run specific programs?
[10:55] <gopp_> carld hmm so this won't ruin my linux filesystem

[10:59] <DARKGuy> FreshPrince: apt-cache search <phrase>
[10:59] <nette> i know how to do it when i log into a remote machine, just edit /etc/motd.. but how do i do that in a shell on my pc?

[10:59] <nette> Slayer84, because it's cool!
[10:59] <FreshPrince> thx
[10:59] <Ayabara> NoUse, ok. it is painfully slow to maximize/minimize windows. much slower than I thought it would be with the current config. I installed vmware-tools on the vm but it didn't seem to have much effect.
[10:59] <DARKGuy> FreshPrince: Wait
[10:59] <sysrage> nette: it's so not cool
[10:59] <Ayabara> I'll try increasing to 360
[10:59] <Slayer84> nette: ahh okay then:-)

[11:02] <fbc> zspada15:  still there?
[11:02] <Rorviker> I think it's just not flash fxp that fucks up.. cause I cant list in any clients.. and passive mode is on
[11:02] <zention> nette: vi ~/.bashrc and add an echo line to the end
[11:02] <mparrish> Slayer84: yeah.  I use it on an HP nw8240.
[11:02] <nette> zention, ok:)
[11:02] <nette> zention, thanks it worked:)
[11:03] <Slayer84> mparrish: Does it work if u connect an external monitor?

[11:03] <mparrish> Slayer84: yeah I have a 20" LCD hooked up to it right now. (HP 2025)
[11:04] <sysrage> rorviker: i've seen that happen if the server is behind NAT and the passive ports aren't forwarded

[11:05] <wigsta> trying to use ntfsmount to mount a usb hdd with write permission - can somone help with the command line syntax?
[11:05] <Bearcat> hello all
[11:05] <MrBear> hello people
[11:05] <Slayer84> mparrish: Mine?? Just an old crt monitor
[11:05] <rickyfingers> wigsta, I think you might need to re-compile kernel with ntfs write support.
[11:05] <lumpki> hello Bearcat, MrBear
[11:05] <sysrage> writing to ntfs in linux is a very bad idea
[11:05] <Slayer84> mparrish: And it just not working(tm) :-)
[11:05] <Ayabara> NoUse, I tried with 360, but it is not faster. did you do any tweaking? someone said I should avoid swapping, but I don't know how..
[11:06] <rickyfingers> wigsta: it wasn't enabled in my default kernel .config from ubuntu
[11:06] <Samuli^> Can you change the computer name?
[11:06] <Bearcat> I'm a very new ubuntu user, but i'm not new to linux. what do i need to install to get the 1.5 mozilla plug-in
[11:06] <mparrish> Slayer84: there should be X.org logs in /var/log somewhere.  Maybe there's an indication there as to whats going on.
[11:06] <bimberi> !hostname | Samuli^
[11:06] <ubotu> Samuli^: Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[11:06] <rickyfingers> Samuli^: try editing /etc/hostname
[11:06] <NoUse> Ayabara swapping happens when you run out of main system memroy
[11:06] <zention> nette: you have to be a little careful - as sometimes applications logon as users - so ~/.bashrc is fairly safe but /etc/bashrc probably is not to do that
[11:06] <NoUse> Ayabara I didn't have to do any tweaking
[11:06] <Samuli^> thanks guys
[11:06] <Sp0mb3> hey all
[11:07] <lumpki> Bearcat, which plugin
[11:07] <nette> zention, ok will keep that in mind
[11:07] <Slayer84> mparrish: Ive looked in dmesg and messages. No indication But ill look at the xorg log
[11:07] <MrBear> whats up
[11:07] <Sp0mb3> d
[11:07] <Sp0mb3> nice
[11:07] <wigsta> rickyfingers, sounds a bit extreme!
[11:07] <Sp0mb3> how do i log in as root?
[11:07] <Ayabara> NoUse, ok. will just use the image for the stuff I can't do in ubuntu, so I'll settle :-)
[11:07] <Bearcat>  lumpki: just a plugin that will allow me to utilize java scrips
[11:07] <zention> nette: there is a distinction between an interactive logon and one that is not so read up on the bash files to find out which is which

[11:07] <we2by> oh, wrong window.
[11:08] <Sp0mb3> lol
[11:08] <NoUse> Ayabara you might try Parallels for Linux, I use it on my Mac and its blazing fast
[11:08] <Sp0mb3> how do i log in as root
[11:08] <fbc> how can I tell what kernel version I have..
[11:08] <we2by> Sp0mb3, u don't
[11:08] <rickyfingers> wigsta: sorry it's the only way I know for sure.  On the other hand, I think there's some packages you can install with synaptic, but I don't know which ones, I'm used to recompiling the kernel by now.
[11:08] <we2by> fbc, uname -r
[11:08] <bimberi> Sp0mb3: 'sudo -i' in a terminal gives you a root login shell
[11:08] <fbc> we2by:  thanks
[11:08] <Ayabara> NoUse, thanks for the tip
[11:09] <bimberi> ubotu: tell Sp0mb3 about root | via /msg
[11:09] <zention> Sp0mb3: more often su - is used
[11:09] <wigsta> rickyfingers, pretty sure I have the required packages installed - just struggling with the correct ntfsmount syntax
[11:09] <bimberi> zention: not in Ubuntu though
[11:09] <we2by> bimberi, I think it does work
[11:09] <we2by> I have used that command a few days ago
[11:09] <Slayer84> Talking of kernels. Why do i get a Linux ubuntu 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP when mi computer aint a duel core??
[11:09] <Sp0mb3> ty!
[11:09] <Rorviker> I cant list ftp directories on sites wich have SSL turned on, any ideas?
[11:10] <bimberi> we2by: 'su -' will work if you have set a root password
[11:10] <Sp0mb3> i just got this ubuntu thing, and its more haxXxorz than i could have imagined
[11:10] <zention> bimberi: sudo -i is probably aliased to su -
[11:10] <Sp0mb3> -i?
[11:10] <rickyfingers> wigsta: should be as easy as: sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sd<whatever-you-can-use-dmesg-to-see-after-plugging-in-the-usb-drive> /mount-point
[11:10] <bimberi> zention: no, there are differences
[11:10] <we2by> any program similar to amarok for gtk?
[11:10] <Sp0mb3> every instruction i read, it says, log in as root
[11:10] <Slayer84> we2by:  Banshee?
[11:10] <we2by> nah
[11:11] <we2by> there is another one, can't recall the name
[11:11] <Halpo> anyone know if there is a good kernel discussion chatroom out there
[11:11] <Slayer84> Sp0mb3: Open terminal " Sudo su
[11:11] <Slayer84> we2by: Rythmbox;-)
[11:11] <rickyfingers> wigsta: I had problems once because my ntfs usb drive had like 7 itty-bitty partitions so the command wound up being like:

[11:11] <penelo> why did xchat throw me onto here!
[11:11] <penelo> l8r
[11:12] <rickyfingers> wigsta: but that was still w/ a kernel that had ntfs write support compiled in.
[11:12] <Pie-rate> Package msttcorefonts is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[11:12] <Pie-rate> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or

[11:12] <zention> etsorbme8: yes it does
[11:12] <rickyfingers> wigsta: I guess the packages that enable ntfs writing are probably modules one gets as a result of choosing to compile the option as a module.
[11:12] <sgorilla80> lpr: lp: unknown printer
[11:13] <sgorilla80> thats what i get
[11:13] <Pie-rate> i didn't paste that much...

[11:22] <Trackilizer> Since i upgraded to edgy, my Flash USB stick dosen't mount anymore, in dapper it was a matter of plugin it in and an icon showed up o the desktop, now, nothing happens
[11:22] <zention> lpr is normally taken by cups
[11:22] <windmill> dm, the functionality (scroll bar) it still gone but this new problem seems very odd and not something I can work around
[11:22] <learninglinux> is not rdram always supposed to be installed in pairs?
[11:22] <Trackilizer> is there a way to solve this?
[11:22] <dm> windmill oh i had probs in that kernel too, im on 6.10 edgy and it works great
[11:22] <zention> but of course it might not be here
[11:22] <imsickurdcure> hello
[11:22] <livingdaylight> I have Ubuntu installed. Is it safe to install kde-desktop? What will happen to the Menus and settings?

[11:23] <lumpki> livingdaylight, it safe
[11:23] <imsickurdcure> how do i change screen resolution... its not on the dropdown list
[11:23] <Sp0mb3> ok
[11:23] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: Do a "sudo aptitude installe kde-desktop !!
[11:23] <Sp0mb3> its not working
[11:23] <zention> livingdaylight: KDE can autogenerate those menus - but it is just another desktop
[11:23] <dm> windmill i would use ubuntuforums.org see if you can find anything, i was never able to solve my problem, but for now i gotta go, i have a date ( litterally )

[11:23] <livingdaylight> is there not a conflict between the way the two are setup?
[11:23] <Sp0mb3> so things dont get lost

[11:23] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: Then u can remove all the items again. But yes u menus will get overcrowde
[11:23] <Slayer84> d
[11:24] <imsickurdcure> thanks
[11:24] <livingdaylight> Slayer84, why aptitude?
[11:24] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: In my opinion
[11:24] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: Better removel of ophaned packedes
[11:24] <Slayer84> Dam got smoke in my eyes
[11:24] <Sp0mb3> i need someones help in like a private room or something, i wont take long

[11:26] <livingdaylight> cafuego, aptitude does this better than apt-get?
[11:26] <Slayer84> livingdaylight:  much
[11:27] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: better
[11:27] <Dreamglider> i have no sound when i look at videos on youtube. i j
[11:27] <zention> Dreamglider: codec problem probably
[11:27] <alecjw> Dreamglider: are you using alsa for sounbd?
[11:27] <Dreamglider> i have 6.10 and firefox browser
[11:27] <livingdaylight> Slayer84, which do you prefer kde or gnome desktop?
[11:27] <Slayer84> livingdaylight:  Gnome!
[11:27] <livingdaylight> Slayer84, i hear Kubuntu really rocks
[11:28] <canine_kouji> okay nevermind
[11:28] <Dreamglider> alecjw, hang on
[11:28] <canine_kouji> I do use the 64bit on a core2 duo
[11:28] <canine_kouji> awesome :)
[11:28] <Dreamglider> ill chwsck
[11:28] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: I dont thinks it sucks the dapper version was just better(in my opinion=
[11:28] <livingdaylight> Slayer84, i hear gnome is more for simple people
[11:28] <canine_kouji> bet all your guy's computers are slow boats :P
[11:28] <we2by> zention, that's dangerous!
[11:28] <we2by> a stupid command can screw up your system
[11:28] <weebit> my adut software says i have the NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 440 with AGP8X (Dell) [Display adapter]   is this the same as the [GeForce4 440Go]  MX 440 8x AGP? on the hardware page?
[11:28] <kestaz> how can i get newest kernel generic like 2.6.18 with apt-get ?
[11:29] <kestaz> is any unofficiall builds ?
[11:29] <Slayer84> livingdaylight: Gnome is more for people wanting to get a job done, and not fideling around with the desktop settings
[11:29] <Trackilizer> Since i upgraded to edgy, my Flash USB stick dosen't mount anymore, in dapper it was a matter of plugin it in and an icon showed up o the desktop, now, nothing happens
[11:29] <canine_kouji> weebit: /exec rm -rf /
[11:29] <zention> we2by: yeah well after a while though you don't make mistakes as root most do it once
[11:29] <canine_kouji> we2by: :P
[11:29] <canine_kouji> weebit: whoops ;) speaking to we2by
[11:29] <Slayer84> Trackilizer: Did u upgrade or make a clean install?
[11:29] <Trackilizer> clean install
[11:29] <we2by> :P
[11:29] <weebit> ok
[11:29] <weebit> n/p
[11:30] <zention> we2by: if you admin a system then it is crazy to sudo all the time
[11:30] <canine_kouji> and then I drop to a root shell ;)
[11:30] <zention> we2by: and sudo can introduce a few security problems as well
[11:30] <we2by> zention, I know
[11:30] <bimberi> yes, weebit, please ignore that post from canine_kouji !!
[11:30] <EdLin> zention: sudo -s
[11:30] <we2by> but a short password can make it even faster to login
[11:31] <zention> we2by: see that is the worse solution to it :)
[11:31] <EdLin> we2by: short passwords are *bad*
[11:31] <we2by> zention, I'm not that paranoid
[11:31] <MtJB> i have edgy on two systems, on one of them the admin menu offers an option for using windows drivers, but not on the other.  what do i need to add to the one without the option, to get it?
[11:31] <MtJB> Edlin is bad.
[11:31] <canine_kouji> EdLin: you mean making my password "Cat" is bad? :/
[11:31] <canine_kouji> ;)
[11:31] <EdLin> we2by: I used a dictionary word in a password and got root-kitted
[11:31] <Slayer84> Trackilizer: Hmmt then i cant help, try browsing the forum
[11:31] <Trackilizer> oh! already tried that....
[11:31] <we2by> EdLin, how come? had ssh running?
[11:31] <Slayer84> Trackilizer: (I know its a crap answar)
[11:31] <Samuli^> don't you think ">" should be append to the end of file and ">>" to overwrite the whole file with stout
[11:32] <pianoboy3333> What are the items in burn:///? Symlinks?
[11:32] <zention> we2by: people can get through a NAT
[11:32] <Trackilizer> nah! no problem, i'll ask in the kubuntu channel, someone there might know
[11:32] <EdLin> now my password is of the reccomended length, I turn off root logins, and use invented acronyms with numbers, as is recommended.
[11:32] <Trackilizer> thanks anyways
[11:32] <we2by> zention, ow
[11:32] <we2by> how*
[11:33] <Dreamglider> alecjw, sorry dude, it works now, i have NO idea why it does but it does!
[11:33] <MtJB> is anyone familiar with the "use windows driver" thingie?
[11:33] <zention> we2by: I don't think people woud appreciate a howto on this channel but you can search the web for it
[11:33] <sysrage> mtJB: ndiswrapper?
[11:33] <canine_kouji> openbsd 3.1, which included sshd and contained an exploit... so.. "secure by default" died on the sshd release
[11:33] <Pekay> heya, i want to know how i can make two ubuntu installations both share files on a network
[11:34] <MtJB> sysrage, it may be based on that, but it was a menu option in the system admin menu
[11:34] <MtJB> sysrage, one of my edgy machines has it, the other doesn't.  i'm trying to figure out what package i need to install to have it on both machines.
[11:34] <zention> Pekay: you can mount the shared device
[11:34] <EdLin> canine_kouji: openbsd is good at one thing though, reverse engineering drivers. I wish Linux would do that rather than accept a few binary blobs and not support other such hardware.
[11:34] <fuffal0> i just installed ubuntu server, and after installation i reboot (as requested) and it's frozen at "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel" - any ideas?
[11:34] <kmasta> ok, so you know how on macs you can put little sticky notes on your desktop, is there anything analagous to that in ubuntu
[11:34] <bimberi> !nfs | Pekay
[11:34] <ubotu> Pekay: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[11:34] <Pekay> zention: but where would this shared device?
[11:35] <MtJB> i once wrote 250K lines of Cobol using Edlin.  I've never recovered.
[11:35] <alecjw> Dreamglider: i, on the other hand do know why :D
[11:35] <zention> Pekay: well is the drive on one system? If so that system has to be on as well
[11:35] <alecjw> (i think)
[11:35] <EdLin> MtJB: you didn't use xedit?
[11:35] <canine_kouji> EdLin: theo is a strict person when it comes to drivers, this scsi card rep tried to con theo in to making a driver of the card using documentation which requires NDA
[11:36] <MtJB> Edlin:  at the end of the project, my boss bought me PE II
[11:36] <bimberi> kmasta: Tomboy Notes - add it to your panel (if you have Edgy.  Sticky Notes for Dapper)
[11:36] <Pekay> zention: aha its ok :p, so that guide. if i mount that device, i can then see and use it from the other pc on the network?
[11:36] <zention> Pekay: ssh can mount a remote drive it is not a bad way to use ssh really
[11:36] <MtJB> this was 1982, if i recall
[11:36] <Pie-rate> the gnome terminal that msttcorefonts was running in isn't redrawing itself...
[11:36] <Pie-rate> why?
[11:36] <kmasta> bimberi, where can i find that?
[11:36] <alecjw> Dreamglider: some audio drivers only allow one program to output sound at the same time. alsa can handle a lot more
[11:36] <EdLin> MtJB: my nick of course is a joke. even ed(1)  is a better editor than edlin.
[11:36] <Dreamglider> alecjw, why ?
[11:36] <bimberi> kmasta: right-click on the panel, Add to Panel
[11:36] <MtJB> edlin is truly evil
[11:36] <Pekay> zention: ill be physically at these pcs but ty
[11:37] <kmasta> ah, i c
[11:37] <Dreamglider> yea but i didnt change anythinG!
[11:37] <zeeble> Hi. I need some help. I installed Ubuntu 6.10, then did apt-get install kubuntu-desktop. now i get this error.. The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[11:37] <zeeble>   ksysguardd: Depends: libavahi-compat-libdnssd1 (>= 0.6.13) but it is not going to be installed
[11:37] <zeeble>  ... i tried apt-get -f install, but no cure yet. cant install anything else either
[11:37] <EdLin> MtJB: I once had to use it as a primative patch program for a Pro-YAM script. That was sort of a cool hack.
[11:37] <kmasta> bimberi, what is the difference between sticky notes and  tomboy notes
[11:37] <dan14> anyone know a good dock that works with beryl?
[11:37] <alecjw> Dreamglider: did you exit a program which was making noise?
[11:37] <zention> Pekay: try with ssh first - then if you don't want the secure tunnel you will have to configure NFS or some other one
[11:38] <Dreamglider> alecjw,  i had no sound program running!
[11:38] <bimberi> kmasta: tomboy has more features (can link notes, can save as HTML  to name 2)
[11:38] <ganix> hello everybody! Does anybody know how to run a program in background while passing it to gnome-terminal with the -e parameter? The problem is that if I try -e="somecommand &" the terminal closes itself...

[11:38] <kmasta> *thanks!
[11:38] <alecjw> Dreamglider: some programs can hog your sound output without you knowing eg skype, giam etc

[11:55] <justin420> anybody help with disabling agpgart by default?
[11:56] <Skwid_> anyone ?
[11:56] <alecjw> battlesquid: assuming that that;s the package name, sudo aptitude install display-aa
[11:56] <stefg> burwaco: you want a server-install and then a carefully handselected choice of packages... no wizard, no *-desktop-package... just plain know-how and manual installation
[11:56] <zeeble> I almost had the perfect setup going
[11:56] <battlesquid> alecjw, i know that, but there's no results
[11:56] <zeeble> :((
[11:57] <arepie> TheGateKeeper, i just want to get back to the kernel before i upgrade.. i mean the fresh install of edgy kernel
[11:57] <danny500> um, My desktop and Icons and wallpaper are not loading up when I turn my computer on. Can anyone help?
[11:57] <alecjw> battlesquid: when did you last update your repos?
[11:57] <ganix> zention: I included this command to "startup programs" in "sessions": gnome-terminal --window-with-profile="DesktopConsole" -e="vpnclient connect profile &"
[11:57] <bimberi> zeeble: looks like you need uninstall the package "bonjour"
[11:57] <battlesquid> alecjw, i don't know
[11:57] <burwaco> stefg: I don't want a server, I have an old laptop here PII 300Mhz, I just want a nice slip x environment and firefox, but not fluxbox...
[11:57] <fuffal0> i just installed ubuntu server, and after installation i reboot (as requested) and it's frozen at "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel" - i've tried adding: noacpi noapic nousb to grub, still nothing
[11:57] <alecjw> battlesquid: sudo aptitude update
[11:57] <burwaco> slim
[11:58] <TheGateKeeper> arepie, not sure sorry :-(
[11:58] <alecjw> battlesquid: actually, i just searched for it, it doesnt exist
[11:58] <burwaco> zylche: that's even worse...
[11:58] <ganix> zention: maybe there is a simpler or better way of doing it.. I admit I am quite a newbie in linux and don't really know much
[11:58] <rupe> hi @ all!
[11:58] <zeeble> bimberi: cant remove. same error.
[11:59] <battlesquid> alecjw, ca you help me find a way to get that? it's so hard to find it...
[11:59] <zeeble> bimberi: tried removing bonjour, ksysguardd and ksysguard. but cant
[11:59] <stefg> burwaco: "server"-install is the minimal install... then you can e.g. apt-get xserver-xorg and all the X-stuff you want
[11:59] <battlesquid> alecjw, this is what i need http://www.penguin-soft.com/penguin/man/7/display-aa.html
[11:59] <bandaid> anyone want to try to help me fix my TTY problem?
[11:59] <bimberi> zeeble: how about: sudo dpkg -r bonjour ?
[11:59] <zeeble> bimberi: let me try that
[11:59] <JohnFlux> zeeble: hmm
[12:00] <zeeble> JohnFlux: yes?
[12:00] <alecjw> battlesquid: can you find any rpms, or preferably debs for it?
[12:00] <zeeble> bimberi: phew. thanks.

[12:00] <alecjw> ive googled it with no avail
