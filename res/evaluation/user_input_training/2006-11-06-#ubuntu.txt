[12:01] <gnomefreak> LHenr1: read what the bot said
[12:01] <gnomefreak> aldin: its not a bug quiet is there on purpose
[12:01] <Subhuman|L> !easysource
[12:01] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[12:02] <aldin> gnomefreak: why now when it was never before what does it mean
[12:02] <LHenr1> I read that, but those are the basic games. I was under the impression I could play the more popular games - Quake3 and such?
[12:02] <Jimbob> bruenig - no dice... still coudln't find package
[12:02] <grothesk> LHenr1: You can. But you have to install them by yourself.
[12:02] <Byan> hey, trying to run unrealIRCd, how do I fix this-
[12:02] <Byan> Failed to load SSL certificate server.cert.pem
[12:02] <grothesk> LHenr1: Usually they have a nice installer.
[12:03] <gnomefreak> aldin: it is there to supress the text scrolling in the usplash
[12:03] <bruenig> Jimbob, that doesn't make sense, unless somebody had messed with your sources.list previously, it should have worked
[12:03] <gnomefreak> aldin: edgy its there
[12:03] <flaco> hi.. someone have installed the ipw2200 access point driver in ubuntu?
[12:03] <LHenr1> OK - can you point me in a direction - I am new to Ubuntu and Linux.
[12:03] <gnomefreak> LHenr1: did you go to the links ubotu gave you?
[12:03] <Jimbob> well bruenig - in my attempts to get things to work, god knows what I've done
[12:04] <LHenr1> links - to what are you referring to? in the docs?
[12:04] <grothesk> LHenr1: Sorry, but googel is your friend: YOURFAVORITE GAME Linux
[12:04] <nolimitsoya> if i want a launcher that starts xterm and executes a command in xterm, how would that line look? all i get when i type 'xterm purity' is a xterm flashing by and closing immidiatly
[12:04] <Byan> anyone have any idea
[12:04] <aldin> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30325/ did u see what i mean, it is in line kernel, and it is again in the line after initrd?
[12:04] <bruenig> Jimbob, do sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, make sure nothing is commented out (that is make sure there are no things that look like this "deb http://..." with a # in front of it) if you find any of those delete the #
[12:04] <Jimbob> ok
[12:05] <thor> nolimitsoya: xterm -e purity
[12:05] <gnomefreak> aldin: its only in one line per kernel
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> thor, thank you :)
[12:05] <chrisknight> FALCO:  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_get_ipw2200_and_wpa_to_work
[12:05] <gnomefreak> for get the # one
[12:05] <LHenr1> Well, My bad.. I guess I can research it.. I was looking for a quicky. NP
[12:05] <LHenr1> Thanks.
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> thor, still the same problem...
[12:05] <aldin> 03. #kernel		/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda6 ro quiet splash 04. #initrd		/boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-10-generic 05. #quiet 06. #savedefault
[12:05] <nolimitsoya> thor, the xterm window wont stay open
[12:05] <gnomefreak> aldin: # = comment do what the kernel does ignore it
[12:06] <thor> nolimitsoya: wait one....
[12:06] <danl> I know where it is in kde, but how do you edit the individual settings for themes in gnome, i want to turn the bevels off on some of the controls
=== AtariPunk is now known as NsOmNiAc
[12:06] <Jimbob> bruenig - I don't think gedit works for me
[12:06] <grothesk> LHenr1: There is no quick way in installing those games. You'll have to run these installers.
[12:06] <david_> can some tell me the difference between the cd iso and the dvd iso?
[12:06] <Jimbob> which coudl be a problem
[12:06] <bruenig> Jimbob, wow, you have some serious problems
[12:06] <Jimbob> bruenig - thanks for the news flash
[12:06] <Jimbob> ;)
[12:06] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: what does gedit do that makes you think it doesnt work?
[12:06] <bruenig> Jimbob, ok well sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:07] <thor> nolimitsoya: try this command line: xterm -e sh -c 'purity'
[12:07] <nolimitsoya> thor, nope :(
[12:07] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: thesed command i saw him give you was for vim not gedit anyway
[12:07] <nolimitsoya> didnt work
[12:07] <wimpies> Hi all I am unable to record from my microphone.  I can hear the mic through my headset but am not able to record from it.
[12:07] <xhc> so i broke my esd.conf, but then i thought, surely dpkg-reconfigure is going to fix it, so i threw a little awk at it and came up with this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure $(dpkg -S /etc/esound/esd.conf | awk -F: '{print $1}')
[12:07] <bruenig> gnomefreak, yeah, but then I told him to check out the sources.list with gedit to see if all was right
[12:08] <xhc> but its not working :(
[12:08] <gnomefreak> ah
[12:08] <aldin> gnomefreak: lol, i know that, i did that, i dont use generic, but my piont is that i "get" it whay it stands in kernel line (splas & quiet), but why after initrd line i have got lonely "quiet" string, i've tested it several times and i have it al the time, can u give me ur menu.lst unmodified if possible...
[12:08] <Jimbob>  it says "cannot open display: (null)" and then it says "Run 'gedit --help' to see a full list of available command line options."
[12:08] <gnomefreak> does he have gnome installed?
[12:08] <Jimbob> I will try  the second command bruenig
[12:08] <thor> nolimitsoya: that should keep the terminal open....it works with 'sol'
[12:08] <xhc> any ideas why dpkg-reconfigure is not doing anything?
[12:08] <thor> did you include the single quotes?
[12:08] <Jimbob> sorry to be such a pain guys
[12:09] <bruenig> Jimbob, the second command should open the file up in the terminal
[12:09] <gnomefreak> xhc: what is the full command you are using?
[12:09] <jrib> Jimbob: when you run 'gedit' are you your normal user?
[12:09] <nolimitsoya> thor, doesnt here. not with 'sol' either
[12:09] <inglor> I have a problem
[12:09] <inglor> I need to download the package csm
[12:09] <flaco> chrisknight: thks... but... I want to load the access point driver (share internet over my wireless card)
[12:09] <inglor> It tells me it is referred to by another package but it can't find it
[12:09] <inglor> :/
[12:09] <xhc> gnomefreak: sudo dpkg-reconfigure $(dpkg -S /etc/esound/esd.conf | awk -F: '{print $1}') , i can do it manually too, but dpkg-reconfigure just isnt working
[12:09] <thor> nolimitsoya: are you typing it exactly as I entered it?
[12:09] <inglor> anyone has any ideas how I could fix it?
[12:09] <thor> nolimitsoya: xterm -e sh -c 'sol'
[12:09] <nolimitsoya> thor, yes
[12:09] <jrib> inglor: what is csm?
[12:10] <user-land> Hello. During shutdown, if an app won't quit, the system will ask what to do, in Ubuntu ?
[12:10] <Jimbob> bruenig it did open the file
[12:10] <inglor> it has to do with compiz, the xgl channel is deserted
[12:10] <bruenig> Jimbob, were there any issues with deb lines being commented out
[12:10] <inglor> it's the compiz manager, it is a dep for compiz-plugins, which is a dep for compiz
[12:10] <Jimbob> jrib I ran it after running sudo -i so no, I was not the normal user
[12:10] <thor> nolimitsoya: working on it, be right back
[12:10] <jrib> Jimbob: does it do that as your normal user?
[12:10] <nolimitsoya> thor, think i got it. needs -hold command :)
[12:10] <nolimitsoya> mom
[12:11] <aldin> anyone knows why is there line 3. stands for http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30326/
[12:11] <xhc> gnomefreak: that esd.conf file belongs to esound-common, so dpkg-reconfigure esd-common should fix it no?
[12:11] <Jimbob> bruenig - nothing has the ##
[12:11] <math_> is there some way to set a font for the xterm?
[12:11] <nolimitsoya> thor, it worked :D thank you for your time :)
[12:11] <gnomefreak> xhc: dont know never use dpkg to fix sound issues
[12:11] <inglor> anyone?
[12:11] <jrib> inglor: are you using unofficial repos for compiz?  why?
[12:11] <thor> nolimitsoya: interesting, I have added it to my fluxbox menu and it works for me <smile>
[12:12] <bruenig> Jimbob, there isn't any commenting out of the sentences?
[12:12] <xhc> gnomefreak: ok, thanks anyways
[12:12] <jrib> math_: yes, use ~/.Xdefaults.  See 'man xterm'
[12:12] <inglor> jrib, I'm usinb compiz.ubuntu.com
[12:12] <eobanb> does anyone know the best option for running NX on 6.10
[12:12] <chrisknight> anyone have lockup issues when booting edgy CD on a dell e1705?
[12:12] <inglor> *ubuntu.compiz.net
[12:12] <math_> thnx jrib
[12:12] <Jimbob> jrib - it did work when I logged out of sudo -i
[12:12] <math_> lets see
[12:12] <eobanb> freeNX, etc
[12:12] <nolimitsoya> thor, well, for me, in xfce, the windows would destroy itself. i missed the -hold last check through man, but saw it not. that solved it :)
[12:12] <nolimitsoya> *now
[12:12] <gnomefreak> aldin: delete it if you dont want it there. if you delete it and something doesnt work you know to add it back. there is 35 different reasons it can be there. dont know how your grub menu was made
[12:12] <inglor> can you do me a favor and send me the deb for compiz? anyone
[12:12] <jrib> math_: also if you google for ~/.Xdefaults, it's probably easier to get an idea for what you have to do
[12:12] <Rawplayer> hey, when i want to create a raid during the install on sparc64 i cant choose "raid volume" for the first partition, but i can for the second and so forth
[12:13] <jrib> inglor: pastebin your sources.list please
[12:13] <inglor> ok, one sec
[12:13] <dope> is there anyway to get my side mouse buttons to work?
[12:13] <Arron> anyone here get the wireless working on a compaq r4000 laptop?
[12:13] <Rawplayer> how come?
[12:13] <math_> well, I dont have the directory Xdefaults :/
[12:13] <Jimbob> bruenig - all the sentences are commented out but the things that start with deb are not
[12:13] <jrib> Jimbob: when you do 'sudo -i', it resets your environment variables.  So you don't have $DISPLAY set
[12:13] <jrib> math_: you have to create it.  It's a text file
[12:13] <math_> k
[12:13] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: are the cdrom repos commented out?
[12:13] <inglor> anyone know a good pastebin site? pastebin.com isn't working
[12:14] <LjL> !paste
[12:14] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:14] <aldin> gnomefreak: it was made out of the box fresh/clean install, line 3. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30326/ btw. i am 100% pozitiv about the quiet in kernel line but this one is suspicious, btw2 i've deleted it and didn feel any changes
[12:14] <Jimbob> jrib thanks for the tip I dodn't realize that changed so much
[12:14] <jrib> math_: if you prefer, you can also use command line arguments to set the font.  Like 'xterm -fs 10' or something
[12:14] <gnomefreak> aldin: did you reboot yet after deleteing it?
[12:14] <inglor> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30328/
[12:14] <inglor> there, my sources.list
[12:14] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - I see nothing about cdrom repos
[12:14] <jrib> Jimbob: it should work if you do 'gksudo gedit' as your user
[12:15] <aldin> gnomefreak: yes
[12:15] <aldin> gnomefreak: all works ok
[12:15] <aldin> gnomefreak: just curious
[12:15] <gnomefreak> aldin: than leave it deleted the only thing that does is set the usplash text to quiet
[12:15] <inglor> any idea?
[12:15] <xhc> how does one revert a config file to the package maintainers version?
[12:16] <gnomefreak> aldin: dont know why the installer thought it should be there
[12:16] <gnomefreak> really need to come up with a command to untar all my tars at once :(
[12:16] <jrib> inglor: it's an issue with http://ubuntu.compiz.net and/or http://xgl.compiz.info/
[12:16] <aldin> gnomefreak: in edgy i dont have text even with or without this, btw i had text in dapper and if i delete quiet splash from kernel line i have it without usplash
[12:17] <inglor> jrib, I know that...
[12:17] <math_> jrib it doesnt work
[12:17] <inglor> I added deb http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz dapper main
[12:17] <inglor> didn't help
[12:17] <jrib> math_: what did you try?
[12:17] <sess> I FINALLY got ati to build the FGLRX driver for edgy, and installed it, and am using it now.  but I need help!  I did a glxinfo and I still get mesa indirect and no direct rendering!  how the heck to do I enable 3D hardware accelleration with my Radion Xpress 200m?
[12:17] <math_> well I maked the file .Xdefaults
[12:17] <gnomefreak> aldin: if you get rid of the first quiet than save run sudo update-initramfs -u you will have it again
[12:17] <Jimbob> so... should I just give up on ubuntu?  Is there a better version I should use for beginners?
[12:17] <jrib> math_: xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults, then open xterm
[12:17] <math_> I added these two lines: xterm.background: black
[12:17] <math_> er ok
[12:17] <aldin> gnomefreak: on edgy i have only nice usplash "ubuntu logo+title"
[12:18] <Suspect> Can someone help me with installing the linux ATI driver please? I am getting an error and am not sure how to fix it ... my graphics were fine until I upgraded to edgy and then my FPS dropped in a lot of stuff..
[12:18] <justintime32> hey, does anyone know what license the included desktop backgrounds are released under?
[12:18] <jrib> math_: that's the wrong format I believe:  it should be  xterm*background: black
[12:18] <aldin> gnomefreak: *when booting
[12:18] <gnomefreak> aldin: yes i know but if you take the word quiet out and run that command i gave you you will again see text
[12:18] <math_> oh
[12:18] <aldin> gnomefreak: *normal thing
[12:18] <inglor> any idea jrib
[12:19] <math_> jrib thnx!
[12:19] <math_> it worked
[12:19] <math_> now I want to use a diff. font
[12:19] <aldin> gnomefreak: on edgy i have "ubunut logo + text, under it progres bar, and thats all, how is it at ur machine
[12:19] <jrib> math_: http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanb/configs/dot-Xdefaults for inspiration
[12:20] <Jimbob> bruenig do you think it would help me to reboot and try again or is that unnecessary?
[12:20] <stilgar> hey there
[12:20] <hai2u> DCC SEND "GnaaSysCrashDeploy" 0 0 0
[12:20] <bruenig> Jimbob, the reboot won't do anything
[12:20] <jrib> inglor: no, sorry.  #ubuntu-xgl is your best bet
[12:20] <math_> thnx jrib :)
[12:20] <sess> gnomefreak:  I managed to somewhat fix most of the issues I've been having, but I need help getting my 3D accel back.  I finally got ati-installer to build the edgy fglrx module.  I set it to my driver and startx.  but glxinfo returns indirect rendering still.  what is wrong here
[12:21] <Jimbob> Well that is a vast improvemet over microsoft right there then
[12:21] <stilgar> what's the best way to install edgy onto evms partitions?
[12:21] <stilgar> hmmm... netsplit
[12:21] <selinuxium> hi all. I have just upgraded to edgy, my terminal window will not allow black on white or black on light yellow. They display as black on dark grey. Any ideas anyone?
[12:22] <stilgar> ok maybe I should repeat that
[12:22] <stilgar> what's the best way to install edgy onto evms partitions?
[12:22] <gnomefreak> stilgar: no
[12:22] <gnomefreak> it was an exploit
[12:22] <rasgueo> exit
[12:22] <aldin> gnomefreak: on edgy i have "ubunut logo + text, under it progres bar, and thats all, how is it at ur machine
[12:22] <stilgar> oh ok
[12:23] <bruenig> Jimbob, are you using edgy or dapper?
[12:23] <Jimbob> bruenig - dapper
[12:23] <gnomefreak> aldin: i leave quiet wher eit is i dont like the text
[12:23] <jeb> hey
[12:23] <stilgar> so anyone know what the deal is with evms on edgy?
[12:24] <jeb> I have a quick question, i'm getting an error up "Your kernel sources cannot be found.  Kernel headers found...  They does not match your running kernel." when i run a configure.sh script.  any ideas anyone?
[12:24] <Jimbob> bruenig/gnomefreak - is there any way I can download the files I need from a website somewhere and put them into the right directory?
[12:24] <Jimbob> to use synaptic that is
[12:24] <jeb> and i don't have a special install or anything
[12:25] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: cd to the directory than use wget to download them
[12:25] <PPAAUULL> I am trying to install the ATI driver for my graphics card but I get this error: "./ati-installer.sh: 163: Syntax error: Bad substitution"
[12:25] <Suspect> Me too!
[12:25] <PPAAUULL> anyone know what is going on and haw to fix it?
[12:25] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - cd to which directory?
[12:25] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: where do you want to download the files to?
[12:25] <jrib> !ati > PPAAUULL
[12:25] <Jimbob> gnomefreak I don't care... how about /usr/java
[12:26] <Suspect> hmm.
[12:26] <Suspect> !ati
[12:26] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:26] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: ok you need to explain what you are trying to do
[12:26] <Jimbob> gnomefreak I was wondering if I coudl make it show up in synaptic
[12:26] <Jimbob> since it's not there now
[12:26] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - sorry I got off topic for a minute.  I want it to show in synaptic so I can install it from there
[12:26] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: apt-cache policy sun-java5-plugin
[12:26] <gnomefreak> what does that say
[12:27] <gu014> hello, when i try and run wine programs from my bottom launcher panel they do not load...if i run the exact same command from console they load without issue,,,would anyone be able to help me out?>
[12:27] <Exposure`> in which package are manpages for standard functions like memcpy, malloc etc? They're not in glibc-doc
[12:27] <jeb> I have a quick question, i'm getting an error up "Your kernel sources cannot be found.  Kernel headers found...  They does not match your running kernel." when i run a configure.sh script.  I'm not running a special install or anything either... any ideas anyone?
[12:27] <hyphenated> Exposure: manpages-dev
[12:27] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: you have to enable multiverse repo. please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:27] <Exposure`> jeb, there should be a links /usr/src/linux pointing to kernel sources of current running kernel
[12:27] <Exposure`> -s
[12:28] <dotsony> predius_: sory, what did i ask you ?
[12:28] <dotsony> 09:52 < predius_> dotsony: add multiverse and universe to your repositories

[12:28] <Arron> anyone here get the wireless working on a compaq r4000 laptop? i cant get ndiswrapper to work at all
[12:28] <dotsony> oh shit
[12:29] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - what do you mean by pastebin?
[12:29] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: you dont have multiverse repo enabled
[12:29] <gnomefreak> !pastebin | Jimbob
[12:29] <ubotu> Jimbob: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:29] <jeb> Exposure, /usr/src/ is empty...?
[12:30] <Exposure`> jeb, then you need to install a kernel, there's prolly a nice ubuntu way to do that
[12:30] <Flannel> !kernel | jeb
[12:30] <ubotu> jeb: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[12:30] <jeb> uhm, wouldn't i already have a kernel installed?
[12:30] <madman91> hello all.. i have an alternate 6.10 amd 64 disc... i need this disc for text isntall... my graphic card is too new i guess and there are no drivers.... but whatever ... i press the install in text button ... and it decompresses linux and boots kernel .. then it just stops... hangs
[12:30] <Exposure`> jeb, kernel yes, kernel sources no
[12:30] <gnomefreak> Exposure`: the src package for kernel is not often needed
[12:30] <jeb> ahh
[12:30] <Flannel> jeb: you have a kernel, not the source.  See the link ubotu gave you (the last one)
[12:31] <jeb> ... groan.
[12:31] <stilgar> ok ubuntu's installer is offically retarded
[12:31] <jeb> i don't need to compile it though?
[12:31] <fredl> ugh anybody know an URL on how to recompile the fglrx kernel modules? the one site I know has the instructions seems to be down.
[12:31] <Exposure`> nope
[12:31] <Exposure`> fredl, try downloading them form nvidia directly, it comes with a nifty installer script
[12:32] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - i pated it
[12:32] <Jimbob> pasted
[12:32] <his_dudnes> how unsafe is dist-upgrade to edgy?
[12:32] <fredl> fglrx from nvidia?
[12:32] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: can i have link please
[12:32] <fredl> FGLRX is from ATI
[12:32] <Jimbob> gnomefreak http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30333/
[12:32] <fredl> :)
[12:32] <jeb> Exposure, Flannel, is it likely that i actually need it - it's for Rutilt - the RaLink wireless card thingy
[12:32] <gnomefreak> his_dudnes: its not unsafe in thoery depends on what you have installed and what you dont have installed either way gksudo "update-manager -c" should work
[12:33] <aldin> ingar: http://www.beryl-project.org/
[12:33] <ifireball> !help module-helper
[12:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about help module-helper - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:33] <Flannel> Jimbob: you added multiverse to dapper-backports (lines 30, 31) you need to add it to dapper (lines 16, 17)
[12:33] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: you dont have multiverse enabled
[12:33] <noelferreira> hi people anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[12:34] <ifireball> fredl: module-helper can help you with that, go ask the dpkg bot in #debian sinc the bot here doesn't seem to know about it...
[12:34] <Discipulus> can Ubuntu use webcams?
[12:34] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: look at the lines that look like 17 and 18. add multiverse to the end of that after a space
[12:34] <Jimbob> Flannel - I have done NOTHING to this document.
[12:34] <Jimbob> ok gnomefreak
[12:34] <noelferreira> maybe with amsn Discipulus
[12:34] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: should look like deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe multiverse
[12:34] <gnomefreak> when your done
[12:34] <JairunCaloth> can you install build-essential from the Edgy CD rom?
[12:34] <Flannel> Jimbob: that's fine.  You need to add the word "multiverse" to the end of those lines, with a space.
[12:34] <fredl> ifireball, google's cache rocks, I found it :)
[12:35] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: any line that ends in universe you want to do that to
[12:35] <his_dudnes> gnomefreak :thanks ,if i understand well the more weird stuff i installed the more possible it is something will be broken?
[12:35] <gnomefreak> JairunCaloth: yes
[12:35] <steveire> How do you send a message to a nickserv account? Anyone know?
[12:35] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working with edgy?
[12:35] <fredl> ifireball, and you're right, you do it with module-helper :)
[12:35] <ifireball> fredl: ok...
[12:35] <hou5ton> hey ... can someone tell me if this is a crazy idea ????  I have worked and worked and never been able to get wireless working on Dapper ..... How about if I just wipe it all off and install Edgy???
[12:35] <gnomefreak> his_dudnes: update-manager fixes most issues that can arise with upgrading
[12:35] <madman91> i have a 6.10 alternate amd 64 isntall disc.. i have to do the text install.. dont ask why ... but then i hit the install in text  button.. and it only decompresses linux, and boots the kernel... or atleast it only displays those messages.... then it hangs... i waited for atleast 10 min.. and nothing ... what can i do ?
[12:35] <Flannel> JairunCaloth: Alternate CD yes
[12:35] <sanmarcos> packages from universe are from debian?
[12:35] <timthelion> is there an irc channel for beagle?
[12:35] <Flannel> sanmarcos: no
[12:35] <JairunCaloth> flannel it's not on the livecd version?
[12:35] <sanmarcos> timthelion: irc.gnome.org/#beagle
[12:36] <his_dudnes> gnomefreak : thanks again
[12:36] <ifireball> hou5ton: it may work and it may not...
[12:36] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: dont forget the ones near the bottom ;)
[12:36] <sanmarcos> Flannel: but some of them are right?
[12:36] <Akuma_> non-technical question: i have 5 official ubuntu cds; how can i tell which is which? x86, powerpc, amd64 .. ?
[12:36] <Flannel> JairunCaloth: the liveCD version isn't a repository
[12:36] <Jimbob> thanks gnome - I did - I'll go back and fix.
[12:36] <hou5ton> ifireball:  hmnmm ... I was looking for something a little more difinitive.  :-)
[12:36] <Flannel> sanmarcos: some of the packages are identical/close to identical, sure.
[12:36] <JairunCaloth> flannel: ok thanks
[12:36] <hou5ton> ifireball:  don't you have your linux crystal ball goin' tonight
[12:36] <sanmarcos> Flannel: right, because I need a package from SID, (trac) specifically, I was just wondering
[12:37] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - done.
[12:37] <ey> is there linux putty
[12:37] <ey> !putty
[12:37] <ubotu> ssh is the Secure SHell protocol (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto). Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows, which can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[12:37] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: save and close it
[12:37] <nolimitsoya> Akuma_, are you sure they are any different? if i was the one printing the labels, id label all exept x86 with their architecture...
[12:37] <Jimbob> done
[12:37] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: i hope you opened it as sudoer
[12:37] <pianoboy3333> Does firefox use gtk? Or does it have a wrapper like OOo? And what does the wrapper actually do?
[12:37] <selinuxium> I have updated to edgy and now totem is trying to play files in firefox instead or mplayer. I cannot find the libtotem file in the firefox plugins. What do I do?
[12:37] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugin
[12:37] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - yeah I noticed it was read only when I didn't use sudo
[12:37] <madman91> does anyone have a solution to my problem?
[12:37] <selinuxium> hi gnomefreak
[12:38] <gnomefreak> selinuxium: hi
[12:38] <Jimbob> ok gnomefreak here goes nuthin!
[12:38] <gnomefreak> pianoboy3333: gtk
[12:38] <ifireball> hou5ton: the cystal ball was running ok, but I just upgraded to edgy so now its broken because its from universal... :P
[12:38] <pianoboy3333> gnomefreak: ah... but before 2.0 it didn't
[12:38] <jeb> do i need to build the kernel?
[12:38] <gnomefreak> pianoboy3333: dont know
[12:38] <ey> Does putty work on linux?
[12:38] <ey> gnomefreak
[12:39] <Akuma_> nolimitsoya: well .. they were _supposed_ to be different. how can i tell anyway? is there a sort of README somewhere that will tell me that?
[12:39] <ifireball> pianoboy3333: afaik its been gtk on linux since day 1
[12:39] <jeb> or am i okay to just download the kernel
[12:39] <pianoboy3333> oh....
[12:39] <Flannel> sanmarcos: debian binary packages don't necessarily work on ubuntu, you could try it.  However, source ppackages do.
[12:39] <Flannel> ey: just use ssh... no need for putty.
[12:39] <nolimitsoya> Akuma_, if you chuck one in a cd drive you might find one :) then, bring on the marker pen! :D
[12:39] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - I am MILES ahead of where I was before
[12:39] <sanmarcos> Flannel: trac is a python package, so I am hoping it will work, if not Ill just source and recompile
[12:39] <Jimbob> It's unpackign
[12:39] <Jimbob> unpacking
[12:39] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: good
[12:39] <pianoboy3333> ifireball: gnomefreak: I was just wondering, since there used to be some firefox-gtk package
[12:40] <ifireball> ey: there is a putty version for linux, however its ususally not needed since you already have "ssh" built-in
[12:40] <Flannel> sanmarcos: most of them should, as long as it's not a library, etc.
[12:40] <Akuma_> nolimitsoya: i did, but there is no readme file or anything else that indicates the architechture that i can see... thats why im asking
[12:40] <sanmarcos> Flannel: thanks
[12:40] <nolimitsoya> Akuma_, the cd label tell you nothing either?
[12:41] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - 6 to 10 minutes to go... looking good
[12:41] <ifireball> pianoboy3333: donno anything about that, I can't find it on synaptic here... (got Edgy)
[12:41] <Waerner> Hey, can I run two commands in bash (in a script file) and make them appear on the same line?
[12:41] <pianoboy3333> ifireball: no, but in dapper and breezy it was there
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> Akuma_, my alternate install cd says i386 in the (software) cd label... yours should too :)
[12:42] <Akuma_> nolimitsoya: aprat from ".. for your pc" nothing else. that doesnt rule out amd64 ... \
[12:42] <Waerner> Like, add a timestamp ( date +%H:%M:%S ) in the front of all "echoes"
[12:42] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: ok the plugin package i gave you installed -jre and -bin as the other 2 people suggested :) so you have it all at once. there is another command you will need before firefox uses the java package you installed
[12:42] <ifireball> pianoboy3333: it may be a compatebility dummy package or maybe linked statically or with an older gtk version
[12:42] <Flannel> nolimitsoya, Akuma_, they don't ship alternates anymore, but I agree.  The CDs should be labeled (they have been in the past)
[12:42] <Akuma_> nolimitsoya: no i386 on mine
[12:42] <pianoboy3333> oh
[12:43] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: let me know when you are done installing it and ill get you to finalize it :)
[12:43] <Flannel> Akuma_: are they different colors?
[12:43] <nolimitsoya> Akuma_, also, README.diskdefines contains the name of the release. fex my alternate: #define DISKNAME  Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft" - Release i386
[12:43] <fredl> hmm this fglrx is getting the nasties on me again
[12:43] <ifireball> is there an ubuntu packages database a-la-packages.debian.org ?
[12:43] <Waerner> Anyone who's familiar enough with bash to answer to my question? :)
[12:44] <Flannel> ifireball: packages.ubuntu.com
[12:44] <steveire> Isn't is possible to leave a message for someone the next time they log into freenode?
[12:44] <Akuma_> Flannel: nolimitsoya: they are all the same colour. it does say x86 pcs on the back. so its not powerpc atleast... but still could be x64...
[12:44] <Flannel> steveire: there's memoserv
[12:44] <gnomefreak> steveire: /msg memoserv help
[12:44] <gnomefreak> brb stepping outside for a moment
[12:44] <nolimitsoya> Akuma_, as i said, check the _software_label, and the README.diskdefines file on them...
[12:44] <Flannel> Akuma_: believe the 64 ones are called 'AMD64'
[12:44] <Akuma_> nolimitsoya: youre right, mine too... i386.... too bad
[12:45] <anders9034> hello
[12:45] <Akuma_> nolimitsoya: Flannel: thanks
[12:45] <Waerner> Am I being ignored? :P
[12:45] <iwkse> anybody have problems with edgy and user account creation, shutdown button who doesn't work, terminal who doesn't open..but just time to time
[12:46] <fredl> module ABI major version (0) doesn't match the server's version (1)
[12:46] <ifireball> Waerner: don't ask to ask, just ask
[12:46] <fredl> now what could that mean....
[12:46] <Waerner> ifireball: Already done that, twice...
[12:46] <steveire> Thanks, memoserv is what I wanted. Nickserv doesn't know anything about it.
[12:46] <iwkse> Waerner: can you repeat your question?
[12:46] <math_> how to make your own commands, for example: x [enter]  to exit
[12:46] <iwkse> math_: using alias
[12:46] <math_> how?
[12:46] <ifireball> Waerner: you mean the output on the same line?
[12:47] <SlyGuy> when i do a full reinstall to upgrade to i need to format?
[12:47] <iwkse> math_: man alias
[12:47] <Jimbob> gnonmefreak I'm ready when you are
[12:47] <Flannel> Waerner: you mean like &&?
[12:47] <Waerner> Of course.  Does anyone know if I can make to commands appear on the same line when creating a shell script?
[12:47] <SlyGuy> do
[12:47] <timthelion> sanmarcos: that chanel does not seem to have anyone in it :(
[12:47] <Waerner> ifireball: Exactly
[12:47] <sanmarcos> timthelion: too bad
[12:47] <Waerner> I want to have timestamps in the front of the outputs :)
[12:47] <iwkse> Waerner: look for .bash_profile
[12:47] <iwkse> or .bashrc
[12:47] <math_> iwkse: no manual entry for alias
[12:47] <gnomefreak> wastrel: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:47] <anders9034> i just installed ubuntu, and i love it, but i can't view the /home/anders/Examples/Experience ubuntu.ogg :( when i click it it starts movie player, and it complains that "Totem could not startup." and  "Could not open resource for writing."
[12:47] <ifireball> Waerner: too easy: printf "%s %s\n" $(cmd1) $(cmd2)
[12:48] <fredl> Consider that the ATI drivers (as of 8.25.18) do not work with >=xorg-server-1.1.0.
[12:48] <Waerner> iwkse: okay
[12:48] <fredl> hmm does that mean anything to anybody?
[12:48] <Waerner> ifireball: Oh, thanks :)  Is it that easy= :P
[12:48] <ifireball> Waerner: $() is a nicer bash form of ``
[12:48] <iwkse> Waerner: right_)
[12:48] <SpaceFrog> hey guys
[12:48] <fredl> is xorg-server > 1.1.0 on edgy?
[12:48] <SlyGuy> well I hope this goes smoothly
[12:48] <apokryphos> fredl: packages.ubuntu.com
[12:48] <math_> iwkse: dont have a manual for aliases
[12:48] <hanasaki> to upgrade... from dapper.. do i just replace dapper with "edgy" in sources.lst ??
[12:48] <apokryphos> fredl: or /msg ubotu packagename
[12:49] <timthelion> sanmarcos: any chance you could tell me the answer to my question: how do I set the path of my mail folder, (I want it to index ~/Mail/mail in stead of ~/.kde/share/apps/kmail/mail)?
[12:49] <apokryphos> hanasaki: no, please read the upgrade instructions in the channel topic
[12:49] <TuOki^> hello i have some problems i upgrated my kubuntu dapper to edgy and now i have lost sounds and also i don't manage to set up my tomcat5 server --> i can start server but it shutdowns and status command gives this information: "tomcat 5 servlet engine is not running, but pid file exists"
[12:49] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: just run gksudo "update-manager -c"\
[12:49] <Waerner> Thanks alot iwkse and ifireball  :)
[12:49] <gnomefreak> without the /
[12:49] <iwkse> math_: moment
[12:49] <wastrel> i didn't say anything yet :p
[12:49] <CarlFK> Waerner: join u-off... i got something too
[12:49] <fredl> apokryphos, hmm?
[12:49] <SpaceFrog> how do i upgrade my Dapper Drake to 6.10?
[12:49] <sanmarcos> timthelion: set $MAIL ?
[12:49] <hanasaki> gnomefreak: i have a bunch of systems that need upgradeing remotely via just ssh... cant use the udpate-manager gui
[12:49] <wastrel> !upgrade | spacefrog
[12:49] <Waerner> CarlFK: ?
[12:49] <ubotu> spacefrog: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[12:49] <gnomefreak> SpaceFrog: gksudo "update-manager -c"
[12:49] <iwkse> alias x = "what do you want"
[12:49] <hanasaki> i did read the instructins before asking
[12:49] <apokryphos> fredl: type /msg ubotu info xorg-server
[12:49] <math_> ooh
[12:50] <CarlFK> Waerner: /join #ubuntu-offtopic... i got something too
[12:50] <Waerner> CarlFK: Ah, ok...
[12:50] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: than make sure you have no unofficial packages including xgl/compiz/beryl and make sure the package ubuntu-desktop in installed
[12:50] <Jimbob> gnomefreak my install is complete.  how do I tie to firefox?
[12:50] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: than feel free to change dapper to edgy and update and upgrade
[12:50] <Suspect> Can someone help me fix the problem which is stopping a .deb file from installing?
[12:50] <fredl> apokryphos, then ubotu tells me xorg-server doesn't exist in any distro it knows.
[12:50] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[12:51] <hanasaki> gnomefreak: thanks!  what woudl be the issue if i had those packages xgl?
[12:51] <mcphail> fredl: xserver-xorg
[12:51] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: type the number next to the one that you just installed
[12:51] <fredl> apokryphos, but, why are you telling me that? does that answer my question?
[12:51] <apokryphos> yes
[12:51] <math_> bash: alias: x not found
[12:51] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: libgl1-mesa-glx would cause your upgrade to fail badly
[12:51] <TuOki^> ..and for sound problem i think that i see before kubuntu starts text that PCI cannot be allocated (or something) also i see in my grub old linux kernel (why?)
[12:51] <gnomefreak> math_: restart terminal after making an alias
[12:51] <c_lisp> when I go on youtube the flash and sound is out of sync
[12:51] <c_lisp> how can I fix that?
[12:52] <hanasaki> bummer.. so no xgl in any way in edgy?  i thought it was gonna be part of the base system now?
[12:52] <gnomefreak> c_lisp: start firefox from terminal like aoss firefox
[12:52] <sanmarcos> hanasaki: xgl is not stable
[12:52] <c_lisp> I have xgl on edgy
[12:52] <math_> no, when I type in term: alias x = "exit" it says: alias: x: =: not found
[12:52] <c_lisp> and beryl
[12:52] <Suspect> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30340/
[12:52] <Phaqui> How can I easily run commands (actually start programs) when I log in, automaticly?
[12:52] <fredl> apokryphos, I'm having a problem getting my fglrx driver to work on Edgy, why would I want ubotu telling me in which distros it knows xserver-xorg?
[12:52] <c_lisp> ty
[12:52] <lonran> if all p2p programs make the whole system crash, just when they are open, what can be the reason?
[12:52] <gnomefreak> math_: did you add it to ~/.bashrc and instead of the " use '
[12:52] <atarinox> does anyone know of a good DC++ client for linux?
[12:52] <iwkse> math_: isn't so hard to google http://webtools.live2support.com/linux/alias.php
[12:53] <math_> ok, I'll look there, thnx
[12:53] <timthelion> sanmarcos: how would I tell if that worked?
[12:53] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: did that work?
[12:53] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - it's done but now it says I do NOT have teh latest version
[12:53] <sanmarcos> timthelion: dont know, dont care for beagle
[12:53] <Jimbob> It doesn't show a missing plugin so I think it did work
[12:53] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[12:53] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: you need to restart firefox also
[12:53] <timthelion> sanmarcos: then what do you use?
[12:54] <ifireball> atarinox: there used to be something called dctc (or was is dcdc?) been years since I used it though
[12:54] <SpaceFrog> is it worth upgrading to 6.10?
[12:54] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: if you type about:plugins in the address bar in firefox it should show java at the bottom
[12:54] <CarlFK> what is the nfs mount option so I don't need to run portmap?
[12:54] <sanmarcos> timthelion: nothing, I dont care for such a software
[12:54] <timthelion> SpaceFrog: all it did for me is make hibernation stop working
[12:54] <Suspect> SpaceFrog: In my opinion no, seeing as my boot screen was broken, xmms was broken, my video drivers are broken now...
[12:54] <timthelion> SpaceFrog: I didn't even notice that startup was faster
[12:55] <hanasaki> how do i set my locale... a program is complaining... perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
[12:55] <hanasaki> perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
[12:55] <SpaceFrog> my only concern is possibly losing my configuration
[12:55] <c_lisp> gnomefreak
[12:55] <Jimbob> Gnomefreak I show version 1.5.0_06
[12:55] <c_lisp> still out of sync
[12:55] <gnomefreak> SpaceFrog: config wont change other than sysinit
[12:55] <Jimbob> (it is working tho best I can tell
[12:56] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: thats normal for dapper
[12:56] <SpaceFrog> thanks gnomefreak, thats reassuring
[12:56] <Jimbob> gnomefreak - you rock
[12:56] <gnomefreak> SpaceFrog: edgy uses upstart with some sysinit "plugins" for lack of better word
[12:56] <ifireball> SpaceFrog: you milage may very; some breakage in Edgy still...
[12:57] <Jimbob> gnomefreak thank you very much...  I think I'm done fiddling with this for the day
[12:57] <gnomefreak> Jimbob: yw
[12:57] <timthelion> Suspect: you use nvidia? I fixed that by running an application called envy, you can get it through apt. http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=293162 somewhere in that thread there are other solutions
[12:57] <sanmarcos> how can I remove a package that fails on install (some weird script it runs) and on remove ?
[12:57] <Waerner> ifireball: Can you please give me the raw containg these  $() again? It seems like Irssi lost it in this giant chat =)
[12:57] <ifireball> SpaceFrog: it may be safer to w8 a month or so, if there isn't any kilelr feature in edgy for you
[12:58] <gnomefreak> sanmarcos: what package?
[12:58] <sanmarcos> gnomefreak: doesnt matter
[12:58] <c_lisp> :(

[12:59] <who_care1> yes
[12:59] <who_care1> stupid gaim
[12:59] <fredl> hmm is there a way to boot edgy without the splash screen so I can see what's going on?
[01:00] <wastrel> fredl:  remove quiet and splash from kernel line in the menu.lst
[01:00] <gnomefreak> fredl: remove splash from kernel arg. line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[01:00] <gnomefreak> wastrel: quiet should bable to stay
[01:00] <gnomefreak> beable
[01:00] <fredl> can I do that at boot time?
=== _Er1K_ is now known as TwoBellyButtons
[01:00] <ifireball> fredl: uf you just want to do this one time, you can do it with "e" from the grub menu
[01:01] <gnomefreak> fredl: i suggest doing it before you reboot if you have never done it before
[01:01] <fredl> oh okay that's handy to know
[01:01] <inglor> !office
[01:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about office - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[01:01] <Waerner> ifireball: Sorry for a stupid question, but what does these things do? "%s %s\n"
[01:02] <ifireball> Waerner: man printf
[01:02] <fredl> I don't have to update grub after that, just reboot after I editted that file?
[01:02] <Waerner> ifireball:  man printf?
[01:02] <gnomefreak> wastrel: read the abs guide. and we dont support writing your own script sin here try in #ubuntu-offtopic or #bash
[01:02] <Waerner> ifireball: You don't need to explain if you don't want to, It works, that's the most important =)

[01:04] <ifireball> Waerner: the "printf" command does the magic here, read its manpage for details.
[01:04] <Waerner> ifireball: Will do. Once again, thanks alot :)
[01:05] <ZirJoker> at the start of some tools like the windows list and the tray manager
=== TwoBellyButtons is now known as __EriK
[01:05] <Flannel> atarinox: there's nothing you need to do to finalize it, you could check your fstab to see that they are, if you're worried about it
[01:05] <atarinox> just fstab in the terminal?
[01:06] <Flannel> atarinox: less /etc/fstab
[01:06] <Flannel> atarinox: /etc/fstab is just a textfile, so just view the file
[01:07] <Kannix_> Hi all
[01:07] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> hi i have edit 915resolution i want to save it. but it doesnt work. i am no root
[01:07] <atarinox> Flannel: ok, under Pass for my root folder it says defaults,error....any idea what thta means?
[01:07] <ZirJoker> who_care1 accept
[01:07] <YeTr2> .
[01:08] <gnomefreak> sisqonrwwwwwwww: i would think that is something you need to edit with sudo
[01:08] <Flannel> atarinox: man fstab will give you all the gorey details
[01:08] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> what i have to type
[01:08] <Kannix_> Has anybody got any expetience with TV card (Hauppauge PVR350) under Ubuntu?

[01:09] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> what i can typ too
[01:09] <Kannix_> errm, experience of course, not expetience.
[01:09] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> something like sudo mousepad
[01:10] <ZirJoker> does anybody knows how to hide this 3 dots? http://www.geocities.com/zir_joker/Pantallazo.png
[01:10] <Flannel> sisqonrwwwwwwww: exactly, sudo mousepad will start mousepad with the permissions you need
[01:10] <human39> Hello all.  I want to skip kernel updates when using apt, any pointers on how I can do this?
[01:10] <TuOki^> heheh i manage to get sounds working: what i did i check all alsamixer stuff through mute /unmute (press m)
[01:10] <Flannel> human39: remove the linux-image-[arch]  package
[01:11] <human39> Flannel, where would that be?  In the apt cache directory?
[01:11] <b0ss_> needing ubuntu help <
[01:11] <sivik> if i'm trying to get a script to run on ubuntu startup, how do i get it to do it and where does the file need to go?
[01:12] <sivik> b0ss_, whats your problem?
[01:12] <Flannel> human39: no, apt-get remove linux-image-[arch] 
[01:12] <b0ss_> how do you add shell code on linux x86 ubuntu
[01:12] <b0ss_> or execute
[01:12] <ZirJoker> does anybody knows how to hide this 3 dots? http://www.geocities.com/zir_joker/Pantallazo.png
[01:12] <sivik> b0ss_, i don't understand what you mean
[01:12] <Flannel> human39: you do all package management via apt (or one of it's frontends)
[01:12] <b0ss_> shell code

[01:13] <HOMER__> hi
[01:13] <human39> Flannel, yes.  This is actually a mythtv box -- So if I want to update the kernel -- I want to have full control over it
[01:13] <Flannel> ZirJoker: believe those have to do with collapsing the toolbars, in the configuration disable that
[01:13] <HOMER__> HOW -selinux disable ?
[01:13] <austin_> heya, is there anyone here who could help me with adesklets
[01:13] <austin_> ?
[01:13] <fredl> aaaaahahaha the ATI fglrx 8.28 drivers are already in edgy
[01:13] <pkh> my headless box has just stopped automounting my usb disk.  any ideas why that may have happened??
[01:14] <__mikem> Ubuntu uses SELinux
[01:14] <__mikem> ??
[01:14] <fredl> so here I am trying to recompile them manually like I did on Dapper and wondering why it won't work.
[01:14] <HOMER__> yes
[01:14] <como> need help.  can't install Edgy on intel dp965lt & Core2Duo, sata hdd & ide dvd.  what should I do?
[01:14] <fredl> oh well :)
[01:14] <pkh> sdb3 appears and is manually mountable, but doesn't automatically appear in /media/usbdisk like it used to...
[01:14] <Flannel> human39: right, remove the linux-image package, it depends on the most recent kernel package, for instance, linux-image-generic would be most common on edgy, linux-image-386 or whatnot on Dapper, etc  uninstalling that package will stop your automatic kernel updates
[01:14] <sivik> como, what is the problem
[01:14] <b0ss_> ill aska  question more easier how do i compile .c and .pl  (perl)  source codes
[01:14] <fredl> now comes the big challenge, seeing if my vmware install keeps on working
[01:14] <como> the installer freezes.  I tried all-generic-ide, it doesn't help
[01:15] <sivik> b0ss_, install the package called build-essential
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
[01:15] <Flannel> b0ss_: perl is an interpretted language, you don't compile it.  c is compiled with gcc, sudo apt-get install build-essential to install all you need
[01:15] <sleon> hi all
[01:15] <ZirJoker> how do i make x terminal transparent?
[01:15] <sleon> i have fucked up my dpkg database with foreall install, how can i unfoobar it??
[01:15] <b0ss_> perl is compiled but used in a command window on windows
[01:16] <como> sivik, I can't really tell what problem the installer hits, it displays the progress, then the progress hangs
[01:16] <variant> ZirJoker: xterm does not support transparency
[01:16] <gnomefreak> sleon: watch your language please
[01:16] <Flannel> b0ss_: no, perl is interpretted, you don't compile perl, on windows, or linux.
[01:16] <sanmarcos> Flannel: trac from sid works fine, you have to copy /usr/bin/pyversions from an edgy install though for it to work, which it did. I guess it comes with python 2.4.3 which isnt in dapper
[01:16] <sivik> como: not sure, have you tried installing without the gui, aka doing it text pased
[01:16] <human39> Flannel, wouldnt that remove the actual kernel files?
[01:17] <sivik> based*
[01:17] <variant> Flannel: thats not to say that you cant compile it :)
[01:17] <TuOki^> But still i have tomcat5 problem so if here is somebody who has set up tomcat5 to edgy i would like to hear some tips ( problem is that i my tomcat5 stops instantly after start)
[01:17] <b0ss_> but isnt eveyr language interpretted into binary
[01:17] <sleon> gnomefreak: apt-get sucks and you all suck when you say that it rules!
[01:17] <variant> b0ss_: eventually yes
[01:17] <preaction> b0ss_, it depends on when it happens
[01:17] <b0ss_> wich is compiled hwo can u run a command on perl if u dont compile it
[01:17] <b0ss_> o
=== Crankymonky is now known as CrankDinner
[01:17] <sivik> b0ss_, technically everything we do on a computer is read as binary
[01:17] <Flannel> human39: no, it's a meta package, it only depends on the kernels, removing it won't remove the kernels, only stop it from installing new kernels
[01:17] <b0ss_> yeah i wa sjust a little confused i been perl programmign for only cuple months
[01:18] <variant> b0ss_: i am in the same boat with java :)
[01:18] <atarinox> what does it mean when a guide tells me to install my kernel headers?
[01:18] <como> sivik, how do I do that?  I can't see the option of text-based install in the menu.  there is safe graphics mode...
[01:18] <Danny> hello
[01:18] <preaction> b0ss_, java calls it a "Just In Time" compiler (even if it's already "compiled")
[01:18] <Flannel> b0ss_: the perl program runs and reads the perl source, then executes those commands
[01:18] <justin_> Does anyone know of a program to make flash videos similar to Macromedia Flash, and Swish for Linux?
[01:18] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> i have type sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and edit somethin. how can i save it
[01:18] <b0ss_> does it reallyt
[01:18] <b0ss_> wow
[01:18] <preaction> atarinox, apt-get install linux-headers-`uname-r`
[01:18] <b0ss_> i never knew that
[01:18] <b0ss_> larry wall wrote this book and he didnt tell me that
[01:18] <gnomefreak> atarinox: open synaptic and search for kernel and install the kernel-headers for you arch
[01:18] <b0ss_> DAM HIM!
[01:18] <human39> Flannel, it is warning me that it will remove the kernel out of /boot/
[01:18] <variant> b0ss_: it's an interpreted language, not compiled
[01:19] <preaction> sisqonrwwwwwwww, Ctrl+W writes out, look at the ^ commands at the bottom
[01:19] <b0ss_> never knew that thanks
[01:19] <Flannel> human39: er, what command are you running?
[01:19] <variant> b0ss_: you _can_ compile it though
[01:19] <b0ss_> but how would i get an executer for perl
[01:19] <b0ss_> yeah how ud i do that
[01:19] <Danny> I need some help MY vol buttons  are ACPI and they control the wrong channel how do I change it so it controls the PCM channel

[01:22] <sethro> Hi bOss
[01:22] <Flannel> human39: you're removing the kernel, remove the meta package, like... linux-image-server
[01:22] <sethro> Preaction how would I install it
[01:22] <knix> isn't there some kind of base-dev package so I don't have to grab gcc/autotools/autoconf/make/everything by hand?

[01:29] <hanasaki> is there some package like fakeroot?
[01:29] <sethro> But the fan is still blowing out cold air...??
[01:29] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: fakeroot would be the package
[01:29] <gnomefreak> sethro: build-essential isnt gonna fix your fan for you
[01:29] <avagant> I try to install windows on the second hd but it tells me I don't have a winxp partition on that drive, even though I partitioned it.
[01:29] <hanasaki> gnomefreak: hmmm apt-cache search fakeroot returns nothing

[01:30] <atarinox> does xubuntu come with any compiling apps after install
[01:30] <preaction> avagant, the windows install disc tells you you do not have a windows partition on hdb?
[01:30] <avagant> yah
[01:30] <gnomefreak> sethro: not unless you plan on compiling something
[01:30] <preaction> atarinox, not likely, apt-get install build-essential

[01:31] <hanasaki> gnomefreak: hmm odd.. checking my sources.lst
[01:32] <gnomefreak> sethro: dont know i dont do laptops never liked them

[01:32] <Danny> ok but some one else may
[01:32] <jessica_> hey, can I get some help with nvidia?
[01:32] <avagant> hmm.
[01:32] <Danny> its not covered in any thing online

[01:33] <TGPO> avagant you open the case and swap where they are on the IDE cables to swap which is read first
[01:33] <gnomefreak> jessica_: using the beta drivers with the regular l-r-m?
[01:33] <sethro> I mean the fan is always running

[01:33] <jessica_> of edgy eft.

[01:34] <hanasaki> gnomefreak: shoudl this like give me a fakeroot? deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy-updates main restricted
[01:34] <avagant> well maybe i should do it the other way.
[01:34] <sethro> VARIANT- Could you help me out
[01:34] <avagant> have windows, and then put linux on hdb.
[01:34] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: no hold on ill get it
[01:34] <PPAAUULL> Ok So I installed XGL and Beryl but now when I type beryl-manager or beryl-xgl the system just freezes. How can I fix this and get it too work?
[01:34] <sethro> PLeASE Dont go to bed
[01:34] <sethro> Come ON!!
[01:34] <sethro> lol
[01:34] <jessica_> gnomefreak: 1.0.8776
[01:34] <sethro> PLEASE
[01:34] <TGPO> avagant sound to me like your going to have to fdisk and start all over
[01:35] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted that will
[01:35] <sethro> Anybody
[01:35] <sethro> Witha a fan problem
[01:35] <TGPO> avagant, install windoze and then linux, otherwise youl be fighting it for a week
[01:35] <avagant> well i'm running on edgy right now.
[01:35] <preaction> avagant, in my travails, windows hates not being on the first partition of the first disk (and now, with edgy, so does ubuntu)
[01:35] <gnomefreak> jessica_: ok now open synaptic and install the linux-restricted-modules package for the kernel you are running.
[01:35] <sethro> Avagant could you help me out
[01:35] <avagant> well do you think linux will install on hdb1?
[01:35] <jessica_> gnomefreak: did that
[01:36] <PPAAUULL> Ok So I installed XGL and Beryl but now when I type beryl-manager or beryl-xgl the system just freezes. How can I fix this and get it too work?
[01:36] <gnomefreak> jessica_: and you have nvidia in your xorg.conf?
[01:36] <TGPO> avagant is your machine strong enough to run windoze in emulation?
[01:36] <atarinox> ok, i'm trying sudo scons to compile this app, and keep getting this message: gtk+ >= 2.6 not found, even though i've run apt-get upgrade gtk+...
[01:36] <preaction> avagant, i had problems with xubuntu installer when trying to install to another hard drive, ymmv
[01:36] <wastrel> PPAAUULL:  try #ubuntu-xgl
[01:36] <avagant> maybe i should try and install linux on hdb first and then go back and install windows and then do the grub thing.
[01:36] <gnomefreak> PPAAUULL: ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:36] <PPAAUULL> ok
[01:36] <crimsun> atarinox: instlal libgtk2.0-dev
=== dv__ is now known as dv_
[01:36] <atarinox> k thanks
[01:36] <preaction> atarinox, you want the development headers, libgtk2.0-dev
[01:36] <nanotube> preaction: what I find out is: If user did not have experiance with PC's before and windows they do not complain and thay learn quicly how ever the other employees which have been using windows for many years that complain and are not wiling to learn just that easy that I point them to doc files:-)
[01:36] <gnomefreak> PPAAUULL: there is a line ot add to your xorg.conf bot cant remember off hand
[01:37] <avagant> crap i can't, nevermind. i haven't been able to get a stupid cd to work.
[01:37] <hanasaki> gnomefreak: hmm i have "main restricted" not just "main" so that will give me main and restricted and thus fakeroot.. right?
[01:37] <jessica_> gnomefreak: yes
[01:37] <gnomefreak> hanasaki: yes
[01:37] <avagant> hmm.
[01:37] <DigitalNinja> I want to list all the packages that are going to be upgraded. How do I do this?
[01:37] <avagant> maybe i should try burning another disk and see if it works, but i can't guarrentee it will.
[01:37] <gnomefreak> jessica_: can i have full error because it sounds like you have mixed packages
[01:37] <jessica_> hold
[01:37] <chrislee> question? should I install java package as .rpm or .tgz file?
[01:37] <jessica_> brb
[01:38] <avagant> crap i just want to do this and i thought you could in bios cause that's what i read.
[01:38] <wastrel> chrislee:  why don't you install java from the repos?
[01:38] <preaction> nanotube, i completely sympathize, i just installed edgy on a friend's computer yesterday. he'll be all over me for advice for the next few months... computer users get frightened when they dont know what to do, and fear makes people angry... at you
[01:38] <gnomefreak> jessica_: you get the API error when you used the nvidia installer and than tried to install nvidia-glx
[01:38] <avagant> i read in bios you just change boot order of hd's.
[01:38] <avagant> i guess i could be wrong.
[01:38] <chrislee> rpm vs tgz?
[01:38] <gnomefreak> tgz
[01:38] <wastrel> chrislee:  .deb
[01:39] <user-land> hello, in edgy, fstab, i see for each partition a long UUID. if i want to add a new partition, do i have to add a UUID too ?
[01:39] <steveire> chrislee: sudo aptitude install sun-java-bin
[01:39] <gnomefreak> chrislee: if you can avoid installing from rpm you will be much happoier in long run
[01:39] <chrislee> .deb isn't an option, unfortunately
[01:39] <TGPO> userland yes
[01:39] <gnomefreak> chrislee: for java it is in the repos
[01:39] <Flannel> chrislee: why not? Whats wrong with the one in the repos?
[01:39] <[erisco] > I installed apache2, I can start and stop the server, but I cannot reach localhost in a browser. I was able to when I had apache, but I installed apache2 and removed apache... restarted everything... no go. Anything I can do to give more details?
[01:39] <bimberi> DigitalNinja: with the -s switch, for example:  apt-get -s dist-upgrade
[01:39] <TGPO> userland you want to man blkid it lays it out nicely
[01:39] <nanotube> preaction: anger and frustration !! Nothing is working !!! that's what they say !!! :-)
[01:39] <jstarcher> Does the "nice" command work on ubuntu?
[01:39] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: Thanks
[01:39] <chrislee> we don't use SUN jres :)
[01:40] <atarinox> preaction: ok, now it's saying libglade >= 2.4 not found...is there another group of apps i need?
[01:40] <gnomefreak> chrislee: ubuntu uses sun-java5-packages
[01:40] <Flannel> chrislee: ubuntu also has blackdown java in repos
[01:40] <chrislee> i don't use those
[01:40] <wastrel> i'm using sun java
[01:40] <preaction> atarinox, you're trying to compile something, you need the -dev packages of every package that it says is "not found"
[01:40] <his_dudnes> jstarcher : why wouldnt it?
[01:40] <bimberi> jstarcher: ubuntu has it, i've not tried it though, i don't see why it wouldn't work
[01:40] <wastrel> from the repo
[01:40] <gnomefreak> chrislee: <hint> its the package your gonna get off the java site
[01:40] <gnomefreak> but use what you want
[01:41] <chrislee> i'm not allowed to
[01:41] <preaction> nanotube, just imagine if you installed OS X, even more radically different from windows
[01:41] <chrislee> anyway, so i got this rpm file or tgz file
[01:41] <jessica_> gnomefreak: I have the error now:
[01:41] <jstarcher> his_dudnes: the man on it says to check your shell docs to see if it's supported
[01:41] <chrislee> gonna go try the tgz, as someone suggested
[01:41] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> my gxine doesnt play mp3
[01:41] <jessica_> gnomefreak: the kernel module is version 1.0-8774 but the X is 1.0-8776
[01:41] <jstarcher> his_dudnes: I couldn't find anything about it on the forums :(
[01:41] <his_dudnes> jstarcher : it is i use it...
[01:41] <Flannel> [erisco] : you sure you restartd apache2 after removing apache?
[01:42] <preaction> chrislee, you're not allowed to use a precompiled package, why?
[01:42] <[erisco] > Flannel, positive
[01:42] <Vich> my adobe acrobat reader doesn't play mp3
[01:42] <preaction> !restricted-formats > sisqonrwwwwwwww
[01:42] <gnomefreak> jessica_: than something is wrong because thats not possible
[01:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about restricted-formats - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:42] <jessica_> gnomefreak: how can I fix it?
[01:42] <AndyJB> I updated from dapper to edgy and now emacs just shows squares instead of characters and I get warnings about "Cannot convert string ... to type FontStruct" and "unable to load any usable ISO8859 font". Any ideas anyone?
[01:42] <gnomefreak> jessica_: thats not a clean install
[01:42] <his_dudnes> you need sudo for higher priorities if i remember well
[01:42] <jessica_> gnomefreak: I just finished the install.
[01:42] <Flannel> [erisco] : and apache2 is running? (ps aux | grep apache2)
[01:42] <gnomefreak> jessica_: remove both packages and reinstall htem
[01:42] <jstarcher> his_dudnes: okay cool, thanks. Default niceness is 10 right? So what do you usually set stuff to? 11?
[01:42] <preaction> AndyJB, try installing the internationalization files
[01:42] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> what do u mean
[01:42] <his_dudnes> i think its 20
[01:42] <gnomefreak> !info nvidia-glx | jessica_
[01:42] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> it is a mp3 file

[01:42] <[erisco] > Flannel, yes
[01:42] <c_lisp> anybody use beryl?
[01:43] <Tiger_IT> Tiger_IT gogogo
[01:43] <Danny> I need some help MY vol buttons  are ACPI and they control the wrong channel how do I change it so it controls the PCM channel
[01:43] <steveire> c_lisp: Yep
[01:43] <gnomefreak> jessica_: you on dapper?
[01:43] <spanglesontoast> does anyone know much about mounting a networking within chroot
[01:43] <spanglesontoast> ?
[01:43] <jessica_> edgy eft
[01:43] <his_dudnes> jstarcher : it s 10 youre right
[01:43] <Pear> does anyone have any idea why desktop drag selections are not working on my XUbuntu install?
[01:43] <Flannel> c_lisp: #beryl people do, a good deal of people in #ubuntu-xgl might as well
[01:43] <nanotube> preaction: I have a problem with OS X :-)) I'm more keen to command line approach !!! But thats only me these days..
[01:43] <gnomefreak> jessica_: reinstall them
[01:43] <c_lisp> how do you stop all the appz coming to getting if your mouse touch a corner of the screen
[01:43] <meathead> can someone help me, I was partitioning in pmagic in dos and it froze partitioning my boot partition, now I need to fix the partition so it works again
[01:43] <AndyJB> preaction: internationalization for what? Which packages? This doesn't happen on my other edgy box by the way.
[01:43] <gnomefreak> jessica_: completely remove --purge them than install them
[01:43] <jstarcher> his_dudnes: so when you use it what do you set stuff to?
[01:44] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> how can i deinstall gxine?
[01:44] <preaction> AndyJB, lang-* gnome-lang-* if i'm not mistaken
[01:44] <TGPO> sisqonrwwwwwwww, apt-get remove gxine
[01:44] <gnomefreak> sisqonrwwwwwwww: sudo apt-get remove --purge gxine
[01:44] <meathead> anyone help me?
[01:44] <Flannel> [erisco] : and apache2 is set to listen on port 80? what's in your error log?
[01:44] <gnomefreak> brb
[01:44] <his_dudnes> well i put batch jobs on 20 so i can see my videos without trouble...
[01:45] <[erisco] > Flannel, nothing is in my error log, I checked. If I can find the configuration file I will check the listening port
[01:45] <meathead> hello
[01:45] <meathead> hello
[01:45] <meathead> is anyone there who can help
[01:45] <his_dudnes> i suspect better uses exist for nice :D
[01:45] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> do someone know now how to install a webcam?
[01:45] <Flannel> [erisco] : /var/apache2/sites-enabled/
[01:45] <jessica_> gnomefreak: Which packages do I need to install?
[01:45] <his_dudnes> meathead: many
[01:45] <Pear> help me please!!! does anyoneknow why desktop drag selections are not working on my XUbuntu install?
[01:45] <Flannel> [erisco] : er, /etc/ not/var sorry
[01:45] <meathead> his_dudnes: well I already asked my question
[01:46] <[erisco] > Flannel, 000-default
[01:46] <Flannel> Pear: Xubuntu or XUbuntu?
[01:46] <Flannel> [erisco] : no, inside that ;) its a text file, should be first line or so
[01:46] <AndyJB> preaction: Can't find packages by those names. Have found language-pack-gnome-en and it's already installed I believe.
[01:46] <Pear> flannel: XUbuntu
[01:46] <Pear> Ubuntu
[01:46] <meathead> I was partitioning my windows ntfs partition in pmagic in dos and it froze, now it doesn't boot
[01:46] <Pear> :(
[01:46] <nanotube> preaction: for example this: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/index.html there is nothing what I can give to our employyes to read..:-(
[01:46] <meathead> there is errors with the partition
[01:46] <frank23> I'm having a strange issue: In kubuntu dapper, I'm running firefox 1.5 and mythtranscode at the same time. mythtranscode uses up all my CPU. when mythtranscode runs at nice=19, firefox is responsive and working fine. when mythtranscode runs at nice=17 (the default), firefox is so slow it's not usable. All the other programs run fine. Any ideas?
[01:47] <meathead> what application can I use to fix the partition
[01:47] <his_dudnes> meathead : i didnt see , i am not shure many can, i dont think this is the apropriate chanel..
[01:47] <TGPO> meathead, 99% sure your hosed
=== CrankDinner is now known as Crankymonky
[01:47] <meathead> I'm not hosed
[01:47] <meathead> there is no hosing
[01:47] <Flannel> Pear: XUbuntu isn't supported here, I'm... not actually sure where it is.  They say to use the mailing lists, not sure if they have an IRC channel
[01:47] <meathead> I'm booted in ubuntu on cd
[01:47] <[erisco] > Flannel, nothing about a port, but it is accessible to localhost at the least
[01:47] <meathead> there is no application to fix a corrupted ntfs partition in linux?
[01:48] <TGPO> meathead, 99% sure that partition is hosed and everything on it is lost ... equals hosed
[01:48] <preaction> nanotube, yeah, that's what the internal help files look like. um... might just be best to give some training and tell them to understand that learning won't come overnight. how long did it take them to learn windows?
[01:48] <bimberi> well ntfs is a closed format.  How could a dev get the information needed to build one?
[01:48] <Pear> flannel: right, ok. but i thought xubuntu was just ubuntu with a different desktop?!
[01:48] <Flannel> Pear: Xubuntu is different than XUbuntu (the latter is ubuntu for the Xbox)
[01:49] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> how can i see the harddisc size?
[01:49] <Flannel> [erisco] : what about /etc/apache2/ports.conf?
[01:49] <meathead> I'm 99.9% sure there are about 101 applications that I could slap all on one boot disc and recover the partition with, most of which run on dos
[01:49] <Pear> flannel: oh, ok. i get you. well i ment Xubuntu
[01:49] <meathead> but you're telling me there isn't something equivalent to chkdsk in linux?
[01:49] <[erisco] > Flannel, want to hear the good news? Port 80 is listening. But that is also the bad news
[01:49] <nanotube> learn windows?  for non IT person it can easily take whole life :-) In here it is the same
[01:49] <his_dudnes> meathead , i would try googling instead of irc for such a problem...
[01:50] <crimsun> meathead: fsck for the various fs.
[01:50] <bimberi> yes, but not for ntfs (afaik)
[01:50] <[erisco] > Flannel, drat I wonder what is going on
[01:50] <GNeu> gnomefreak, I have installed linux-restricted-modules but I still can't get ndiswrapper to load
[01:50] <Pear> flannel: do you know...should drag selections work on my destop too? its only working in filemanagers for some reason...
[01:50] <TGPO> meathead there is, but your talking NTFS, microsofts closed proprietary file structure
[01:50] <gnomefreak> GNeu: on edgy?
[01:50] <GNeu> gnomefreak, yup
[01:50] <gnomefreak> thought so
[01:50] <Flannel> Pear: I have no idea, sorry.  You might try asking in #xubuntu
[01:51] <GNeu> gnomefreak, others having issues too?
[01:51] <shadowhywind> here is a off the wall question, A friend of mine wants to make a Bumpersticker for his car, with the ubuntu logo, any trademarks or anything that he should be afraid of?
[01:51] <gnomefreak> GNeu: iirc there is a bug on that. i dont think it was fixed yet due to short release time
[01:51] <Flannel> [erisco] : so, you can access it from localhost? just not by IP? or what?
[01:51] <Pear> flannel, ok thnx
[01:51] <GNeu> gnomefreak, thanks
[01:51] <gnomefreak> GNeu: yes alot of people have had issues with it
[01:51] <nanotube> preaction: I'm big fan of windows2linux switch but with this documentation we never manage to switch ordinary pc users to linux
[01:52] <[erisco] > Flannel, I cannot access it through localhost. I was able to before I removed apache and put on apache2. I didn't have apache for long (accidently installed it) but PHP5 was not working either (although I went through the dapper and followed the guide for it)
[01:52] <Flannel> [erisco] : sorry, I have no idea what could be the problem.  Since it's new, I'd try purging it all, inlcuding apache stuff (if you havent already) and trying again
[01:53] <Lone> what are the reccommended system requirements for ubuntu/kubuntu 6.06.1?
[01:53] <[erisco] > Flannel, I have heard of purging before. What is it?
[01:53] <user-land> if anyone is interested, the answer to my question about /etc fstab is that you can just delete the UUID entries there, also removing the leading '# '.
[01:53] <user-land> what is the easiest way to edit grub in ubuntu ?
[01:53] <CientificoLoco> how do I share voice with aMSN?
[01:53] <nanotube> preaction: ok dude...I need to go..thanks for a help...have a great day !!
[01:54] <Flannel> ericz: apt-get remove --purge [package]  removes the configurations as well as just the programs, it's equivalent to "complete removal" in synaptic
[01:54] <gnomefreak> user-land: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[01:54] <wastrel> open /boot/grub/menu.lst in a text editor
[01:54] <Danny> I need some help MY vol buttons  are ACPI and they control the wrong channel how do I change it so it controls the PCM channel
[01:54] <ericz> flannel, heh.. uh, thanks i'll remember that
[01:54] <user-land> thank you, gnomefreak. just coming back from a day of installing Suse ... wasn't nice ...
[01:54] <gnomefreak> user-land: <hint> please know what your doing before trying it as it can leave your system bootless
[01:54] <Flannel> ericz: sorry, [erisco] , that was meant for you
[01:55] <[erisco] > Flannel, I got it
[01:55] <chrislee> how do I set my java path?  ie, if my current java is in /usr/bin and I want the "java" command to respond to the java in /usr/local/bin
[01:55] <Suspect> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30340/ <-- anyone know how I can fix this problem? :/
=== pc22 is now known as pc22zzz
[01:55] <[erisco] > Flannel, I'd rather not have to redownload MySQL server... lets try without purging that
[01:56] <gnomefreak> chrislee: you can change what java the system uses by running sudo update-alternatives --config java
[01:56] <CientificoLoco> how do I share voice with aMSN?
[01:56] <wastrel> chrislee:  edit your CLASSPATH env var
[01:56] <chrislee> how do I edit my classpath env var?
[01:56] <chrislee> export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/bin
[01:56] <chrislee> ?
[01:57] <[erisco] > Flannel, something is wrong... I purged apache2 AND php5. I have not reinstalled PHP5, yet it is still showing up in the running processes
[01:57] <Joe_CoT> Suspect: dpkg -i --force-overwrite fglrx-4-3-0_8.30.3-1_i386.deb
[01:57] <wastrel> chrislee:  that's actually for classes, not for the runtime   ...
[01:57] <[erisco] > Flannel, also after installing apache2 again, I still cannot see localhost
[01:57] <Suspect> Thanks a lot Joe_CoT
[01:57] <gnomefreak> Joe_CoT: first thats dangerous sencond if you are gonna have him run it please give him the full command
[01:58] <Joe_CoT> Suspect: in this case, since it's just an icon, it shouldn't hurt anything. But in general overriding main with alien debs can put your install in an unhealthy state
[01:58] <gnomefreak> Joe_CoT: there should be /var/bleh infront of all that
[01:58] <abnerian_> How can I tell if I have Madwifi installed?
[01:58] <Suspect> Alright
=== co_look_friends is now known as cewe_alim] 
[01:58] <[erisco] > Flannel, I can install apache and it works just fine
[01:58] <vos> Hi, where are the openssl libs installed in ubuntu?
[01:58] <gnomefreak> abnerian_: apt-cache policy madwifi     if its a package
[01:58] <[erisco] > Flannel, what is going on with apache2? I think it is missing files
[01:59] <gnomefreak> ar hai2u
[01:59] <vos> anyone /usr/share/doc/libxmlsec1-openssl/copyright
[01:59] <vos> /usr/share/doc/openssl
[01:59] <vos> /usr/share/doc/openssl/doc
[01:59] <vos> /usr/share/doc/openssl/doc/HOWTO
[01:59] <vos> oops
[01:59] <Joe_CoT> gnomefreak: i was getting to the "dangerous" part
[01:59] <crimsun> vos: ssl libs are in /usr/lib/
[01:59] <abnerian_> slocate finds it though
[01:59] <crimsun> vos: dpkg -L libssl0.9.8
[01:59] <Flannel> [erisco] : if it's missing files, then yes, purging and reinstalling should fix it
[01:59] <abnerian_> So...is madwifi installed and in USE?
[01:59] <vos> crimsun: thx.
[02:00] <user-land> gnomefreak, i don't know what i'm doing :-) i see menu.lst is still the one from Ubuntu. however i have now a boot record that lists Suse as the first option, and i would like to place Ubuntu (which is now second) there first. do i need to do this in lilo ?
[02:00] <[erisco] > Flannel, I know, but I don't think apt-get is grabbing everything. I mean, the process to install apache seems longer than apache2, if that is a fair assessment
[02:00] <Danny> I need some help MY vol buttons  are ACPI and they control the wrong channel how do I change it so it controls the PCM channel
[02:00] <CientificoLoco> how do I share voice with aMSN?
[02:01] <gnomefreak> user-land: look at help.ubuntu.com there is a section in there that tells you how to do it
[02:01] <abnerian_> http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/Distro/Ubuntu  Are these instructions safe to follow?
[02:01] <crimsun> Danny: pastebin ``lspci -nv'', please
[02:01] <user-land> or can i just run a command to restore menu.lst onto the effective boot record ?
[02:01] <crimsun> Danny: also, pastebin ``amixer''
[02:01] <Joe_CoT> gnomefreak: and what did you mean by the "/var/blah" part? I don't understand
[02:01] <[erisco] > Flannel, it still says apache2 is running. It is still letting me start and stop the server too... however it does not read as installed, and it was purged
[02:02] <gnomefreak> Joe_CoT: most of time when dpkg/apt wont overwrite files it will give you a file/path/app.deb
[02:02] <abnerian_> Can anybody help me install Madwifi?
[02:02] <gnomefreak> Joe_CoT: normally its /var/cache/bleh/bleh/bleh.deb
[02:02] <Joe_CoT> gnomefreak: okay, I've never ran into that before
[02:02] <[erisco] > Flannel, maybe I should restart the computer... sounds like a windows thing though ;)
[02:02] <user-land> gnomefreak, is it searchable ? i don't see grub mentioned there.
[02:03] <jadacyrus> HI there, I have twinview setup with the NVIDIA Xserver settings utility..How do I change it so that say, when I maximize a window on one screen it only maximizes on that screen instead of spanning both monitors.. ..is it a metamode?
[02:03] <gnomefreak> user-land: hold on ill get you the page
[02:03] <mvd> hi all, I am having problems switching a drive over from being a slave to a master... trying to get grub reinstalled gives me the error, "The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly."
[02:04] <DigitalNinja> When upgrading a server with "apt-get upgrade" how do I know if I need to reboot?
[02:04] <Flannel> [erisco] : er, if its still letting you start/stop, then I cant believe it's been purged.  You'll need to remove the model of apache as well (prefork, worker, etc), since apache2 is a meta package (ah, that might be the issue with apache as well, try removing "apache-common"
[02:04] <LjL-Ubuntu> DigitalNinja: if the kernel is upgraded, you need to reboot
[02:04] <Flannel> DigitalNinja: if you added a kernel, you'll have to reboot to get the new kernel
[02:04] <DigitalNinja> Thanks!
[02:04] <DigitalNinja> I didn't see the kernel in the list
[02:05] <gnomefreak> user-land: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/ch10s05.html
[02:05] <Flannel> mvd: that's because your MBR on your new master doesn't have grub on it
[02:05] <wastrel> it usually tells you at the end that you need to reboot
[02:05] <kmaynard> good news--with a little work, i got truecrypt to work in edgy
[02:05] <wastrel> if you've updated the kernel
[02:05] <mvd> Flannel: indeed, but I am trying to run grub-install and that's the error I get
[02:05] <[erisco] > Flannel, it is still letting me start and stop apache2... and it was purged
[02:05] <LjL-Ubuntu> wastrel: hm, i'm not sure it does anymore (well, perhaps the server version does, but not the desktop version), i haven't seen that with the latest edgy kernel upgrade
[02:05] <[erisco] > "Package apache2 is not installed, so not removed"
[02:06] <crimsun> Danny: make sure you tell me the URL(s), please
[02:06] <Flannel> [erisco] : you purged the -prefork -worker -whatever package as well? you'll want to remove apache2-common, while youre at it
[02:06] <user-land> gnomefreak, thanks, but the menu.lst is still the original ubuntu one. but it is not in effect anymore. how can i overwrite the record now in effect, generated by Suse ?
[02:06] <livingdaylight> looking for a proper and decent CD/DVD label maker
[02:06] <livingdaylight> Please do not suggest glabels as that appears to be a piece of crap
[02:07] <gnomefreak> user-land: did you install ubuntu or suse last
[02:07] <Flannel> [erisco] : "apache2" is a meta package, like apache, removing them doesn't necessarily remove the item (which means you probably still have apache1 installed)
[02:07] <user-land> suse, gnomefreak.
[02:07] <Euphidime> I have a quick question, I've seen a multitude of guides for installing Windows XP on a VMWare Virtual Machine. I was wondering if it was possible to use VMWare to boot an existing Windows Installation on my harddisk?
[02:07] <[erisco] > Flannel, apache and apache-common was both purged, and ditto for apache2 now
[02:07] <Elazar> Running Edgy. Just installed the Ubuntu/Debian package for Frostwire (http://frostwire.com). When I try to run it, I get this error... "/usr/lib/frostwire/runFrost.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")" ... in its startup script... http://hashphp.org/pastebin.php?pid=9272. I'm not familiar enough with bash scripting to be able to troubleshoot the problem. Can anyone advise?
[02:07] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: it doesnt work for you but it might work for others please dont give your opinions as advice
[02:07] <gnomefreak> user-land: it should already be using suses than
[02:07] <[erisco] > Flannel, and good news? It won't let me start and stop the server now
[02:07] <gnomefreak> and should be lilo
[02:08] <[erisco] > Flannel, better yet, it isn't running anymore
[02:08] <user-land> it does, gnomefreak. but i don't want to use suse anymore.
[02:08] <[erisco] > Flannel, now for me to try again :)
[02:08] <vos> crimsun: hmm.. specifying ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/lib/ still give me errors about not finding the openssl libs.
[02:08] <gnomefreak> !grub | user-land
[02:08] <ubotu> user-land: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:08] <mvd> what am I missing to get grub installed on what is now the master but was before the slave?
[02:08] <AndyJB> It appears that emacs is trying to use an iso8859 font and can't find any. Anyone know how I can install them, or if already installed tell emacs where to look for them? This is a global problem across all accounts so I'm not looking for a per user solution.
[02:08] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak, well, it does appear to be what it appears to be to me. But i would welcome a suggestion of another cd/dvd label maker if there is one in LInux?
[02:08] <[erisco] > Flannel, I can now see localhost from apache2
[02:09] <tsukoharu> hello, may someone please tell me how i can edit a .pml file? im trying to configure options for a game...and sadly the only way is to open this file type, there is no .conf files that have the necessary options i need to turn off to enhance the games performance
[02:09] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: after the comment you made i figured you would have something to back it up. hint apt-cache search <something>
[02:09] <livingdaylight> by the way gnomefreak hello :)
[02:09] <Euphidime> tuskoharu: PlayOnline?
[02:09] <tsukoharu> Euphidime: its a game called topspin
[02:09] <[erisco] > Flannel, and the server is acting normally now *whew* and PHP in installed. Better yet
[02:09] <crimsun> vos: because you need libssl-dev
[02:10] <Euphidime> tsukoharu: Ah, okay.
[02:10] <crimsun> vos: by default the dev packages aren't installed
[02:10] <[erisco] > Flannel, thanks for all your help! Now I just need to figure out if the database is running right
[02:10] <vos> crimsun: i see, gonna install it.
[02:10] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak, all the work on the /etc/X11/xorg.conf didn't help, unfortunately. Just thought i'd update you since you were gone by the time i had restarted X
[02:10] <noodles12> i have a real easy question... does anyone with a laptop know how to chang ethe volume control on your laptop from the headphone control to the pcm
[02:10] <noodles12> ?
[02:10] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak, what do you mean something to back it up?
[02:11] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: join me in #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:11] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak, its crashed 3 times in a row, and i can't as much as put text in a text box, so....
[02:11] <mvd> # kopt=root=UUID=dae16e5d-c3df-4007-8625-8fa8ddee7525 ro <-- why did edgy change things to look so ugly?
[02:11] <mvd> and how can I verify that that is /dev/hda2 like it should be?
[02:11] <bruenig> mvd, I wondered the same thing
[02:12] <gnomefreak> mvd: that is a better way due to kernel changes
[02:12] <chrislee> gnomefreak -- I tried "sudo update-alternatives --set java <path>", but it says can't find <path> .. yet, when I do a "ls <path", it's obvious the java file is there
[02:12] <TGPO> mvd thats blkid, so you can move drives around in your system and it will still work fine
[02:12] <gnomefreak> mvd: kernel changed to see only sd* at one point
[02:12] <gnomefreak> chrislee: i didnt state --set
[02:12] <mvd> TGPO: funny, since I have moved a drive around and now things *don't* work
[02:12] <crimsun> mvd: we migrated to UUID mounting to resolve a number of issues
[02:12] <chrislee> -config
[02:12] <Elazar> Running Edgy. Installed the Ubuntu/Debian package for Frostwire (http://frostwire.com). Getting this error...

Not familiar enough with bash scripting to be able to troubleshoot. Can anyone advise?
[02:12] <chrislee> ok, i read "set"
[02:13] <bordy> Can anybody help me understand why Firefox and Flock wont stay open?
[02:13] <TGPO> mvd didnt say I believed it, just telling you what was told to me when
[02:13] <jrib> Elazar: edit /usr/bin/frostwire and tell it to use bash instead of sh
[02:13] <rbil> I wasn't aware that the new Ubuntu did that with drives. Thankfully I haven't upgraded. :-)
[02:13] <mvd> TGPO: :)
[02:13] <Joe_CoT> hey tgunner
[02:13] <tgunner> hey guys
[02:13] <Elazar> jrib: Awesome. Thanks! :D
[02:13] <gnomefreak> bordy: flash plugin installed?
[02:14] <[erisco] > how do you find your machine name? stupid question I am sure
[02:14] <bordy> gnomefreak: I tried to install the flash plugin, and thats when firefox started closing every time I got to a flash page.
[02:14] <rbil> That silliness looks too much of the way Windoze encodes things in its registry. :-)
[02:14] <gnomefreak> bordy: remove it
[02:14] <crimsun> [erisco] : ``hostname''
[02:14] <[erisco] > crimsun, thanks
[02:14] <craigermendel> I am trying to copy somthing into a folder with root permissions.  When I drag and drop on the GUI it just tells me that I don't have permission instead of asking for a root password.  Can anyone help me?
[02:14] <w30> livingdaylight, tried openoffice templates? Check ooffice.org for the templates.
=== Cas_ is now known as Cas
[02:14] <jrib> craigermendel: what are you trying to copy into where?
[02:14] <chrislee> gnomefreak -- it provides me w/ two java options...neither of which is the one i want.
[02:15] <bordy> gnomefreak: Remove what, the plugin or FF/Flock? And how would I do either?
[02:15] <HeathenDan> you can open terminal and see username@hostname$
[02:15] <thor> I am running E16 and want to start gkrellm at startup. Neither .xinitrc nor .xsession seems to work, and .gnomerc won't be read since I am not running gnome. Anyone know how to start something automatically at X startup?
[02:15] <tgunner> craiger: change directory, cp file1 file2 /new directory
[02:15] <TGPO> uname -a lets you see the whole thing
[02:15] <gnomefreak> bordy: the plugin for flash
[02:15] <bordy> how do I do that?
[02:15] <rbil> Would someone paste his/her fstab into a pastebin? I'd like to see what Edgy is now doing. Thanks
[02:15] <craigermendel> jrib, I am trying to copy the Java runtime environment file into a java folder I created in usr.
[02:16] <gnomefreak> bordy: how did you install it?
[02:16] <bordy> packet installer from a link from someone in here
[02:16] <gnomefreak> bordy: what version?
[02:16] <livingdaylight> w30, cool,do you know for a fact that they do CD/DVD labels?
[02:16] <bordy> How do I find that?
[02:16] <jrib> craigermendel: just 'gksudo nautilus' in a terminal.  Be very careful with this...
[02:17] <livingdaylight> w30, is that in writer?
[02:17] <asdfcheesecake> i'm tryuing to upgrade to edgy from 6.06 dapper, and its failing on apt-get dist-upgrade with something about x11-common... any idea whtas wrong?
[02:17] <w30> livingdaylight, yes, but I haven't used them. sorry
[02:17] <chrislee> do i need to register the java SDK I just downloaded somewhere?
[02:17] <kamui> well, the edgy upgrade destroyed my system, Just reinstalled dapper, will be sticking with that for a while
[02:17] <[erisco] > I am running this : " mysqladmin -h root@EricLinux -u root -p password" but it is saying root@EricLinux cannot be found. Ideas?
[02:17] <turbojugend> MY XORG crashed, actually it can't find the "nvidia" modules... I changed it to "nv" but now I can't start gnome(I use beryl) anyway I am writting through default KDE... what should I do to get the freaking nvdia driver working? (I use amaranth repos and yesterday I updated)
[02:17] <crimsun> asdfcheesecake: make sure 'ubuntu-desktop' is installed if you use gnome.
[02:17] <strav> hi there... I'm trying to access my ipod mini from ubuntu and there is something odd hapenning: the device seems to be detected for a period of time then disappear. I've tried both mounting it with hotplug or manually, I can actually get to use gtkpod and perform manipulations on the ipod db but after a while, my mounted disk is empty and the device name has either changed or disappeared in /dev... any clue on how to fix that?
[02:18] <asdfcheesecake> oh... well i MEANT to say i'm running server edition
[02:18] <rbil> eriscol: try root@localhost
[02:18] <gnomefreak> bordy: check in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
[02:18] <[erisco] > rbil, nope :(
[02:18] <rbil> erisco: echo $HOSTNAME
[02:18] <gnomefreak> bordy: did you run sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree?
[02:18] <bordy> possibly?
[02:18] <[erisco] > decent idea rbil
[02:19] <crimsun> asdfcheesecake: ok, pastebin the entire error spew
[02:19] <gnomefreak> bordy: try sudo apt-get remove --purge flashplugin-nonfree
[02:19] <tsukoharu> may someone please tell me how i can edit a .pml file? im trying to configure options for a game...and sadly the only way is to open this file type, there is no .conf files that have the necessary options i need to turn off to enhance the games performance
[02:19] <bordy> gnomefreak: I do have a flash plugin -nonfree folder
[02:19] <gnomefreak> bordy: it would help if you know how you installed a package
[02:19] <wastrel> what's .pml?
[02:19] <tsukoharu> like what program can i use for windows
[02:19] <asdfcheesecake> just a sec
[02:19] <turbojugend> anby idea ^^^^?
[02:19] <gnomefreak> bordy: run the command i gave you
[02:19] <bordy> I realize, but I am still new at this, let alone after the upgrade
[02:20] <gnomefreak> tsukoharu: windows support is done in ##windows we can only give you ubuntu advice and packages
[02:21] <bordy> gnomefreak: I just got this error "E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem
[02:21] <gnomefreak> bordy: run that command than sudo dpkg --configure -a
[02:21] <mvd> so apparently I was able to install grub if I did it from within the grub console

[02:21] <strav> turbojugend, actually, if you change the driver section in device to nvidia, does it get gnome back? (and depending on which method you choosed for starting xgl, you should disable it, start a proper gnome session, correctly set nvidia then try xgl and at last: beryl)

[02:23] <kamui> bruenig: this tutorial Im reading says that i have to add beryl repos and then do an apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade.  Thats what broke my system last time
[02:23] <__mikem> OH my god
[02:24] <bruenig> kamui, people have beryl on dapper. I have seen it. That tutorial may want you to do it one way but it is not the only way.
[02:24] <kamui> bruenig: got a link for me?
[02:24] <bordy> Alright, I did those commands. But I still am not able to stay in firefox OR flock
[02:24] <bruenig> kamui, no, #ubuntu-xgl is likely to be of help

[02:27] <Skreet> In one sentence why should I use LVM, go!

[02:27] <gnomefreak> godmachine81: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:27] <quintin> Skreet: meh.
[02:27] <bruenig> I don't care if you use it
[02:27] <godmachine81> gnomefreak:: seems like all you ever do is kick/ban people and tell them to go somewhere else.. whats your problem man?
[02:27] <Flannel> quintin: if you have the plugin, then it should work in FF

[02:28] <nalioth> godmachine81: in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[02:28] <quintin> Flannel: I do.  it doesn't.

[02:30] <nalioth> gnomefreak: look for yourself
[02:30] <gnomefreak> ah
[02:30] <gnomefreak> sorry missed it
[02:31] <quintin> anyone have any tips for making firefox not be so slow?
[02:31] <Seveas> d0h
[02:31] <quintin> I'm even storing it in a ramdisk and it takes forever to load
[02:31] <quintin> on slower hardware in windows it loads in 2s
[02:31] <withaY> bruenig, it allows you to call a service from inside another one.
[02:31] <gnomefreak> quintin: install it from tar
[02:31] <DanaG> bug-buddy doesn't know gsynaptics.
[02:31] <quintin> gnomefreak: and that means what?
[02:31] <bruenig> withaY, yeah, I am not sure what the equivalent is
[02:31] <gnomefreak> !firefox
[02:31] <ubotu> firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[02:32] <Viper550> something is going on here?
[02:32] <MKR> viper: some idiot abusing a months old bug for kicks
[02:32] <quintin> gnomefreak: and that is totally useless information.
[02:32] <quintin> are you saying that I should use the mozilla.com build?  I do.
[02:33] <Skreet> is web-browser really hyphenated..
[02:33] <quintin> btw, just installed mozilla and java works in it... hm
[02:33] <gnomefreak> quintin: i gues syou didnt read it
[02:33] <gnomefreak> quintin: read the link that was newversion
[02:34] <quintin> gnomefreak: I don't want the new version.  this is still a bunch of nonsense that doesn't apply to me.
[02:35] <MKR> You can grab pretty much any legacy version from their FTP
[02:35] <withaY> bruenig, maybe this @include syntax that i'm noticing in a couple of these pam module config files?
[02:35] <bruenig> withaY, no clue
[02:35] <withaY> ok.  thanks.
[02:35] <gnomefreak> quintin: it shows you how to install from a tar since you wanted faster that would make it faster
[02:35] <DanaG> I need an old gsynaptics.
[02:36] <atarinox> can somebody help me find ATS (assistive tech suport)...i need to turn it off
[02:36] <quintin> gnomefreak: you must not be very smart.
[02:36] <quintin> gnomefreak: I have done that.  I said that twice
[02:36] <nalioth> quintin: please be civil.
[02:36] <quintin> I'll be civil if you'll be intelligent. :)
[02:37] <`Jessica> okay. brand new fresh install of Edgy Eft, and I hosed the machine by following the howto
[02:37] <`Jessica> for nvidia
[02:37] <quintin> the mozilla build fixed some scrolling issues, but it is still slow in loading, even if I load it from a ramdisk

[02:37] <meheren> I need to burn a cd using a computer with no hard drive any ideas? can i boot off of the network, if so how?...
[02:38] <wastrel> gratuit:  you can use .htaccess to ban ip's i believe
[02:38] <quintin> gratuit: maybe you want the 'adblock' plugin?
[02:38] <quintin> gratuit: I ban a lot of servers with my router, so that all clients are protected
[02:38] <gratuit> wastrel: is that user specific?
[02:38] <conlh> Hi. First time linux user. I'm trying to set up nvidia-glx by following the wiki but I keep getting some error message about not having a kernel driver install. Help. Anyone?
[02:38] <gratuit> I need something that is not user specific
[02:38] <lwylie> what's the best editor/librarian for ID3 tags on .flacs?
[02:39] <wastrel> gratuit: nvm i thought you were running the web server
[02:39] <quintin> meheren: knoppix?
[02:39] <hyphenated> gratuit: 0.0.0.0 entries in /etc/hosts
[02:39] <quintin> gratuit: what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[02:39] <meheren> quintin, yeah but i only have one cd drive..
[02:39] <gratuit> hyphenated: ah, thanks
[02:39] <crimsun> lwylie: kill id3 tags on flacs. They're awful and break lots of apps. Use vorbis comments instead.
[02:39] <atarinox> so does anyone know where this ATS (assistive tech support) is located...this guide says it's in system > preferences....but i dont seem to have any preferences option under system....
[02:39] <hyphenated> gratuit: but that's hostnames, not domains
[02:39] <TGPO> conlh sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf find where it says nv and change it to nvidia
[02:39] <quintin> meheren: use the "toram" kernel command line option so that everything is cached.  then you can switch cds.
[02:39] <crimsun> atarinox: are you using gnome?
[02:40] <atarinox> xfce
[02:40] <crimsun> atarinox: that's because we don't have the same menu structure that GNOME does.
[02:40] <gratuit> hyphenated: I believe that will accomplish what I need, thanks
[02:40] <lwylie> crimsum:  ok... what's a good editor/librarian for vorbis comments? not able to do anything with sound juicer or rhythmbox
[02:40] <hyphenated> gratuit: (ie: you can't ban *.ebay.com, you'd have to list every known subdomain in there)
[02:40] <crimsun> atarinox: you might want to search the wiki for Xfce and assistive tech
[02:40] <meheren> quintin... ok yet anether prob... how do i get knoppix? (for free) i have the ubuntu cd's can i do it with thoses?
[02:40] <ubutom> meheren, try insert http://www.inside-security.de/insert_en.html
[02:40] <meheren> *those
[02:40] <crimsun> lwylie: ex falso and cowbell are my recommendations
[02:41] <crimsun> lwylie: I'm partial to the former
[02:41] <quintin> meheren: you download it off the internets. omgz
[02:41] <lwylie> crimsum: great... thanks for the reccomendation.
[02:41] <quintin> meheren: if this computer has no hard drive, where are you getting the data to burn from .. the network?
[02:41] <meheren> quintin, but how do i boot my computer with it? my computer has no hard drive and it is my only computer with a cd burner
[02:41] <ubutom> meheren, it is just 50MB, if you type insert toram at boot prompt, it will be copied into RAM, and you can burn with your drive
[02:42] <meheren> quintin, yes
[02:42] <quintin> meheren: ... you put it in the computer and reboot.
[02:42] <meheren> quintin, but now we are back to the beginning how do i burn the cd?
[02:43] <quintin> meheren: are you mentally challenged?  I already told you once, and someone else told you as well.  use the "toram" kernel option to cache everything in ram.  then you can eject the tray.
[02:43] <quintin> meheren: if you mean the program?  'cdrecord' probably is what you want.
=== who_cares is now known as who_care1
[02:44] <meheren> quintin, umm im not following this
[02:44] <quintin> meheren: ok.  which part?
[02:44] <meheren> quintin, sry!...
[02:45] <meheren> quintin, ok soo... tell me what to do again?
[02:45] <quintin> meheren: that's fine.  what specifically is unclear.
=== who_care1 is now known as who_cares
[02:45] <hcjc92> okay, i'm here (finally... lol i was asdfcheesecake a minute ago)
[02:46] <quintin> meheren: ...
[02:46] <meheren> quintin, ok i have a bootbale computer... (the one im using) with a hd i have anether computer no hd but a cd burner
[02:46] <finalbeta> can system wide (alsa) equalizing be achieved? Can't find anything on it.
[02:46] <hcjc92> the best i can do for the pastebin'ing the err log, is http://huncar.freehostia.com/errlog.txt (i sorta killed x by rebooting before it was done upgrading...)
[02:46] <meheren> how do i boot the computer with the cd burner and bun a cd?
[02:46] <meheren> *burn
[02:47] <quintin> meheren: we covered this.  I'll try to use small words.  boot with a livecd using the toram kernel option so that the cd is cached in ram.  eject the tray.  insert a CD-R or CD-RW.  burn with program of your choice.
[02:47] <meheren> i get how i can boot the computer using insert or knoppix but how do i get those programs onto cd's?...
[02:47] <meheren> oh!... lolo i feel so stupid
[02:47] <meheren> *lol
[02:47] <meheren> use my livecd... hehe
[02:48] <DanaG> Argh,
[02:48] <meheren> heh yeah sry about that
[02:48] <DanaG> bug report tool says 'Please fix the problems below and try again.'

[02:49] <crimsun> hcjc92: right, pastebin the error spew.
[02:49] <DanaG> pffft, you have to CLICK on the package name, and not just type it in?  That's stupid!

[02:52] <zipzo> yes, im there
[02:52] <crimsun> zipzo: the stuff in quotes is a command
[02:53] <ubutom> you could try to pxe-boot meheren , but i dont know much about that... dont you know someone whp could burn you a cd?
[02:53] <zipzo> ok i enetered it
[02:53] <crimsun> zipzo: type that string into a terminal and paste the output onto the pastebin
[02:53] <zipzo> and i therefor posted that
[02:53] <meheren> ubutom, i got it thx for the help :)
[02:54] <`Jessica> hey, i used the envy script to install the nvidia driver but it doesn't have direct rendering support.
[02:54] <`Jessica> Can anyone explain to me what I can to to enable it?
[02:54] <`Jessica> |
[02:54] <wastrel> !nvidia | `Jessica
[02:54] <ubotu> `Jessica: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:54] <`Jessica> no
[02:54] <`Jessica> that method doesnt' work
[02:55] <zipzo> ok i got a full page of errors after posting the reult to pastebin
[02:55] <`Jessica> and caused me to have to reinstall my system
[02:55] <crimsun> zipzo: right, now point us to the URL
[02:55] <zipzo> http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php
[02:55] <crimsun> zipzo: no, your paste.
[02:55] <zipzo> im saying, thats what happened, errors
[02:56] <quintin> `Jessica: I kind of doubt that was really needed.
[02:57] <Parachutes> Hi, can someone give me a quick idea of how I would disable the loading of X on startup? I just want my Ubuntu box to boot to terminal login.
[02:57] <zipzo> ok i closed the error screen, and hit send to pastebin, and its just sitting loading.
[02:57] <quintin> any recommendations for a FAST gecko based browser?
[02:58] <quintin> k-meleon doesn't run on linux :\
[02:58] <Jordan_U> quintin, Firefox 1.5 ;)
[02:58] <livingtm> I have a question about edgy for AMD64- can I run any software compiled for i386?
[02:58] <bluefox83> quintin, gecko?
[02:58] <wastrel> firefox is satisfactory on my system
[02:58] <tengulre> hi,all
[02:58] <quintin> Jordan_U: it is way too damn slow.
[02:58] <wastrel> galeon ?
[02:58] <nalioth> quintin: galeon, epiphany, kazehakaze all run on linux and are gecko based
[02:58] <quintin> bluefox83: yes.  the rendering engine in mozilla, firefox, etc
[02:58] <bluefox83> swidrfox works great
[02:58] <bluefox83> er
[02:59] <bluefox83> swiftfox
[02:59] <quintin> nalioth: thanks, I'll try those.  swiftfox also sux
[02:59] <wastrel> i used to love galeon until the 2.0 mess
[02:59] <wastrel> i think they've gotten better
[02:59] <lotusleaf> use Dillo, it's fun when you're drunk ;)
[02:59] <jojoman02> my usb-hard disk is being loaded read-only how do i mount it r/w??
[02:59] <Jordan_U> quintin, I think FF is slow because it uses the geko engine, try konqueror.
[02:59] <daxlett_> is there a way besides using the 'sessions' preference to add a startup program?
[02:59] <zipzo> ok well for some reason, pastebin was not working, but the ubuntu one was. so here is my soundblaster results   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30355/
[03:00] <wastrel> !startup  | daxlett_
[03:00] <ubotu> daxlett_: To add programs to start up when you log into your Gnome session https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup
[03:00] <quintin> Jordan_U: mhmm... riiiight. :P  really though?? :p
[03:00] <jojoman02> how do i find out if it's fat32 or not?
[03:00] <DanaG> yay, modprobe script:
[03:00] <DanaG> install snd-hda-intel /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-hda-intel $CMDLINE_OPTS && { if amixer | grep SPDIF ; then rmmod -w snd_hda_intel && modprobe snd-hda-intel ; fi }
[03:00] <hcjc92> crimsun, xbattbar doesn't want to go away... :| http://huncar.freehostia.com/errlog2.txt
[03:00] <neonempyr> nForce vs. VIA?
[03:00] <neonempyr> (nforce4) vs. VIA?
[03:00] <Jordan_U> quintin, That is just a guess, but I havn't heard of anything geko based faster than swiftfox.
[03:00] <daxlett_> wastrel: heh, thanks, but I need a way that doesnt involve the system>prefernces>sessions
[03:01] <davey486> how to i make sure my cd drive is using dma?
[03:01] <quintin> Jordan_U: I even have firefox running from a ramdisk and it is still slow
[03:01] <DanaG> when SPDIF shows up, the card doesn't work, so that script rmmod-s and re-modprobes it until it shows up without the SPDIF.
[03:01] <crimsun> hcjc92: doesn't look like the edgy repos are actually active.
[03:01] <tsukoharu> hey
[03:01] <skittz04> Looking for some assistance setting up 6.10 with multiple monitors -- not the usual questions though - the live CD won't work with my video card (Nvidia FX 5200) , so I think I need to do a manual install -- do I use the alterntive install CD for that, or do I throw switches on the live cd ?
[03:01] <crimsun> hcjc92: those errors actually have nothing to do with xbattbar, btw.
[03:01] <crimsun> hcjc92: sudo dpkg -P xbattbar && sudo apt-get -f install
[03:01] <hcjc92> i know, but it won't get removed...
[03:01] <quintin> davey486: if you are using 6.06 it is automatically enabled.
[03:01] <hcjc92> okay
[03:02] <wastrel> skittz04:  alternate cd i believe is what you need for textmode install
[03:02] <davey486> im using 610
[03:02] <Paladine> anyone had any problems with the new nvidia drivers?
[03:03] <Paladine> when I say new I mean the recent upgrade from the ubuntu packages
[03:03] <Paladine> as opposed to the beta on nvidias site
[03:03] <bimberi> skittz04: Did you try the LiveCD boot option for safe video (i think that's what it's called)?
[03:03] <w30> Parachutes, you need to edit /etc/inittab and change the line id:2:initdefault: to be 3 instead of 2 (back it up first so you can revert if something goes wrong though.)
[03:03] <skittz04> yeah. the safe video option didn't work either.. it couldn't find any screens.
[03:03] <zipzo> how can i fix the sound to make it work? i got nothing coming out of my soundblaster?
[03:04] <who_cares> what's the command to list the current permissions for a file
[03:04] <skittz04> running an ati radeon (9200? ) for one monitor, and a dual head nvidia fx 5200 for the other two.
[03:04] <bimberi> skittz04: kk, sounds like you'll need the alternate CD then :|
[03:04] <wastrel> who_cares:  ls -l filename
[03:04] <kamui> Any fglrx experts around to help me figure out why even though Im successfully using the fglrx driver to power Xorg, Im getting NO direct rendering?
[03:04] <Sirrion> anyone know if the sil3112a chipset works out of the box on 6.10?
[03:04] <DanaG> Paladine: there's some version conflict in Amaranth's linux-restricted modules.
[03:04] <Parachutes> w30, even if the rcN.d scripts in both rc2.d and rc3.d are the same, X won't load in runlevel 3 as on anyother Linux distro?
[03:04] <RogerBacon> haha, great one, The classic Linux warning is not to type rm -Rf /* as root. Yes, you will erase your system. No, it will not be pretty. Yes, you will feel stupid.
[03:04] <DanaG> Namely, the official one has a newer version number but has older NVIDIA drivers.
[03:04] <who_cares> thanks
[03:05] <skittz04> should i do a vesa driver install, or should i try and download and use a nvidia driver in the install from the start ?
[03:05] <DanaG> So lock the package to the Amaranth version.
[03:05] <crimsun> zipzo: I'm still waiting on the URL.
[03:05] <Bane> sirrion I have one, and I can't get 6.10 installed
[03:05] <zipzo> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30355/
[03:05] <hcjc92> damit.... well it got rid of xbattbar and -f install worked, and then i do dist-upgrade and it dies on something ELSE! :|
[03:05] <zipzo> must have missed it
[03:05] <DanaG> google for amaranth lrm
[03:05] <Sirrion> bane... what exactly happens?
[03:05] <zipzo> :)
[03:05] <Bane> all kindsa crap, pretty much gave up hehe
[03:05] <Sirrion> bleh
[03:05] <Bane> video corrupts just booting off cd
[03:05] <devios> anyone have a working canon i850 printer in edgy?
[03:05] <crimsun> zipzo: oh that's simple. It's still set to your onboard Intel.
[03:05] <crimsun> zipzo: are you using gnome?
[03:05] <Sirrion> what kind of board you got bane?
[03:05] <zipzo> yes
[03:05] <bimberi> skittz04: the alternate cd uses a text-mode installer.  You can try various X drivers from there
[03:05] <Bane> asus
[03:05] <crimsun> zipzo: System> Preferences> Sound> [middle tab]  > Set default sound card
[03:05] <Bane> hang on sec
[03:05] <Bane> a8n?
[03:06] <skittz04> ok. sounds good. will give it a shot. the alternate ISO is downloading now.
[03:06] <quintin> How do I regenerate keys for packages?  I keep being wanred that stuff is "untrusted"
[03:06] <bimberi> quintin: sudo apt-get update
[03:06] <Bane> checking real quick
[03:06] <Bane> and to make sure its not the 3114
[03:06] <Sirrion> cuz im also wondering if it would auto pickup and work with my nvidia onboard nic
[03:06] <pkh> auto-mounting usb disks isn't working on my server.  coes anyone know how to find out why?
[03:07] <Bane> I just use the yukon
[03:07] <zipzo> thx Crimsun!
[03:07] <Bane> picks that part up fine :)
[03:07] <pkh> usb-disk is mountable by sudo mount ... -- just won't do it automatically in /media when I insrt it.
[03:07] <quintin> bimberi: you're my hero! :-*
[03:08] <mzli> <pkh>modify file fstab
[03:08] <Bane> ya a8n-deluxe
[03:08] <quintin> pkh: did you change kernels?
[03:08] <Sirrion> hmm... the livecd can you get online with that? or no...
[03:08] <mzli> <pkh>remove the line which usb related
[03:08] <Bane> think its a sil314 though
[03:08] <Sirrion> like if it keeps bonking out on me... my other system doesnt have a net connection
[03:08] <Bane> switched my single drive to the NF4 controller, and it got farther
[03:08] <pkh> the usb disk isn't mentioned in fstab...
[03:08] <DanaG> System audio and web audio goes to onboard.
[03:09] <DanaG> music and movie audio goes to external.
[03:09] <Bane> I have a raid setup and a SLI setup though, figure one of those is blowing the install out
[03:09] <DanaG> Annoying sounds on the web?  fn-mute!
[03:09] <pkh> quintin, nope.  it's 6.06.1 headless, only done normal update/upgrade's since install a few months ago
[03:09] <[erisco] > so if I want a link from /home/eric/Desktop/www/ to /var/www/ what will my command look like?
[03:09] <hanasaki2> how do i force a package to be uninstalled that is giving errors on apt-get remove --purge
[03:09] <w30> Parachutes, perhaps remove the gdm link in your run level like the S13gdm link in /etc/rc3.d
[03:09] <mzli> <pkh>Sorry , my mistake.
[03:09] <Sirrion> ln -s /home/eric/Desktop/www /var/www?
[03:09] <wastrel> [erisco] :  ln -s target link_name
[03:09] <Euphidime> I finally got my Video drivers working with my dual head setup. However, when I move my mouse over to my second monitor, it turns into a ...white box. A big white box. Has this happened to anyone else?
[03:09] <Sirrion> err backwards
[03:09] <Bane> don't really do linux, but heard good things about Unbuntu, so wanted to check it out, doesn't work on mys sytem :)
[03:09] <quintin> [erisco] : .. ln -s ?
[03:10] <Sirrion> yea.. i figured id tinker with it
[03:10] <pkh> Euphidime, are you using the ati binary drivers (fglrx)
[03:10] <wastrel> what's SLI  ?
[03:10] <Euphidime> pkh: Yes
[03:10] <Bane> all though I can get RedHat EL working on my box np sirrion
[03:10] <Sirrion> i dont have anything against windows... since i need it for almost everything i do (ps/web design)
[03:10] <[erisco] > wastrel, quintin, thanks I'll try that
[03:10] <Bane> ya it pays the bills :)
[03:10] <Sirrion> so.. im going to try and jump shit and try all opensource stuff :-D
[03:10] <pkh> Euphidime, doesn't work -- they're buggy.  i spent ages trying to get rid of that myself -- went back to ati drivers and everything is perfect...
[03:10] <Sirrion> shit=ship lol
[03:10] <taladon> jump shit??
[03:10] <taladon> nice one
[03:10] <Bane> hehe
[03:11] <Bane> wastrel: dual video cards
[03:11] <mzli> <Sirrion>asp or php?
[03:11] <Sirrion> php
[03:11] <Euphidime> pkh: Will my xorg.conf still work if I just change it to use the ati drivers instead of fglrx?
[03:11] <Sirrion> 2.0 stuff
[03:11] <hanasaki2> i am upgrading to edgy from dapper... courier-authdaemon upgrade is failing.. and i cant even apt-get remove it due to " Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should reinstall it before remove.. "  but reinstall fails too
[03:11] <pkh> Euphidime, i think it's possible (didn't look into it) that the dapper version was ok, but the edgy version is buggy.  i noticed some weird stuff on the cursor in single-mode when i upgraded, but hadn't dual-screened t that time
[03:11] <mzli> <Sirrion>are you using template?
[03:11] <quintin> I'm still not too happy with any of these web browsers.  this is saaaaaad.  that older hardware with windows runs firefox so much faster than my main desktop :(
[03:11] <crimsun> hanasaki2: it's a bug, and we know about it. No ETA on a fixed package.
[03:11] <Sirrion> template?
[03:12] <mzli> <hanasaki2>reinstall from cd is the fast method
[03:12] <Euphidime> pkh: Alright, thanks for your help
[03:12] <hanasaki2> crimsun  buggars :(  ok.. so am i screwed or is there a way around it?
[03:12] <mzli> <Sirrion>smarty or phplib etc.
[03:12] <crimsun> hanasaki2: depends how familiar you are with debconf.
[03:12] <pkh> Euphidime, shoudl be pretty close.  what I did instead was backup the xorg.conf -- then rebuild the basic setup -- then make the changes required to go back to dual-head -- the only problem I remember was that the ati driver wasn't get installed by default in my setup
[03:12] <Sirrion> oh... ive honestly used a bunch of different ones
[03:12] <hanasaki2> crimsun  i have heard of it .. :( thats all.. please help me out
[03:12] <Sirrion> me and a partner do webhosting
[03:12] <kevin_> i have a netgear W511T (atheros i believe) on an edgy eft cd and i just downloaded the restricted modules... how do i make edgy see my wifi card?
[03:12] <Danny> I need some help MY vol buttons  are ACPI and they control the wrong channel how do I change it so it controls the PCM channel \
[03:13] <Sirrion> so im pretty much doing either the ps work... or just the work on OUR site
[03:13] <tsukoharu> crimsun: do you know anything about .pml files? i need to edit one
[03:13] <pkh> Euphidime, and there are two.  one one driver and the other something eimilar...  not sure whether it's a repo issue with me, but check it out
[03:13] <crimsun> tsukoharu: no.
[03:13] <Parachutes> w30, can I just remove the link?
[03:13] <[erisco] > wastrel, quintin, thanks that worked great! One more thing learned
[03:13] <Sirrion> tsukoharu... if in doubt, try opening with notepad
[03:13] <Sirrion> hehe
[03:13] <crimsun> hanasaki2: it's a bit too involved at this stage. Wait for the fixed package.
[03:13] <tsukoharu> Sirrion tried...its compiled
[03:13] <kevin_> anyone?
[03:13] <hanasaki2> crimsun  my box is now hoarked
[03:13] <mzli> <Sirrion> ok.
[03:13] <hanasaki2> waiting is ummm gonna suck
[03:13] <Danny> I need some help MY vol buttons  are ACPI and they control the wrong channel how do I change it so it controls the PCM channel
[03:13] <Bane> no clue kevin, its a pita for my linksys hehe
[03:14] <Bane> get told to RTFM, its easier just to load windows back on the box and call it good ;)
[03:14] <crimsun> Danny: I asked you for information over an hour ago. Did you provide it?
[03:14] <Danny> ok tell me
[03:14] <kevin_> well supposedly this is a linux freindly card or whatever... is it a problem in edgy?
[03:14] <LionsPhil> Soooo...wpasupplicant. Is there actually any up-to-date documentation on vaguely modern wireless support?
[03:15] <crimsun> Danny: ``lspci -nv && amixer''  -> pastebin
[03:15] <LionsPhil> I found a hacked-up half-for-Dapper-half-for-Breezy guide, but it doesn't feel like working.

[03:15] <hanasaki2> crimsun sothat it.. edgy goes prod w/ a bug like this and the answer is... i know y0our box is messd up.. wait for the fix without an ETA?
[03:15] <Danny> were do i out that
[03:15] <Bane> edgy picked up something about my linksys, but I don't really know what.  20 pages of wiki crap on it
[03:15] <crimsun> hanasaki2: I'm not the release manager; it's not my call.
[03:15] <LionsPhil> I know for certain that hostap_pci is the right module, and I know my wpa_supplicant config are good, as both came from a previous Gentoo install on this exact box.
[03:15] <mzli> <pkh>what you met are related autofs service.
[03:15] <hanasaki2> okok
[03:16] <TonySt> black_sun, this is what freenode is like :-)
[03:16] <black_sun> aww

[03:16] <hanasaki2> so noone is gonna / able to help with such an issue on a prod release that messed up a box?
[03:16] <TonySt> just a few more people than what you're used to
[03:16] <Danny> ok
[03:16] <LionsPhil> However, the interface isn't starting up. And iwconfig and the silly graphical things don't think that wlan0 is actually wireless. Which is kind of unhelpful.
[03:16] <taladon> is there any way in konversation to tile the chat windows? I've got 2 up and I can't stand tabbing back and forth between them

[03:59] <poquedoraqu> how come whenever i use my external HD linux on other computers i have to reconfigure graphics, yet the live boot disk requires no such thing
[03:59] <Danny> how do i get to the wiki
[03:59] <wastrel> Danny:  wiki.ubuntu.com
[04:00] <bordy> !firefox
[04:00] <ubotu> firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[04:00] <ra21vi> poquedoraqu: but u cannt sqeeze most from Live CD
[04:00] <firebird619> Which repo is the opera browser in? I have universe and multiverse enabled and it isn't there.
[04:00] <poquedoraqu> i know that. I just want to know why i have to reconfigure my x thingy, instead of just runinng it
[04:00] <poquedoraqu> the boot doesnt have to do that
[04:00] <wastrel> poquedoraqu:  the livecd tries to autodetect video hardware on boot
[04:01] <poquedoraqu> aha! can i do that myself?
[04:01] <wastrel> but your installed version doesn't expect to have to do that
[04:01] <poquedoraqu> any loophole?
[04:01] <wastrel> poquedoraqu:  i don't know but it's an interesting question.
[04:01] <poquedoraqu> i think you should be able to have it autodetect. Surely.
[04:02] <wastrel> poquedoraqu:  i imagine that sort fo thing isn't in the installed OS so that it doesn't slow down the boot process.
[04:02] <poquedoraqu> well okay, thanks anyway guys. Ill get back to you if i find out :)
[04:02] <poquedoraqu> ah. well ill ask around. tanks
[04:02] <AndyJB> firebird619: I _think_ opera maintain their own repository
[04:03] <firebird619> AndyJB: Yes, I know they have one and I can get it from there, but I thought I had read somewhere that it was added to one of the Ubuntu repos starting with version 9.
[04:04] <AndyJB> firebird619: Didn't know that. Probably easier to stay up to date if you get it straight from Opera though.

[04:06] <bruenig> who_cares, what is the problem?
[04:06] <trelayne> hi all, I've recently move my ubuntu installed HD to another computer. Of course the graphics is different and I would need to redo the graphics config. Anyone know what tool  I can use  with an already installed system?
[04:06] <bruenig> !xconfig
[04:06] <ubotu> To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[04:07] <trelayne> thanks ;-)
[04:07] <nomasteryoda|w> devios, so what is your issue with i850?
[04:07] <skelter> how do i use a .debdiff file to patch?

[04:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about debdiff - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[04:08] <who_cares> the one in the system menu doesn't work either
[04:08] <bruenig> who_cares, oh, well does anyone know what command those buttons do?
[04:08] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed ubuntu-lamp_6.10-2_all.deb on this system.  I want to remove it now but don't know how.
[04:09] <ubuntu_newb> I only want it to be a desktop computer, not a web server.
[04:09] <Danny> crimsun i looked it up but it stoped half way
[04:09] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, Are you running Edgy?
[04:10] <nomasteryoda|w> ubuntu_newb, apt-get remove  ubuntu-lamp
[04:10] <bruenig> ubuntu_newb, have you tried sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-lamp?
[04:10] <w30> hcjc92, try xcdroast
[04:10] <hcjc92> i know there *something* (yes i am a newb thanks) that you can use to make it so more than one thing can play music/make noise/etc etc at once, what is it xD
[04:10] <chandoo> hi :)
[04:10] <who_cares> maybe if I re-install ubuntu?
[04:10] <chandoo> how to use usb thumb dirve to install ubuntu
[04:10] <bruenig> chandoo, plug it in, generally an icon will pop up on the desktop
[04:11] <AndyJB> who_cares: A little drastic!
[04:11] <tonyyarusso> There's something seriously wrong with the system bell on my desktop (IBM Netvista M42).  Rather than just beeping, the sound persists for several seconds.  This behaviour just started today.  Any ideas?
[04:11] <chandoo> i am new to ubuntu, is this best distro for desktop usage
[04:11] <who_cares> not really
[04:11] <Jordan_U> chandoo, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
[04:11] <who_cares> I still don't have it installed all the way
[04:11] <bruenig> who_cares, I am sure that would work. Not sure if it is called for
[04:11] <bruenig> oh, he said install, i thought he said use a usb drive
[04:11] <who_cares> I'm just getting it online for the first time
[04:11] <AndyJB> who_cares: If we figure which command the button runs you can try it in a terminal and see what happens
[04:11] <wastrel> best is subjective

=== blind_ is now known as blind
[04:12] <chandoo> thanks Jordan_U i will read the article
[04:12] <w30> hcjc92, although I think K3b from KDE is the best burner for DVD or Cd, just intstall the kde libs and not KDE
[04:12] <Jordan_U> chandoo, That is a matter of opinion, but it is definately focused on desktop useability
[04:13] <chandoo> Jordan_U i want ease of use with heavy stuff if i wanted
[04:13] <kevin_> how likely is it for a pcmcia port to fry?
[04:13] <chandoo> like building custom kernels and so on
[04:13] <Jordan_U> chandoo, Building custom kernels is basically the same with all distributions AFIK
[04:14] <chandoo> Jordan_U so far i only know fedora, i havent tried any other distro
[04:14] <chandoo> i read a lot on ubuntu , want to give a try
[04:15] <chandoo> Jordan_U is it fully free?
[04:15] <zircx> question, is there anyway to install kde into ubuntu edgy? much like the kubuntu distro?
[04:15] <Jordan_U> chandoo, 100% :)
[04:15] <dakaru> in Ubuntu I never have had to do Kernel work
[04:15] <sizzam> chandoo: there was an article on digg about compiling kernels in ubuntu --- http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
[04:15] <Jordan_U> zircx, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[04:15] <chandoo> Jordan_U: most problem i faced is it with 64bit, not many apps to play around with it
[04:15] <mzl1> zircx:why? just install ubuntu is fine.
[04:16] <zircx> mzl1, because i want to try the kde enviroment in ubuntu
[04:16] <chandoo> sizzam thanks for the link i will definetly read it
[04:16] <bimberi> zircx: install the kubuntu-desktop package
[04:16] <dakaru> Ubuntu is simply the most desktop ready OS in my opinion
[04:16] <zircx> Jordan_U, bimberi  thanks
[04:16] <who_cares> I think I just broke the file browser
[04:16] <who_cares> it doesn't open
[04:16] <ubuntu_newb> This is all I get after doing apt-get remove ubuntu-lamp....
[04:16] <ubuntu_newb> Removing ubuntu-lamp ...
[04:16] <ubuntu_newb> root@James-ubuntu1:/#
[04:16] <chandoo> how abt 64 bit support and related apps
[04:16] <kevin_> anyone have any idea how likely it is for a pcmcia port to fry?
[04:16] <ubuntu_newb> I don't think it removes it.
[04:17] <scamboy> !pcmia
[04:17] <chandoo> is any one running 32bit as well as 64bit combined?
[04:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pcmia - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:17] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, It is what is called a meta package, do: sudo apt-get autoremove
[04:18] <ubuntu_newb> that's it? just sudo apt-get autoremove ?
[04:18] <zircx> ubuntu_newb, try it and you'll find out lol
[04:18] <observer2> hi
[04:18] <poquedoraqu> there simply has to be a way to make ubuntu auto-detect my graphics at startup.
[04:18] <mzl1> zircx: ubuntu is default gnome. kde should be kubuntu.
[04:18] <Jordan_U> poquedoraqu, There is.
[04:18] <poquedoraqu> ?
[04:19] <poquedoraqu> how :D
[04:19] <tsb> hi
[04:19] <who_cares> hey, my volume works now
[04:19] <ubuntu_newb> I get...  E: Invalid operation autoremove
[04:19] <who_cares> :)
[04:19] <skelter> hey - i want to apply the .debdiff file from this page https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/eclipse/+bug/68380 - how do i do that?
[04:19] <zircx> mzl1, I'm well aware of that .. hence why I am asking howto install the kde desktop, I've already got gnome, I don't think there should be a need to download the kubuntu iso to install kde desktop..
[04:19] <tsb> howto install Ultimate3.0.1.tar.gz on my ubotu  server :D ?
[04:19] <Jordan_U> poquedoraqu, Have it run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[04:19] <Jordan_U> at startup
[04:19] <poquedoraqu> because i want to eb able to quickly port this usb drive with linux on it between two machines
[04:19] <poquedoraqu> yay a command!
[04:19] <observer2> I heard that it's possible to run Ubuntu on a PC that only has one partition on its hard drive, which already has Windows installed on it.  Is this true?
[04:20] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, are you running Edgy?
[04:20] <ubuntu_newb> don't know
[04:20] <bruenig> observer2, without a virtual machine, no
[04:20] <ubuntu_newb> what's that?
[04:20] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, The newest version of Ubuntu.
[04:20] <nomasteryoda|w>  observer2 you can partiton it with gparted
[04:20] <scamboy> its edgy..
[04:20] <tsb> howto install Ultimate3.0.1.tar.gz IRC service .. some support on that..
[04:20] <SAM_theman> Hi guys.. has anyone gotten "Alacarte Menu Editor" to actually work ?
[04:20] <ubuntu_newb> Yeah I just got it.
[04:20] <nomasteryoda|w> safely... just backup critical data
[04:20] <peanutb> observer, only if you make a new onw
[04:20] <bimberi> observer2: yes, the Ubuntu installer can resize the windows partition to make space.
[04:20] <poquedoraqu> you're a life saver! thanks!
[04:20] <zircx> ubuntu_newb, I would suggest that you actually go and read something about ubuntu if you don't even know what the latest release is?!
[04:20] <Jordan_U> SAM_theman, Works for me.
[04:20] <ubuntu_newb> it is version 6.06.1 LTS
[04:20] <bruenig> SAM_theman, it worked great on dapper. I am on xubuntu now so now alacarte for me
[04:20] <dakaru> I like Dapper over edgy. No idea why but I do.
[04:21] <shini`> no
[04:21] <Bonez56> hi all, i just upgraded to edgy from dapper and now i can not get my PC to detect either my digital camera, or my card reader. can anyone help?
[04:21] <SAM_theman> it dosen't seem to wrok for me any suggestions
[04:21] <shini`> ubuntu_newb: the latest version is 6.10
[04:21] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, That is the second to newest version, 6.10 is the newest
[04:21] <observer2> thanks
[04:21] <who_cares> so, I have a broken button and a broken file browser, should I just re-install ubuntu?
[04:21] <who_cares> I've already done it once today, after I broke part of the kernel (or whatever GRUB is)
[04:21] <nomasteryoda|w> observer2,  with sata drives though, i've seen better results partitioning with the gparted tool on the installer cd... or the live gparted disc
[04:21] <ubuntu_newb> how can I update?
[04:21] <shini`> who_cares: grub is the boot loader :)
[04:21] <Jordan_U> !upgrade | ubuntu_newb
[04:21] <ubotu> ubuntu_newb: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[04:21] <bruenig> who_cares, if you want to. When I just started, I probably reinstalled 3-4 times the first week
[04:22] <yipe> uh-oh, is tonyyarusso okay?
[04:22] <who_cares> I deleted it earlier
[04:22] <ubuntu_newb> and what does that have to do with me removing ubuntu-lamp?
[04:22] <who_cares> :-[
[04:22] <yipe> emergency maintenence sounds... bad
[04:22] <tonyyarusso> yipe: tonyyarusso is fine; tonyyserver is sick.
[04:22] <shini`> who_cares: lol
[04:22] <Vuen_> hey guys, i'm having a problem with my partition table
[04:22] <Bonez56> hi all, i just upgraded to edgy from dapper and now i can not get my PC to detect either my digital camera, or my card reader. can anyone help?
[04:22] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, There is a new feature in Edgy that would make what you are trying to do much easier.
[04:22] <Vuen_> it looks like this, i've got an ntfs partition (sda1), an ext3 partition (sda5), a swap partition (sda6), and three ext2 partitions
[04:23] <shini`> ubuntu_newb: if you're going to update your ubuntu and you have nothing on yhour hdd now but a clean 6.06 install I would probably download the 6.10 cd and do a clean install
[04:23] <shini`> ubuntu_newb: aka formatting and putting edgy eft (6.10) on
[04:23] <Vuen_> now the problem is, the last two partitions have their /dev/sda# references in the wrong order
[04:23] <shini`> ubuntu_newb: i've heard upgrading causes issues
[04:23] <Vuen_> the last partition is /dev/sda8 and the one before it is /dev/sda9
[04:23] <ian__> No sound after 6.06 --> 6.10, aplay -l gives me this output, any help? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30363/
[04:23] <Vuen_> and gparted is confused and won't let me change the partition table anymore.
[04:23] <mzl1> dakaru: me 2, dapper is more reliable.
[04:23] <observer2> is there a version of Ubuntu that runs straight from the CD, without needing to install it onto the hard drive?
[04:23] <Danny> 6.06
[04:24] <Vuen_> anyone know how i can fix my partition table?
[04:24] <immrtl> is there ubuntu documentation for recompiling the kernel that came with the 6.10/LIVEcd? why did it automatically compile with CONFIG_AGP=m, with agpgart running as a mod now??
[04:24] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, But that feature only helps if you were using edgy when you installed it, so upgrading won't help you now unfortunately :(
[04:24] <wastrel> observer2:  the desktop CD
[04:24] <immrtl> Vuen_: what do u mean wrong order
[04:24] <ubuntu_newb> Thanks for all the help guys... I'll probably just go get the latest version on cd
[04:24] <Jordan_U> observer2, All of the versions have / do
[04:24] <ubuntu_newb> What is the major differences between the versions?
[04:24] <shini`> ubuntu_newb: i think that's the best way to do it -- from what i've heard
[04:24] <nomasteryoda> many
[04:24] <yipe> lol, I never noticed that the wongs live in the addams' family house
[04:24] <Vuen_> immrtl: i mean when i mount it, the last partition is /dev/sda8 and the one before it is /dev/sda9.
[04:24] <ubuntu_newb> and would the newest version be my best option as a second desktop?
[04:24] <Vuen_> it's like this
[04:24] <shini`> i've only used dapper (6.06) so I couldn't tell you, but i heard edgy runs faster
[04:25] <Vuen_> when the partitions aren't mounted, qtparted correctly shows the data in the right places
[04:25] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, Yes, but depending on what kinds of things you do you may or may not notice them.
[04:25] <nomasteryoda> shini`, it does
[04:25] <roach_> hello, I'm an overly ambitious Ubuntu (and Linux) n00b, trying to install Ubuntu 6.10 onto two clean 80GB IDE drives in RAID-1, and (so far) failing...  any RAID-1 expertise in the house?
[04:25] <mzl1>  ubuntu_newb:why second, not first?
[04:25] <dakaru> Edgy seemed to have a lot of "Rough, edges".
[04:25] <skelter> could anyone tell me how to apply a debdiff patch?
[04:25] <Vuen_> but when i actually mount /dev/sda8 and /dev/sda9, their data is switched, and qtparted shows all the data in the wrong spots
[04:25] <ubuntu_newb> I'm mainly using it on my second system to learn linux better
[04:25] <scamboy> !raid
[04:25] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[04:25] <ubuntu_newb> plus my main system I use for gaming
[04:25] <Vuen_> like it thinks 60 gigs of data moved from one platter to another physically on the drive
[04:25] <ubuntu_newb> I can't run windows games on linux
[04:25] <roach_> ubotu: thanks!
[04:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks! - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:25] <Vuen_> it's the strangest thingg
[04:26] <scamboy> !Wine
[04:26] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:26] <shini`> nomasteryoda: i'm with dapper because i heard there's stability issues with edgy
[04:26] <observer2> thanks again
[04:26] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_newb, You can, but it isn't easy.
[04:26] <mzl1> ubuntu_newb: hoho~~~,good boy!
[04:26] <Vuen_> roach_: lol. ubotu is a robot.
[04:26] <shini`> lol
[04:26] <ThomBrown> any1 know how to make xchat auto log into certian channels?
[04:26] <shini`> i did that the other day i think
[04:26] <roach_> I said I was a n00b, didn't I?  :)
[04:26] <nomasteryoda> shini`, yes... i've seen them but been running edgy for 2 months... along wtihthe ups and downs
[04:26] <zircx> ok time to try this kde-desktop out
[04:26] <roach_> Is it bad manners not to thank a bot??

[04:26] <nomasteryoda> i think its pretty stable now...
[04:26] <immrtl> Vuen_: what were u doing to make this happen?
[04:26] <shini`> oh ok cool
[04:26] <Cataphract> the configure scripts are ignoring $CC -> http://sial.org/pbot/20919
[04:26] <Cataphract> what can I do?
[04:26] <mzl1> Jordan_U: it's not so perfect to run windown app under linux. just use win as a gameplayer is fine.
[04:26] <immrtl> were u rewriting the table?
[04:27] <who_cares> anyone thing restarting gnome could fix my problems?
[04:27] <shini`> i have to copy my files to a safe place first
[04:27] <dakaru> I hate KDE, Gnome just seems to run a lot faster with less crashes.
[04:27] <shini`> to make sure
[04:27] <who_cares> they all seem to focus around gnome
[04:27] <ThomBrown> any1 know how to make xchat auto log into certian channels?
[04:27] <shini`> dakaru: yeah, i've noticed that also -- I also think gnome is prettier
[04:27] <Vuen_> immrtl: i was changing my partition table. i had a 120 gig partition (sda7) and a 60 gig partition (sda8) at the end of the drive
[04:27] <mzl1>  dakaru: fvwm and xfce is much faster.
[04:27] <shini`> dakaru: but there's also xfce, blackbox and fluxbox
[04:27] <Vuen_> i split the 120 gig partition in half, and the middle part became sda9 instead of sda8
[04:27] <dakaru> Fluxbox, is what I had been using for 6 months.
[04:27] <Vuen_> now qtparted is all confused. it won't let me merge the two partitions back together or anything
[04:27] <dakaru> Doing everything in text/terminal got old after a while.
[04:27] <Jordan_U> who_cares, You could try restarting just the panel: killall gnome-panel
[04:28] <unfo> hi all. I use debian. I wonder:
[04:28] <unfo> In Ubuntu, is syntax highlighting on by default in vim, emacs, and xemacs?
[04:28] <immrtl> ?? is there data on either of the partitions?
[04:28] <w00> I've beem using ubuntu since the middle of last week after trying another version of linux. i have debian installed on my other hda. i also have xp and still use windows me on an old machine that i "experiment with". i almost have java installed on my ubuntu machine, i get the java image but it still isn't right. on a chat i was testing it in, my typed words after enter were seen, but not my pre-enter typing. i have the universe multiverse repo added along wi
[04:28] <ThomBrown> any1 know how to make xchat auto log into certian channels?
[04:28] <unfo> ThomBrown, did you check the manual?
[04:28] <unfo> :)
[04:28] <who_cares> could be /join #x?
[04:28] <ThomBrown> :(
[04:28] <nomasteryoda> ThomBrown, its simple
[04:28] <scamboy> !atm
[04:28] <shini`> dakaru: i've found that term is more reliable than guis
[04:28] <Vuen_> immrtl: yes. i've got 110 gigs of data in all. i want to just delete the middle partition and expand the other one to fill it, but it won't let me
[04:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about atm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:28] <Bane> ThomBrown: do it by server
[04:28] <shini`> dakaru: and I do a lot in terminal anyway so I don't mind it lol
[04:28] <ThomBrown> hmm
[04:28] <Bane> theres a perform on connect option
[04:28] <Vuen_> gives me some really cryptic error, some function call fails
[04:29] <shini`> dakaru: but at the moment i do prefer gnome to bb and fb
[04:29] <scamboy> who is zinnix??
[04:29] <who_cares> if I stop gnome, do my windows (like oh say, gaim) go away?
[04:29] <nomasteryoda> lol
[04:29] <scamboy> i mean zennix??
[04:29] <shini`> "stop" gnome?
[04:29] <dakaru> I have my gnome setup to run similar to OSX, same icons, dock and stuff. I love it.
[04:29] <shini`> heh
[04:29] <shini`> :)
[04:29] <Jordan_U> who_cares, Yes, but if you run the command I gave they won't because it only restarts the panel
[04:30] <who_cares> okay
[04:30] <Bane> ok back to NWN 2
[04:30] <unfo> why does #ubuntu+1 redirect here?
[04:30] <bruenig> unfo, because feisty is not really up and running yet
[04:30] <immrtl> Vuen_: maybe i'm just real slow today, but theres something that doesn't seem right; why are you rewriting a partition table that has data on it? you have to clear that data before making a new partition
[04:30] <shini`> fiesty?
[04:30] <shini`> lol
[04:30] <shini`> is that the next version of ubuntu?
[04:30] <Vuen_> immrtl: i don't want to make a new partition, i want to expand a partition
[04:30] <who_cares> hey, I can't start terminal
[04:30] <who_cares> lol
[04:31] <bruenig> feostu fawm
[04:31] <bruenig> feisty fawn*
[04:31] <shini`> lol i love it
[04:31] <shini`> the names are great
[04:31] <unfo> shini`, yes. the development proceeds incessantly, always adding more features and fixing things in people's bug reports.
[04:31] <Jordan_U> who_cares, Does it give an error or just not start?
[04:31] <immrtl> oh then make the sda8 extended partition and sda9 a logical partition
[04:31] <unfo> (your bug reports count!) :-)
[04:31] <who_cares> just doesn't start
=== rheddry is now known as EinZteiN
[04:31] <shini`> i'm going to try to compile this program again
[04:31] <shini`> wish me luck
[04:31] <shini`> lol
[04:31] <devios> best way to install php/perl/mysql/apache2 on edgy?
[04:31] <Vuen_> immrtl: um, there's already an extended partition. the drive's got a bunch of stuff on it
[04:31] <srvDave> good to know unfo
[04:32] <bruenig> shini`, what program is it?
[04:32] <unfo> shini`, look for it at www.apt-get.org
[04:32] <shini`> ardour
[04:32] <Akuma_> when i try to boot the ubuntu cd, i get the first options screen and choose 'boot or install'; but then the computer restarts and comes back to the same screen .. what can i do about that?
[04:32] <wastrel> devios:  probably th lamp howto
[04:32] <shini`> it's only available from source
[04:32] <Vuen_> 30 gig ntfs is primary, then the extended partition has 20 gig ext2, 3 gig swap, and three 60 gig ext2 partitions
[04:32] <wastrel> just add perl
[04:32] <unfo> shini`, did you check multiverse?
[04:32] <scamboy> WHO is zennix guys??? ops??
[04:32] <unfo> oops I mean universe
[04:32] <devios> wastrel: ?
[04:32] <shini`> yes
[04:32] <roach_> on a 6.10 AMD64 Alternate install, do I get to choose btw GRUB and LILO?
[04:32] <wastrel> !lamp
[04:32] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[04:32] <bruenig> !info ardour-gtk
[04:32] <ubotu> ardour-gtk: digital audio workstation (graphical gtk interface). In component universe, is optional. Version 0.99.2-2build1 (edgy), package size 2188 kB, installed size 5992 kB
[04:33] <immrtl> is there a limit to how many logical partitions u can have on an extended one?
[04:33] <bruenig> shini`, is that what you are looking for
[04:33] <Vuen_> immrtl: i don't think so
[04:33] <Flannel> roach_: All Alternate CDs let you choose, you'll want to do the expert setup though
[04:33] <immrtl> are u sure?
[04:33] <observer2> bye
[04:33] <peanutb> shini, try ardour-gtk
[04:33] <shini`> yes
[04:33] <shini`> ok
[04:33] <shini`> thanks
[04:33] <immrtl> Vuen_: hang on let me check
[04:33] <roach_> Flannel: Thanks!
[04:33] <Jordan_U> who_cares, press alt=F2 and run xterm
[04:33] <shini`> might be it
[04:33] <unfo> shini`, that is it.
[04:33] <bruenig> shini`, well look at the description, should be pretty obvious
[04:33] <shini`> thanks unfo  :)
[04:34] <unfo> the credit goes to bruenig.
[04:34] <psusi> anyone know how to smack grip aournd with a large trout to get it to quit converting names for files to all lowercase and substituting _ for space?
[04:34] <Jordan_U> who_cares, I meant alt+F2 :)
[04:34] <shini`> thank you, bruenig
[04:34] <shini`> you saved me a lot of time
[04:34] <unfo> ubuntu has more than 10 thousand packages including universe. you should never need to recompile anything. :)
[04:34] <shini`> trying to compile that was making my computer overheat and shut down :|
[04:35] <shini`> well I checked the official ardour site
[04:35] <scamboy> !zennix
[04:35] <shini`> i guess someone msut've made a deb package
[04:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about zennix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:35] <shini`> which is what i was planning on doing afterwards
[04:35] <who_cares> does copy/paste work with the ctrl+alt+f1 thing?
[04:35] <shini`> lol
[04:35] <peanutb> shini, better get an operaton :)
[04:35] <Jordan_U> psusi, Could you please refrase that, I don't understand your question.
[04:35] <unfo> sadly, the official sites often don't mention that these things are in the ubuntu apt repository.
[04:35] <bimberi> who_cares: no
[04:35] <Vuen_> who_cares: no. copy/paste works with screen though :)
[04:35] <who_cares> but I can't launch terminal in gnome
[04:35] <Vuen_> who_cares: you can get a screen window going in x, paste something in it, then go attach it in tty1
[04:35] <shini`> this one did actually but i didn't see it there... I dunno maybe i didn't update my list or something
[04:35] <roycebarber> huge help you guys love ya!
[04:35] <wastrel> psusi:  check the prefs
[04:36] <bruenig> the sites aren't generally the ones who package for the repos so you can't really blame them
[04:36] <Vuen_> who_cares: try xterm
[04:36] <shini`> must've missed it somehow
[04:36] <unfo> shini`, you may also want to look into software fan and cpu speed control. also, PC stores sell excellent CPU fans and heatsinks. :)
[04:36] <Jordan_U> who_cares, That is why I said press Alt+F2 and run xterm
[04:36] <ThomBrown> guys, i added a second user to my edgy machine . . . when in my original user id, I have no problems reading/writing files, but when in my second user profile (my wife's!) I can't get things to work properly . . . it's slow, and buggy.  One major issue is I can't save OpenOffice docs . . . I go to "save as" and the app freezes
[04:36] <ThomBrown> thoughts?
[04:36] <bimberi> who_cares: does running 'xterm' using alt-F2 work?
[04:36] <who_cares> k
[04:36] <who_cares> xterm
[04:36] <who_cares> one sec
[04:36] <bimberi> argh, sorry Jordan_U, lagging badly here :|
[04:37] <bruenig> you can run xterm from alt f2, then run gnome-terminal and see what kind of error that is spitting out
[04:37] <shini`> now i have to figure out how to use it :|
[04:37] <psusi> wastrel, check for what?  I don't see anything that sounds like it would help
[04:37] <shini`> unfo: this is my laptop :|
[04:37] <who_cares> can't run xterm
[04:37] <who_cares> display isn't set
[04:37] <who_cares> or something like that
[04:37] <shini`> unfo: for this comp i need a cool bay or whatever they're called
[04:37] <shini`> fan bays
[04:37] <psusi> Jordan_U, grip saves the ogg files with the names from the album converted to all lower case and a _ character instead of a space in the name
[04:37] <bruenig> water cooling
[04:37] <Jordan_U> who_cares, Not ctrl+alt+F2, just alt+F2
=== rawr is now known as departed_soul
[04:38] <psusi> so you get my_band/my_song.ogg instead of "My Band\My Song"
[04:38] <ThomBrown> guys, i added a second user to my edgy machine . . . when in my original user id, I have no problems reading/writing files, but when in my second user profile (my wife's!) I can't get things to work properly . . . it's slow, and buggy.  One major issue is I can't save OpenOffice docs . . . I go to "save as" and the app freezes
[04:38] <who_cares> okay
[04:38] <immrtl> who cares have u configured /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[04:38] <unfo> Jordan_U, underscores are the Unix way. that's why so many apps use them by default.
[04:38] <ubuntu_new1> I'm just upgrading this version
[04:38] <immrtl> Vuen_: i can't find an answer, im still looking though
[04:38] <who_cares> it made the alt+f2 box go away
[04:38] <ubuntu_new1> it's downloading the upgrades right now.
[04:38] <Jordan_U> unfo, You replied to the wrong guy :)
[04:38] <who_cares> not sure if it did anything
[04:38] <unfo> oops
[04:38] <BerylMatt_> can someone help me out with Beryl please
[04:38] <Vuen_> immrtl: don't worry about it. i'll probably just move the 110 gigs off to a friend's computer and nuke the whole thing
[04:39] <SAM_theman> Has anyone got their ATI 7000 to work correcty with ubutnu 6.06 not 6.10 ?
[04:39] <shini`> well it's because underscores are easier to read than escaped spaces (\ )
[04:39] <Jordan_U> BerylMatt_, try #ubuntu-xgl
[04:39] <BerylMatt_> I am getting some errors in the terminal with it starts
[04:39] <ubuntu_new1> I'll let you guys know how my upgrade goes...
[04:39] <shini`> :)
[04:39] <Vuen_> it's just really irritation. must be a bug somewhere, but i can't even tell whether it's a bug in the linux kernel or a bug in gparted
[04:39] <who_cares> I got the killall gnome-panel to work
[04:39] <ubuntu_new1> I'm upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10
[04:39] <Vuen_> s/irritation/irritation
[04:39] <immrtl> Vuen_: do as u wish, which partitions can u still access?
[04:39] <ThomBrown> guys, i added a second user to my edgy machine . . . when in my original user id, I have no problems reading/writing files, but when in my second user profile (my wife's!) I can't get things to work properly . . . it's slow, and buggy.  One major issue is I can't save OpenOffice docs . . . I go to "save as" and the app freezes
[04:39] <who_cares> how do I re-start it?
[04:39] <unfo> ubuntu_new1, why?
[04:39] <psusi> not in a gui environment it isn';t
[04:39] <Vuen_> immrtl: i can still access all of them.
[04:39] <bruenig> !repeat
[04:39] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[04:39] <immrtl> have u tried using another disk manager Vuen_?
[04:39] <psusi> I wantthe spaces are much nicer than _s
[04:39] <ubuntu_new1> which sucks because I just downloaded the 6.06 version a few days ago
[04:39] <unfo> ThomBrown, if no luck, try www.ubuntuforums.org :)
[04:39] <ubuntu_new1> I didn't want to have to download a whole new cd
[04:40] <Jordan_U> who_cares, It should have restartedon it's own.
[04:40] <psusi> and the correct capitalization also makes it much more raedable
[04:40] <ubuntu_new1> I just installed ubuntu
[04:40] <ubuntu_new1> it should upgrade ok
[04:40] <ubuntu_new1> I would hope so anyway
[04:40] <who_cares> erm
[04:40] <who_cares> it didn't
[04:40] <bruenig> ubuntu_new1, why didn't you install from the edgy disk?
[04:40] <DeltaF> I'm installing Edgy from CD and would like to use LVM. Am I missing an option or has it really been left out?
[04:40] <who_cares> reboot?
[04:40] <unfo> psusi, underscores are the Unix way. that's why so many apps use them by default. :) I agree they are annoying.
[04:40] <ThomBrown> sorry . . . thought it would be an easy one
[04:40] <livingtm> Hey what is the password for CUPS administration on UBUNTU.. the users password?
[04:40] <ubuntu_new1> don't know
[04:40] <bruenig> livingtm, yes
[04:40] <Vuen_> ubuntu_new1: that's probably a bad idea
[04:40] <Jordan_U> !enter | ubuntu_new1
[04:40] <ubotu> ubuntu_new1: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[04:40] <ubuntu_new1> Just figured upgrading would be ok
[04:40] <livingtm> bruenig, thx
[04:40] <DeltaF> (apologies for contributing to the question traffic...)
[04:41] <ubuntu_new1> huh?
[04:41] <psusi> unfo: yea... but sound juicer doesn't, so it keeps things looking sane... but sound juicder doesn't like this new cd I got today... grip does... but names them all ugly
[04:41] <ubuntu_new1> hitting enter spams the channel?
[04:41] <wastrel> livingtm:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PrintingCupsWebInterface
[04:41] <unfo> ubuntu_new1, every line you type goes to 846 people. that's almost 900 packets per line you type. it's best to be concise. :)
[04:41] <immrtl> Vuen_: have u tried using a different partitioning manager
[04:41] <Jordan_U> Vuen_, Upgrading from a new install shouldn't cause problems, I don't thing the Edgy update is THAT bad
[04:41] <shini`> has anyone ever used jack before?
[04:41] <Arrick> is there a way on ubuntu breezy to view and edit a sqlite db?
=== thev is now known as thevenin_
[04:41] <immrtl> ubuntu_new1: he means using commas instead of hitting enter 40 times
[04:41] <unfo> psusi, so use grip then rename it yourself? :-) I use mmv from renameutils but you can rename it manually too.
[04:41] <pokeypapaw> hello, having some probs with ubuntu recognizing my tv tuner card... the docs I found talking about this tell me to check the card list in my kernal documentation...could someone tell me how to do this?
[04:41] <bruenig> breezy wow, might as well be on warty
[04:41] <Vuen_> immrtl: nope, i've just stuck with parted. should i try partition magic?
[04:42] <Arrick> bruenig, if I want to upgrade I will
[04:42] <wastrel> i have a system still running breezy
[04:42] <wastrel> nothing wrong with breezy

[04:42] <Akuma_> when i try to boot the ubuntu cd, i get the first options screen and choose 'boot or install'; but then the computer restarts and comes back to the same screen .. what can i do about that?
[04:42] <newo> can someone help me
[04:42] <unfo> ubuntu_new1, yes, enter should only be used at the end of a sentence. :-)
[04:42] <newo> how come i can't install rox?

[04:42] <newo> i can't apt-get anything
[04:43] <ubuntu_new1> I'll let you guys know
[04:43] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_new1, If all you care about is bandwidth, the Update takes more to download than the install CD.
[04:43] <who_cares> should I reboot?
[04:43] <ubuntu_new1> if anything I'll just burn edgy
[04:43] <unfo> !enter > ubuntu_new1
[04:43] <peanutb> shini, it just ran after i installed the package.
[04:43] <shini`> peanutb: when i try to run ardour it says there's a problem that possibly jack isn't running
[04:43] <immrtl> is there documentation on recompiling the kernel from the edgy LIVEcd???
[04:43] <Vuen_> alright, i'm gonna try partition magic
[04:43] <Vuen_> bye
[04:43] <shini`> peanutb: weird... when i do a ps aux|grep jackd nothing shows
[04:43] <Vuen_> and thanks immrtl
[04:43] <unfo> immrtl, it is usually a waste of time to recompile a kernel.
[04:43] <immrtl> i didn't want it compiled with CONFIG_AGP=m or agpgart installed
[04:43] <immrtl> i have to
[04:43] <Jordan_U> ubuntu_new1, Ok, run: gksu "update-manager -c" to upgrade

[04:45] <salmon> leaving
[04:45] <shini`> peanutb: my jackd isn't in that directoy...
[04:45] <who_cares> I'll try that then
[04:45] <shini`> peanutb: in fact i don't know where it's located..
[04:45] <immrtl> unfo: the new ATI closed source driver will not use its internal AGP system if agpgart is running as a module or AGPgart is compiled into the kernel
[04:45] <ubuntu_new1> Then I'll just reformat the drive and do a fresh install.

[04:47] <newo> wow, ubuntu is awesome
[04:47] <newo> thanks bruenig :)
[04:47] <mzl1> Riyo:what do you use ? adsl?
[04:47] <peanutb> shini', i just installed it and it worked, i just tried it when i installed audor.
[04:47] <Riyo> I conect to a wireless AP
[04:48] <srvDave> Riyo...Applications/Internet/FireFox
[04:48] <mzl1> Riyo: I use wire . :P
[04:48] <shini`> peanutb: did you have to run jackd or ardour just worked without it?
[04:48] <dakaru> haha yeah, Wireless is hard
[04:48] <Jordan_U> bruenig, For future reference, there is a built in command to add extra repositories: sudo software-properties -e universe
[04:48] <Riyo> -_-
[04:48] <Riyo> I have to be connected
=== Blitzreh is now known as DENI
[04:48] <shini`> peanutb: i'm goingn to try removing jackd and putting it back on
[04:49] <bruenig> Jordan_U, yes, I realize there are other ways. However, that way looks so much more complicated.
[04:49] <livingtm> wastrel, ok, ran through that and it still tells me permission denied. this is a new edgy 64 isntall
[04:49] <who_cares> the reboot worked!
[04:49] <peanutb> shini'., im on amd64, possibly a difference in the packages
[04:49] <Jordan_U> bruenig, Really, I think it is much easier than using sed.
[04:49] <livingtm> wastrel, and it didnt prompt me for a password still (like it did the first time)
[04:49] <who_cares> I even got my Rhythembox back
[04:49] <Riyo> I think I go to administrator then networking? I see 2 option for dial-up and lan
[04:49] <who_cares> :)
[04:49] <bruenig> Jordan_U, yeah I agree with you, I meant my way looks more complicated
[04:49] <ubuntu_new1> I guess I'll just let this upgrade finish
[04:50] <shini`> peanutb: oh... i'm on x86
[04:50] <elsigh> Is this a place to ask about php / imagemagick?
[04:50] <shini`> peanutb: this still isn't working though...
[04:51] <phu> anyone help me with ssh remote command excution problem?
[04:51] <riddlebox> is AGP support built into the default kernel?
[04:51] <peanutb> shini, did you install jackd?
[04:51] <shini`> peanutb: yah i installed it

[04:56] <strabes> is it advisable to install linux-image-686 if i have a centrino processor?
[04:56] <bruenig> pip, what packages do you want to get and are you asking how to upgrade to edgy, it is hard to tell?

[04:59] <Usedpresident> Hey everyone, complete linux noob here, and this might sound ignorant, but can Linux be installed on an external USB drive that already has windows files on it?, Like, can Windows and ubintu coexist on the same hard drive, or do I need another partition?
[05:00] <pip> bruenig, My system is lack of many packages ,I dont want to format my system .And now I am using terminal
[05:00] <bintut> and for weeks of using this ubuntu edgy eft and this is also my first time to encounter this kind of problem, some of my files in my ~/Desktop/ directory have change and very weird..  you can check out the output of my "ls -l" command at http://paste.debian.net/16184
[05:00] <bruenig> Usedpresident, you would need to partition it
[05:00] <bruenig> pip, what is your first language?

[05:01] <pip> bruenig, they are not very professional
[05:02] <pip> bruenig, some skilled questions are hard to get answered there
[05:02] <bruenig> pip, I will try to help. I am not sure what you are asking though
[05:02] <bintut> anyone has visited my paste at http://paste.debian.net/16184 ? has anyone from this channel encountered this similar problem?
[05:02] <bruenig> bintut, HUMAN RIGHTS
[05:03] <pip> bruenig, wait
[05:03] <bruenig> bintut, but to answer your question, assuming you are referring to the ?'s, I have never had that happen
[05:04] <bintut> pip: you want to install the gnome desktop?  if yes, make sure that you have the main, universe, multiverse, updates and security binaries listed in your /etc/apt/sources and do the following commands:  $ sudo -s -H ; apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
[05:04] <aum> grrr!! FFS!!! i updated nvidia-glx, my xorg server wouldn't come up because nvidia-glx is at 8776 but nvidia-kernel-module is still at 8774! had to downgrade nvidia-glx to get my xorg back up
[05:05] <novaterata> how do you mount an iso?
[05:05] <pip> bintut, let me try ,thanks
[05:05] <bintut> bruenig: yes, it's weird. this is my first time to encounter this problem..  all the files that are in CAPITAL LETTERS are all directories..
[05:05] <Vuen> novaterata: sudo mount <iso> <path>
[05:06] <bimberi> !mountiso
[05:06] <ubotu> To mount an ISO disc image, type "sudo mount -o loop my.iso <mountpoint>"  -  bin/cue can be converted to ISO using !bchunk  -  ISO images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com  -  Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before burning
[05:06] <bruenig> bintut, that is an odd naming convention but whatever works for you...
[05:06] <bintut> bruenig: and check this out when i tried to change to the DOWNLOADS directory:
[05:06] <bintut> root@localhost:/home/bintut/Desktop# cd DOWNLOADS
[05:06] <bintut> bash: cd: DOWNLOADS: Permission denied
[05:06] <pip> bruenig, how to restore to the original state with violent ?
[05:07] <pip> bruenig, I mean the system
[05:07] <mluser-home> does anyone happen to know what the correct package name for the ati fglrx drivers is called for edgy?
[05:07] <bruenig> pip, reformat and reinstall is best
[05:07] <tich> how do i burn an iso using gnomebaker?
[05:07] <pip> bruenig, the apt-get does not work
[05:07] <SAM_theman> nope
[05:07] <bruenig> tich, you see the burn image to disk
[05:07] <pip> bruenig, that's the point
[05:07] <bintut> bruenig: i changed the naming convention to emphasize the directories and ordinary files when someone like you read my paste
[05:08] <SAM_theman> mluser-home, I trying to get my ati 7000 fixed
[05:08] <bruenig> pip, use the CD and install again
[05:08] <tich> bruenig, it looks like my options are, data dvd, data cd and audio cd
[05:08] <pip> bruenig, OK
[05:08] <pip> bruenig, I have to do that : )
[05:08] <bruenig> tich, I don't have gnomebaker anymore but I remember there being some option. You should be able to right click on the iso in nautilus and click write to disc
[05:09] <bintut> bruenig: root@localhost:/home/bintut/Desktop# file DOWNLOADS
[05:09] <tich> bruenig, oh i think i see it under tools, thanks.
[05:09] <bintut> DOWNLOADS: ERROR: cannot open `DOWNLOADS' (Permission denied)
[05:09] <bimberi> tich: note that you don't need gnomebaker, just right-click on the iso in nautilus (the file manager) and select Write to Disc
[05:09] <bruenig> localhost, that is a good name for your machine, very creative
[05:10] <tich> bimberi, i have xubuntu so it doesn't use nautilus.
[05:10] <phu> so is there anyway that my remote command will load some profile script before my command excute
[05:10] <bimberi> tich: kk
[05:10] <bruenig> tich, why not use xfburn
[05:11] <bruenig> tich, it says it right in the toolbar, burn image to disk in xfburn
[05:11] <tich> yeah i tried but the program freaked out and didn't do anything.
[05:11] <bintut> anyone here can help me?

[05:30] <Lathiat> PMantis: it may just be the hdd power down stuff
[05:30] <Lathiat> but usually if it goes "click click" etc its a bad hdd
[05:30] <Lathiat> but ti may just do that spinning up and down

[05:39] <TheMoebius> wastrel: yeah, i changed that but it doesn't seem to make any difference
[05:39] <riddlebox> tritium, kopts? do I just enter agp=off in the kernel line?

[05:41] <immrtl> i am using xfce xfwm, are u using gnome?
[05:41] <TheMoebius> yeah
[05:42] <immrtl> hrm, i think you found the menu you were looking for, sounds as tho its a module problem
[05:42] <immrtl> what kind of mouse is it
[05:42] <me|ong> um does anybody know why on a fresh install IPV6 would be used isntead of IPV4?
[05:42] <flipdesk> so, anyone else having USB issues since the Edgy upgrade?
[05:43] <mattyv> Explosif: type ifconfig, do you actually have an IP address? could be a dns issue
[05:43] <me|ong> cuz i can't get a freaking address from my DHCP even though it was workign on another version of linux like a hour before
[05:43] <flipdesk> me|ong: sounds like a dhcp issue
[05:43] <me|ong> no
[05:43] <me|ong> that's the thing
[05:43] <flipdesk> me|ong: your adapter will have an ipv6 address by default
[05:43] <TheMoebius> immrtl: USB. by module do you mean kernel module or something else?
[05:43] <who_cares> my dhcp doesn't work either
[05:43] <me|ong> i was using linux like a hour before and formated and changed to ubuntu
[05:43] <atoumey> thank you ubotu
[05:43] <me|ong> the ip was leased.. and i have a resevation for my MAC
[05:44] <me|ong> it won't use it at all
[05:44] <immrtl> TheMoebius: yes
[05:44] <flipdesk> me|ong: run dhclient, see if you get an IP
[05:44] <who_cares> ah, that's my router's fault
[05:44] <immrtl> TheMoebius: more specifically what kind of mouse
[05:44] <flipdesk> TheMoebius: are you having USB issues too?
[05:45] <me|ong> just dhcpclient as a command?
[05:45] <flipdesk> me|ong: no, dhclient
[05:45] <me|ong> oh sorry  ok give me a minute
[05:45] <me|ong> fyi.. i tried a static mapping and it gave me problems
[05:45] <TheMoebius> immrtl: i don't know - its just a generic USB optical mouse without a brand name on it
[05:45] <flipdesk> might have to run as root
[05:45] <immrtl> flipdesk: his mouse sensitivity wont change with gnome settings
[05:45] <jason> Good evening.
[05:45] <me|ong> k
[05:45] <flipdesk> ah
[05:45] <me|ong> good call

[05:46] <jason> Since I upgraded to Edgy, I can no longer connect to my camera.
[05:46] <immrtl> dont do it gyaresu_coffee
[05:46] <flipdesk> jason: USB?
[05:46] <gyaresu_coffee> immrtl, why?
[05:47] <adam_> how do you execute 2 commands on the same line? <command 1> && <command 2>?
[05:47] <jason> Yes
[05:47] <flipdesk> I can't tell if its USB mass storage problem
[05:47] <flipdesk> or just a USB issue in general
[05:47] <flipdesk> since all of my USB devices are USB mass storage
[05:47] <wastrel> my usb is fine in edgy
[05:47] <adam_> jason: was that yes directed at me?
[05:47] <me|ong> no dhcpoffers
[05:47] <me|ong> :S
[05:47] <wastrel> i didn't upgrade, this was a fresh install
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[05:48] <me|ong> any other ideas?
[05:48] <flipdesk> i just did a fresh install
[05:48] <flipdesk> me|ong: hmm, is this a fresh install?
[05:48] <me|ong> yes
[05:48] <me|ong> i tried edgy like an hour before and it worked
[05:48] <who_cares> adam_: the && thing works
=== gyaresu_coffee is now known as gyaresu
[05:48] <me|ong> except it was laggy as hell
[05:48] <jason> At flipdisk
[05:48] <who_cares> I just tried it
[05:48] <me|ong> so i went back to 6.06
[05:48] <wastrel> i have usb camera that works, usb palm pilot.  haven't tried a mouse yet
[05:48] <gyaresu> immrtl, why?
[05:49] <TheMoebius> flipdesk: i have USB mass storage devices on edgy with no prob
[05:49] <flipdesk> me|ong: rm /var/lib/dhcp3/* and try dhclient again

[05:49] <flipdesk> I'm having the same problem as that guy
[05:49] <ndowens> hey does ubuntu have berrl or something like that, i know it's something to do with the graphics and it maybe spelled beryl or something like that, maybe that is what is messing me up when trying to load the live cd of edgy
[05:49] <adam_> who_cares: it doesn't appear to work in a launcher in a panel.
[05:49] <gyaresu> immrtl, Would you care to be more precise regarding fglx drivers please?
[05:49] <who_cares> not sure about there
[05:49] <flipdesk> ndowens: beryl is not installed by default
[05:49] <immrtl> gyaresu: those instructions can mess you up if you have a 8500 or higher card
[05:49] <who_cares> I tried in terminal
[05:50] <jason> Here's the exact error:
[05:50] <immrtl> gyaresu: did u look at https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.30.3-inst.html
[05:50] <flipdesk> ndowens: so no, beryl is not your problem
[05:50] <gyaresu> immrtl, thank you. i only have an 9200 pro.
[05:50] <jason> An error occurred in the io-library ('Could not claim the USB device'): Could not claim interface 0 (Operation not permitted). Make sure no other program or kernel module (such as sdc2xx, stv680, spca50x) is using the device and you have read/write access to the device.
[05:50] <immrtl> gyaresu: yes that is what im saying, 8500 or HIGHER
[05:50] <jason> This doesn't happen on my other (dapper) machine
[05:50] <flipdesk> well lets see, lsusb doesn't lock up anymore
[05:50] <flipdesk> just doesn't show anything
[05:50] <flipdesk> damn
[05:51] <axisys> how do I get /dev/fb0 installed? w/o this i cant player video w/ mplayer
[05:51] <shoyer> Hi, I'm having an issue with themes in beryl. It works fine, but only the window dressings are themed. The rest of the interface appears to be the un-styled Gnome default.
[05:51] <gyaresu> immrtl, stupid radeon. Do you know of the solution. (i am very experienced with linux/nvidia, just happen to have a spare card in the cupboard)
[05:51] <me|ong> still no DHCPOFFERS receiver
[05:51] <me|ong> :S
[05:51] <ndowens> hmm well there is something that is causing me to have problems, see i see the taskbar/menubar w/o the options, but i have one time seen the options and firefox icon and etc and time, and other times i see the desktop and try to click install but it doesn't come up
[05:51] <flipdesk> shoyer: that isn't a beryl problem
[05:51] <flipdesk> shoyer: beryl is only a window manager
[05:51] <shoyer> what's the problem with then?
[05:51] <gyaresu> immrtl, (thanks for the heads up by the way)
[05:51] <shoyer> emerald?
[05:51] <flipdesk> no
[05:52] <flipdesk> hold on
[05:52] <shoyer> thanks
[05:52] <adam_> who_cares: sry i had to leave really quick
[05:52] <wastrel> try the ati driver for 9200
[05:52] <flipdesk> goto System -> Preferences -> Themes
[05:52] <flipdesk> to set your gnome theme
[05:52] <ndowens> any ideas what would make it load correctly
[05:52] <shoyer> the theme is human
[05:53] <flipdesk> ok
[05:53] <flipdesk> so what's the problem?
[05:53] <me|ong> themes? you're having problems with THEMES?
[05:53] <shoyer> changing that doesn't effect the themes I see
[05:53] <who_cares> is shockwave for firefox not available for amd64 machines?
[05:53] <shoyer> yeah, yeah
[05:53] <ndowens> i have one time seen the ubuntu background, but others it is just the orange color
[05:53] <shoyer> the interface is unthemed, still
[05:53] <adam_> anyone know why ubuntu won't mount my USB mass storage device? it shows up in Device Manager, so i know the comp knows it's there
[05:53] <me|ong> who_cares check their website
[05:53] <bimberi> who_cares: shockwave is not available for linux period.
[05:53] <immrtl> gyaresu: do u care whether or not the ATI driver will use its internal AGPGART support
[05:53] <flipdesk> adam_: you're not the only one
[05:53] <shoyer> everything is the ugly beveled boxes
[05:54] <who_cares> I just downloaded the plugin firefox referred me to
[05:54] <flipdesk> adam_: I joined about 5 minutes ago with the same problem, and you're the 3rd person that's asked that question :-)
[05:54] <who_cares> but it said it doesn't work with 64 bit installs
[05:54] <nehoksan> anyone want to share dogporn?
[05:54] <who_cares> not really
[05:54] <adam_> flipdesk: :) any solutions?
[05:54] <flipdesk> adam_: if you did an upgrade from dapper you might try booting an older kernel, though you'll probably have other issues with that
[05:54] <flipdesk> adam_: its looking like a 2.6.17 issue
[05:54] <flipdesk> adam_: http://www.skepticats.com/linlog/entries/2006/10/Edgy_USB_bug.php
[05:54] <flipdesk> that guy is having the same problem
[05:54] <novaterata> is there a good channel server for discussing WINE
[05:55] <Vuen> yikes
[05:55] <Vuen> my hard drive is a total disaster

[05:55] <ubotu> novaterata: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[05:55] <ndowens> anyone please, i want to try the new ubuntu
[05:55] <gyaresu> immrtl, not familiar with it. seems like allocating some system memory would be good.
[05:55] <me|ong> so nobody has an real idea of ubuntu and anythgin networking then?
[05:55] <ndowens> according to the cd i need 128mb of ram and i do have that as well
[05:55] <me|ong> cuz getting IPV6 shti and not 4 is pretty much pissing me off
[05:55] <novaterata> !wine
[05:55] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[05:55] <Vuen> immrtl: so i'm looking at my drive in partition magic in windows, get this, it says the first ext2 partition is "partition type unknown" and offers to format it. yet with the ext2ifs driver i can browse it just fine in windows.
[05:55] <axisys> how do insall /dev/fb0 <-- framebuffer? mplayer video does not work w/o it
[05:56] <flipdesk> me|ong: did I tell you to rm /var/lib/dhcp3/* ?
[05:56] <novaterata> ok... but no channel off the top of your heads
[05:56] <me|ong> yes
[05:56] <me|ong> it's not DHCP
[05:56] <nehoksan> nobody want to sharE????
[05:56] <me|ong> i statically assigned
[05:56] <flipdesk> i see
[05:56] <me|ong> it didn't work
[05:56] <me|ong> i ONLY get IPV6
[05:56] <flipdesk> can you ping anything on the local network?
[05:56] <me|ong> no
[05:56] <immrtl> Vuen: is it an older version of partition magic? maybe doesnt support ext2 yet?
[05:56] <me|ong> i have 3 machines on this networ all workign liek they always have..
[05:56] <flipdesk> do you have multiple adapters in the system?
[05:56] <immrtl> no that doesn't sound right, it had to support ext2
[05:56] <me|ong> DHCP works, DNS, WINS you name it
[05:56] <flipdesk> do an ipconfig -a
[05:56] <me|ong> it's the ubuntu
[05:56] <ndowens> o and when i load the cd gnome before the ubuntu screen that says loading natilus and stuff then a gnome error pops up saying something couldn';t load so some thinggs like background, themes, taskbars and stuff like that may not work
[05:57] <me|ong> just one
[05:57] <Vuen> immrtl: no, it does have ext2 support, because it shows my root and my other two ext2 partitions as ext2
[05:57] <Jordan_U> Vuen, I'd just use gparted
[05:57] <Vuen> it just shows the one in the middle (sda7) as unknown
[05:57] <Vuen> Jordan_U: tried that, gparted gives some cryptic error
[05:57] <immrtl> Vuen: try doing cfdisk
[05:57] <Vuen> cfdisk?
[05:57] <immrtl> just type cfdisk as root
[05:57] <Vuen> i did fsck on all the filesystems
[05:57] <Vuen> ok
[05:57] <Vuen> i'm in windows right now though :/
[05:57] <Jordan_U> Vuen, Can you pastebin that cryptic error?
[05:58] <me|ong> sudo -s -H = perm root access no need to type sudo each time
[05:58] <Vuen> it's just one line, some function call not working

[06:02] <Vuen> alright, gonna reboot to a livecd
[06:02] <Vuen> here i go
[06:02] <Explosif1> me|ong, no, ath0 is the name of my atheros based wireless device, not ethernet.
[06:02] <me|ong> ahh
[06:03] <me|ong> good to know :)
[06:03] <ndowens> anyone have a clue why gnome isn't loading correctly on the livecd
[06:03] <briguyd> i'm tring to install libsdl-dev and it's not working, saying something about libartsc0-dev, anyone have this problem?
[06:04] <kmaynard> ndowens, no, but you may wanna try the alternate cd...
[06:04] <peanutb> gyaresu, thanks
[06:04] <ndowens> why the alternate cd
[06:04] <flipdesk> so yeah, USB is effectively completely broken, wonderful
[06:04] <ndowens> i just bought this cd b/c i can't downloading something that big on 56k w/o going crazy
[06:05] <Jordan_U> ndowens, Is it giving an error that X failed to load or is it distorted

[06:06] <mitrovarr> I'm having some trouble with the 6.10 installer and GRUB; it wants to install it to hd0, which isn't the booting hard drive, and fails when I tell it to install to sd0, which should be the correct one (sda is the booting drive)
[06:06] <JayFM> Can anyone help me. I'm unable to use the 'sudo' command - it returns an error.
[06:07] <charle97> what's the error?
[06:07] <c0rt3z_> jayFM is your user in the sudoers file?
[06:07] <mitrovarr> is sd0 the proper name for the MBR of sda?
[06:07] <ndowens> Jordan_U: it doesn't give a X error or distorted, when it goes in X and the screen will turn orange for ubuntu desktop or whatever it will show the lil screen for ubuntu that it is loading desktop and taskbar and nautilus and then a error will pop up saying something couldn't be loaded or timed out, and says some things like desktop, taskbars, and backgrounds and themes may not work and it will show the taskbars and i have one time seen the application ic
[06:07] <JayFM> Lol, i don't know. This is off a fresh install
[06:07] <JayFM> So i guess no
[06:08] <briguyd> oh, where should i go with trouble in dapper? i forgot that edgy was no longer "+1"
[06:08] <JayFM> How do i put 'root' in the sudoer's file?

[06:10] <robyns-here> I'm in Australia and we do dates day, month, year
[06:10] <neobonzi> Can someone tell me why when i right click beryl and choose it as my windows manager it doesnt do anything?
[06:10] <Jordan_U> ndowens, Try ctrl+alt+bckspace to restart X, see if it works then, if not, do it agin and try starting the safe gnome session.
[06:10] <charle97> briguyd, how are you attempting to install it?
[06:10] <briguyd> yeah, it says "libsdl1.2-dev: Depends: libartsc0-dev but it is not going to be installed" "E: Broken packages"
[06:10] <briguyd> charle97,  sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev
[06:10] <robyns-here> in php strtotime is month, day, year

[06:11] <Jordan_U> neobonzi, What guide did you follow?
[06:11] <charle97> briguyd, have you tried installing libartsc0-dev?
[06:11] <transgress_> okay so i have a problem... ubuntu is semi locking up on me
[06:11] <RabidDog> what is the freenx repository address for nx?
[06:11] <robyns-here> I want a date entered at 18-03-1975 (that's 18th March) to be converted to timestamp
[06:11] <hot_wheelz> hi guys
[06:11] <RabidDog> freenx*
[06:11] <hot_wheelz> i have a fusion dvico dual digital dvb-t and it won't work in ubuntu
[06:12] <neobonzi> hmm - i tried so many that I can hardly remember - it involved so much file tweaking
[06:12] <ndowens> Jordan_U: my cdrom acts like it is loading something but it takes waaay to long to be, and it is a newer cdrom/cdrw
[06:12] <transgress_> i can't type, but i can move my mouse and do stuff with it... i can watch movies that are started and such, but i can't shutdown or suspend or hibernate or anything so i have to hard reboot
[06:12] <hot_wheelz> its not detected by the mythtv-setup program
[06:12] <transgress_> anyone else having that problem?
[06:12] <briguyd> charle97, yeah, and it doesnt work
[06:12] <mitrovarr> Can anyone help?  I can't get the bootloader installed for 6.10.  It wants to write to hd0 by default, but that's not the right drive, it needs to write to the MBR of sda.  But when I tell it to write to sd0, it just has a fatal error and crashes.  Anyone know what to do?
[06:12] <neobonzi> im using edgy /w x1400 ati graphics card on a lptop
[06:12] <hot_wheelz> but we have another winfast dtv1000t which IS being detected and can scan channels OK
[06:12] <charle97> briguyd, do you have all the repositories enabled?
[06:12] <robyns-here> neobonzi, I want a date entered at 18-03-1975 (that's 18th March) to be converted to timestamp
[06:13] <hot_wheelz> any ideas
[06:13] <c0rt3z_> exit

[06:13] <ndowens> Jordan_U: what if it isn't the cd
[06:13] <adam_> i'm trying to get my WiFi working but looking at the Ubuntu WiFi Documentation is just confusing me. can anyone help? My WiFi Card shows up in Device Manager, but not in Networking

[06:14] <briguyd> which in turn complains about the version of libglib2.0 thats installed
[06:14] <transgress_> anyone have their keyboard suddenly stop working?
[06:14] <charle97> briguyd, hmmm
[06:14] <riddlebox> how can I tell if I have  a 64bit cpu?
[06:14] <ndowens> Jordan_U: i tried another distro and it used beryl and some other graphic enhanced stuff and it gave me the same problem
[06:14] <neobonzi> Jordan_U, I'm using edgy with x1400 graphics card - could i have configured somethiing wrong?
[06:14] <Jordan_U> ndowens, Then I don't know what it is, I had a similar problem once though when my hardware clock broke.
[06:14] <adam_> transgress_: i've had my mouse stop working when switching users
[06:14] <transgress_> nah my mouse still works
[06:14] <transgress_> and programs won't start but running ones work like normal
[06:14] <ndowens> Jordan_U: and said it is a issue with ATI in the other distro
[06:15] <adam_> transgress_: what r u doing when it stops working?
[06:15] <transgress_> different stuff
[06:15] <RabidDog> is there a edgy repository for freenx?
[06:15] <transgress_> i was just using my browser
[06:15] <briguyd> when i try to do sudo apt-get update, it says that there was an error with the "packages.freecontrib.org" repo
[06:15] <transgress_> sometimes i'm watching movies
[06:15] <charle97> briguyd, maybe wait for that repo to come back
[06:15] <briguyd> its been saying that for a few weeks now
[06:15] <charle97> oh
[06:16] <briguyd> should i disable it?
[06:16] <neobonzi> does anyone know why when i right click the beryl icon and select it as the window manager, it simply refereshes my screen and does nothing?
[06:16] <charle97> maybe they changed
[06:16] <ndowens> i seen a ubuntuforum and some person sounds like they had the same problem, and he said noapic nolapic and acpi=off worked, i tried noapic and pci=noacpi and once acpi=off
[06:16] <mitrovarr> Where should I put the bootloader for a linux/windows system where windows xp is already installed?
[06:16] <adam_> transgress_: a bad connection maybe? i don't know. i'm not one of the experts in this IRC channel :(

Can someone here please tell me how to find out where on my original HDD is the original root so that I can mount it and chroot
[06:23] <jStefan> How could i diagnose nautilus eating over 90% of my CPU constantly (for over 5 minutes) ?
[06:23] <mitrovarr> jStefan:  Could the drive you were reading be PIO instead of DMA?
[06:23] <max_> can anyone help me with installing a bootsplash screen
[06:23] <mitrovarr> jStefan:  I had a cdrom that was in PIO mode doing that exact thing every time I tried to use it.
[06:23] <jStefan> mitrovarr, wasn't reading any drives
[06:24] <mitrovarr> jStefan:  Guess not then.

[06:24] <JayFM> Hey, can someone please help me. I need help with installing, and using ndiswrapper.
[06:24] <Jordan_U> river, Sure, in the LiveCD find out which partition is formatted Ext3, and that should be the root of your HDD install.
[06:24] <mitrovarr> How does running the 64-bit version of ubuntu compare to the 32-bit?
[06:25] <efrancolaporte> i need help i cant download any file from the video result "lost in translation" from FrostWire

[06:26] <ChrisNiemy> seems that this bug is not solved
[06:26] <skelter> can anyone tell me how to use a .debdiff file to patch stuff?
[06:26] <RabidDog> is there a edgy repository for freenx?
[06:26] <jessie> hello

[06:27] <JayFM> Can someone please help me connect to a WPA-PSK (TKIP) encrypted network? I have a Netgear Wireless PCI adapter (WG311T)
[06:27] <Jordan_U> river, Gparted
[06:27] <surfaceao> JayFM: check with wifi-radar
[06:27] <Arepie> hello.. should i install swat?? i can't open up my windows network folder..
[06:27] <bordy> I am evidently getting an error with X that makes my firefox and flock close?
[06:27] <river> Jordan_U , checking
[06:28] <jessie> Arepie, no i believe its SBM or something like that. also how are you trying to open the folder?
[06:28] <briguyd> why cant i join #ubuntu+1?
[06:28] <jStefan> How could I diagnose nautilus eating over 90% of my CPU constantly (several minutes now) ?
[06:28] <bordy> yeah, "The program Gecko received an X window system error"
[06:28] <RabidDog> dammit
[06:28] <JayFM> What's wifi-radar?
[06:29] <crimsun> briguyd: because feisty's not open yet.
[06:29] <Jordan_U> briguyd, It doesn't exist yet, Feisty isn't much of anything yet.
[06:29] <jessie> briguyd, maybe password protected or it doesn't exest
[06:29] <_deb_> ! feisty
[06:29] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu will be codename Feisty Fawn it should be released in April 2007 and so have the release name 7.04. Until released it is beta. Today it is not even alpha. ;-)
[06:29] <Lone> hahahaha feisty fawn
[06:29] <jessie> good one, ubotu
[06:29] <briguyd> upgrading to edgy, wish me luck
[06:29] <RabidDog> feisty fan needs load balancing dual wan network support :p
[06:29] <Lone> lol have fun
[06:29] <jessie> briguyd, i like edgy
[06:29] <RabidDog> fawn*
[06:29] <Lone> i don't like upgrading to edgy
[06:29] <RabidDog> jessie I hate edgy right now
[06:29] <bordy> Anyone happen to know anything about an X Window Error in Gecko? I have no clue what that means
[06:30] <briguyd> me too, i got it on one machine, and the upgrade was painful
[06:30] <jessie> RabidDog, whys this?
[06:30] <adam_> max_ the way i changed the splash was i modified /var/lib/gconf/debian.defaults/%gconf-tree.xml. just use the command sudo nano /var/lib/gconf/debian.defaults/%gconf-tree.xml and change the line <stringvalue>splash/ubuntu-splash.png</stringvalue> to one of your own. just put your own splashes in /usr/share/pixmaps/splash/ and change that line and your done
[06:30] <RabidDog> because I can't find the correct repository for freenx
[06:30] <Arepie> jessie: im trying to open up folder from shared windows network.. but when i open up network server, it shows nothing in my windows network
[06:30] <jessie> RabidDog, whats freenx do?
[06:30] <jessie> Arepie, are you connected?
[06:30] <RabidDog> allows me remote desktop in from my winblows box
[06:31] <Jordan_U> JayFM, Do you get that error with any package?
[06:31] <ChrisNiemy> anyone can plac flac audio with amrok + xine +edgy ??
[06:31] <adam_> max_ that changes the splash for all users though. i never found out how to do it for just me
[06:31] <JayFM> Can some one help me? I don't know what ubuntu package i'm running... Eg. edgy, feisty, and so on.
[06:31] <RabidDog> I need the new repository so I can upgrade NX so it will work again
[06:31] <crimsun> ChrisNiemy: you need libxine-extracodecs from multiverse (and universe)
[06:31] <JayFM> I don't know.
[06:31] <mitrovarr> JayFM: wpasupplicant is supposed to be able to handle WPA-PSK
[06:31] <jessie> RabidDog, you can you Putty, or something like that cant you? or maybe that's just terminal, not sure
[06:31] <JayFM> I don't know how to use/install/get it though.
[06:31] <RabidDog> putty is terminal
[06:31] <crimsun> JayFM: lsb_release -r
[06:31] <ChrisNiemy> crimsun: already installed. I'm guessing there was a problem with flac and the xinelibs at dapper
[06:32] <crimsun> ChrisNiemy: yes
[06:32] <jessie> JayFM, use sudo apt-get install packagename
[06:32] <JayFM> Release:        5.10
[06:32] <jessie> RabidDog, i see.
[06:32] <ChrisNiemy> crimsun: can you play flac files?
[06:32] <adam_> max_ g2g in case you missed it, your answers higher up /\ /\ /\
[06:32] <JayFM> Jessie: That doesn't work It returns an error.
[06:32] <crimsun> ChrisNiemy: yes.
[06:32] <JayFM> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30367/
[06:33] <crimsun> JayFM: that's breezy.
[06:33] <kamui> !newsreader
[06:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about newsreader - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:33] <JayFM> Yay, i know what package i'm running. Lol
[06:33] <jessie> jayfm, you got me. have you tried synaptic from system--->Synaptic Package Manager
[06:33] <Jordan_U> JayFM, Can you pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[06:33] <Arepie> jessie: yes im connected
[06:33] <JayFM> Sure, hold on.
[06:33] <ChrisNiemy> crimsun: ok, thanks for the feedback, than it seems a problem at my system. so that I'm sure it is not the bug from dapper anymore
[06:34] <crimsun> JayFM: it's not "package" but "Ubuntu release"
[06:34] <kamui> anyone have a recommendation of a good newsreader?  Im looking for integrated multimedia support, binary sorting, possibly binary decoding too...
[06:34] <JayFM> Okay, thankyou :)
[06:34] <JayFM> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30369/
[06:35] <JayFM> So Jordan_U... What have i stumped you with?
[06:35] <briguyd> so is this the channel for both dapper and edgy?
[06:35] <tom{}bigTC> how do you fix error 22 problem by grab
[06:35] <JDStone> briguyd: it's for ubuntu
[06:35] <JDStone> hoary, brezzy, dapper, edgy
[06:36] <mitrovarr> JayFM:  That's pretty strange that you can't get it because the exact command you linked to worked for me (well it was already installed, but otherwise would have.)
[06:36] <crimsun> no longer hoary
[06:36] <Jordan_U> JayFM, There is your problem, your sources.list is entirely commented out :) I'll fix the pastebin.
[06:36] <JDStone> oh
[06:36] <Masqu1> Hello
[06:36] <JDStone> hello mas
[06:36] <JDStone> hello Masqu1
[06:36] <briguyd> oh, so its for everything that's currently being supported?
[06:36] <JayFM> So what does that do?
[06:36] <compudaze> its for ubuntu
[06:36] <mitrovarr> so, does anyone know why grub-install would fail to write to a drive?
[06:37] <tom{}bigTC> I tried playing installing gentoo now I can get xp or ubuntu to work , I get error 22
[06:37] <Jordan_U> JayFM, It tells Ubuntu where to get applications from on the internet.
[06:37] <compudaze> mitrovarr: what was the 'grub'install' line that failed?
[06:37] <jessie> Arepie, you need Samba, try searching the packages for Samba.
[06:37] <Masqu1> I just installed --"i think " Azereus --it worked 1 time --now i cant find and icon or where it went
[06:37] <JayFM> Ah... I figured :) Just took a bit of reading.
[06:37] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I wasn't running the command directly, but using it as part of the ubuntu installer, so I don't know unfortunately.
[06:37] <JayFM> Thanks, so are you showing me what to uncomment?
[06:38] <compudaze> did it at all ask you where you wanted to install grub?
[06:38] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  it just reported a 'fatal error' and didn't write the bootloader
[06:38] <bordy> !paste-bin
[06:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about paste-bin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:38] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I was attempting to write to 'sd0' which I assumed was the MBR of sda... should I do hd1 instead?
[06:38] <JayFM> !pastebin
[06:38] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[06:38] <compudaze> sd0?
[06:38] <bordy> thanks jay
[06:39] <JayFM> ;] 
[06:39] <compudaze> sda maybe?
[06:39] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  Drive is sda
[06:39] <Vuen> this is very curious.
[06:39] <compudaze> should write to sda, not sda1
[06:39] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  hd0 is hda, which is the wrong drive to write it too
[06:39] <Masqu1> BTW Im very very new to ubunto or any linux for that matter
[06:39] <compudaze> which should be (hd0)
[06:39] <Vuen> i'm using an edgy livecd instead of a dapper livecd to fix my partition table, and it's not mixing up the drive letters.
[06:39] <bordy> Anyone have time to help me with something i have absolutely no clue how to fix? X Window Errors in Gecko? All I know is it means I can't open firefox or Flock...
[06:39] <Vuen> must have been a bug in the linux kernel that they've fixed
[06:39] <Vuen> that's pretty awesome
[06:40] <Jordan_U> JayFM, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30370/ run: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and replace what is there with my correction from pastebin
[06:40] <jessie> Vuen, which bug for what?
[06:40] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I have a PATA drive (hda) and a SATA drive (sda).  It needs to write to the mbr of sda, but hd0 writes to the mbr of hda and sd0 fails.
[06:40] <Vuen> jessie: the kernel in dapper was mixing up sda8 and sda9
[06:40] <Vuen> it was screwing with parted
[06:40] <compudaze> i c
[06:40] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  it just occured to me that maybe I should try hd1, so I'll do that next
[06:40] <jessie> i see. sounds good
[06:40] <compudaze> whichever is the first drive in your system
[06:40] <Arepie> jessie: i guess samba was installed?? in edgy it should have been installed rite?
[06:40] <Vuen> i like edgy more and more every day
[06:40] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  technically hda is the first drive but it's set to boot off sda
[06:41] <compudaze> is the sata drive bootable in your bios?
[06:41] <compudaze> ok
[06:41] <jessie> i dont know, Vuen, does edgy already have samba?
[06:41] <blazemonger> anyone here know how to make a custom linux distro?
[06:41] <Vuen> jessie: hold on, i'm on an edgy livecd, i'll check
[06:41] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  the hda is the secondary master.  I think the sda is the tertiary master
[06:41] <river> Jordan_U, ok I think I have the right device /dev/hda1 , can you help with the mount command and do I need to mount anything else before I chroot ?
[06:42] <Vuen> jessie: nope.
[06:42] <jessie> i see, vuen. i love edgy too! its very nice. quick. stable. etc.
[06:42] <Vuen> it's easy enough to install though, sudo apt-get install samba
[06:42] <charle97> blazemonger, http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/
[06:42] <compudaze> when it asks you, tell it; /dev/sda
[06:42] <hanasaki> i am trying to add a disk to an array with mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/hdc2   and getting the msg the device is busy.  it is not liisted in lsof /// /dev/hdc2 that is
[06:42] <compudaze> if that fails u can try hd0
[06:42] <blazemonger> charle97: how hard is it?
[06:42] <charle97> don't know
[06:43] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I tried hd0 the first time... it wrote to the mbr of hda, no good.
[06:43] <blazemonger> i'm trying to be conservative about what packages i install in ubuntu i dont want to mess anything up
[06:43] <jessie> ok, vuen. arepie, do sudo apt-get install samba to have it work (in the terminal)
[06:43] <Masqu1> so can anyone tell me where installed apps go ??? please thanks
[06:43] <charle97> i just started fiddling with slackware
[06:43] <Jordan_U> river, To mount run: mkdir /chrootInstall && sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /chrootInstall
[06:43] <blazemonger> slackware's good too chalcedony
[06:43] <immrtl> how do i change the C compiler default output name? is it an AC_ variable?
[06:43] <jessie> Masqu1, depends of the software
[06:43] <blazemonger> charle97 i mean
[06:43] <compudaze> it copies the data fine during the install?
[06:43] <blazemonger> it's neat how there's multimedia live cd distros out now
[06:43] <Vuen> Arepie: you should be able to do it in synaptic or adept. look for a package called Samba, and install that
[06:43] <Masqu1> ubuntu jessie
[06:43] <charle97> blazemonger, you don't need to be conservative with ubuntu
[06:43] <JayFM> Jordan_U: What's the filename for Wpa supplicant?
=== G-net|Gilnim is now known as Gilnim
[06:44] <blazemonger> charle97: i'm a linux newbie
[06:44] <jessie> no, the apps masqu1, must not have been specific enough
[06:44] <JayFM> like: 'sudo apt-get install *******'
[06:44] <charle97> blazemonger, messing things up is how you learn linux
[06:44] <jessie> sorry masqu1
[06:44] <JayFM> What's *******?
[06:44] <Vuen> JayFM: apt-cache search wpa
[06:44] <blazemonger> i wanted to start experimenting with programming and midi sequencing
[06:44] <jessie> charle97, couldn't agree more
[06:44] <Jordan_U> Maqu1, there are shortcuts in your gnome menu, run: whereis <commandname> to find where the binary and other usefull files are.
[06:45] <mitrovarr> jayfm:  it's just wpasupplicant, at least for 6.06
[06:45] <compudaze> mitrovarr: make sure it's (sd0)
[06:45] <blazemonger> i'm watching the age of spiritual machines like embedding computers in the brain
[06:45] <compudaze> with the ()'s
[06:45] <JayFM> :S I don't have 6.
[06:45] <JayFM> 6.06*
[06:45] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I was careful about that before
[06:45] <Jordan_U> JayFM, wpasupplicant , you had the command correct the first time
[06:45] <compudaze> then i dunoi
[06:45] <Masqu1> as I said i installed that bittorent app Azer?? something --and it worked 1 time --now i cant find an icon to start it also i installed the ntfs partiotioner thing --no clue where to find it
[06:45] <patric> hi
[06:45] <Hatty> I just recently upgraded to edgy. I tried to set up a crontab (crontab -e) "1 00 00 * * 0 ~/backup" but it complains "Bad day-of-month".. why?
[06:45] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  it's ok, I'm pretty sure it's hd1
[06:46] <charle97> blazemonger, you have to be really sick in the head to build a distro from scratch
[06:46] <immrtl> mitrovarr: to grub sd0 and hd0 are the same, it doesn't identify like that
[06:46] <Lam_> how do i disable single-user-mode from booting into root on GRUB?
[06:46] <jessie> arepie, did you get my last response?
[06:46] <Jordan_U> JayFM, You just need to run: sudo apt-get update for it to work.
[06:46] <blazemonger> immrtl: i am sick in the head actually.i'm mildly autistic
[06:46] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  would it make sda hd1, if hda was hd0?
[06:46] <blazemonger> i just need a mentor to guide me in the right direction
[06:46] <immrtl> blazemonger: u must be talking to charle97, because i didn't say anything to you
[06:46] <compudaze> mitrovarr: very well could be
[06:46] <blazemonger> and i'm heavily interested in nanotechnology
[06:46] <blazemonger> yup immrtl
[06:47] <charle97> blazemonger, sorry i can't be one
[06:47] <immrtl> yes it would mitrovarr
[06:47] <blazemonger> would anyone here like to be a mentor?
[06:47] <jessie> blazemonger, i would, but i don't know enuf
[06:47] <blazemonger> that has a knowledge of coding and mathematics..i just don't want to pay to go to college when we have the internet
[06:47] <charle97> blazemonger, ask shuttleworth
[06:47] <immrtl> or what u should do is it would make it sd1 since u already have hd0 mitrovarr
[06:47] <charle97> blazemonger, he's smart and sick in the head
[06:48] <blazemonger> charle97:I want to gain enough knowledge to contribute to the studio softwware
[06:48] <blazemonger> is he autistic?
[06:48] <JayFM> Oh yay. It's working :)
[06:48] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  I'll try sd1 if hd1 doesn't work (hda is the only pata drive so there's no hdb)
[06:48] <charle97> blazemonger, no
[06:48] <JayFM> Thanks so much, people :)
[06:48] <Hatty> I just recently upgraded to edgy. I tried to set up a crontab (crontab -e) "1 00 00 * * 0 ~/backup" but it complains "Bad day-of-month".. why? Also, no matter what I enter as Day-Of-Month, whether it be * or 31, it STILL fails =/
[06:48] <charle97> blazemonger, i don't think so
[06:48] <blazemonger> i have all the time in the world right now and disabled so i figured i'd use the time i have for contributing things
[06:48] <immrtl> heh ok mitrovarr it doesn't work like that
[06:49] <immrtl> mitrovarr:  you are talking of two diff hd's correct?
[06:49] <Jordan_U> river, Did you get that chroot working?
[06:49] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  right, there's a pata drive on hda and a sata drive on sda
[06:49] <Vuen> ugh
[06:49] <immrtl> see grub doesn't see the mounts like /dev/hda and /dev/sda
[06:49] <river> Jordan_U , just checking what was actually mounted
[06:49] <Vuen> qtparted just crashed
[06:49] <Vuen> this does not bode well
[06:49] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  <nods> i realize that now, I just didn't know it before
[06:50] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  I'm sure that it's making hda hd0 and sda hd1
[06:50] <jessie>  no, vuen it doesn't. you might have no data left!!! or you may luck out
[06:50] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  Which would make sense since hda is the secondary ide channel, and sda is the third.
[06:50] <compudaze> Hatty: u have day of month as 00
[06:50] <river> the /dev/hda1 only had a couple of user home dirs and lost and found...
[06:50] <tag> anyone use their cell phone for GPRS data?
[06:50] <tag> with ubuntu
[06:50] <immrtl> yes it might auto-recognize that your 2nd is SATA, but it does support grub-install sd1
[06:50] <tag> or any other fucking linux
[06:50] <Poseidon> How can I realize 3D destop in ubuntu 6.10
[06:50] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  sda is the boot drive because I've switched them
[06:51] <immrtl> sda is not an ide channel
[06:51] <immrtl> its an SATA channel
[06:51] <Jordan_U> !beryl | Poseidon
[06:51] <ubotu> Poseidon: beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[06:51] <Vuen> Poseidon: try in #ubuntu-xgl
[06:51] <jessie> hey, actually has anybody gotten a pocket pc to sync with edgy?
[06:51] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  I was trying to write to sd0, though.. which wouldn't have worked, right?
[06:51] <compudaze> Poseidon: what video card do you have?
[06:51] <river> Jordan_U , the /dev/hda1 only seemed to have a couple of users home dirs including mine and lost & found so does not look like the original root...shouldn't I expect full tree including original /etc
[06:51] <Hatty> compudaze: I ran crontab -e and the first column was #. I looked in /etc/crontab and it used 7 columns as well
[06:52] <Hatty> compudaze: Works now. Thanke
[06:52] <Hatty> thanks
[06:52] <compudaze> Hatty: it's "min hour dayofmonth month dayofweek"
[06:52] <compudaze> np
[06:53] <Jordan_U> river, Yes, you should see more, was there more than 1 ext3 partition?
[06:53] <immrtl> thing is mitrovarr, you can only have 1 partition on a HD that can be flagged bootable, and with 2 hd's whichever one u have set to boot, as u say sda, u should write the grub-install to sda
[06:53] <tag> how do I disable LCP?
[06:53] <jessie> dammit!!! my w32codecs got 90% done and then failed!!!
[06:53] <Hatty> compudaze: crontab -e opened a nano with "# m h  dom mon dow   command
[06:53] <compudaze> jessie: try again =)
[06:53] <mitrovarr> immrtl:  I'm trying to
[06:53] <jessie> downloading that is
[06:53] <river> Jordan_U, yes, I have unmounted /dev/hda1 and mounted /dev/hdb1 instead .. that has GRUB , vmlinuz* some others, also does not look right
[06:53] <blazemonger> jessie: so shuttleworth is not in his right mind either?
[06:53] <compudaze> Hatty: right
[06:54] <Hatty> compudaze: Why the extra # column if Im not supposed to use it?
[06:54] <compudaze> Hatty: add your line below it following the same syntax
[06:54] <maxxism> is anyone aware of a kickass torrent client for linux similar in features to utorrent on windows?
[06:54] <jessie> thanks compudaze, but i don't have the time right now. it's 5 til 11!!
[06:54] <Jordan_U> river, Any more? :)
[06:54] <jessie> hey, actually has anybody gotten a pocket pc to sync with edgy?
[06:54] <compudaze> Hatty: the # is a comment line just telling you how to format a cron entry
[06:54] <Hatty> ..
[06:54] <Hatty> Heh
[06:54] <Vuen> maxxism: azureus
[06:54] <maxxism> I am using utorrent under wine.  but it seems a little buggared.
[06:54] <Hatty> I feel embarrased
[06:55] <maxxism> without the azureus bloat?
[06:55] <charle97> blazemonger, aren't you talking to me not jessie?
[06:55] <Hatty> maxxism: qtorrent is kind of decent
[06:55] <immrtl> mitrovarr: in other words /boot/grub.conf can only use names like hd0, hd1, so on, the command grub-install can use names like hd0, OR it can use regular HDA names
[06:55] <immrtl> the actual install to MBR command CAN use regular device filenames
[06:55] <river> Jordan_U, yes I also have /dev/hdb2 but that is an "extended" not ext3 and also /dev/hdb5 "unknown" with flags lvm
[06:56] <maxxism> Hatty:  thanx i will check it
[06:56] <jessie> sorry blazemonger, i cant mentor u, and i dont know shuttleworth
[06:56] <immrtl> brb
[06:56] <compudaze> maxxism: why not azureus?
[06:56] <jessie> i just don't know enough
[06:56] <mitrovarr> immrtl: ah
[06:56] <Hatty> maxxism: Im not sure if you can select specefic files in the torrent to download. I havent looked around in it yet but you probably can
[06:56] <jessie> while im turning in
[06:57] <Poseidon> compudaze,my video card is Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950,is it available??
[06:57] <Jordan_U> river, Did the one with vmlinux and grub have /etc and stuff like that also? the files you mentioned are common in the root directory.
[06:57] <maxxism> compudaze  I find azureus a bit bloated
[06:57] <compudaze> maxxism: if you're up for it, torrentflux is a nice web-based replacement, but u need to setup a webserver with php/mysql
[06:57] <river> Jordan_U, the only dir was GRUB
[06:58] <maxxism> I am even considering something command line.   but I really like the IP filtering of uTorrent.
[06:58] <Jordan_U> river, never mind then :)
[06:58] <maxxism> also the encrypted torrents is nice.  my ISP used traffic shaping software.
[06:58] <river> Jordan_U, should I try and mount the "extended" ? if so as what type ?
[06:59] <Hatty> maxxism: "traffic shaping"? As in monitoring?
[06:59] <maxxism> i think azureus is the best linux bet.
[07:00] <Jordan_U> river, I actually don't know pretty much anything about extended partitions, I have Ubuntu installed on my a mac where there is no need of them :)
[07:00] <tag> Now I get "No network protocols running" back from the phone
[07:00] <maxxism> Hatty:  traffic shaping looks at internet traffic and gives more speed to stuff like http   and less to P2P ports.
[07:01] <Hatty> ah
[07:01] <mitrovarr> this is a totally off-topic question, but how safe is linux to install on a laptop?  Any chance of frying hardware?
[07:01] <Hatty> bandwidth filtering
[07:01] <maxxism> alot of ISP's are starting to use it
[07:01] <blazemonger> who would like to be a linux mentor?
[07:01] <immrtl> maxxism: its called throttling
[07:01] <SpaceFrog> hey guys
[07:01] <maxxism> mitrovarr it runs awesome on laptops.
[07:01] <Poseidon> s Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 available for 3d desktop??? is there somebody who can told me
[07:01] <river> Jordan _U, is there any way then I can try and boot of the original (failing install) and get it to list where it is booting from ? some boot option ?
[07:01] <crimsun> blazemonger: we have an Ubuntu mentor system. Ask in #ubuntu-motu.
[07:01] <SpaceFrog> I've just upgraded to 6.10, and i've noticed a heap of problems.. My sound isn't working at all, and it's very sluggish
[07:01] <Jordan_U> mitrovarr, perfectly safe :)
[07:01] <mitrovarr> maxxism:  I know it does *most* of the time, but is there any chance of it killing one?  I'd risk it myself, but this is advice for someone else.
[07:01] <maxxism> imrtl:  whatever.  tech name is traffic shaping.
[07:01] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat
[07:02] <Jordan_U> mitrovarr, Absolute worst that can happen is you will need to reformat your drive.
[07:02] <Pensacola> why doesn't my end button go to the end of the page in firefox?
[07:02] <immrtl> is that the tech name? haha
[07:02] <mitrovarr> Jordan_U:  Good to know.  I lost a CD burner to it a while ago.
[07:02] <maxxism> mitrovarr:  I run it fine on mine.
[07:02] <jarrad> SpaceFrog: Did you have no problems with dapper?
[07:03] <Jordan_U> mitrovarr, If their fans arent controlled by the BIOS ( like on powerbooks ) it could overheat.
[07:03] <mitrovarr> Jordan_U:  I can't guarantee it was linux, but I tried to burn a CD with it in k3b and it never burned anything again.  Worked in windows before that, and that was the first try.
[07:03] <Hatty> K. Oddball question here. I installed tuxguitar, tuxguitar-alsa, and (apparantly) libswt3.1-gtk-java. Now, if i do apt-get install azureus, it tries to remove those packages because "they were automatically installed and are no longer needed." Why?
[07:03] <mitrovarr> Jordan_U:  I'll keep that in mind, thanks
[07:04] <Squeee> Is anyone here running or know someone that runs beryl with 2 monitors with an ati video card?
[07:04] <Jordan_U> Hatty, It doesn't try to remove them, it is just informing you that no other packages depend on them.
[07:05] <Hatty> Jordan_U: when i do apt-get install azureus, it says it will remove them
[07:05] <mitrovarr> Grub installed properly to (hd1).  Thanks everyone
[07:05] <SpaceFrog> jarrad: yep, everything was fine with dapper
[07:05] <Jordan_U> Hatty, really? can you pastebin the output?
[07:05] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: then I recommend reinstalling Dapper.
[07:05] <SpaceFrog> oh,
[07:05] <charle97> spacefrog, clean install edgy
[07:05] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: in any case, we're supporting Dapper far longer than we're supporting Edgy.
[07:06] <SpaceFrog> heh, i guess i should have downloaded an edgy iso
[07:06] <SpaceFrog> it took me 5 hours to upgrade using the upgrade manager
[07:06] <SpaceFrog> oh well
[07:06] <rredd4> is it possible to install the macromedia player plugin for firefox?
[07:06] <charle97> you can download an edgy iso faster than 5 hours
[07:06] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: I can assist you with sound, but I need an answer to the question I asked.
[07:07] <Jordan_U> rredd4, Flash?
[07:07] <mitrovarr> rredd4:  Flash player, yes.  Shockwave, no.
[07:07] <SpaceFrog> crimsun: I ran that command
[07:07] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: and what was the output?
[07:07] <charle97> rreddd, yes
[07:07] <SpaceFrog> Mixers:
[07:07] <SpaceFrog> 0: CMedia PCI
[07:07] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: and ``cat /proc/asound/modules'' ?
[07:07] <SpaceFrog> That's my CMedia soundcard
[07:07] <Hatty> Jordan_U: http://pastebin.ca/241464
[07:07] <SpaceFrog> crimsun:  0 snd_cmipci
[07:07] <rredd4> is macromedia the same a adobe flash player?
[07:07] <Squeee> adobe bought macromedia
[07:07] <SpaceFrog> rredd4: adobe own macromedia now
[07:08] <SpaceFrog> so adobe flash player is the newest version
[07:08] <rredd4> ok
[07:08] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: ``amixer'' (use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org )
[07:08] <SpaceFrog> crimsun: ok, one moment
[07:08] <blazemonger> so there's no need to be conservative with installing packages in ubuntu?
[07:08] <Pensacola> why doesn't my end button go to the end of the page in firefox?
[07:08] <blazemonger> i just want to have all of the dev stuff i need for compiling sources from freshmeat.net
[07:09] <Jordan_U> Hatty, That is bizzare, does it do that with other packages also?
[07:09] <mitrovarr> Ok, new problem; GRUB installed properly, but when I try to boot linux, it gives me "Error 21:  Selected disk does not exist
[07:09] <immrtl> Pensacola: what end button? the keyboard one
[07:09] <SpaceFrog> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30374/
[07:09] <river> Jordan_U, I booted from my HDD (not liveCD) to the grub menu and editing the grub menu item from which I normaly boot, it says "root (hd1,0) does that help ?
[07:09] <Pensacola> yeah
[07:09] <immrtl> its only supposed to go to the end of a line ?
[07:09] <rredd4> i installed the adobe libflashplayer.so into the /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins folder, under root, do i need to do something to activate it?
[07:09] <Pensacola> well it used to go to the end of the webpage
[07:10] <immrtl> Pensacola: try ctrl + end
[07:10] <Hatty> Jordan_U: ill check
[07:10] <Jordan_U> river, Not really
[07:10] <Pensacola> hey that works :)
[07:10] <Pensacola> but can't I customize it?
[07:10] <immrtl> i dont ever remember end going past the end of a line
[07:10] <charle97> blazemonger, it depends
[07:10] <Jordan_U> river, Was there an ext3 partition within the extended partition?
[07:10] <immrtl> i dunno Pensacola sorry
[07:11] <Hatty> Jordan_U: No, only with azureus as far as i can tell.
[07:11] <Pensacola> no problemo, thanks for helping
[07:11] <Hatty> Jordan_U: For the record, those packages are java related
[07:11] <charle97> blazemonger, is the machine you're using your primary machine in which you need to be running
[07:11] <blazemonger> charle97 yah
[07:11] <SpaceFrog> crimsun: i just figured it out
[07:11] <crimsun> SpaceFrog: your 'Master' element is zeroed; your 'PCM' element is zeroed and muted.
[07:11] <percy> hi
[07:11] <rredd4> SpaceFrog i installed the adobe libflashplayer.so into the /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins folder, under root, do i need to do something to activate it?
[07:11] <blazemonger> just pretty much looking for a mentor :)
[07:12] <SpaceFrog> rredd4: no, it should work when you restart firefox
[07:12] <mitrovarr> has anyone had problems with 975x motherboards?  I'm getting some odd errors
[07:12] <charle97> blazemonger, you could try to have multi ubuntu install
[07:12] <river> Jordan_U, can't remember the details now as it used to be a windows box, which I repartitioned to install ubuntu on...then later I blew away the windows partion and created another ext3 for additional space
[07:12] <SpaceFrog> right-click a flash section of a website and you'll see the version
[07:12] <percy> does anyone know how to get mkv files working
[07:12] <Jordan_U> Hatty, Ok, Azureus depends on different versions of those libraries and possibly tux guitar depends on the older ones.
[07:12] <SpaceFrog> crimsun: after installing edgy, it turned all my volume right down
[07:12] <immrtl> rredd4: restart mozilla?
[07:12] <SpaceFrog> crimsun: thanks for your help
[07:12] <rredd4> immrtl did that
[07:12] <river> does anyone know which device is being booted from when my grub says "root (hd1,0)"
[07:12] <Hatty> Jordan_U: ah, k
[07:12] <charle97> blazemonger, use one for your none compiling stuff, the other for compiling
[07:12] <blazemonger> charle97:or having ubuntu for desktop and a live cd distro for my music stuff
[07:12] <blazemonger> mm interesting tactic chalcedony
[07:12] <blazemonger> charle97 i mean
[07:13] <mzl1> My win was insected, how could i do with that junk?
[07:13] <rredd4> immrtl I went to the ABC site to play lost tv show, it said that i needed macromedia flash player, maybe i should install the stand alone one?
[07:13] <mzl1> insected, --infected.
[07:13] <river> or does it all depend on fstab ?
[07:13] <charle97> blazemonger, well i'm tri booting xp, slackware, and edgy
[07:13] <charle97> blazemonger, i use edgy for my everyday stuff and slackware to experiment
[07:13] <immrtl> rredd4: http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash
[07:13] <ChrisNiemy> hi again. still the xine backend under edgy is not able to play flac files, though all extra code packages are installed. totem plays flac files fine. amarok does not. Im now running from the edgy live cd, and installed the packages: same problem :( flac generally works fine, but all apps that use xine refuse, (libxine-extracodecs is installed) seems that this bug from dapper is still alive.
[07:14] <Jordan_U> Hatty, If you want more options, tell apt to install tux-guitar and it will try to find multiple ways to fix the dependency problem so you can choose the least "destructive" one ( destructive is a bad word but you get what I mean)
[07:14] <charle97> blazemonger, i've toasted my slackware install numerous times in the past week, but was still able to do everyday stuff with my edgy install

[07:15] <digit> I want to be sure i get the firefox plugin installed as well
[07:15] <john64> is 1.5.0 Update 8 sufficient?
[07:15] <digit> i guess
[07:16] <digit> im using edgy
[07:16] <john64> for the java part, sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre will get you 1.5.0 u8

[07:23] <cge> spikeb: If you stick a new file in ~/.Trash, does it show up?
[07:23] <mitrovarr> Does anyone have drives that aren't seen by GRUB?  Is there any way to deal with that?
[07:23] <river> noiesmo , sam result, "file not found"
[07:24] <cge> svensko: Openoffice will probably work well for that, yes.
[07:24] <Jordan_U> svensko, with a dual boot to start out, sure.
[07:24] <spikeb> cge: sure, if i use the console and list the contents that way. but not in nautilus
[07:24] <john64> svensko: it would be cool, you would have more freedom, but its not really worth it to type papers
[07:24] <noiesmo> river, you are just entering that in terminal prompt not in grub prompt
[07:24] <john64> openoffice.org is availible for windows
[07:25] <cge> spikeb: I mean, does it show up in Nautilus? Or have you tried deleting ~/.Trash and then seeing if that fixes it?
[07:25] <spikeb> ooh
[07:25] <mitrovarr> svensko:  A lot of whether it's a good idea depends on her printer and whether it's linux compatible
[07:25] <spikeb> cge: haven't tried just deleting the .Trash dir
[07:25] <cge> svensko: Yes, check linuxprinting.org.
[07:25] <svensko> i don't believe she wants it just for open office, we got the entire MS office package when we got our laptops, but ive shown her a lot of the features that come with ubuntu out of the box and she loves it
[07:25] <john64> then its a good idea!
[07:25] <karsten_21> jewsdidwtc
[07:25] <john64> linux can be a very productive environment
[07:26] <ke> You can probably run that in wine
[07:26] <john64> its the only thing i use for school work
[07:26] <ke> I can imagine
[07:26] <spikeb> cge: nope, deleting .Trash didn't help
[07:26] <ke> Though I wouldn't recommend it :)
[07:26] <svensko> i believe i'll set up her with a dual boot at first
[07:26] <cge> svensko: I meant that OpenOffice would work well for papers and powerpoint. When I started using Linux there was no powerpoint equivalent. Of course, I just use LaTeX now anyway.
[07:26] <mitrovarr> svensko:  Sounds good.  There's not really much to lose that way
[07:27] <svensko> she's one of the types of girls that spends her life on myspace, and has enough spyware to make me want to vomit
[07:27] <john64> then its a good idea
[07:27] <mitrovarr> svensko:  in that case it may be a great idea
[07:27] <svensko> i mentioned the fact that linux doesn't really have spyware and her eyes lit up :)
[07:27] <cge> svensko: Maybe you should consider *not* dual booting in that case.
[07:28] <john64> linux isnt free of spyware because its more secure, its just that no one makes spyware for it
[07:28] <andy_t_roo> g'day - i'm having problems installing ubuntu on a virtual pc - i get "<0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task!" after selecting install or boot from the first menu. this occurs in text mode in 6.10 alternate and the safe mode graphics in 6.06
[07:28] <river> noiesmo, do you mean from a livecd ? or what ? as I cannot boot to even a prompt of the original installation, only to the grub menu and not much further
[07:28] <john64> generally people who run linux are able to pick out spyware
[07:28] <mitrovarr> john64:  I'd say it's a little from column A and a little from column B
[07:28] <spikeb> cge: if i manually enter the URL for nautilus as ~/.Trash it works just fine.
[07:28] <spikeb> cge: it's like the applet is pointing to the wrong location.
[07:28] <mitrovarr> john64:  It is more secure, and the userbase is far more alert
[07:28] <svensko> john, yes, i realize that, but it's enough to keep her from being stupid i believe
[07:28] <cge> spikeb: Hmm.... yes, that does sound like the problem.
[07:29] <spikeb> i've had this issue on more than one distro too, oddly enough.
[07:29] <mitrovarr> john64:  One of the biggest assets for linux spyware security is that linux users use almost entirely open source software, which can't contain spyware almost by definition
[07:29] <cge> john64: I think the cultural differences make a big difference as well.
[07:29] <john64> mitrovarr: don't confuse open with good, richard stallman himself says that the GPL is supposed to encourage free software primarily, whether or not its good doesnt bother him
[07:29] <svensko> my main concern is that she will be writing a paper and have ubuntu freeze, since i've installed it, i've had it freeze twice, even though i had MANY applications open
[07:29] <john64> yes, i agree cge
[07:29] <JohnFlux_> Hey all
[07:29] <john64> but i think its more down to a smaller, more fluent userbase
[07:29] <river> noiesmo, when I do try and boot, the transcript says "Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83" then further on a vmlinus line "root=/dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root" not sure if that helps
[07:29] <harriet_1234> hello, i want to configure an ISA audio card on ubuntu 6.06, its not auto recognised, any ideas?
[07:30] <mitrovarr> whoa, ok, I have a big problem here
[07:30] <JohnFlux_> i upgraded from dapper to edgy, and now X doesn:t work ;-)  I'm in bitchx on the console now
[07:30] <john64> what happens
[07:30] <Danman> hello
[07:30] <cge> john64: I've been trying Windows again for the first time in years, and I'm amazed at how commercial and closed the culture is. Things which no one would ever think of paying for with Linux are sold for Windows.
[07:30] <defrysk> harriet_1234, buy a pci audio card is what I would do
[07:30] <JohnFlux_> in /var/log/xorg.0  it says AUDIT: ..... client 23 rejected
[07:30] <mitrovarr> on the first boot of the new ubuntu system, an existing ext3 fs had fsck start and then die
[07:30] <river> Jordan_U, please note my previous message to noiesmo, regarding filesystem and root, does that helps ?
[07:30] <cge> spikeb: Let me look around for a moment.
[07:30] <spikeb> cge: ok
[07:30] <Jordan_U> john64, He meant that you can trust that anything in say the Ubuntu repositories has been checked for malware characteristics in the code
[07:31] <mitrovarr> apparently the filesystem contains large files but lacks LARGE_FILE flag in superblock
[07:31] <john64> jordan_u: are you sure?
[07:31] <harriet_1234> ok, well if its that much of a pain i'll go see if i have one someplace
[07:31] <Danman> Has anyone here ever worked with an imac isight rev c
[07:31] <Jordan_U> john64, I know there would need to be a hell of a conspiracy for that not to be true.
[07:32] <john64> cge: People pay for the ease of use and commercial support, there is NOTHING wrong with closed software
[07:32] <mitrovarr> I have a serious filesystem problem... apparently an ext2 filesystem contains large files but doesn't have the LARGE_FILE flag in the superblock
[07:32] <john64> jordan_U: i am not talking about ubuntu, i am talking about Open and free s/w in general
[07:32] <Jordan_U> john64, But this conversation is better suited to #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:32] <spikeb> yes there is
[07:32] <john64> ok,  nice change of topic slipped in there
[07:32] <mitrovarr> john64:  I think the problem with the windows culture is the freeware.  It's free, but not open source, and so much of it is malware funded.
[07:32] <digit> that sucks
[07:33] <john64> yep, but that is someone being cheap in an environment not designed for cheap people!
[07:33] <cge> john64: That isn't what I mean - that is perfectly understandable. What I'm surprised by is charging for things like themes, and things like that.
[07:33] <svensko> while this isn't ubuntu related, does anyone here know E36 BMWs very well? i've got a question or two, please PM me!
[07:33] <john64> oh, i know, but for the average person, installing a theme in windows is dead simple.  in linux it is very dauting for a new user
[07:33] <mitrovarr> So, does anyone know a way to fix a ext2 filesystem that has large files in it but no LARGE_FILE in superblock?
[07:33] <Arafangion> Why might my LCD screen suddenly have a window saying "LCD OFF" or "LCD ON"?
[07:33] <Arafangion> It's totally random.
[07:34] <Arafangion> The LCD itself doesn't turn on and off, just has this irritating message.
[07:34] <seamus7> How can I reset or reinstall or reconfigure the standard Gnome Panel? ...  I upgraded to Edgy and some of the Panel Applets aren't displaying properly when I make the panel background transparent. Anyone have a clue about this?
[07:34] <Madpilot> john64, really? I never did figure out XP's themeing; Gnome's is dead easy.
[07:34] <cge> spikeb: Strange, gnomevfs-info Trash: doesn't work. Is Trash: not a gnomevfs URI?
[07:34] <spikeb> cge: doesn't seem to be
[07:34] <digit> installing themes in debian or ubuntu is a cake walk
[07:34] <john64> if you buy a theming program, its dead simple
[07:34] <digit> its called art manager if you use gnome
[07:34] <Madpilot> john64, that doesn't count; Gnome's theming is built right in!
[07:34] <digit> easy
[07:35] <john64> but so is XP's
[07:35] <SurfnKid> how can i dump an iso content to my root drive
[07:35] <spikeb> cge: i was poking around in gconf-editor and the url handler for trash is nautilus "%s" - is that the same as yours?
[07:35] <Jordan_U> john64, But it means that I can tell my grandother she can install anything she want's from add remove programs, that makes Ubuntu inherently more secure than windows, especially because of the trouble she would have to go to to run something not from the repo's
[07:35] <john64> the other thing is that you have to trust the distributor, be it open or closed source
[07:35] <spikeb> cge: i'm wondering if it should be nautilus ~/.Trash
[07:35] <digit> then you download it and do it the hardway
[07:35] <cge> spikeb: Where is it in gconf?
[07:36] <spikeb> cge: /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/trash
[07:36] <SurfnKid> how can i dump an iso content to my root drive
[07:36] <Utopiate> When I load Gnome with Beryl the system hangs at Window Manager Load... any ideas?
[07:36] <mitrovarr> john64:  Open source is intrinsically more trustworthy, though, because anyone can check it out and find malware.  That just means you need a trustworthy source for binaries, which is easy to find.
[07:36] <cge> spikeb: Mine is nautilus "%s", yes.
[07:36] <spikeb> hmm
[07:36] <john64> no it doesn't.   It all stems from who you trust.  If you trust Ubuntu, then all your packages are fine.  If you don't trust spyware.inc and install their product, you will have security issues
[07:36] <andy_t_roo> can anyone help with a kernel panic when i install ubuntu on virtual pc? (i know about the problems with 16/32 bit graphics, but this occurs in next mode install from the alternate disk also)
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:36] <john64> right, but who actually audits their code before compiling it, let alone compiles it
[07:37] <cge> spikeb: Have you tried asking in #gnome on irc.gnome.org?
[07:37] <karsten_21> !learn gaysex.ro Da tu lai prence ista yesti gaysex channal.
[07:37] <spikeb> cge: no not yet
[07:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about learn gaysex.ro Da tu lai prence ista yesti gaysex channal. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:37] <mitrovarr> wanna start this up in offtopic, john64?  I wouldn't mind discussing it more but they'll kick us out
[07:37] <Arafangion> ubotu: Nice save.
[07:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Nice save. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:38] <reazn> ubotu: reproduction
[07:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about reproduction - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:38] <john64> i should get back to my school work anyway,  my sql isn't going to write itself :P
[07:38] <reazn> lol
[07:38] <Jordan_U> john64, Yes, if canonicle wanted to they could push an update with malware in it, but eventually they would get cought and there would be a HUGE scandal.
[07:38] <cge> spikeb: That tends to be an excellent place to ask such questions.
[07:38] <spikeb> cge: i shall head there, then. :)
[07:39] <cge> spikeb: I've had Miguel de Icaza answer questions there before.
[07:39] <john64> that isnt what i am talking about though
[07:39] <mitrovarr> anyone know how to convert a ext3 filesystem to support large files?
[07:39] <john64> malware != vulnerable software
[07:40] <john64> i am talking about vulnerable software
[07:40] <mitrovarr> john64:  bugs and exploits operate under the same principle, to a degree; overt ones are caught by people picking through the code.
[07:40] <cge> mitrovarr: Have you looked at mke2fs?
[07:40] <SurfnKid> how can i dump an iso content to my root drive
[07:40] <Jordan_U> !language karsten_21
[07:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about language karsten_21 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:40] <john64> it is a matter of trust whether or not canonical includes malware
[07:40] <mitrovarr> cge:  not yet.  I'm taking my large files off the partition in windows with ext2ifs before I get back into linux to fix it.
[07:41] <Jordan_U> !language | karsten_21
[07:41] <ubotu> karsten_21: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[07:42] <john64> RMS himself said that it is more important for Free software to be free than good, and i would say security is good thing so by RMS's own definition, Free software which comprises most of the ubuntu base does not have the aim of being good or secure as its primary motivation
[07:42] <cge> mitrovarr: Ah yes, ext2ifs is excellent. Something like that should be included on Ubuntu cds, instead of things like Firefox
[07:42] <mitrovarr> john64:  yes, but canonical is trustworthy; they wouldn't destroy their business by including malware.  The problem with freeware is that you have to trust tons and tons of minor entities, and eventually you get one that is corrupt.
[07:42] <iami89> when i run ./configure command in terminal it error:"error: C compiler cannot create executables
[07:42] <john64> i know that, but who is to say that someone doesn't hack their repos, or they have an angry or useless package maintainer
[07:42] <iami89> how to fix it
[07:42] <cge> iami89: Have you installed build-essential?
[07:42] <john64> try sudo apt-get install build-essential
[07:43] <cge> SurfnKid: Why do you want to do that?
[07:43] <Jordan_U> john64, Because RMS speaks for the entire OSS communit /sarcasm
[07:43] <iami89> nope, how to install it?
[07:43] <john64> as the founder, and author of the GPL, i would say his word is good for something
[07:43] <mitrovarr> cge:  Actually it would be cool to include windows/linux integration tools like that on a linux install cd.
[07:44] <john64> *founder of the GNU
[07:44] <john64> OSS != Free
[07:44] <Jordan_U> john64, Yet most of the kernel hackers openly disagree with him on GPL v3
[07:44] <john64> as do i
[07:44] <SurfnKid> cge, i have an ISO id like to dump all the info in a folder to install or view the contents
[07:44] <mitrovarr> cge:  Although ext2ifs is actually why I have this problem (told it my filesystem had large files support and apparently I was wrong, but why wouldn't it by default?  That's just stupid.)
[07:44] <cge> SurfnKid: If you want to get files off of the image, you can loop mount it with "sudo mount -o loop /path/to/image.iso /mount/path", and then the files will be in /mount/path and you can copy them to wherever you want.
[07:44] <SurfnKid> but k3d doesnt let a user do so, it just lets you burn
[07:45] <cge> mitrovarr: It *might* not matter.
[07:45] <john64> but the GPL3 isnt out, so its just an idea, at its root it furthers the statement that he cares more about freedom than quality
[07:45] <SurfnKid> cge, wicked thanks
[07:45] <drano> for some reason, the available wireless networks don't appear in the network manager's list
[07:45] <SurfnKid> ill try it
[07:45] <drano> what can i do to fix this?
[07:45] <mitrovarr> cge:  Still, I can't have fsck loading and then crashing every boot.
[07:45] <Jordan_U> john64, Do you believe that Ubuntu is not inherently more secure than XP + 3rd party software?
[07:45] <john64> the GPL is inherintly aimed towards free rather than good software
[07:45] <cge> SurfnKid: oh, by the way, you need to creat the mount path before you can run that.
[07:45] <iami89> hey cge : how to install it?
[07:45] <john64> Depends on which 3rd party software
[07:45] <cge> iami89: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[07:45] <john64> again, you can install unsafe sw on ubuntu
[07:46] <mitrovarr> cge:  I might just have to bail everything off the drive and format it.  I hope not.
[07:46] <Jordan_U> john64, And the kernel hackers further the general opinion that RMS is a nutcase
[07:46] <john64> XP + trustworthy software is no more secure than Ubuntu, but it isnt less
[07:46] <SurfnKid> gotcha
[07:46] <cge> mitrovarr: Let me look at a few things first.
[07:46] <iami89> only run that command?
[07:46] <mitrovarr> cge:  I'm almost done with the copy, then I'll be ready
[07:46] <john64> just because people haven't found vulnerabilities in F/OSS doesnt mean they don't exist
[07:46] <cge> mitrovarr: So it crashes fsck. But will it mount if fsck isn't run?
[07:46] <Jordan_U> john64, Yes, but it is harder / less necisary to do.
[07:46] <mitrovarr> cge:  ext2ifs can do it.   I don't know about windows
[07:47] <mitrovarr> cge:  Err, linux
[07:47] <john64> it comes down to trust, if you install s/w from people you trust, your system has that trust
[07:47] <BHSPitLappy> unless you leave ports open and get hax0red.
[07:47] <Jordan_U> john64, IMHO it is easier to get by with only applications I trust in Linux than in windows.
[07:48] <john64> but you implicitly trust anything in their repos!
[07:48] <cge> mitrovarr: Unfortunately, technical questions like yours are generally not answered in here.
[07:48] <iami89> do you know how to remove the things what we installed?
[07:48] <john64> and linux is a kernel not an os
[07:48] <mitrovarr> cge:  Well, someone has to know the answer, and it IS tricky
[07:48] <aldwin> can anyone help me?
[07:48] <john64> i would say i cannot get by with the packages in "main" at all
[07:48] <mitrovarr> cge:  i'll probably just end up bailing off the partition, formatting it, and remaking it correctly
[07:48] <cge> mitrovarr: I *think* that while fsck will fail, that Linux will still mount properly.
[07:49] <john64> no codecs other than XIPH, no java, so many things arent there
[07:49] <aldwin> i wanted to run ubuntu on my desktop. i downloaded the 6.10 ubuntu for 64bit pc (amd) but it didnt work.
[07:49] <mitrovarr> cge:  It should be fine when I reboot because now it doesn't have large files on it
[07:49] <aldwin> i wanted to run ubuntu on my desktop. i downloaded the 6.10 ubuntu for 64bit pc (amd) but it didnt work.
[07:49] <john64> remember, Universe is community sw, meaning canonical didnt check it for sure
[07:49] <BHSPitLappy> aldwin, we heard you the first time
[07:49] <aldwin> :P
[07:49] <seamus7> Hi ya'll... anyone know how I can find the source of my desktop Panel's difficulty displaying background transparency correctly? ... (this problem began when I upgraded to Edgy)
[07:49] <aldwin> sorry
[07:49] <halabiro> guys i cant create a dial up connection to internet
[07:49] <mitrovarr> john64:  If you were that nervous, you could always compile programs yourself
[07:50] <cge> mitrovarr: You can look at the manpages for mke2fs, tune2fs, and e2fsck to see if there is some option to change the filesystem in the correct way.
[07:50] <BHSPitLappy> john64, there's a good level of standards for getting your packages into the universe repo
[07:50] <mitrovarr> cge: good idea
[07:50] <john64> using only s/w in main, would say that it follows my assertation that its freedom before quality because an installation with only main packages is useless to most
[07:50] <cge> BHSPitLappy: On the other hand there are packages in main like reportbug that don't work at all.
[07:50] <SurfnKid> cge, um i made a mistake mounting it to my /home dir and now i cant find my user dir? how do i get back to it? unmount it?
[07:50] <john64> right, but i don't care, and i trust Canonical, Universe, Multiverse, Microsoft, Adobe, etc...
[07:50] <BHSPitLappy> john64, like he said, then just use source repos, check the source out yourself, and compile by hand
[07:50] <john64> MS has a lot more to loss than Canonical
[07:51] <cge> SurfnKid: sudo umount /path/to/image.iso
[07:51] <SurfnKid> ok
[07:51] <aldwin> i wanted to run ubuntu on my desktop. i downloaded the 6.10 ubuntu for 64bit pc (amd) but it didnt work.
[07:51] <john64> i don't have the time/interest to do that.  I use ubuntu, i trust canonical, but no more than i trust ms
[07:51] <mitrovarr> john64:  the problem isn't trusting ms
[07:51] <Jordan_U> john64, But I am not trusting one person or group when I am trusting Ubuntu's repos, There are so many people that would love to catch Canonical distributing malware, I have a trust in Microsofts employees that may be looking to find flaws to talk about also, nobody can just say, if you tell anybody about this vulnerability you are fired, it would take a HUGE conspiracy for Ubuntu to get awaw with malware.
[07:52] <haydenAU> what clustering features were introduced in Edgy?
[07:52] <BHSPitLappy> john64, if Wendy's, for instance, messes up one person's sandwich, and they report it, does the corporation fall apart?
[07:52] <john64> yes, unless you are an expert security analyst, and compile your own code, it is solely about trust
[07:52] <cge> john64 , mitrovarr, Jordan_U, BHSPitLappy, and others: it really would be better to move your discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:52] <aldwin> can anyone help?
[07:52] <mitrovarr> cge:  I tried but they won't go
[07:52] <BHSPitLappy> john64, similarly, microsoft can afford slip-ups (they do, often) that are really great expenses to individuals
[07:52] <halabiro> guys i cant create a dial up connection to internet?
[07:52] <BHSPitLappy> cge, you're right
[07:52] <mzli> aldwin: ??
[07:52] <john64> just as much as canonical can
[07:52] <charle97> aldwin, is 64bit you're only option?
[07:52] <BHSPitLappy> halabiro, is your modem recognized/supported
[07:52] <marcrosoft> so every once and a while (usually in the middle of the night) my computer will crash and need to be hard rebooted... is there a way to look in logs to see what might have caused this?

[07:53] <SurfnKid> cge, this is weird, if my ISO is within the directory that i mounted it how can i unmount it?
[07:53] <haydenAU> !cluster
[07:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cluster - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:54] <mitrovarr> remote X clients getting hardware accel?  That sounds really cool
[07:54] <SurfnKid> the iso is in /home/user/iso
[07:54] <cge> SurfnKid: Try sudo umount /home
[07:54] <john64> i am there
[07:54] <SurfnKid> ok
[07:54] <tich> what is the command line to check to see if my wireless card is on?
[07:54] <SurfnKid> device is busy
[07:54] <cge> tich: iwconfig
[07:54] <cge> SurfnKid: Oh dear.
[07:54] <SurfnKid> hehe
[07:54] <cge> SurfnKid: It would be easiest to restart.
[07:54] <mitrovarr> tich:  use ifconfig to see if it has an interface
[07:54] <SurfnKid> yep brb
[07:55] <cge> SurfnKid: mount should stop that. I'll think about getting that changed.
[07:55] <river> Jordan_U, I've rebooted to the liveCD and the only thing shown under the extended partition in gparted on /dev/hdb2 is /dev/hdb5 listed as "unknown" type
[07:55] <SurfnKid> yeah
[07:55] <SurfnKid> i should change the mount dir
[07:55] <SurfnKid> brb
[07:55] <cge> tich: Use iwconfig
[07:55] <cge> tich: That will tell you whether the radio is on or not.
[07:56] <achandra> RobNyc: need anything for beryl? I saw it in a magazine earlier today...looked cool
[07:56] <achandra> RobNyc: 3d card or??
[07:56] <BeanBag> when i try to install more software in the ADD/REMOVE thingy is says that "the software is not available on any software channel" Im running 64bit dapper drake
[07:56] <tich> cge, wifi0 says no wireless extension but ath0 a bunch of info, but i can't connect to it.
[07:57] <tich> cge, how would i get it to connect?
[07:59] <BHSPitLappy> achandra, edgy or dapper?
[07:59] <mitrovarr> cge:  The drive mounted in linux without problems
[07:59] <LearninLinux> I have a stupid question.  I searched all over the Ubuntu forums and found no help!
[08:00] <BeanBag>  when i try to install more software in the ADD/REMOVE thingy is says that "the software is not available on any software channel" Im running 64bit dapper drake, please help
[08:00] <huck> BeanBag: do you have the repositories added to your sources.list?
[08:00] <Hatty> LearninLinux: Theres no such thing as a stupid question.
[08:00] <timthelion> Hatty: yes there is, do you want me to start asking them?
[08:01] <Hatty> timthelion: If you honestly don't know the answer, then ask.
[08:01] <timthelion> LearninLinux: fire away. maybe one of us can help
[08:01] <BeanBag> huck: i guess i need a net connection to access the repositories?
[08:01] <achandra> BHSPitLappy: I have both installed so I guess either...
[08:01] <timthelion> Hatty: ok, why did hibernation stop working when I upgraded to edgy?
[08:01] <huck> BeanBag: you might be able to get them off the live cd/install cd depending on what they are... but I've never used it. An internet connectoin would be good :D
[08:02] <cge> mitrovarr: I think the Linux drivers might ignore the large file attribute.
[08:02] <tich> cge, info appeared for ath0 but i can't connect to my wireless router, what should i do now?
[08:02] <Hatty> timthelion: because of a bug?
[08:02] <timthelion> Hatty: yes.
[08:02] <cge> tich: Are you using network-manager?
[08:02] <Hatty> timthelion: I didn't mean ask me.
[08:02] <timthelion> Hatty: you see, I never asked how to fix it...
[08:02] <LearninLinux> I installed Ubuntu (Edgy) and have used gnome before, and just for a change I wanted to try KDE.  I did "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop.  It worked great, but didn't like the feel of KDE.   I uninstalled kubuntu-desktop and everything else that got installed with it, but when i boot up my computer, i get the Kubuntu progress bar.  How do i get the ubuntu splash screen (not the login or the "loading this/that/nautilus...) the FIRS
[08:02] <LearninLinux> T screen that you see when you boot ubuntu up.
[08:02] <BHSPitLappy> achandra, AIGLX ships with edgy by default. Run glxgears from a terminal and tell me if it runs fash/smoothly.
[08:02] <achandra> agree..with the network-manager....it should simplify things...
[08:02] <tich> no, i use netapplet, but it says that my wireless is disabled
[08:03] <cge> tich: network-manager is generally much easier.
[08:03] <achandra> BHSpitLappy: im on my dapper box now, and it runs smooth and nice
[08:04] <BHSPitLappy> LearninLinux, maybe reinstall the package usplash-theme-ubuntu ?
[08:04] <tich> cge, i have run it but it never shows any wireless connections to choose from
[08:04] <cge> tich: I've only used network manager and the sudo iwconfig ath0 essid "ESSID"; sudo  iwconfig ath0 enc open key" ; sudo dhclient ath0
[08:04] <BHSPitLappy> achandra, well, on the dapper box you'll have to install and set up aiglx and everythin
[08:04] <BHSPitLappy> unlike with the edgy box
[08:04] <BeanBag> huck: also, when i try to play movies and mp3's it says something about plugins
[08:04] <cge> tich: Does sudo iwlist scan show anything?
[08:04] <river> can anyone help me to identify which /dev/ has my original failing root partition so that I can mount it using a livecd and then chroot
[08:04] <LearninLinux> BHSPitLappy:  I will look into it... thanks for the tip!
[08:04] <BHSPitLappy> LearninLinux, just find it in synaptic and reinstall. it might fix it.
[08:05] <cge> river: Use cfdisk or gparted to see which partition has a ext2 or other linux partition?
[08:05] <BHSPitLappy> or even fdisk -l
[08:05] <huck> BeanBag: I'm still pretty new to linux too, but I got all mine installed by using Automatix  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=138405

[08:06] <tich> cge, it listed stuff like: [interface]  frequency,  but nothing that looks like wireless, and no specific data (i don't think)
=== co_look_friends is now known as cari_sobat_ce
[08:06] <cge> tich: So iwlist scan doesn't show any essids? That isn't a good sign.
[08:06] <huck> cge: that's interesting.... i've never had a problem with it, maybe I'm one of the lucky ones
=== cari_sobat_ce is now known as cari_sobat
[08:07] <huck> BeanBag: you might want to disregard my last suggestion
[08:07] <tich> cge, no everything starts with square brackets with interface written in them and no essid
[08:08] <river> cge, I used gparted and found two devices which have an ext3... one only has two user home dirs and the other a GRUB dir amongsts other files, but no /etc /proc so does not look like the correct mount point
[08:08] <cge> huck: For mp3s and audio other than Real and wmv, you should enable universe and multiverse and install all of the gstreamer0.10-plugins-* packages.

[08:11] <tich> cge, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30385/  let me know what you think.
[08:12] <river> cge, I did not say it was dying, I said "it fails to boot" ... it was interupted (system shutdown gracefully) in the middle of an upgrade from Dapper to Edgy ... gets to unpacking kernel or somewhere and goes to a blank screen with flashing cursor at which point it stays
[08:12] <cge> river: oh
[08:12] <cge> river: trying to talk to four people at one time gets confusing.
[08:13] <river> cge, someone else suggested "boot from livecd, mount original root then chroot and continue" The problem is I can't find my original root to mount
[08:13] <del4> installing ubuntu is like some strange dream to the center of the earth where things make sense or something
[08:13] <river> cge, I'm sorry, I'm sure it gets confusing
[08:13] <cge> river: It sounds like it is the extended partition. Have you tried mounting it?
[08:13] <river> cge, would try if I knew what type to mount it as
[08:14] <cge> river: Probably ext3
[08:14] <river> cge, I think I already tried those ut I'll try again and get back to you
[08:15] <cge> tich: Use sudo iwlist scan instead of sudo iwlist.
[08:16] <Neil3> hm i wonder if there's any way to speed up drawing of the display in gnome, apart from using compositing
[08:17] <tich> cge, i pasted it to the same page (lines 1-46)
[08:17] <cge> Neil3: The murrine theme engine is supposed to be faster.
[08:18] <Neil3> cheers cge  i'll check it out
[08:18] <cge> Neil3: Due to the ubuntu-art debacle it isn't in main or universe, however.
[08:18] <seamus7> Anyone have a hunch why some of my desktop panel applets display visual noise behind them when I set the panel background to any degree of transaprency?
[08:18] <Neil3> dang yeah i noticed
[08:19] <cge> Neil3: There is a package for Ubuntu if you search on the internet, however.
[08:19] <river> cge, fails to mount with ext3, however if I boot to the original grub menu and attempt to boot I see "filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83" does that help us ?
[08:19] <cge> river: Hmm... did you say that you have access to the /boot partition?
[08:20] <cge> tich: Your wireless card is working.
[08:21] <cge> tich: Could you pastebin the contents of /etc/network/interfaces?
[08:21] <tich> cge, yeah i'll let you know when it is done
[08:21] <schmirgo> good morning, i have somehow messed up my console with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup". i cannnot get the correct number of lines in the console. i.e. there is unused space at the lower end of the console but 2 more lines would fit in there how can i change it so that i can use this free space on the screen?
[08:22] <river> cge, only as far as the grub menu and if I proceed it does not get much further then what I mentioned above the "vmlinuz root=/dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root" then goes to balnk screen with cursor and hangs
[08:23] <cge> river: Aaaaaaaaah!!!! Were you using LVM or an encrypted root partition?
[08:23] <BeanBag> does Automatix realy help people set Ubuntu up? Im a total newb and i am struggling, but i want to ditch WinXP
[08:23] <anthrem> How is Ubuntu with the new upgrade?...Thinking about installing....curious

[08:24] <seamus7> anthrem... what are the advantages of using Fedora over Ubuntu.. I thought of installing Fedora alongside my Ubuntu.
[08:24] <cge> BeanBag: If you look at the wiki page I directed you to, that should have the instructions you want.

[08:24] <anthrem> well, Fedora is sideways supported by lots, but so is Ubuntu
[08:24] <defrysk> seamus7, fedora core is a disaster compared to ubuntu
[08:24] <defrysk> thats about it
[08:24] <anthrem> I like COOL!
[08:24] <cge> tich: Where?
[08:25] <anthrem> Fedora is a HUGE disaster
[08:25] <anthrem> a real PITA
[08:25] <defrysk> anyway , ot
[08:25] <charle97> why?
[08:25] <defrysk> its slow and a pain to maintasin
[08:25] <huck> BeanBag: yea, apparently there's issues with it. I never had a problem with it on 2 different machines, but it might be more of a risk than it's worth
[08:25] <tich> cge, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30387/ (lines 1-24)
[08:25] <schmirgo> anthrem, its very good. if you want an easy setup... it detected my widescreen with the install cd and wifi and suspend to disk. i could surf the web over wifi while installing it, everything worked aut of the box
[08:25] <defrysk> </rhyme>
[08:25] <anthrem> Fedora sucks because of the maintainence
[08:25] <defrysk> yum is a disaster
[08:26] <anthrem> I heard the new Ubuntu upgrade was not so good...anyone here seeing troubles?
[08:26] <defrysk> yellow dogs update moloch
[08:26] <mitrovarr> I know this is a stupid question, but what do I put into fstab to make a filesystem read/write to everyone, not just root?
[08:26] <charle97> i've seen reviews that said that yum owns apt
[08:26] <anthrem> yum really sucks IMHO
[08:26] <defrysk> anthrem, better fresh install this time
[08:26] <cge> mitrovarr: Look at the umask option in the mount manpage.
[08:26] <charle97> clean install edgy, don't upgrade

[08:27] <anthrem> so the edgy upgrade is better for a fresh install? Excellent!!!
[08:27] <seamus7> defrysk: ahh .. I only thought of installing Fedora but after looking at screenshots for many other distributions and reading that most of the same packages are available and most use Gnome or KDE ... I'm wondering why I would want to leave Ubuntu for another distribution?
[08:27] <maxamillion> i installed and then changed my mirrors to mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu but my work machine is still on the defaults ... any reason why one would recieve a new nvidia-glx package and new linux kernel headings as an update but the other didn't even though both are almost identicle in hardware
[08:27] <defrysk> not really but yes
[08:27] <cge> anthrem: No, you should do a fresh install of edgy.
[08:27] <BeanBag> huck: im currently checking those pages out... thanks a million for the help
[08:27] <cge> anthrem: If you can do so easily.
[08:27] <river> cge, it is likely as a partition within the "extended" with filetype "unknown" has flags "lvm" when looking at it in gparted
[08:27] <charle97> i don't see edgy as an upgrade to dapper.  it's a new os to me
[08:28] <anthrem> that's what I mean....the edgy install would be good as a fresh...will do so that way
[08:28] <defrysk> seamus7, believe me, ubuntu is a GOOD distro and make many others seem dissapointing exept for perhaps slackware
[08:28] <huck> BeanBag: sure thing, cge is actually the one who pointed them out ;)
[08:28] <anthrem> where did I but the damn disk.... grr!
=== pc2 is now known as ce_smp_crTmn
[08:28] <maxamillion> defrysk: you must enjoy upgrading packages manually

[08:29] <cge> river: I've never used lvm before.
[08:29] <maxamillion> defrysk: to say that slackware isn't disapointing
[08:29] <anthrem> like the KDE apps, but still prefer ICEWM
[08:29] <anthrem> less CPU overhead
[08:29] <maxamillion> defrysk: slackware has nothing to manage packages
[08:29] <river> cge, I'm sure I used it accidently thinking it was going to allow me to seemlessly span drives
[08:29] <defrysk> maxamillion, slackware is a good ditro but likes to stick to old school solidness and snappieness
[08:30] <seamus7> Is there any way of fixing transparency display issues with my Panel Applets without having to do a complete reinstallation of Edgy? Anyone?
[08:30] <defrysk> maxamillion, its amatter of choice
[08:30] <maxamillion> defrysk: fair enough ... i'm just lazy and apt-get does the work for me :)
[08:30] <Pyru> Hello, i have just finished downloading kubuntu, I don't have a blank cd but i mounted it with daemon toolz is there anyway i can install this without a blank cd? maybe make a new partition and somehow boot the iso from it or something?
[08:30] <cge> river: It *will*, if I recall.
[08:30] <river> cge, sounds like this is all too hard and I'm going to be forced to use the old Microsoft trick....re-install from scratch and blow away anything on the drives
[08:31] <maxamillion> i installed and then changed my mirrors to mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu but my work machine is still on the defaults ... any reason why one would recieve a new nvidia-glx package and new linux kernel headings as an update but the other didn't even though both are almost identicle in hardware ... any thoughts?

[08:32] <cge> Pyru: Yes, but the question is, do you have any way of running any version of Linux or a POSIX compliant OS on the computer, and how much do you know about Linux?
[08:33] <Pyru> I don't kno wmuch about linux, though I do have ubuntu 5.10 I think it was, on a cd burned it about a year ago =/
[08:33] <tich> cge, it says " SIOCADDRT: network is unreachable failed to bring up ath0"

[08:34] <maxamillion> Pyru: sorry, missed the first part
[08:34] <cge> Pyru: I would wait and burn a copy then. There *is* a way to install from an image, but it requires considerable expertise.
[08:34] <fredl> but after I login the splash screen comes up, but shortly after the screen gets light grey

[08:35] <river> does anyone here know how to mount a partion which used to be root but managed under LVM ? i.e. what type should it be mounted as
[08:35] <cge> mitrovarr: umask *should* work with any ext2 partition.
[08:35] <mitrovarr> cge:  in that case, what number?   I read the manpage but it wasn't helpful
[08:35] <tich> cge, after i run ifup ath0 it says " SIOCADDRT: network is unreachable failed to bring up ath0"
[08:36] <fredl> If I choose a fluxbox session everything works.
[08:36] <cge> river: You can't just use mount, I believe. You have to set it up with the device mapper.
[08:36] <cge> mitrovarr: Try 666, maybe?

[08:38] <cursed> its like the 5th time i try to switch to linux, and every single time something prevents me from doing it! im cursed! and i though ubuntu finally make it easy, but no! it managed to make it worse! arhhhg
[08:38] <sanmarcos> if you want to run gnome that is
[08:38] <sanmarcos> cursed: whats the probleme?
[08:38] <morphius> Using 6.06: I have a script that I am running using cron. When it runs as cron, it will not work properly. If run from command prompt, however, it works fine. The script: Checks to see if the computer can ping google. Next, it checks to see if the IP address has changed. If it has it updates my wireless router using a perl web scraping script and changes the dmz. Any ideas?
[08:38] <cursed> sanmarcos: can't boot
[08:38] <river> although I do have two drives so it would be nice to use something that seamlessly spans the two
[08:38] <cge> river: If you have separate home partition, that is probably the best thing to do.
[08:38] <cursed> sanmarcos: i get to the first screen (boot / install), then kernel loads, then it reboots
[08:38] <cge> river: You can just set up LVM again, too.
[08:39] <sanmarcos> morphius: man 5 crontab, check to see which user is running it
[08:39] <cge> crimsun: Oh, wow.
[08:39] <antxon> hola amigos
[08:39] <sanmarcos> cursed: weird, does the live cd work?
[08:39] <fredl> is there a simple way to make GNOME forget it's configuration?
[08:39] <cge> crimsun: You were using a swap partition, right?
[08:39] <morphius> I should be running under root (as root: crontab -e)
[08:39] <sanmarcos> fredl: rm -rf ~/.gconf
[08:39] <swift> cge: sorry about that, im on a satelite from the middle of no where
[08:39] <crimsun> cge: no. I just didn't start the X Window System at all.
[08:39] <swift> can you sugest anything?
[08:39] <tich> cge, ifup ath0 didn't work.
[08:39] <cursed> sanmarcos: it used to, until yesterday. now i can't boot it
[08:39] <sanmarcos> fredl: and ~/.gnome*
[08:39] <cge> crimsun: Ah, so it wasn't a standard Ubuntu install. That makes sense.
[08:40] <river> cge, I don't have separate home never got that far...the intention was to move it to the other drive but -sigh- never managed to get that far (I'm a noob)
[08:40] <cge> swift: So people here think that xubuntu won't work very well, but you could try it.
[08:40] <fredl> sanmarcos, hmmm. do you know of any GNOME problems with Edgy?
[08:40] <cge> river: Oh, then you have a problem.
[08:40] <crimsun> Xubuntu won't work any better than Ubuntu or Kubuntu with only 32 MiB.
[08:40] <sanmarcos> fredl: specifically?
[08:40] <swift> cge: can't see why not :P thank you for your help.
[08:40] <cge> swift: You could also try DamnSmallLinux
[08:40] <sanmarcos> fredl: edgy has a lot of problems
[08:41] <crimsun> as soon as one starts the X Window System, you eat whatever memory would have been in dcache.
[08:41] <morphius> crimsum: might work with fluxbox though
[08:41] <crimsun> morphius: it's not the wm, it's the X server itself.
[08:41] <swift> cge: it's for my little bro, and i know little of linux any way, so i was looking for something easy
[08:41] <fredl> yeah. Because I upgraded to Edgy yesterday and when I log in on a GNOME session, the splash comes up but it seems whenever the control-panel starts coming up the screen turns grey
[08:41] <river> cge, fortunately it is only one of the kids machines so apparently not a huge loss so in the interest of time maybe this is the next best way forward
[08:41] <link_36p> im trying to make a script to launch warcraft III
[08:41] <cge> swift: Hmm... in that case I'm afraid that you will have problems.
[08:41] <morphius> crimsun: right, but does fluxbox even use x?
[08:41] <crimsun> morphius: ...yes.
[08:42] <cge> swift: If it isn't a laptop, it would probably be worthwhile to just get some more RAM for it.
[08:42] <gleidson> #pt
[08:42] <morphius> crimsun: ...oh
[08:42] <link_36p> wine "/home/patrick/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Warcraft III/war3.exe" says there is no such file or directory when launched in a script, but not just from pasting it into a terminal, any suggestions?
[08:42] <cge> swift: Old RAM is quite cheap, and there are probably a variety of people who would give it away.
[08:42] <river> cge, thanks for your attempts at help within all this other noise
[08:42] <swift> cge: tis a laptop :P maybe i will just build him a desktop
[08:42] <mitrovarr> cge:  mount won't accept umask as an option
[08:42] <charle97> link, you need to use a C: path
[08:43] <cge> river: wait a bit
[08:43] <fredl> sanmarcos, I see TONS of messages in my .xsession-errors like ALSA lib conf.c:3947:(snd_config_expand) Evaluate error: No such file or directory
[08:43] <cge> mitrovarr: Oh
[08:43] <tich> cge, do you have any other ideas to get the wireless working?

[08:43] <gleidson> #brasil
[08:43] <gleidson> #brazil
[08:43] <tich> cge, yes, it is installed
[08:43] <charle97> link, C:\\Program Files\Warcraft III\war3.exe
[08:43] <sanmarcos> fredl: weird, just reinstall if you can, try login in as another user, if not, then you could apt-get install --reinstall --purge those packages
[08:44] <cge> river: In the LiveCD, can you run vgchange as root?
[08:44] <link_36p> charle97, but im making a scipt to do battle net hacks (just to log on) and i need to CD into the directory to mv some stuff around during launch
[08:44] <fredl> sanmarcos, Hmm, logging in as another user sounds like a plan
[08:44] <mitrovarr> cge:  hah, I'm retarded.  All I had to do was change the permissions of the directory it was mounted into
[08:44] <fredl> lemme try that
[08:44] <cge> tich: Remove the lines about ath0 in /etc/network/interfaces, and then run nm-applet
[08:44] <river> cge, I'll try from a terminal
[08:44] <link_36p> charle97 when puting cd "directory" into a bash file it says it doesnt exist
[08:44] <cge> mitrovarr: I'm just as bad for not remembering that and telling you...
[08:44] <tich> cge, okay i'll give it a go, should i restart?
[08:45] <cge> tich: No
[08:45] <sanmarcos> fredl: then you can tell if its the users problem
[08:45] <charle97> link, isn't what you're doing violating the bnet tos
[08:45] <cge> tich: Oh, but you should run sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart
[08:45] <river> cge, tried "sudo vgchange" but command not found
[08:45] <charle97> link, they may ban you
[08:45] <mitrovarr> cge:  oh well, I know now at least.  it's only ext2s that work that way, I know for a fact it doesn't work with no permissions fs
[08:45] <cge> charle97: Running it in Linux is probably a TOS violation anyway.
[08:45] <morphius> lol @ charle97
[08:46] <sizzam_> how do i get the foot icon back for the gnome menu
[08:46] <tich> cge, just the lines that have ath0 in them or should i # other lines as well?
[08:46] <sizzam_> in edgy
[08:46] <morphius> do they even _maintain_ battlenet anymore
[08:46] <cge> tich: Just the ath0 lines
[08:46] <link_36p> charle97 i dont care i own the game
[08:46] <morphius> what game is it link?
[08:46] <link_36p> charle97: so u dont know why bash says the directory doesnt exist?
[08:46] <charle97> warcraft 3
[08:46] <tich> cge, and i should leave the wlan0 line alone?
[08:47] <link_36p> morphius: warcraf III
[08:47] <pyc> ogg to avi, any tool for ubuntu?
[08:47] <morphius> they probably won't care
[08:47] <cge> river: What about pvscan?
[08:47] <cge> tich: I think so, yes.
[08:47] <charle97> link, sorry i don't know
[08:48] <river> cge, nope, same result
[08:48] <tich> cge, nm says that no network devices have been found
[08:48] <cge> river: Did you run the dbus restart command?
[08:49] <cge> Err, tich: Did you run the dbus restart command
[08:49] <tich> cge, no is it: sudo dbus?
[08:49] <river> cge, did I miss something, "dbus restart command" ?
[08:49] <cge> river: No, that was meant for tich
[08:49] <cge> tich: sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart
[08:50] <river> cge, heh, I don't know how you run multiple stacks
[08:51] <cge> river: It is difficult.
[08:51] <cge> river: I never come here expecting to answer people's questions, either. I just somehow start doing.
[08:51] <cge> it
[08:51] <Hopp> hi
[08:52] <river> cge,your assist is appreciated.. how about I go and eat my dinner and come back in 30min hopefully you are still here and not trying to help 15 people at once
[08:52] <Hopp> anyone knows how to play different dvb-s freqs using vlc
[08:52] <cge> river:  I might still be here.
[08:52] <mitrovarr> cge:  I think I fixed that filesystem thing, it just required copying a large file to the filesystem in linux.  Linux has the wit to change the large-file flag if you move one in, ext2ifs just doesn't (so it won't make the filesystem incompatible with old kernels.)
[08:52] <river> cge, see you then, thanks
[08:52] <morphix> hi, due to some issues with the current ubuntu kernel i was forced to compile my own custom 2.6.18.1 kernel, but now nvidia drivers do not work.. and i'm unable to get into X
[08:52] <cge> river: You're welcome
[08:52] <cge> mitrovarr: Ah.
[08:52] <mitrovarr> morphix:  you'll have to get the Nvidia drivers from Nvidia and compile them yourself
[08:52] <FirstStrike> morphish: when you compile a new kernel you need to reinstall your graphics drivers
[08:52] <morphix> FirstStrike: yeh i know.. and thats what i did.
[08:53] <morphix> didnt work
[08:53] <mitrovarr> morphix:  check to make sure it's compiling with the same GCC version as the kernel
[08:53] <FirstStrike> you need to compile them yourself. you can't just install the nvidia-glx with a custom kernel.
[08:53] <morphius> morphix, before you do that what was your specific error
[08:53] <Tru7h> Could somebody explain how to upgrade to edgy?
[08:53] <cge> Tru7h: Do you have a separate home partition?
[08:53] <morphius> Tru7h: DONT use apt-get dist-upgrade
[08:54] <Brandals> hi...!
[08:54] <cge> morphius: Why not?
[08:54] <Geoffrey2> is there a visual partition manager in Edgy?
[08:54] <Tru7h> cge: I only have one partition for Linux. It's dual-booting with Windows.
[08:54] <Tru7h> morphius: How come?
[08:54] <compudaze> Geoffrey2: install gparted
[08:54] <tich> cge, the wireless network shows up, it tried to connect for a long time but then went back to no network connection.
[08:54] <morphius> cge: theres a new command for it, and It will cause a problem or two which you will have to resolve manually if you do.
[08:54] <Brandals> what the topic
[08:54] <cge> tich: Do you have DHCP running on your wireless access point?
[08:55] <tich> cge, yep.
[08:55] <cge> morphius: Yes, I know that update-manager is there, but it uses X which I don't like.
[08:55] <cge> morphius: And the only problem I have heard about apt-get dist-upgrade is that it won't work if you don't have ubuntu-desktop installed.
[08:55] <cge> tich: Hmm...
[08:55] <morphix> Firetech: ah ok.. **der** forgot.. so i would just need to install nvidia-kernel-source?
[08:55] <mitrovarr> yay, 6.10 has firefox 2
[08:55] <mitrovarr> I've been looking forward to that
[08:55] <morphius> cge: yes but I used apt-get and had to force install gconf2
[08:55] <morphix> and compile it
[08:56] <Tru7h> Should I install edgy over my old version?
[08:56] <FirstStrike> No
[08:56] <morphius> Sure you can do that Tru7h. Just be aware that there might be a conflict or two.
[08:56] <mitrovarr> morphix:  I'd actually go to nvidia.com, get their driver package, and run their installer
[08:56] <cge> Tru7h: If you have only one partition, then no.
[08:56] <morphius> cge: why not?
[08:56] <cge> Tru7h: Using update-manager would be best.
[08:56] <Brandals> hi...!
[08:56] <cge> morphius: Installing over it would likely wipe the partition.
[08:57] <compudaze> morphix: install xorg-dev and linux-headers-generic (or whatever kernel u have) and use nvidia's installer
[08:57] <morphix> mitrovarr: well i'm kinda limit by the fact i cant load X to use a web browser.
[08:57] <morphix> i'm getting mixed input here
[08:57] <morphix> lol
[08:57] <Tru7h> cge: So, there is a way to update my version without downloading, burning, and installing edgy?
[08:57] <compudaze> since you have a custom kernel, use it's headers
[08:57] <cge> Tru7h: Yes, update-manager
[08:57] <morphius> Tru7hOh I see. Yes you should install over using update-manager no you should not re-install off the CD
[08:57] <mitrovarr> morphix:  have someone get the web address and then use wget
[08:57] <morphix> i made headers.. and installed them
[08:57] <Tru7h> cge: Alright. Thanks.
[08:57] <cge> !update | Tru7h
[08:57] <ubotu> Tru7h: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[08:58] <BeanBag> how can i configure GRUB so that it boots  ANOTHER (Windows XP [please dont kill me]  ) partition by default?
[08:58] <Tru7h> I'm quite new at this distro of Linux, I appreciate your guys' help.
[08:58] <mitrovarr> morphix:  Do you have internet access at least?
[08:58] <tich> cge, i've heard some folks say that a fresh install is good for going to edgy, should i do that? could the update have screwed some stuff up?
[08:58] <morphius> Tru7h: you can also use https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[08:58] <compudaze> morphix: use the 'nv' X driver for now just to get to X to make it easier
[08:58] <Tru7h> Thanks for the links.
[08:58] <morphix> mitrovarr: i'm currently on the machine.. so yes. i have web access just no X
[08:58] <mitrovarr> morphix:  32bit or 64bit linux?
[08:58] <morphix> 32bit
[08:58] <cge> morphix: Install elinks?
[08:58] <morphix> elinks?
[08:59] <cge> morphix: A console based browser.
[08:59] <mitrovarr> morphix:  I think 'wget http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8776/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8776-pkg1.run' should work
[08:59] <BeanBag>  morphix: Why 32bit? whats wrong with 64bit?
[08:59] <Geoffrey2> when I do a 'sudo nautilus', I'm getting a warning about a session DBUS connection failing to open...is that something I can fix, or is it not a big deal?
[08:59] <Flannel> Geoffrey2: you should use gksudo
[08:59] <thor> does anyone know what ubuntu uses instead of .xinitrc?
[08:59] <mitrovarr> morphix:  sorry you can't use copy and paste :-(
[08:59] <morphix> well ive heard there are some probs with 64bit atm so i am just sticking to 32bit OS right now.. just want to get the functionality back on here
[08:59] <cge> Geoffrey2: don't worry about it.
[08:59] <tich> cge, why doesn't nm show the wired connection?
[08:59] <morphix> hmm
[09:00] <cge> tich: A fresh install would be good, yes.
[09:00] <Flannel> BeanBag: you can change your default in the grub menu, /etc/grub/boot.lst
[09:00] <cge> tich: And nm ignores any device that is listed in /etc/network/interfaces.
[09:00] <BeanBag>  morphix: what are the main probs? Im running 64bit now, dapper
[09:00] <compudaze> morphix: just use the 'nv' driver till u can make your own nvidia driver
[09:00] <mzli> <cge> fresh instal will overpass every error!!
[09:01] <mitrovarr> morphix:  using the nv driver is a good idea too.  Then, you can use x to get and install the driver
[09:01] <BeanBag> Flannel: Thanks, what option should i add?
[09:01] <compudaze> BeanBag: how hard is it to get 32-bit only apps running?
[09:01] <cge> mzli: Ubuntu is really lacking in terms of upgradeability, unfortunately.
[09:01] <tich> cge, ah that makes sense.  i don't know if you have any other suggestions but...
[09:02] <Flannel> BeanBag: it's already in there, something like "Default 0"  you'll change that number
[09:02] <morphix> mitrovarr: my X is currently set up for dual screen.. i'd have to generate a new xorg.conf just to use nv drivers
[09:02] <tich> cge, thanks for all the help
[09:02] <mzli> <cge> right. I've dead once.
[09:02] <mzli> <cge>and reinstall.
[09:02] <BeanBag> compudaze: What apps are 32bit only?
[09:02] <cge> mzli: I reinstall about once every few months.
[09:02] <compudaze> morphix: easy... make a backup of your current xorg.conf and run, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:02] <cge> mzli: Often in bizarre ways, like using a Dapper LiveCD to install Edgy.
[09:02] <mitrovarr> morphix:  well, you could just dupe the current file and use an interim one.
[09:02] <domster> Does anyone know where vino-server logs to. Or, because it doesn't seem to log anywhere, how to make it log somewhere - I'm having auth issues.
[09:02] <BeanBag>  Flannel: thanks, will try that out
[09:02] <mitrovarr> morphix:  but if you really don't wanna use x, did you try to get that file the way I suggested?
[09:02] <avagant> Ok with xchat-gnome is there a way I can change where the users are?
[09:03] <compudaze> BeanBag: vmware-server-console
[09:03] <compudaze> BeanBag: i haven't found a 64-bit binary
[09:03] <cge> avagant: No (it's xchat GNOME!)
[09:03] <morphix> would it be better to use the drivers from the nvidia site or just compile my own  kernel modules?
[09:03] <Flannel> !nvidia | morphix
[09:03] <ubotu> morphix: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:03] <mitrovarr> morphix:  it's the same thing, the driver from nvidia compiles itself for your kernle
[09:03] <morphix> mitrovarr: yeh manually typed out the url (eek) and its downloading atm
[09:03] <compudaze> you're not really compiling the module anyway, it's closed source, you're just making it work with your kernel
[09:03] <avagant> no but i mean i don't like the popup list.
[09:03] <mzli> <cge>hoho~ ,  I install system almost daily recently.
[09:03] <mitrovarr> morphix:  that's why I mentioned making sure you had the right GCC, sometimes the module is a pain
[09:04] <abnerian_> Hey, how do I tell what version of madwifi I have installed?
[09:04] <avagant> I want the popup list to show on the side.
[09:04] <avagant> So I can actually tell who's in the room.
[09:04] <BeanBag>  compudaze: but for watching movies, songs and running cedega is 64bit okay?
[09:04] <tich> cge, that's funny i used a dapper livecd to install edgy as well! (but now i am going to do it cleanly)
[09:04] <mzli> <cge>i'd like to try each *nix system
[09:04] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I'm pretty sure you do compile it, because I've had the module bitching about the wrong kernel version, wrong gcc used, etc. just like a module.
[09:04] <cge> avagant: Yes, you can't do that in xchat-gnome. You could install xchat though.
[09:04] <avagant> DANG
[09:04] <avagant> well I have both.
[09:04] <tich> cge, did you have any major problems when you did it?
[09:04] <avagant> haha
[09:04] <cge> tich: No. You used debootstrap?
[09:04] <avagant> So I just learned how to dualboot, and I'm super proud of myself.
[09:04] <compudaze> the actual drive part is closed source.
[09:04] <compudaze> driver
[09:05] <compudaze> you do compile stuff
[09:05] <abnerian_> I learned how to dual boot before I learned what ls meant.
[09:05] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  makes sense
[09:05] <abnerian_> Because I REALLY liked gaming.
[09:05] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I know it's not open source but I thought you still compiled it
[09:05] <cge> avagant: The actual xchat is in universe though, if you install the xchat package.
[09:05] <avagant> Well I tried dual booting with linux first.
[09:05] <tich> cge, what is debootstrap... so, i probably didn't use it :)
[09:05] <JayFM> I'm back :)
[09:05] <avagant> And that didn't work.
[09:05] <cge> avagant: That has the user list type that you want.
[09:05] <mitrovarr> anyone know if neverwinter 2 runs on linux?  1 did.
[09:05] <cge> tich: How did you install Edgy with the Dapper cd then?
[09:05] <avagant> So I spent all afternoon downloading windows, THEN netbooting Ubuntu.
[09:05] <abnerian_> Does anyone here know how I might go about telling what version of Madwifi I have installed?
[09:06] <avagant> ERr installing windows I might say.
[09:06] <compudaze> BeanBag: yeah it's good for that, but i need to run binary distributed apps that only are available in 32-bit
[09:06] <cge> avagant: Was it a downloaded copy :)
[09:06] <tich> cge, i installed dapper then upgraded using the update manager
[09:06] <avagant> No it was a completely legal version :D
[09:06] <morphix> mitrovarr: what was the *-dev packages i needed apart from xorg-dev ? there were a few errors during the installation
[09:06] <cge> tich: Ah. A fresh install should help then.
[09:07] <JayFM> Hey, can someone please help me. I have a WPA-PSK (TKIP) enrypted network, although i can't connect to it. Can someone please help me?
[09:07] <progek> can someone help me set up the java jdk? I had no problem in dapper but for some reason it's not working in edgy. I downloaded the latest version from sun, stored it in /usr/local and adding a path in my bashrc. When I check my javac version it shows gcj and there is no alternative using update-alternatives
[09:07] <compudaze> morphix: u should have build-essential probably
[09:07] <mitrovarr> morphix:  I don't know, sorry.  You need build-essentials to make the module, I'm sure
[09:07] <xcess>  How can we setup PATH variable for x-windows session?
[09:07] <morphix> compudaze: already have that, needed that to actually compile :P
[09:07] <ekalavya> try automatix progek
[09:07] <tich> cge, great.  i kinda enjoy reinstalling anyhow. it is somewhat meditative.
[09:07] <cge> avagant: I actually use a downloaded copy even though I have a proper licence, because it installs more cleanly.
=== toarn_ is now known as toarn
[09:07] <compudaze> would hurt to install automake1.9 either, duno if it's needed
[09:07] <ekalavya> go to http://getautomatox.com
[09:07] <ekalavya> go to http://getautomatix.com
[09:07] <mitrovarr> morphix:  It takes a little bit of work to make the module-compiler work.  It's a pain.  I wish I remembered how, but I don't think there's any other way to make it work than to do it this way.
[09:07] <avagant> Yah the version I have actually installs within 2 hours.
[09:07] <progek> thanks
[09:08] <BeanBag> have anyone here tried Cedega before?
[09:08] <cge> ! automatix | progek
[09:08] <compudaze> you also need your kernel source, may need to tell the NVIDIA prog where the headers are
[09:08] <ubotu> progek: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[09:08] <Flannel> ekalavya: please don't recommend automatix here
[09:08] <avagant> cge: Actually I just have the media version.
[09:08] <mitrovarr> BeanBag:  I made it from source, but not the pay version.
[09:08] <avagant> cge: But hey it works and it gets the job done.
[09:08] <morphix> compudaze: i installed the kernel headers when i made and installed this kernel
[09:08] <BeanBag>  mitrovarr: where can i get the source? is it hard to compile?
[09:08] <compudaze> what errors do you get then?
[09:09] <avagant> Plus I have sound in it, and that's a major thing. That's how I got into this Ubuntu mess in the first place :D
[09:09] <Flannel> progek: whats wrong with the jdk in the repositories?
[09:09] <progek> well, I think it's just a path problem
[09:09] <zerosmoke> ok total newb to irc here, anyone have a copy?
[09:09] <morphix> compudaze: only missing *-dev packages but the installer still works
[09:09] <progek> well, can't compile advanced java apps, it chokes and complains
[09:09] <cge> zerosmoke: What?
[09:09] <mitrovarr> BeanBag:  You get the source from the CVS repository; they have instructions on how to get it on the cedega site.  There's good instructions on how to compile it online, as well as scripts to help.
[09:09] <morphix> for xorg-dev etc
[09:09] <Flannel> progek: the sun jdk?
[09:09] <Flannel> progek: it's the same jdk you'll get from the sun site
[09:10] <morphix> nvm.. seemed it only needed xorg-dev
[09:10] <morphix> :)
[09:10] <tich> cge, thanks for all the help.
[09:10] <zerosmoke> :cge: ok
[09:10] <morphix> brb.. testing this
[09:10] <JayFM> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=293864
[09:10] <JayFM> Can someone please help me?
[09:10] <compudaze> xorg-dev is more than enough, i'm sure it really only needs some of those packages
[09:10] <mitrovarr> BeanBag:  the compiled version is not as good though because it doesn't have the copy protection things.  Really, it quite sucks.  I never got it to run any games more than incredibly half-assed.
[09:10] <cge> tich: Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
[09:10] <gaurav> hello channel
[09:10] <cge> zerosmoke: What do you mean?
[09:10] <gaurav> I'm not able to install printer in Edgy.
[09:10] <zerosmoke> sorry, cb talk
[09:11] <gaurav> via gnome-cups-add
[09:11] <zerosmoke> testing to make sure its working
[09:11] <mitrovarr> So, does anyone know which linux-image version I use for 64-bit on a core 2 duo?
[09:11] <cge> gaurav: What happens?
[09:11] <morphius> JayFM: you may need to be using wpa supplicant to connect to wpa networks
[09:11] <compudaze> mitrovarr: linux-image-generic
[09:11] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  thanks.
[09:11] <tich> cge, don't apologize, you saw this process through to the end. no one could ask anything else of someone.
[09:11] <cge> zerosmoke: Ah, then yes, it is working.
[09:11] <JayFM> I've had a little look around, but i can't find out how to configure it.
[09:11] <compudaze> you need to get it from the binary_amd64 archive though it you want a 64-bit system
[09:11] <gaurav> cge, wait a minute I'm pasting
[09:11] <zerosmoke> hey anyway...installing xubuntu alternate install and it goes fine until i run into configuring anthy...anyone run into same problem?
[09:11] <morphius> mitrovarr: the combined the 386 and 64 kernel into one
[09:11] <cge> gaurav: Where?
[09:12] <JayFM> http://www.debianadmin.com/enable-wpa-wireless-access-point-in-ubuntu-linux.html
[09:12] <JayFM> That's the sign :)
[09:12] <compudaze> mitrovarr: if you're not running 64-bit now you'll have to reinstall the amd64 version
[09:12] <JayFM> sight*
[09:12] <compudaze> anthy?
[09:12] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I am, I just wanted to make sure I had the right kernel (like with the 386/k7/686 ones)
[09:12] <quattromaggio> raga
[09:12] <morphix> thanks guys.. worked perfect :)
[09:12] <quattromaggio> che repo posso usare?
[09:13] <cge> JayFM: I can never get wpa_supplicant to work without it doing something stupid, like resetting the connection every ~10 seconds.
[09:13] <compudaze> mitrovarr: if you do uname -a you'll see it's it's 64bit
[09:13] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  I know I'm running 64 bit.  I just wanted to make sure I had the proper optimized kernel, like getting the K7 kernel for amd 32 bit proccessors.
[09:13] <compudaze> mine says i686, but if you're amd64 it should read something like X86_64
[09:13] <zerosmoke> compudaze: apparently its a japanese text software or something for linux
[09:13] <JayFM> Lol, well what am i supposed to do?
[09:13] <JayFM> I need this connection.
[09:13] <JayFM> :S
[09:14] <cge> JayFM: Don't use wpa? :(
[09:14] <compudaze> mitrovarr: there's basicly 3 for ubuntu, 386, generic, server - everything else is deprecated in edgy
[09:14] <progek> it has a problem with the formatter object among scanner and using tomcat with servlets. I downloaded the sun jdk just like I did last time but I am trying to just add a path. I can compile within the bin directory from my jdk
[09:14] <JayFM> I don't have a choice :(
[09:14] <cge> JayFM: I'm sure someone else in here can help you.
[09:14] <gaurav> cge, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30393/
[09:14] <mitrovarr> compudaze:  i just upgraded, so I did not know that.  Thanks.
[09:14] <compudaze> np
[09:14] <JayFM> Well help me find someone :P
[09:14] <JayFM> (Please)
[09:14] <progek> but not outside the folder
[09:14] <gaurav> cge, my printer is attached to server running Dapper
[09:14] <compudaze> i should goto sleep i guess
[09:15] <gaurav> cge, and I'm running Edgy
[09:15] <cge> gaurav: You are running it with sudo or gksudo, right?
[09:15] <mitrovarr> compudaze: laters, and thanks for the help
[09:15] <aldwin> is there anyone that could help me install the ubuntu 6.10. it didnt work with my desktop computer with the processor of amd2 x2 64bit with asus m2npv-mx??? (please do help me, i can chat via pm too)
[09:15] <zerosmoke> what's the problem aldwin?
[09:15] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  Mention your specific problems and if anyone knows the solution, we'll tell you
[09:16] <aldwin> okay
[09:16] <aldwin> wait
[09:16] <cge> aldwin: And if no one knows, we'll ignore you, or argue about what you need to do.
[09:16] <mitrovarr> cge:  too true :-)
[09:16] <gaurav> cge, yes
[09:16] <aldwin> pls wait
[09:16] <zerosmoke> aldwin:  or we'll give you paypal email accounts first
[09:17] <zoople> hey, does anyone know a good p2p software? tried amule..doesnt seem to download and frostwire doesnt load..any suggestiongs
[09:17] <zerosmoke> bearshare
[09:17] <gaurav> cge, I've installed from scratch
[09:17] <zoople> for linux?
[09:17] <aldwin> first i did download the image of 6.10 abuntu then burn it in the cd rom
[09:17] <zerosmoke> mmm...you got me there
[09:17] <cge> cge,  let me think
[09:17] <gaurav> cge, I'm running gnome-cups-add with gksu
[09:17] <charlie5> hello ... does anyone know what would cause this when running an app ? .....    /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied
[09:18] <aldwin> i did reboot my pc and then the cd client was the one working (nothings wrong with that). Until when i enter the choice of installing it in my computer.
[09:18] <cge> charlie5: It means that the app isn't executable.
[09:18] <aldwin> there... nothing happens...
[09:18] <aldwin> :(
[09:18] <JayFM> Sorry, but can anyone here help me connect to a WPA-PSK (TKIP) secured network. I have a Netgear 108Mb/s Wireless PCI adapter (WG311T). Ta.
[09:18] <cge> gaurav: Ok, so what happens when you try to add it with gnome-cups-add. I can't tell from the output.
[09:18] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  is your keyboard working?  does up and down do anything?  my motherboard doesn't handle USB keyboards without drivers
[09:19] <compudaze> stupid xchat-gnome keeps crashing
[09:19] <cge> compudaze: Have you tried plain xchat?
[09:19] <iwaterball> charlie5: most common cause: you're running a shell script that had been converted to a dos text file rather then a unix text file, used dos2unix
[09:19] <compudaze> anyone know if xchat-gnome supports virtual hosts?
[09:19] <Flannel> compudaze: install plain xchat, it's in universe
[09:19] <gaurav> cge, printer doesn't get installed
[09:19] <compudaze> cge: it doesn't look as pretty ;p
[09:19] <Karass> Hi, can anyone suggest a substitute app for adobe illustrator/fotoshop?
[09:19] <aldwin> yes, my keyboard is working
[09:19] <cge> gaurav: But it runs fine?
[09:19] <mitrovarr> Karass:  GIMP for fotoshop
[09:19] <compudaze> does xchat allow you to bind to an ip alias?
[09:19] <gaurav> cge, what runs fine ?
[09:19] <zerosmoke> karass, mgi photosuite
[09:19] <aldwin> mitrovar: my keyboard works
[09:19] <JayFM> !wpa
[09:19] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:20] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  so you hit enter on the install and it just hangs there?
[09:20] <Karass> zerdith: ok, phptpsuite? in universe? And what about illustrator?
[09:20] <aldwin> mitrovarr: it did work and i did choose installing it in my hard drvive but nothing happens
[09:20] <charlie5> iwaterball: thats sounds likely ... ui may have de-cpmpressed the gzipped  tarball wrong ?
[09:20] <cge> gaurav: I mean, gnome-cups-add doesn't give you any errors? It runs as it should, but then doesn't add the printer?
[09:20] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  no error messages?
[09:20] <aldwin> mitrovarr: it just ended with the logo of ubuntu in block and white and the computer stops right there.
[09:20] <gaurav> cge, yes it doesn't give any error dialog boxes
[09:20] <charlie5> cge: thanks ... the binary seems to have 'x' mode set
[09:20] <aldwin> mitrovarr: no, no message at all.
[09:21] <cge> gaurav: Oh dear, let me think for a moment.
[09:21] <iwaterball> charlie5: no but someone might compressed it wrong
[09:21] <compudaze> we'll see if this is any better
[09:21] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  hmm.... it's a desktop, right?
[09:21] <zerosmoke> aldwin, that happened to me with xubuntu install, so i tried alternate install...so far it worked up to configuring anthy
[09:21] <charlie5> iwaterball: thank you ... i'll try dos2unix :)
[09:21] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  oh, good idea, do the alternative install disk
[09:21] <zerosmoke> how much ram you got aldwin?
[09:21] <aldwin> ah okay.
[09:22] <Flannel> zerosmoke: you might try asking in #xubuntu, they'd have a better chance of knowing
[09:22] <aldwin> so how can i do the alternative install disk???
[09:22] <zerosmoke> ...
[09:22] <zerosmoke> i thought that's where i was
[09:22] <charlie5> iwaterball: do you know which package has dos2unix ?
[09:22] <iwaterball> Karass: for vector drawing try inkscape
[09:22] <zerosmoke> duhhhhhh
[09:22] <Flannel> zerosmoke: nope, this is #ubuntu ;)
[09:22] <cge> gaurav: The best option in your case, since you have a root password, is to edit the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf to allow the web configuration system, and then use that.
[09:22] <zerosmoke> ok, over and out
[09:22] <cge> gaurav: I haven't had too much success with gnome-cups-add
[09:22] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  go download it from the ubuntu site, burn it, and then boot off of it just like the other one
[09:22] <gaurav> cge, Okay
[09:22] <cge> Karass: Yes, Inkscape is very good.
[09:22] <aldwin> okay thank you...
[09:22] <aldwin> thanks to you all
[09:23] <compudaze> ahh yes, xchat does support ip binding
[09:23] <iwaterball> charlie5: sorry, I'm too fasr from my ubuntu to check for you, try a search in packages.ubuntu.com
[09:23] <Karass> iwaterball: yeah, i've tried that. but it hardly is enough. Just take a look at all those filters and easy functionality on illustrator. if there are plugins in the repos, i've not seen any.
[09:23] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  That might really help because the problem may be some hardware incompatibility with the liveCD
[09:23] <cge> Karass: I believe Photoshop will run in Wine, as well.
[09:23] <gaurav> cge, Unable to copy PPD file!
[09:23] <charlie5> iwaterball: not a prob ... i can check myself ... thanks again
[09:23] <gaurav> cge, ^^^ error at web interface
[09:23] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  It'll bypass all that, since the other one doesn't boot into X or anything
[09:23] <gaurav> cge, BtW, my printer is HP LaserJet 3050 present in HPLIP distribution
[09:23] <cge> gaurav: Sounds like a problem with the ipp server.
[09:23] <Intimate`>  http://juicer.moviecity.hop.clickbank.net   http://juicer.richjerk.hop.clickbank.net  - pick one =] 
[09:24] <cge> gaurav: Ah, it could be a problem with hplip over the network, maybe.
[09:24] <gaurav> cge, lemme try to add network printer
[09:24] <gaurav> s/network/local/
[09:25] <SurfnKid> cge, im back
[09:25] <SurfnKid> got it all copied, done
[09:25] <cge> SurfnKid: Good
[09:25] <JayFM> Sorry, but can anyone here help me connect to a WPA-PSK (TKIP) secured network? I have a Netgear 108Mb/s Wireless PCI adapter (WG311T).
[09:25] <SurfnKid> thanks for the command, very useful for the future
[09:25] <aldwin> mitrovar: am i doing the right thing? downloading the ubuntu-6.10-alternative-amd64.iso???
[09:25] <cge> JayFM: Try asking on the forums or (better yet) the mailing list.
[09:26] <cge> SurfnKid: Yes, loop mounting is very useful.
[09:26] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  You are if you have a 64 bit processor
[09:26] <mitrovarr> aldwin:  Do you?
[09:26] <JayFM> I've asked on the forums, but i'll try the mailing list.
[09:27] <cge> JayFM: I've found that the mailing list tends to be best.
[09:27] <iwaterball> Karass: filters in a verctor drawing program?
[09:28] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  they exist, they're just vector filters
[09:28] <gaurav> cge, I've tried HP driver in a local printer it failed to install
[09:28] <cge> gaurav: Hmm...
[09:28] <gaurav> cge, but when I tried Apple printer's PPD in local and network, both worked fine
[09:28] <cge> gaurav: Does the laserjet that you have actually need HPLIP, or can it use another driver?
[09:29] <gaurav> gaurav, I also tried using Casio's ppd it failed too
[09:29] <Slothbag1> anyone know how to run setterm -powersave  remotely? i get cannot un(set) powersave
[09:29] <gaurav> cge, it needs HPLIP
[09:29] <cge> gaurav: Hmm...
[09:29] <cge> gaurav: And hplip is installed?
[09:29] <gaurav> cge, as PPD is present in the HPLIP distribution
[09:29] <iwaterball> mitrovarr: that is almost impossible, sicne you can't impement fileter math on vector graphics, maybe you can convert vector to raster and then filter, but then you lose data
[09:29] <gaurav> cge, and hplip is running
[09:30] <Vuen> hey guys, can cfdisk resize an ext2 partition without erasing the data?
[09:30] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  They just affect everything, like a filter.  Like deformation filters can easily be applied to vectors
=== Slothbag1 is now known as slothbag
[09:30] <cge> gaurav: Which laserjet was it again?
=== slothbag is now known as slothbag1
[09:30] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  maybe it's a different technical mechanism, but they're still called filters?
[09:30] <iwaterball> mitrovarr: that kind of filetr exists in inkcape afaik
[09:31] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  I see, it's just a matter of terminology
[09:31] <seamus7> Anyone know about Panel Applet background transparency problems in Edgy?
[09:31] <cge> Vuen: no, but parted and gparted can.
[09:32] <xyzone> can gparted resize ext3?
[09:32] <gaurav> cge, HP LaserJet 3050
[09:32] <iwaterball> mitrovarr: stoff like brightness/contrast, gussian blur, edge find, etc. cannot afaik be implemented in vector graphics, this is ususally what CG artists mean when they say "filters" (the term comes from signal processing)
[09:32] <Vuen> cge: parted segfaults while trying to resize my ext2 partition.
[09:33] <cge> gaurav: You can just use the postscript driver instead.
[09:33] <gaurav> cge, it works fine with Dapper running on other boxes with separately installed PPD
[09:33] <mandelum> is there any way of controlling the fan on a loptop?
[09:33] <slothbag1> can anyone help with setterm & edgy
[09:33] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  Oh, no, of course not.  But you can do things like color effects, deformations, geometry changes, etc.
[09:33] <gaurav> cge, yes I'm trying to use that postscript PPD with that printer
[09:33] <zoople> trying to install limewire and am getting: Extracting the installation resources from the installer archive...
[09:33] <zoople> Configuring the installer for this system's environment...
[09:33] <zoople> No Java virtual machine could be found from your PATH
[09:33] <zoople> environment variable.  You must install a VM prior to
[09:33] <zoople> running this program.
[09:33] <gaurav> cge, not hpijs PPD
[09:33] <cge> gaurav: Oh
[09:33] <zoople> i have java installed
[09:34] <cge> gaurav: And that isn't working either?
[09:34] <iwaterball> mitrovarr: I suppose Karass should teel us exactly what he is looking for
[09:34] <river> cge, I is back. any further ideas before I blow away these partitions ? ... I might just google for device mapper and mounting lvm partitions
[09:34] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  and I've seen blur filters in vector graphics, they just make things partially transparant toward the edges.  Basically they make solid lines into lines with gradient edges.
[09:34] <cge> river: You could do that. When did you install Ubuntu on it? Do you know if it was using the device-manager?
[09:34] <cge> river: Err, mapper
[09:34] <Vuen> i'm gonna go try partition magic
[09:34] <Vuen> gah
[09:34] <gaurav> gaurav, yes that is not working, HPLIP (in Edgy) ships with that PPD
[09:34] <Jaeke555> Anyone know why I can't get to the internet? I get IP from DHCP and everything seems to work as far as to my gateway but nothing past it...
[09:34] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  I worked as a graphics artist for a little while and I was amazed what they could do with vector filters.
[09:35] <iwaterball> mitrovarr: I see, filters without filtering...
[09:35] <cge> gaurav: So you've tried both PPDs, and neither one works, right?
[09:35] <rihui> hi
[09:35] <rihui> i have a question
[09:35] <gaurav> cge, yes
[09:35] <thyko> does ubuntu have a text only runlevel?
[09:36] <rihui> is it possible to skip filesystem checking for vfat partitions?
[09:36] <cge> gaurav: And the printer is connected directly to the other computer, not via jetdirect?
[09:36] <iwaterball> mitrovarr: no reason why such stuff shouldn't be in inscape, does it has an extension language a-la script-foo?
[09:36] <thyko> im using it on a server and dont need X mostly
[09:36] <gaurav> cge,  yes plugged into server via USB
[09:36] <rihui> i have 3 vfat partitions and the checking process during bootup takes like 1 and a half minutes
[09:36] <cge> gaurav: ok
[09:36] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  No idea, I've never used it.  My experience is with illustrator
[09:36] <thyko> any ideas?
[09:36] <mitrovarr> iwaterball:  i'm installing it as we speak though, so hopefully I'll know in a bit
[09:37] <iwaterball> thyko: ubuntu does not assign meaning to runlevels the way redhat, etc. do; if you want text-oly, simply uninstall gdm
[09:37] <river> cge, I installed 5.10 when it came out then upg'ded to 6.06 and then the other day while upgrading to 6.10 the upgrade the machine was shutdown half way through leaving it unbootable...I do vaguely remember asking it to use LVM on the original install because I knew I had multiple drives and eventually may want to span the devices seemlessly.
[09:37] <cge> river: I think all of those used dm
[09:38] <zoople> any ideas on my problem?
[09:38] <jaaroo> hello there. I've bought a new disk and would like to know if there is any recommended method how shoud I copy root partition from one disk to another. Partition sizes are not equal (target partition is smaller)
[09:38] <smoenux> Hey everyone
[09:38] <zoople> "No Java virtual machine could be found from your PATH variable:
[09:38] <chuckyp> jaaroo, there are several ways to do it.
[09:38] <CarinArr> aw
[09:39] <smoenux> Can anyone tell me if SATA II Hard Drives give any hassles with Edgy? I remember seeing stuff on that somewhere.
[09:39] <cge> river: I'm looking at the lvm2 docs right now.
[09:39] <Vuen> argh. incredible frustration trying to partition my drive. i just want to expand an ext2 partition to use up the remaining free space on the drive. parted segfaults, and partition magic gives "Error #702", a lovely undocumented error with no explanation whatsoever.
[09:40] <chuckyp> jaaroo, check out partimage
[09:40] <cge> gaurav: You should probably take a look at the CUPS documentation
[09:40] <chuckyp> jaaroo, you should be able to image your current partition and move it.
[09:40] <gaurav> cge, looking
[09:40] <river> cge, p.s. when booting from hdd I see "vmlinus root=/dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root"
[09:40] <cge> river: Yes.
[09:40] <cge> river: So in the livecd, can you run lvdisplay?
[09:40] <gaurav> cge, Thanks and BtW, you're a good multi-tasker. Keep context-switching ;-)
[09:41] <river> .cge, standby
[09:41] <river> cge, command not found
[09:41] <chuckyp> jaaroo, http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/partimage
[09:41] <cge> river: Hmm... try apt-get installing lvm2
[09:42] <ekimus> Vuen:  i wouldn't let partition magic touch anything else than fat or ntfs if you love your data
[09:42] <river> cge, standby
[09:42] <Vuen> ekimus: i'm trying again and it seems to be working. apparently it didn't like ext2ifs.
[09:43] <river> cge, is it on the livecd ? as I don't have the wireless stuff working on the livecd yet
[09:43] <Vuen> ekimus: it's resizing my ext2 partition right now; it's checking for inodes, so it seems at least somewhat aware that data exists on the drive. we'll find out soon whether it makes any effort to keep it.
[09:44] <ekimus> Vuen:  shouldn't there be a ext[23] resize (something like that) available in ubuntu. I think its default mode is to expand the filesystem to the size of the partition (note: expand only - for shrinking there's more to be done)
[09:44] <Vuen> honestly it's just 55 gigs of pirated media. i'm in canada, so it's half legal to have, but honestly i'd deserve it if it just deleted all this data
[09:44] <iwaterball> Vuen: you might want to check your partition table with the linux fdisk, some partitioning tools tend to make a mess out of your partition table that makes other tools crush... (fdisk has a "v" command to verify)
[09:44] <SurfnKid> Vuen, what is it
[09:44] <lupine_85> !info ubuntu-standard feisty
[09:44] <ubotu> ubuntu-standard: The Ubuntu standard system. In component main, is standard. Version 1.30 (edgy), package size 15 kB, installed size 44 kB
[09:44] <Vuen> just tv shows
[09:45] <SurfnKid> whats so illegal about that
[09:45] <cge> river: Oh.
[09:45] <cge> river: I don't think it is.
[09:45] <Vuen> SurfnKid: um, well in the states, media piracy is illegal. downloading movies, tv shows, music, etc.
[09:45] <river> ok, I'll try and reconfigure the wireless to get online from that box
[09:45] <cge> river: Use a dapper livecd if you have one.
[09:45] <river> cge, sorry see above
[09:45] <lupine_85> but teh USA is teh sux0r :p
[09:45] <Vuen> uhohes, looks like partition magic crashed
[09:46] <river> cge, don't have a dapper live only alternate
[09:46] <cge> river: ah
[09:46] <SurfnKid> Vuen, very soon all 3 countries will have equal laws, i agree, delete it
[09:46] <Vuen> the hard drive's still thinking but the window froze. i'll let it do its thing. time for a snack.
[09:46] <lupine_85> resist the DMCA :D
[09:46] <SurfnKid> the North American Union is going to destroy Mexico and Canada's independence
[09:46] <cge> river: Apparently, LVM was removed from the Edgy LiveCD.
[09:46] <mzli> <SurfnKid> ???
[09:46] <Vuen> SurfnKid: i highly doubt that. canada and the uk are going in the opposite direction of the united states in terms of media piracy
[09:46] <SurfnKid> mzli, its coming
[09:46] <visik7> anyone has mouse issues with vmware workstation on linux guest ?
[09:47] <livingdaylight> anyone has success installing Opera from repositories?
[09:47] <Vuen> SurfnKid: no, it's not. canada has basically legalized downloading movies and music for personal use.
[09:47] <Juhaz> there's nothing inherently illegal about the files, the act of downloading may be illegal, depending on who you ask, uploading is definitely illegal, but once you have them... it's just file
[09:47] <SurfnKid> Vuen, would really hope so
[09:47] <SurfnKid> ah
[09:47] <river> cge, I see.. trying to configure wireless
[09:47] <iwaterball> visik7: worked fine for me, then again I switched to SSH as soon as the VM could network
[09:47] <SurfnKid> well lets hope it backfires, some US laws about media just need to be left alone
[09:48] <visik7> iwaterball: I use vmware primary to test livecds but the mouse is 10 time slower on guest than host
[09:48] <chuckyp> So does the mozilla-plugin-vlc  actualy work or is it broken?
[09:48] <iwaterball> visik7: I suppose you didn't install the vmware tools, this might be a hardware thing... :P
[09:49] <iwaterball> visik7: like I said, worked fine for me
[09:49] <crimsun> chuckyp: it's broken. We know about it.
[09:49] <Vuen> well i'll be damned. it actually worked. i now have a 120 gig ext2 partition with 50 gigs of video.
[09:49] <visik7> iwaterball: I can't install vmware tool for every livecd
[09:49] <livingdaylight> is Linux kompletely broken, or just a constant work in progress?
[09:49] <Vuen> i'm a happy camper.
[09:49] <visik7> iwaterball: btw I mean on edgy on dapper no problem
[09:49] <lupine_85> constant WIP :)
[09:49] <chuckyp> crimsun, any work around or fix?
[09:49] <chuckyp> crimsun, or should I say will it be fixed.
[09:49] <lupine_85> read "the cathedral and the bazaar"
[09:49] <crimsun> chuckyp: it will be fixed.
[09:49] <iwaterball> visik7: can't help you there, I was VMwaring centos
[09:50] <Vuen> livingdaylight: um, neither? sorry to break it to you, but most of the internet runs on linux
[09:50] <crimsun> livingdaylight: yes.
[09:50] <zoople> do i dare ask about graphics drivers for linux?
[09:50] <Vuen> zoople: do ask
[09:50] <CarinArr> zoople, what card?
[09:50] <zoople> gforce go 6600
[09:50] <lupine_85> !nvidia
[09:50] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:50] <CarinArr> then, yes, you're allowed to ask;)
[09:50] <livingdaylight> Vuen, yea, Apache is a mean warrior... ^^
[09:50] <CarinArr> zoople, shouldn't be a problem
[09:50] <Vuen> zoople: that card will work great with linux.
[09:50] <zoople> cool :D
[09:50] <livingdaylight> crimsun, arrrr.....
[09:50] <Vuen> including cedega with plenty of games, like counter-strike, etc
[09:51] <Cromag> is internet = homepages for you guys ?
[09:51] <river> cge, ok have wireless going and online, apt-get install lvm2 in progress
[09:51] <zoople> lol so should find everthin in need in those pages?
[09:51] <zoople> or is there some tricks?
[09:51] <livingdaylight> Anyone here own the G2X ?
[09:51] <lupine_85> it's a 2-line job :D
[09:51] <lupine_85> really easy
[09:51] <Vuen> zoople: should all be there. nvidia drivers are pretty easy to install on linux.
[09:51] <cge> river: good
[09:51] <zoople> k thanks ill have a look
[09:51] <zoople> !nvidia
[09:51] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:52] <chuckyp> Vuen, don't need cedega for counter-strike
[09:52] <tcr> Has anyone a clue about that mandb(8), manpath(1) thingie? I suspect it's coming from debian... I want to say that ~/software/*/man is to be searched, if the respective directory exists. With the traditional approach of using environmental variables ($MANPATH), it was just so easy to make it work, sigh.
[09:52] <Vuen> chuckyp: oh? it runs natively on linux?
[09:52] <livingdaylight> anyone know whether Opera download from their homesite only available for Dapper also works in Edgy?
[09:52] <chuckyp> Vuen, no you can use wine to run it.
[09:53] <cge> livingdaylight: I'm nearly certain it does.
[09:53] <Vuen> oh. :/
[09:53] <chuckyp> Vuen, atleast thats what I use and its free.  Cedega costs money.
[09:53] <Vuen> well... cedega is supposed to cost money...
[09:53] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, it should work
[09:53] <chuckyp> Vuen, yes.
[09:53] <compudaze> isn't cedega a fork of wine?
[09:54] <livingdaylight> cge, arrrr....'guess i'll have to just try. Why Canonical repos advertise Opera but then is not available...bothers me
[09:54] <Vuen> compudaze: yep.
[09:54] <river> cge, ok install done. tried lvdisplay again and it says "lvdisplay" not found for your version of lvm
[09:54] <cge> river: try running /lib/lvm-200/lvdisplay
[09:54] <Vuen> compudaze: it's a fork of wine from when it was under the X11 license, before they switched to GPL. that's why cedega is proprietary
[09:54] <compudaze> ah i see
[09:54] <chuckyp> compudaze, yeah a pay to play fork
[09:55] <khaije1> !xen
[09:55] <ubotu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy
[09:55] <compudaze> so they charge for it now?
[09:55] <L3oN> Hi
[09:55] <cge> Vuen: Is it actually proprietary or is it just that they charge for binaries? I seem to recall a cvs of it somewhere.
[09:55] <vegiVamp> they charge for binaries
[09:56] <compudaze> so u can compile it yourself?
[09:56] <Vuen> cge: there is a cvs, but they highly discourage people from actually using it.
[09:56] <volvoguy> hey guys, a few days ago someone told me about a command to list all the packages installed on a system and i forgot to write it down. anyone know what i'm talking about?
[09:56] <vegiVamp> you pretty much pay for the work they do on it to get it to run the latest games
[09:56] <cge> Vuen: Of course. They want you to pay them.
[09:56] <vegiVamp> and as far as I remember, only the most recent version is payware.
[09:56] <compudaze> volvoguy, try, aptitude search ~i
[09:56] <river> cge, I like progress
[09:56] <L3oN> anyone know how i can make hidden names of files stay on desktop ?
[09:57] <cge> river: That command works?
[09:57] <volvoguy> compudaze, thanks! i don't think that was it but it did the trick!
[09:57] <vegiVamp> volvoguy: you probably saw dpkg -l
[09:57] <cge> L3oN: Ctrl-H?
[09:57] <zoople> ok, it said it installed (the GeForece Go 6600 drivers)..whats a quick way to check
[09:57] <gameover> who can help me with network manger?
[09:57] <L3oN> cge: just name....
[09:57] <volvoguy> vegiVamp, yeah i think it was dpkg or apt-cache related. *shrug* i got what i needed. :)
[09:58] <river> cge, yes it listed a pagefull ofinfo
[09:58] <lupine_85> if yiou restart X you'll get a nvidia screen splash :)
[09:58] <cge> river: ah
[09:58] <Vuen> zoople: how did you end up installing it? did you just activate multiverse and apt-get install nvidia-glx?
[09:58] <gameover> i cant connect to wireless encrypted with wep
[09:58] <lupine_85> !nvidia-glx
[09:58] <tcr> The gnome terminal doesn't seem heed $HOME/.profile, is that normal?
[09:58] <ubotu> nvidia-glx: NVIDIA binary XFree86 4.x/X.Org driver. In component restricted, is optional. Version 1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1 (edgy), package size 3970 kB, installed size 12312 kB
[09:58] <lupine_85> why activate multiverse?
[09:58] <zoople> i didnt do apt-get...i just found it in synaptic
[09:58] <cge> river: could you pastebin it somewhere, or put it in #flood?
[09:58] <Vuen> oh
[09:58] <Vuen> i thought it was in multiverse.
[09:58] <lupine_85> nah
[09:58] <cge> tcr: yes
[09:58] <Vuen> hmph.
[09:58] <lupine_85> :p
[09:58] <tcr> cge: rationale?
[09:59] <zoople> anyhoo, so is there a quick way to test?
[09:59] <fredl> dangit that Edgy upgrade is hosed. Display driver no longer worked but that was easily fixed. Sound driver no longer works. GNOME is broken. hpoj trashed my printer config...
[09:59] <lupine_85> restart X
[09:59] <cge> tcr: It isn't a login terminal, and shells don't read .profile unless they are login shells.
[09:59] <zoople> is that what i type?
[09:59] <lupine_85> ctrl+alt+backspace
[09:59] <zoople> ok
[09:59] <cge> tcr: There is an option in the preferences to have the shells started as login shells.
[09:59] <Vuen> fredl: lots of people have had edgy upgrade problems unfortunately. my suggestion is to tar up /home and /etc, and then install from scratch.
[09:59] <compudaze> zoople, run nvidia-settings
[09:59] <compudaze> the control panel should pop up
[09:59] <cge> tcr: Or you can use .bashrc if you are running bash.
[10:00] <lupine_85> fredl: make sure ubutu-desktop is still installed
[10:00] <Jaeke555> Hey fellas, what's the command for downloading the GUI for ubuntu? ( I got this: apt-get install ubuntu-desktop but it doesn't work )
[10:00] <fredl> this bothers me. One of the major advantages over Debian was always that the hardware detection on workstations worked near flawless....
[10:00] <Vuen> Jaeke555: the GUI? what do you mean?
[10:00] <compudaze> Jaeke555, what does it say?
[10:00] <tcr> cge: Yeah, I know. Didn't think of the login shell issue. Thank you.
[10:00] <cge> fredl: It probably has more to do with the upgrade.
[10:00] <Vuen> fredl: yeah. it's probably the upgrade's fault. does the sound work from the livecd?
[10:01] <fredl> cge - true, but the same could be said about running Debian unstable... upgrading Ubuntu for both Edgy and Dapper has been like Debian unstable in the years before.
[10:01] <volvoguy> i can never get nvidia-settings to "stick".
[10:01] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Graphical User Interface, like X Window system or something :D ( I'm so much a linux newbie )
[10:01] <cge> fredl: Yes, it is rather unfortunate.
[10:01] <Vuen> fredl: if you have a few hours to reconfigure things, you're probably best off reinstalling. if you have /home on a separate partition, you can keep all your settings, otherwise you can just tar up /home and restore it when you get it working again.
[10:01] <fredl> Vuen - didn't try the livecd, trying to recover some stuff here but it's taking me a lot of extra time.
[10:01] <cbx33> hmm - why when I try to remove nvidia-glx does it try to remove ubuntu-desktop and the entire xorg set of packages
[10:01] <cbx33> it never used to do that
[10:01] <Jaeke555> compudaze: it says E: Couldn't find package ubuntu-desktop
[10:02] <cge> Jaeke555: That is *bad*.
[10:02] <fredl> hang on, brb
[10:02] <Jaeke555> cge: How come? :)
[10:02] <Vuen> Jaeke555: did you install ubuntu from the alternate cd? it should come up with GNOME (a gui) automatically...
[10:02] <cge> Jaeke555: How did you install?
[10:02] <compudaze> Jaeke555, quick question... are you running Ubuntu?
[10:02] <Vuen> lawl
[10:02] <Jaeke555> vuen: I have the server version of ubuntu, thats why I don't have the GUI
[10:02] <Vuen> ah.
[10:02] <Jaeke555> compudaze: yeah, I am :)
[10:02] <compudaze> u can still install ubuntu-desktop from the server version
[10:03] <zoople> ok so i restart my system..how do i check the nvida drivers now
[10:03] <Vuen> Jaeke555: type: cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:03] <Vuen> and tell us what the uncommented lines say
[10:03] <river> cge, http://pastebin.ca/241541
[10:04] <Jaeke555> Vuen: umm, quick one, how do I stop the text flow? :D
[10:04] <Vuen> zoople: what do you mean by "check the drivers"? did you get an nvidia splash screen right before you logged in?
[10:04] <fredl> this is fubar, I just removed all of .gconf* and .gnome* and rebooted. When I log in using an existing login without those dirs, I end up with a completely white screen. When I log in with a newly created user ID, it all works.
[10:04] <zoople> nope
[10:04] <Vuen> Jaeke555: type this instead: less /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:04] <Vuen> that way you can pageup/pagedown to scroll and press q to exit
[10:04] <Vuen> for a default install you should have only four uncommented lines
[10:05] <zoople> so..no splash screen = no install?
[10:05] <Vuen> zoople: hmm, i'm not sure :(
[10:05] <Vuen> i don't know a whole lot about nvidia drivers, sorry
[10:05] <zoople> thats ok..does anyone?
[10:05] <fredl> I don't get it, how do I make gnome think it's completely, entirely fresh in a user's homedir?
[10:06] <Jaeke555> Vuen:  erse multiverse, universe multiverse
[10:06] <fredl> is there more than ~/.gconf* and ~/.gnome* ??
[10:06] <iwaterball> zoople: pretty much, though you can disable the spalsh screen in xorg.conf, I think it on by default
[10:06] <Vuen> Jaeke555: hold on, let me pastebin my sources.list for you
[10:06] <Jaeke555> Vuen: and then there are some lines saying: deb http://blaablaablaa dapper-updates main restrictled
[10:06] <compudaze> zoople, do you have nvidia instead of nv in your xorg.conf?
[10:06] <zoople> not sure
[10:07] <Vuen> Jaeke555: yeah, that's exactly what that should look like
[10:07] <iwaterball> zoople: you can try running the "glxinfo" command and see who is the GLX provider
[10:07] <compudaze> did you install the package nvidia-glx?
[10:07] <Vuen> Jaeke555: okay, start by typing sudo apt-get update
[10:07] <zoople> tup instlalled nvidia-glx
[10:07] <river> cge, does it look like non compat version of lvm too ?
[10:07] <compudaze> after that, did you run, nvidia-glx-config enable?
[10:07] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I don't want to update my ubuntu version, I just need the GUI :D
[10:07] <zoople>  extension "GLX" missing on display
[10:08] <zoople> ummmm: compudaze..i get: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[10:08] <zoople> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[10:08] <chuckyp> compudaze, I believe it runs by default when you install nvidia-glx
[10:08] <Vuen> Jaeke555: the update command doesn't update ubuntu, it just downloads the new package lists. the upgrade command updates your ubuntu, and the dist-upgrade command upgrades it. it's a bit counterintuitive, i know.
[10:08] <zoople> lol..maybe something went wrong
[10:08] <Vuen> blame debian for making apt confusing :)
[10:08] <Jaeke555> Vuen: okays, let me try that :D
[10:08] <compudaze> apt!=confusing =)
[10:08] <Jaeke555> vuen: it started doe
[10:09] <Vuen> yep. don't worry, apt-get update won't change or upgrade anything. it will just update the package lists.
[10:09] <Jaeke555> vuen: it started downloading some items and is done already
[10:09] <Vuen> that's good
[10:09] <Vuen> now sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[10:09] <cge> river: Sorry, was talking to someone in #ubuntu-bugs
[10:09] <Jaeke555> I did it, it gave me sh*tloads of packages, total of 1561MB of stuff :D
[10:09] <cge> river: Ah. It appears that the new root is /dev/Ubuntu/root. Does that exist?
[10:10] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Do I want to continue? :D I guess so
[10:10] <Vuen> Jaeke555: holy cow. what version of ubuntu did you install?
[10:10] <Jaeke555> Vuen: 6.06
[10:10] <Rothbuntu> O_o
[10:10] <what_if> is tunneling support broken in edgy ? I keep getting errors of "no such device" for devices that are listed in ifconfig
[10:10] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Don't shoot the messenger, I'm not gonna use it, I'm just the guy who's installing it
[10:10] <Vuen> Jaeke555: ah. heh. that's why it's sometimes better to install the desktop version of ubuntu, even if you intend it for a server. they don't really expect for you to need x on it, so it's pretty much stripped down to the bones :)
[10:11] <river> cge, sorry, how do I check
[10:11] <Vuen> Jaeke555: once it's done that, you should definitely do apt-get upgrade.
[10:11] <cge> river: Does that file actually exist?
[10:11] <BHSPitLappy> what_if, how are you referencing said devices
[10:11] <blinky> can someone tell me the url for ubuntu pastebin thing?
[10:11] <Vuen> this will download all the security patches and bug fixes for the system
[10:11] <Vuen> do that BEFORE rebooting, so that ubuntu-desktop doesn't screw anything up.
[10:11] <what_if> it is named '0000' referencing as '0000'
[10:12] <Vuen> don't worry, it won't upgrade you to ubuntu 6.10; it will just apply bug fixes and security updates
[10:12] <river> on one of the unmounted drives/partitions ? rember I'm in livecd at the mo
[10:12] <zoople> lol this isnt going so well..i installed it but its saying it didnt install
[10:12] <zoople> do i do something wrong?
[10:12] <what_if> BHSPitLappy: ifconfig lists as '0000-00' but I have tried that also
[10:12] <river> cde, sorry stilla newbie so sorry if vague at times
[10:12] <compudaze> welp, gonna compile cedega and goto sleep, will try it out in the morning
[10:12] <BHSPitLappy> what_if, are the zeros just for the sake of example, or is that what it actually says....
[10:12] <chie> Hi everybody...I have a hylafax question.  I am looking for something called: egetty ... but can't seem to find it.  Does anyone know where this is, or better yet, a replacement?
[10:12] <james296> Is it possible to get an alt-tab replacement that looks like the kind from Windows Vista, but without using xgl/compiz?
=== amedcj is now known as amedddcj
[10:13] <james296> since Im havin major troublle trying to get xgl/compiz
[10:13] <Vuen> :/
[10:13] <fredl> Hmmm
[10:13] <TLE> Hey I need a little advice with partitioning. I have a disc where there is a extended partition that contains 5 partitions, sdb5 sdb6 sdb8 sdb9 sdb7 in that order. Now I want to delete sdb8 and make 3 new partitions of it, but then it tell me to umount any partitions with a number higher than 8, now I can do that if I do it from a live cd. But I need to know if the partition with a higher number sdb9, will change name when I delete sdb8 and make 3 new ones sin
[10:13] <compudaze> james296, ati card?
[10:13] <james296> Nvidia
[10:13] <compudaze> edgy?
[10:13] <james296> Geforce FX 7300 GS
[10:13] <what_if> BHSPitLappy: the 0's are for real, also tried naming the tunnel 'gre1' and got the same error
[10:13] <fredl> I just completely moved my homedir and made a new one and now GNOME starts up properly again....
[10:13] <james296> yes, Edgy
[10:13] <compudaze> it was easy for me
[10:13] <Vuen> james296: have you spoken to anyone in #beryl? they might be able to help. if not, hop into #beryl-dev and give the devs your hardware and the problems you're having, so they can fix it at some point in the future
[10:14] <compudaze> u have the beta driver installed?
[10:14] <blinky> can anyone give me the URL for the ubuntu pastebin?? i have lost what i cannot find
[10:14] <what_if> BHSPitLappy: this only happens when I try to apply a route to the device
[10:14] <CarinArr> james296, give it to me, i'll give you my 5500;)
[10:14] <chie> == Hi everybody...I have a hylafax question.  I am looking for something called: egetty ... but can't seem to find it.  Does anyone know where this is, or better yet, a replacement? ==
[10:14] <fredl> and I was wrong apparently since sound does work....
[10:14] <james296> LOL
[10:14] <Vuen> blinky: you can just use pastebin.ca
[10:14] <iwaterball> TLE: it will change name, since the names are derived from the partition order
[10:14] <james296> I JUST HAD ONE
[10:14] <CarinArr> james296, lol
[10:14] <BHSPitLappy> what_if, not sure, and plus, I really really have to go... I shouldn't have even led you on, sorry :(
[10:14] <CarinArr> worth a shot
[10:14] <zoople> !nvidia
[10:14] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:14] <what_if> BHSPitLappy: is ok, i will keep looking online
[10:14] <BHSPitLappy> night
[10:14] <james296> well I installed it using Automatix2 lol
[10:14] <iwaterball> TLE: if you need that many partitions you're better off using LVM
[10:14] <blinky> Vuen, thanks buddy
[10:14] <BHSPitLappy> </BHSPitLappy>
[10:15] <compudaze> so you have the beta driver installed?
[10:15] <compudaze> u get the beta logo on X startup?
[10:15] <james296> probably
[10:15] <james296> lol
[10:15] <Vuen> TLE: sdb9 will probably change names, yes. you may want to refer to the partition in the fstab using its UUID instead of /dev/sdb9, that way it won't matter what sdb# it is.
[10:15] <compudaze> the white screen
[10:15] <CarinArr> out of interest, does anyone know if the vim version has changed between dapper and edgy? can't seem to get syntax highlighting in new version
[10:15] <river> cge certainly not a file with livecd booted. do you want me to try and mount it ?
[10:15] <CarinArr> or rather in edgy version
[10:15] <james296> the Nvidia screen?
[10:15] <james296> yes
[10:15] <james296> oh wait
[10:15] <james296> when I try to install xgl/compiz..
[10:16] <zoople> ooh is someone else having Nvidia troubles?
[10:16] <Vuen> compudaze: automatix won't install beta drivers afaik
[10:16] <TLE> iwaterball: Crap. Thank you for the info :: I'll check out LVM
[10:16] <compudaze> u dont need xgl
[10:16] <james296> I get a blue screen error that says it cant find my display device
[10:16] <Vuen> it will install the latex stable nvidia
[10:16] <Vuen> s/latex/latest <.< >.>
[10:16] <volvoguy> i've only installed the beta nvidia drivers on my laptop, but they seemed pretty solid.
[10:16] <what_if> does anyone know if tunneling support is broken in Ubuntu edgy? I keep having errors of "no such device" when trying to apply routes
[10:16] <james296> well beta sounds risky, maybe I should keep the STABLE driver? lol
[10:16] <compudaze> james296, try this: http://gandalfn.wordpress.com/howto/howto-compiz-aiglx-on-edgy
[10:16] <compudaze> u need the beta drivers installed 1st
[10:16] <cge> river: Yes
[10:16] <Vuen> james296: yeah, you definitely don't need the beta drivers
[10:16] <zoople> sudo nvidia-glx-config enable: gives me an error
[10:16] <TLE> Vuen: Ohhh so that's what they are for. But anyway that wont do the trick with grub.
[10:16] <iwaterball> CarinArr: when I had that problem it turned out to be something with my .vimrc, try movnig it
[10:16] <Vuen> compudaze: no, you don't need beta drivers.
[10:16] <zoople> says i havent installed it when i have
[10:17] <volvoguy> compudaze, thanks. i was just going to ask for a good edgy/beryl link. :)
[10:17] <river> cge, as what type ?
[10:17] <CarinArr> iwaterball, well, it explicitly says it doesnt' recognise the "syntax on" in my .vimrc which has worked for yonks
[10:17] <vegansickle> oh no
[10:17] <vegansickle> im getting this DCOPserver error
[10:17] <compudaze> even if you dont use xgl?
[10:17] <Vuen> you definitely *don't* need nvidia beta drivers to use beryl. furthermore, the new nvidia beta driver features are useless if you're using Xgl, and they're less stable.
=== vegansickle is now known as seryphareth
[10:17] <cge> river: ext3
[10:17] <iwaterball> CarinArr: still works for me
[10:17] <CarinArr> iwaterball, new install of edgy or upgrade?
[10:18] <CarinArr> cause mine worked when ijust upgraded.. doesn't work after clean install
[10:18] <Jaeke555> Vuen: ah,I was bit distracted here, but let me see, I need to do Apt-get upgrade and then reboot?
[10:18] <Vuen> compudaze: even if you don't use xgl. you can just enable aiglx, just as you would with ati drivers (assuming he's using edgy)
[10:18] <iwaterball> CarinArr: they moved the syntax file, youre .vimrc might point to the wrong place
[10:18] <seryphareth> im using kubunutu latest edgy and im getting the .DCOPserver_vegansickle__0 error
[10:18] <iwaterball> CarinArr: upgrade
[10:18] <volvoguy> i heard maybe that AIGLX works with the new nvidia drivers, but i haven't read up on it at all.
[10:18] <Vuen> Jaeke555: yes. sudo apt-get upgrade. did the 1.5 gigs finish downloading already?!?
[10:18] <compudaze> i haven't tried that way, was just easier this way
[10:18] <compudaze> i haven't had any problems with the beta drivers
[10:18] <bilss_> hi
[10:18] <river> cge, nope says special device doe snot exist
[10:19] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Nope, not yet, I'm somewhere in 97% I think...
[10:19] <volvoguy> Vuen, what does AIGLX give you?
[10:19] <what_if> if I install ubuntu 6.06 and upgrade will it also upgrade the kernel ??
[10:19] <seryphareth> does anyone know how to fix the DCOPserver isn't loading error?
[10:19] <CarinArr> iwaterball, if you do :syntax on in a vim session does it work?
[10:19] <CarinArr> iwaterball, cause i get: E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version                                1,1           All
[10:19] <Vuen> compudaze: ah. that's strange. i've had MANY problems with the beta drivers on edgy, whereas none existed with the stable drivers
[10:19] <cge> river: ah
[10:19] <bilss_> I still have not upgraded  from dapper what are the advantages as i have only a mail server with minimal X
[10:19] <cge> river: So, it appears that the device mapper module isn't mounted
[10:19] <iwaterball> CarinArr: they mayn have vim-tiny installed by default rather then a fully flegged vim; can't check it just now
[10:19] <compudaze> what kind of problems?
[10:20] <cge> river: err, loaded
[10:20] <seryphareth> compudaze: me?
[10:20] <volvoguy> cge, they informed me here to stick with dapper for server duties. i just did the install.
[10:20] <CarinArr> iwaterball, right, at least that's an idea, i'll check
[10:20] <Jaeke555> Vuen: So apt-get install <package name> will only download the package? and apt-get upgrade will install all the downloaded packages?
[10:20] <Vuen> the nvidia beta drivers broke my wireless card (restricted-modules), have corrupted video in some games (scorched3d), broke x (no longer starts on boot, even though i've now uninstalled them), would not use vram properly (so i still had to use xgl)...
[10:20] <CarinArr> i just assumed since it was there it was the full version
[10:20] <Vuen> LOADS of problems
[10:20] <james296> E: Malformed line 39 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
[10:20] <river> cge, I'll take your word for it
[10:20] <Vuen> so if you don't need the beta drivers, definitely best not to use them.
[10:20] <cge> river: so sudo modprobe dm-mod
[10:20] <james296> thats what I get when I try to apt-get update
[10:20] <cge> river: And then try again.
[10:21] <volvoguy> Vuen, can you use AIGLX with the stable Nvidia drivers?
[10:21] <james296> when I added the source
[10:21] <Vuen> volvoguy: as far as i know, yes.
[10:21] <volvoguy> I thought there was something new in the betas that made it finally work.
[10:21] <Vuen> volvoguy: i'm pretty sure you can. with the latest stable drivers, it's just a matter of enabling aiglx in the xorg.conf.
[10:22] <Vuen> volvoguy: no, what the new beta drivers do is they make aiglx unnecessary by adding the pixmap-whatever hook directly to the drivers.
[10:22] <Vuen> you can still use aiglx.
[10:22] <volvoguy> Vuen, oooh... that's right.
[10:22] <seryphareth> <--- KUBUNTU 6.10 "Could not Read Network Connection List" .DCOPserver_vegansickle__0 please check to see that the "dcopserver" program is running
[10:22] <volvoguy> is there a aiglx.org or something for more info?
[10:22] <volvoguy> nevermind I'll JFGI
[10:22] <compudaze> which is faster? XGL or aiglx?
[10:22] <bilss_> I still have not upgraded  from dapper what are the advantages as i have only a mail server with minimal X
[10:22] <Vuen> compudaze: depends on your hardware.
[10:23] <compudaze> 6800gt for me
[10:23] <Vuen> compudaze: for amd, ati, etc, you're probably best with aiglx. for intel, nvidia, etc, you're probably best with xgl
[10:23] <seryphareth> no ideas about the DCOPserver error?
[10:23] <seryphareth> ive tried looking at the search engines
[10:23] <river> cge, ok no error from modprobe but retry on mount same error
[10:24] <volvoguy> bilss_,  they informed me here to stick with dapper for server duties. i just did the install.
[10:24] <Vuen> personally i have intel, nvidia, asus, and aiglx/nvidiabeta was slower than xgl and kept getting black windows because of not using video ram properly
[10:24] <bilss_> volvoguy: install of dapper?
[10:24] <volvoguy> bilss_, yes.
[10:25] <volvoguy> bilss_, for a server.
[10:25] <cge> river: Ok, run lvs again
[10:25] <Vuen> Jaeke555: sorry i missed your message, apt-get install <package name> will download and install that package. apt-get upgrade will see if there are newer versions of any packages on your system, and if so, it will download and install them.
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[10:25] <what_if> Is edgy "production level" yet, or more of a beta ??
[10:25] <cge> river: or lvdisplay
[10:25] <seryphareth> no its beta
[10:25] <seryphareth> :)
[10:25] <Vuen> what_if: it's released means it's production level.
[10:25] <volvoguy> bilss_, Dapper is LTS while Edgy is not.
[10:25] <seryphareth> it leaving me with this stupid DCOP error!
[10:25] <compudaze> if you want more stable use 6.06.1
[10:25] <seryphareth> i really dig 6.10
[10:26] <seryphareth> but this error sucks
[10:26] <bilss_> volvoguy: whats LTS mean
[10:26] <what_if> compudaze: downloading now :)
[10:26] <seryphareth> i got maya installed np
[10:26] <volvoguy> bilss_, Long Term Support
[10:26] <Vuen> bilss_: LTS means long term support. it means they are supporting dapper for three years instead of the usual 1.5 years
[10:26] <volvoguy> bilss_, it has a longer life cycle than Edgy - it will be officially supported longer.
[10:26] <what_if> will apt-get upgrade install the new kernel ??
[10:26] <Jaeke555> Vuen: So Apt-get install ubuntu-desktop will download and install the ubuntu-desktop (What ever it is; X window?) so I only need to reboot for it to take effect?
[10:27] <compudaze> i'll have to try the other different ways, xgl vs aiglx vs GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap
[10:27] <Vuen> what_if: if there is a new kernel available, yes.
[10:27] <Vuen> Jaeke555: yes.
[10:27] <bilss_> volvoguy: its ok i guess but not as soild as sarge
[10:27] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Sounds like too easy :)
[10:27] <Vuen> Jaeke555: but make sure you apt-get update and apt-get upgrade again before rebooting
[10:27] <volvoguy> compudaze, me too. we'll have to compare notes. :)
[10:27] <Vuen> just to make sure there's nothing missing.
[10:27] <Jaeke555> Vuen:  what do those commands do?
[10:27] <what_if> Vuen: i'm having problems with the new kernels... how do I tell apt _not_ to upgrade the kernel
[10:27] <Vuen> Jaeke555: it definitely is too easy. don't you love installing things on linux? :)
[10:27] <Vuen> what_if: mmm. i'm not sure. hold on
[10:27] <DavidW2> hi. I have a problem starting up mysql
[10:27] <Jaeke555> vuen: I'd rather install stuff on Windows, thats easier :)
[10:28] <river> cge, ok lvdisplay nothing new
[10:28] <DavidW2> Seems to be this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/mysql-dfsg-5.0/+bug/66702
[10:28] <Vuen> Jaeke555: EGAD! not a chance.
[10:28] <DavidW2> I need a working mysql asap im willing to try an older package, say, if the one from dapper works or something
[10:28] <cge> river: Ok. What is in /dev/mapper?
[10:28] <Jaeke555> vuen: anyways, apt-get update: updates the package list? and what does apt-get upgrade do then?
[10:28] <volvoguy> bilss_, never tried sarge. this machine has been powered on since the first ubuntu release and only rebooted for new kernels. i've never had any crashes.
[10:29] <Vuen> Jaeke555: apt-get update updates the package list. apt-get upgrade checks the package list to see if any packages that you have have been upgraded since you installed them, and if so, it will download and install the new versions.
[10:29] <JayFM> Hey everyone, can someone please help me open a smime.p7s file?
[10:29] <Jaeke555> Vuen: woot, everything is almost automated in linux :)
[10:29] <JayFM> I recieved it from the ubuntu user-mailing list
[10:29] <seryphareth> <--- KUBUNTU 6.10 "Could not Read Network Connection List" .DCOPserver_vegansickle__0 please check to see that the "dcopserver" program is running
[10:30] <Jaeke555> Vuen: What its missing is ability to run 'Wolrd of Warcraft' on it, when thats possible I'll certainly turn to linuxes :)
[10:30] <seryphareth> im on terminal now after killing the poor kdm
[10:30] <seryphareth> bx
[10:30] <cge> river: Ah. Ok. Run lvm vgscan, and then lvm vgchange -a y
[10:30] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, I thought you could run WoW with Cedega?
[10:31] <cge> river: Then I think you should be able to mount the partition.
[10:31] <bilss_> volvoguy: i run a cuple of programs I used apt-get to install both need a pid file in /var/run but evertime i reboot it wipes the /var/run dir strange but on sarge its ok but had dapper now since brezzy but just thought I would give you my view
[10:31] <Vuen> Jaeke555: WoW should run with cedega, afaik
[10:31] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I understood like 50% of the sentence :D cedega? afaik?
[10:32] <volvoguy> bilss_, hmm.. strange. i've never had to muck around the /var directory much.
[10:32] <Vuen> Jaeke555: cedega=program for running windows games in linux. afaik=as far as i know.
[10:32] <Vuen> what_if: hold on, almost found it
[10:32] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, transgaming.com (or maybe .org)
[10:32] <Jaeke555> Vuen: ahaa!   I guess I'll have to familiarize myself to it :)
[10:33] <what_if> Jaeke555: cedega does run WOW, even says so on their webpage
=== reZo is now known as phpError
[10:33] <A3on> sup all, I have a question, I am using Edgy and it seems that exim4 has port 25 open or that it is listening on 25. I'm sure exim4 got on my system via rkhunter on my system, but I did opt for no configuration of exim4 at the time. This never happened on Dapper when installing rkhunter! Yes, I have firestarter installed, however, i have tor installed as well and doing an nmap on 127.0.0.1 shows that in fact pot 25 is open as well. Should
[10:33] <A3on> i be concerned?
[10:33] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, it doesn't do Battlefield2 so well (at least for me), but I know I WoW is supported (and advertised - so it must work pretty well).
[10:33] <bilss_> volvoguy: i think sarge and the new testing etch are more robust they are tested and tested again before release ubuntu is a rock for new people to linux
[10:33] <cge>  A3on: probably not.
[10:33] <bilss_> etch
[10:34] <A3on> cge, and why is that?
[10:34] <Jaeke555> volvoguy: thanks, you might have just saved me from microsoft!
[10:34] <cge> A3on: I'm nearly certain it isn't configured as an open relay.
[10:34] <Vuen> what_if: ack, sorry, i can't find it. there's a way you can put a hold on a package, to make it not upgrade; the command is something like hold, or apt-get hold, or dpkg hold, i don't know. search the dpkg manpage for hold
[10:34] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, Yay! do i get a comission check? ;)
[10:34] <river> cge, you're a legend !! mounted
[10:34] <A3on> cge, but nmap shows that it is?
[10:34] <ailean> what program can i use to encode an ".avi file onto a DVD so that I can play it on DVD players?
[10:34] <what_if> Vuen: will do, that is what I ran into. Lack of clear answers
[10:34] <cge> river: Amazing! I'm amazingly lucky in finding that little bit in the LVM2 FAQ. I've never even used LVM myself.
[10:35] <cge> A3on: Sure, it is an open port, but it can't be used as an open relay.
[10:35] <Jaeke555> volvoguy: you wish! :D
[10:35] <A3on> cge, how can i find out if it used as an open relay or configured in such a way?
[10:35] <HS^> does ubuntu installer have a partition program?
[10:35] <cge> A3on: If you telnet in from a remote location and do helo asdf \n msg from: test@example.com\n rcpt to: asdf@example2.com\n, it will reject it.
[10:35] <river> cge, awesome... great progress well done. Now it is mounted as ~/chrootOriginal  now all I should need to do is chroot to it, can you help with that too ?
[10:35] <ailean> HS^, yes
[10:36] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, yes, yes i do. Spend the money on Cedega instead though. :)
[10:36] <HS^> ok
[10:36] <cge> river chroot /path/to/mounted/part /bin/bash, if I recall.
[10:36] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I got this error, Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file
[10:36] <cge> A3on: Or there are tests on the web.
[10:36] <Jaeke555> volvoguy: omg its not freeware?
[10:36] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, no but it's cheap and well worth the money.
[10:36] <A3on> cge, yes such as port scanners?
[10:36] <Vuen> Jaeke555: when did you get this error? and no, cedega is not free :(. you may be able to get wow to work in wine, which is free.
[10:37] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, basically you're paying for support.
[10:37] <river> cge, with sudo I presume
[10:37] <seryphareth> who am i?
[10:37] <seryphareth> i want my DCOPserver to work
[10:37] <Jaeke555> vuen: it was setting up some font thingy :)
[10:37] <seryphareth> hehe
[10:37] <cge> river: Of course.
[10:37] <cge> A3on: no
[10:37] <Jaeke555> Vuen: but it passed it...
[10:37] <HS^> is it easy to update ubuntu , completely with all installed packages?
[10:37] <cge> A3on: A port scanner will just tell you whether the port is open.
[10:38] <A3on> cge, what do you mean then?
[10:38] <cge> A3on: It won't tell you if you can actually send mail through the port.
[10:38] <Vuen> Jaeke555: http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=707
[10:38] <ailean> what program can i use to encode an ".avi file onto a DVD so that I can play it on DVD players?
[10:38] <Vuen> Jaeke555: that's apparently a success story of WoW under wine, which is free.
[10:38] <Vuen> or just google for wine world of warcraft, and start reading :)
[10:38] <ANaRcHiC> anyone got xgl functioning on edgy?
[10:38] <cge> A3on: Like http://www.abuse.net/relay.html or http://mail-abuse.org/tsi/ar-test.html
[10:39] <river> cge, ok that's done too yay ! so now to resume the interupted upgrade ? "apt-get ?????"
[10:39] <chuckyp>  ANaRcHiC a lot of people go to #ubuntu-xgl for help
[10:39] <A3on> cge, but the fact that it is listening on the port suggests that it is open?
[10:39] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I'm sure trying to run windows software on linux is hard as it is, and when its not automated, its too hard :D so I guess I'll have to stick with windoze still :)
[10:39] <ANaRcHiC> ty :)
[10:39] <cge> A3on: Not really.
[10:39] <Vuen> Jaeke555: ooh, here's a good tutorial: http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=707
[10:39] <chuckyp> Jaeke555, what software do you need from windows?
[10:39] <HS^> is it easy to update ubuntu , completely with all installed packages?
[10:39] <cge> river: dist-upgrade
[10:40] <iwaterball> HS^: yes.
[10:40] <Jaeke555> chuckyp: well, MSN messenger and world of warcraft :) I think thats about it :)
[10:40] <cge> A3on: It means that others can connect to the port, but it doesn't mean that they can use it to send mail.
[10:40] <Vuen> Jaeke555: did you mean to set all this up on the linux machine you're installing now? if so, why did you use the server install cd?
[10:40] <river> cge, confirming "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[10:40] <Vuen> Jaeke555: there are loads of messengers you can use instead of msn. generally the best one is gaim
[10:40] <chuckyp> Jaeke555, well msn you can use gaim to connect to your msn account.  Or if you want some more of the msn features you can alwasy install amsn
[10:40] <cge> A3on: If it is configured correctly, as I am confident that it is, then it will allow others to send email to your machine, but will not allow them to send emails to other machines.
[10:40] <chuckyp> Jaeke555, and wow runs under wine.
[10:41] <Vuen> Jaeke555: there are even text-based msn clients for linux that you can use without even installing a GUI. right out of that terminal where you apt-getted your desktop, you can use msn.
[10:41] <Jaeke555> Chuckyp: yeah, I believe it does, but when I'm on it, it won't :D
[10:41] <A3on> cge, hmmm how about exploit the port and gain entrance into the system?
[10:41] <river> cge, do I need to login in or am I magically root now even without specifying any user or password ?
[10:41] <Jaeke555> vuen: damn linux is versatile :)
[10:41] <Vuen> yep
[10:41] <cge> river: You have magical rootness.
[10:41] <Vuen> i know
[10:42] <Vuen> Jaeke555: what's even better about text-based things like that is that you can use them inside a text-based window manager, like screen
[10:42] <cge> river: An example of why most security is useless when an attacker has physical access.
[10:42] <Vuen> so when you SSH or telnet to your computer, you can take over the session without disconnecting from irc, msn, etc
[10:42] <cge> A3on: The attacker would have to be able to exploit exim4.
[10:42] <cge> A3on: One can't just exploit the port.
[10:42] <Jaeke555> Vuen: but you need a year of practise before you can actually do anything with the terminal box :)
[10:43] <chuckyp> Jaeke555, same as windows.  Think of how much practice you've had with that.
[10:43] <Vuen> you can do pretty much anything from the console in linux, including write school papers (latex), browse the internet (lynx/links2/w3m), chat with others (irssi,bitchx,tmsnc,naim)...
[10:43] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Rebuilding the database. This may take some time.
[10:43] <A3on> cge, ah seems i need to go research exim4 exploits then ^^
[10:43] <Jaeke555> chuckyp: Yeah, I know, but to get into Linux world, I first have to forget my 18 years of windows experience :D
[10:44] <Vuen> Jaeke555: heh, well it does take quite a bit of learning, yes. but look at it this way, you spent your whole life learning windows
[10:44] <Jaeke555> Vuen: So true :D
[10:44] <river> cge, understand re security. Another question, it wants to download 231mb for the upgrade, can I add an alternate cd or something to avoid the download ?
[10:44] <Vuen> and how much can you do from a windows terminal? not much. you can already do more in a linux terminal and you just started.
[10:44] <cge> Jaeke555: It does take a long time to learn the CLI, but in my opinion it is worth it.
[10:44] <PecisDarbs> hi crowd, question to Ubuntu packagers - how frequently happens translations updates packages release and how to initialise one, if there is need to fix faulty translations
[10:44] <Jaeke555> Vuen: but don't you just hate it when you know what you should do, but you don't know how to :)
[10:44] <chuckyp> Jaeke555, well not necessarily forget it.  I'm from windows environment too.  So I know what you mean.  But I pretty much only use nix now.  My wife still boots to windows ocasionally.
[10:44] <peija-kax> yeh and i can tell you that after a few years on linux windows starts to feel quite odd :p just installed xp for a friend yesterday :p
[10:45] <Vuen> hehe
[10:45] <Arafangion> chuckyp: Lately, someone's watched me program in C, using screen and a split vim.
[10:45] <Arafangion> chuckyp: He asked "Is that Visual Studio?"
[10:45] <chuckyp> PecisDarbs, perhaps your questions would be better answered on the forums?   THere is also irc rooms for different languages.
[10:45] <Vuen> i'm a bit embarrased to say that i'm in windows right now >.< i'm repartitioning my hard drive with partition magic, because parted was segfaulting :(
[10:45] <Jaeke555> my only requirements is that I can mainly play PC/windows games on it :)
[10:45] <rasputnik> anyone know how to stop (edgy) firefox asking if I want to restore my session? it's driving me potty.
[10:45] <Vuen> but, i'm still using irssi in a terminal window :D
[10:45] <cge> PecisDarbs: I think you want to go to rosetta?
[10:45] <chuckyp> Arafangion, lol
[10:45] <Vuen> i'm addicted to the console. completely addicted.
[10:46] <iwaterball> Jaeke555: if all you want to do is play windows games, use windows
[10:46] <Arafangion> Vuen: It is infact, recommended to use only one partition program, so if you're already using partition magic, it'd be best to continue using that.
[10:46] <cge> Vuen: Yes, it is addictive.
[10:46] <Arafangion> Vuen: Same.
[10:46] <PecisDarbs> cge: no, I want to understand how translation update debs are issued for particular language :)
[10:46] <cge> PecisDarbs: Ah
[10:46] <volvoguy> Vuen, good! i decided to make my server headless this time. I'll need console help eventually I'm sure. :)
[10:46] <Vuen> Arafangion: actually, i've used a whole variety of partitioning software on this drive
[10:46] <cge> PecisDarbs: You might try asking on #ubuntu-devel
[10:46] <PecisDarbs> cge: it is done by Ubuntu packages or it can be done from Translation team, etc.
[10:46] <PecisDarbs> ohhh
[10:46] <PecisDarbs> I see
[10:46] <PecisDarbs> thanks
[10:46] <PecisDarbs> :)
[10:46] <peija-kax> i have a windows on an older box as 2nd os for playing games, and i use my new linux box as its firewall so it isnt slowed down by av and firewall software ;) works
[10:46] <Arafangion> volvoguy: You can still use graphical programs on headless boxes.
[10:46] <Vuen> Arafangion: the current partition table was built using maxtor's boot cd, parted, cfdisk, and partition magic.
[10:46] <cge> PecisDarbs: Even though it isn't *precisely* the right place to ask.
[10:47] <Vuen> Arafangion: it's quite a mess. it's no wonder parted is segfaulting :p
=== caelum_ is now known as i386
[10:47] <chuckyp> Jaeke555, yeah  your best bet is to dual boot so you don't lose that aspect of it.  Gaming is seriously laking in linux but its getting better as time goes on.  More developers are releasing linux versions of their games.  EA is the big one that is being a PITA at the momment.  Once they start releasing clinet versions linux will truely rock.
[10:47] <PecisDarbs> cge: at least I will try
[10:47] <Arafangion> Vuen: The fact is that the partition table isn't completely standardized :(
[10:47] <Vuen> Jaeke555: yep. dual booting windows and linux is extremely easy with ubuntu
[10:47] <ChrisNiemy> hi, someone uses FLAC for music files? trying to play them with xine-backend and amarok. seems that its still not working under egdy. _can_ anybody here play FLAC under amarok (edgy eft)?
[10:47] <volvoguy> Arafangion, yeah - i don't have *much* need to though. the only GUI app i really used on that machine was Azureus, since it has all my big hard drives in it.
[10:47] <cge> ChrisNiemy: Me
[10:48] <A3on> cge, hmmm seems there as an exploit in exim4 about causing overflows to gain privileges, but that was back in 2005 and did exist on Ubuntu Warty. cge, is there any way i can configure it to stop listening on port 25?
[10:48] <Vuen> Jaeke555: i have a 30 gig partition on which windows is installed, which i use exclusively for games. other than that, i do everything in linux
[10:48] <cge> ChrisNiemy: You need to install xine-extracodecs
[10:48] <cge> A3on: I believe so, let me think for a moment.
[10:48] <volvoguy> Arafangion, and I think I can control Azureus adequately through the console or the web-gui plugin.
[10:48] <A3on> cge, thanks
[10:48] <ChrisNiemy> cge: did that, also tried from a fresh install. i must be crazy ;) refuses to work.
[10:48] <Vuen> volvoguy: they're developing a cli interface to azureus, by the way. you can run it as a daemon without an interface.
[10:48] <cge> A3on: You could disable exim4 entirely with update-rc.d
[10:48] <Vuen> heh
[10:49] <cge> A3on: Or you could use firestarter to close the port, though do note that it will still appear as open from your local machine.
[10:49] <ChrisNiemy> cge: so the problem concerning the xinelibs which occured under dapper is now fixed in edgy?
[10:49] <A3on> cge, what is the full command to issue update-rc.d?
[10:49] <cge> ChrisNiemy: I don't know. I think it was working. But flac works well with gstreamer.
[10:49] <cge> A3on: update-rc.d
[10:49] <cge> A3on: oh
[10:50] <volvoguy> Vuen, yeah - I've already done that a bit for practice. The only thing I haven't figured out without the GUI is picking only a few files from a huge torrent or subscribing to RSS feeds (and setting up filters).
[10:50] <ChrisNiemy> cge seems to work with rhythmbox :) just missing the crossfading-function of amarok
[10:50] <cge> A3on: update-rc.d -f remove exim4. Though firestarter or some other firewall might be a better idea if you have one installed already.
[10:50] <cge> ChrisNiemy: amarok can use gstreamer.
[10:50] <volvoguy> Vuen, it's probably in the wiki though. it's been a few weeks since i visited. :)
[10:51] <rasputnik> A3on: you tell exim to listen on 25 with the '-bd' flag. just remove that from your exim options
[10:51] <ChrisNiemy> cge ok, then i have to check the settings there. I'll give it a try. thanks
[10:51] <Vuen> man, i wish azureus wasn't written in java. it's such a great program
[10:51] <Vuen> but java makes everything difficult
[10:51] <cge> Vuen: Have you tried ktorrent.
[10:51] <cge> Vuen: ?
[10:51] <Vuen> is there a fix for how azureus always shuts down improperly if you don't close it before logging out?
[10:52] <A3on> rasputnik, where do i find the exim options?
[10:52] <cge> A3on: Probably in /etc/default
[10:52] <Vuen> cge: yeah, i've tried ktorrent. it's missing tons of features, the connectivity sucks, the speed sucks...
[10:52] <CarinArr> vuen, are you using sun java?
[10:52] <volvoguy> Vuen, not that I know of. that's a thorn in my side as well.
[10:52] <cge> Vuen: Ah
[10:52] <Vuen> CarinArr: yep, sun java.
[10:52] <cge> Vuen: Why would the speed and connectivity be worse?
[10:52] <CarinArr> jus tchecking, cause i discovered it's hellish if you don't
[10:53] <volvoguy> Opera REALLY sucks for torrent speed. I used it in a pinch a few times. I have no idea why one would be faster than another.
[10:53] <CarinArr> i've managed to kill azureus a few times the last few days without it complaining at all
[10:53] <Vuen> cge: for the speed, i have no idea, but it is. i tried downloading the new episode of the office, i let it run for an hour and it spent the whole time at 8 k/s. i said "screw this" and stuck it in azureus, the speed jumped right up to 140k/s and downloaded the whole episode in about 20 minutes.
[10:53] <CarinArr> i found ktorrent got me crap download speeds too
[10:53] <Whatsisname> hey anyone know how to shut off the terminal bell/ beep
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-out
[10:54] <cge> Vuen: Ah. I think that is because illegitimate bittorrent downloads require the use of nonstandard ports instead of 6881
[10:54] <Vuen> cge: as for connectivity, azureus has all sorts of features ktorrent lacks. for one thing, azureus has dht, which means it doesn't need a tracker to find peers
[10:54] <volvoguy> Opera is telling me right now that a 4Gb file is going to take 8 days to download and there's like 48 seeders.
[10:54] <CarinArr> and it kept saying NAT and stuff weren't working when they were
[10:54] <Vuen> it also means it can download torrent files using only hashes or magnet links, etc
[10:54] <Vuen> cge: uhh, no, that's a load of crap...
[10:54] <cge> Vuen: If I recall correctly, ktorrent has DHT, does it not?
[10:54] <A3on> rasputnik and cge, there is no -bd flag in  /etc/default config file of exim4?
[10:54] <CarinArr> cge, yes, but for me it kept claiming it wasn't working
[10:54] <volvoguy> "non-standard" ports shouldn't effect torrents at all.
[10:55] <Jaeke555> Vuen: /var/lib/scrollkeeper/C/scrollkeeper_extended_cl.xml:680: parser error : premature end of data in tag sect line 504
[10:55] <Rothbuntu> utorrent is the ONLY one ill ever use
[10:55] <IRCMonkey1111> how to change fonts for any arbitrary X app (some app derived from mozilla for eg)
[10:55] <Vuen> cge: i don't think it implements it nearly as well as azureus does. it probably implements it the way the official bittorrent client does, which sucks; it emphasizes restrictions to try to force people to upload, instead of just focusing on connectivity
[10:55] <A3on> cge, however exim4 runs as a demon?
[10:55] <rasputnik> A3on: no, it's done in the init script itself
[10:55] <chuckyp> azureus here.
[10:55] <Vuen> cge: and i know for a fact ktorrent has no method of searching the dht or transferring torrent files using hashes or magnets
[10:55] <fredl> I guess VMWare server won't automatically migrate to Edgy huh?
[10:55] <cge> rasputnik: It shouldn't do that...
[10:55] <chuckyp> fredl, why not?
[10:56] <chuckyp> fredl, automatically no but you can tell it o.
[10:56] <volvoguy> fredl, it should upgrade just like regular hardware.
[10:56] <fredl> well since it uses kernel modules and edgy has another kernel
[10:56] <thor> rasputnik: re your request to turn off firefox restore...http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1788/firefox_2_0_how_to_always_restore_your_session
[10:56] <rasputnik> cge: I know, and debian shouldn't split the config of thirdparty apps into a billion little files. waddayagonnado?
[10:56] <A3on> rasputnik, then all i would have to do is uncomment  'nodaemon' then right?
[10:56] <volvoguy> i didn't know vmware ubuntu used a tweaked kernel.
[10:56] <cge> rasputnik: FILE A BUG!
[10:57] <fredl> this is one of my big tests for VMWare server, to see how easy it is to migrate to a new distro version :)
[10:57] <cge> rasputnik: I'll go look at it right now.
[10:57] <rasputnik> thor: you beauty. I found the docs but the value doesn't exist by default.
[10:57] <rasputnik> cge: they won't listen, I've tried it before.
[10:57] <volvoguy> fredl, yeah - and unfortunately i don't think there's much documentation for it. :-\
[10:58] <volvoguy> fredl, let me see if i have a VM of it sitting around.
[10:58] <Vuen> Jaeke555: eek, that's really strange
[10:58] <thor> rasputnik: right, you have to create it (and set it to false to turn off the restore)
[10:58] <fredl> volvoguy, ofcourse it does.... and I documented what I did for earlier VMWare kernel modules so it should be a breeze
[10:58] <shredder_> I accidentally deleted my minimize panel once and never got back the ability to minimize a window. I do have a lower panel, when I minimize a window the window goes into the corner of my screen and I cannot find it? any suggestions
[10:58] <charlie5> i've clobbered my fstab so that now i cannot boot ... could anyone please have a look at this paste of fstab, and see what i've done wrong ? ... http://rafb.net/paste/results/nJqXYx77.html
[10:58] <Vuen> Jaeke555: mm, i don't really know what that error is. does the gui start up?
[10:58] <volvoguy> fredl, my bad. i've never had to look very hard for info i guess. :)
[10:59] <cge> shredder_: readd it.
[10:59] <fredl> volvoguy http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_vmware_server
[10:59] <cge> shredder_: right click, add to panel, I think it is task list or something similar.
[10:59] <Jaeke555> Vuen: its still setting up the stuff it downloaded
[10:59] <volvoguy> fredl, i have an ubuntu dapper server VM here. i could try an upgrade to edgy for you - to see what kind of errors i get.
[10:59] <A3on> screw it ill just uninstall it - thanks guys ;)
[10:59] <rasputnik> A3on: yes. well, set the QUEUERUNNER option to that. Sorry, haven't used exim4 on a debian for a while
[10:59] <volvoguy> fredl, sweet! i've been loving howtoforge lately.
[11:00] <charlie5> should 'noauto' be set in fstab for the mian '/' partition ?
[11:00] <Vuen> Jaeke555: ah. yeah, that'l take a while. installing 1.5 gigs of stuff :)
[11:00] <cge> A3on: exim4 is really hard to configure. postfix is much easier.
[11:00] <fredl> volvoguy, one step ahead of you :) I had a running VMWare install on Dapper and it broke after the upgrade to Edgy which seems fair enough.
[11:00] <Jaeke555> Vuen: yeah... but I think it should be done soon :)
[11:00] <Jaeke555> Vuen: and whats fun, is that I got a fresh install and it still gives me occational error messages :D
[11:00] <A3on> rasputnik, its cool id rather have it off my system right now anyways, just wish rkhunter didnt need it
[11:01] <volvoguy> fredl, bummer!
[11:01] <river> cge, thanks for all your help
[11:01] <rasputnik> fredl: it works ok. you need to rerun vmware-config.pl *and* remove your old libdbus lib
[11:01] <cge> A3on: Ah!
[11:01] <A3on> cge, hehhe easy for you, but ummm im a noob ;)
[11:01] <cge> A3on: It just requires an MTA!
[11:01] <fredl> rasputnik, ok that's helpfull :)
[11:01] <cge> A3on: So you can install something like esmtp
[11:01] <A3on> cge, mta?
[11:01] <rasputnik> fredl: 'apt-get remove libdbus-1-2'
[11:01] <Vuen> Jaeke555: yeah, that's normal pretty much. loads of different possible hardware creates minor differences about how things are installed, and linux likes to be verbose.
[11:02] <Vuen> Jaeke555: keep in mind that you get all these sorts of errors in windows, but windows likes to brush it under the table instead of telling you about it.
[11:02] <fredl> why does that one have to go rasputnik?
[11:02] <A3on> cge, does esmtp listen to ports?
[11:02] <cge> A3on: mail transport agent. There are full ones like exim4 and postfix, which are actual mail servers, and ones like esmtp which aren't actually servers.
[11:02] <cge> A3on: no
[11:02] <A3on> cge, sweet ill install esmtp then
[11:03] <cge> A3on: If I recall, you need to install esmtp and esmtp-run
[11:03] <ChrisNiemy> cge: whoo, it works with amarok, had to delete the ~/.xine directory. and I guess the flac files which were produced by grip, had wrong parameters or so, another flac file which i made with soundconverter works.
[11:04] <cge> ChrisNiemy: strange
[11:04] <ChrisNiemy> cge: it is ;)
[11:04] <Jaeke555> Vuen: So true, but it seems that I'm close to end since it installed Open office already
[11:04] <cge> A3on: And then installing rkhunter should work without pulling in exim4
[11:04] <volvoguy> does anybody know of an iPod video encoder as simple as iSquint on Mac? Man I love that thing but my x86 machines have so much more horsepower than my G4 iBook.
[11:05] <cge> volvoguy: Can mencoder do it?
[11:05] <fredl> rasputnik, that worked easily enough :)
[11:05] <Jaeke555> Vuen: and the installation seems to constantly have problems with the fonts
[11:05] <A3on> cge, one question though Exim is a deamon right?
[11:05] <cge> volvoguy: Although that certainly doesn't satisfy the simple requirement.
[11:05] <cge> A3on: yes
[11:05] <fredl> so is there still a 'commercial' version of VMWare?
[11:06] <volvoguy> cge, it CAN - but it's not "push go" simple like iSquint (isquint.org if you want to peek at the UI).
[11:06] <A3on> cge, then that explains why even after an uninstall it still has that port open and shows, from nmap, that exim is still listening on it
[11:06] <volvoguy> fredl, yeah. the "Workstation" version - and all the commercial server stuff.
[11:06] <cge> A3on: Even though you uninstalled it?
[11:06] <A3on> cge, yes
[11:07] <chuckyp> How slow is windows xp through vmware?
[11:07] <cge> volvoguy: push go simplicity isn't there yet with linux.
[11:07] <cge> chuckyp: slow
[11:07] <A3on> cge, ill be back let me restart my system
[11:07] <charlie5> hi again ... anyone know what these in fstab are for ...    UUID=a8f244
[11:07] <fredl> volvoguy, so is that still called ESX?
[11:07] <cge> A3on: you might not have uninstalled the right packages
[11:07] <volvoguy> cge, thanks. i didn't think so. i've done MUCHO googling.
[11:07] <chuckyp> cge, like click on something go get a smoke and come back?
[11:07] <volvoguy> fredl, yeah. that sounds right.
[11:07] <cge> chuckyp: Not *that* slow, but much slower than wine.
[11:07] <cge> chuckyp: If I recall correctly.
[11:07] <tRSS> hey guys. i have a wierd problem. my (k)ubuntu breezy was working fine uptil now. yesterday due to power failure, my machine shutdown abruptly. now when it boots, the screen remains blank. i think X simply fails to start. how do I fix this?
[11:07] <DavidW2> Anyone having problems with mysql?
[11:08] <volvoguy> isquint is freeware. i wonder if they'd consider opening the source for linux comilation. it's not a super FANCY GUI, just super simple.
[11:08] <fredl> see, I like VMWare a lot, I've been trying stuff with the free server and that seems pretty stable... this was basically one test, to see how it stand migrating to newer version of kernels and all
[11:08] <Vuen> Jaeke555: just out of curiosity, what is this machine for that you're installing ubuntu on? is it a server for an office or is it just for a home computer or office workstation?
[11:08] <fredl> I've heard though that ESX outperforms the free VMWare server by orders of magnitude.
[11:09] <fredl> can anybody confirm that?
[11:09] <Jaeke555> Vuen: its supposed to serve as a webserver later, when I get the stuff installed on it
[11:09] <volvoguy> fredl, i have the commercial workstation (a version or two old) and the free player is just as stable at running VMs (of course the player can't create them). i honestly haven't tried the free or commercial server products yet.
[11:09] <Vuen> Jaeke555: ah.
[11:10] <asdjjaad> hey guys, I have Core2duo on Intel 965 MO with SATA HD, edgy fails to install
[11:10] <crimsun> asdjjaad: known issue, no ETA.
[11:10] <Jaeke555> vuen: work related stuff, some two dudes asked me from something they have absolutely no idea, so, if they want an old version, I'll give them an old version :D
[11:10] <ChrisNiemy> cge: i got it: in grip in the encoder section there are wrong parameters by default. i manually converted a wav with command-line flac and that works, though the with grip created flacs do work with gstreamer. however, thanks for listening ;))
[11:10] <fredl> volvoguy, I have not done any measurements on the free version....
[11:10] <Vuen> Jaeke555: dapper isn't an old version, in fact for a webserver dapper is the right version to install.
[11:10] <asdjjaad>  crimsun: are there any workarounds ?
[11:11] <fredl> volvoguy, but I'm thinking about buying one whopping server for my company and installing ESX on that.
[11:11] <crimsun> asdjjaad: none that are very effective.
[11:11] <volvoguy> fredl, i've not done any benchmarking either. just going by "feel".
[11:11] <asdjjaad>  crimsun: too bad.
[11:11] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I still would have chosen the most up-to-date version, just incase...
[11:11] <fredl> and I'm wondering if the price warrants the benefits.
[11:11] <volvoguy> fredl, just out of curiosity have you looked at Xen yet?
[11:11] <vegansickle> hey1
[11:11] <Vuen> Jaeke555: not really, you're still better off with dapper because it's LTS.
[11:11] <asdjjaad>  crimsun: Mandriva 2007 works
[11:11] <Staz> So is there a known fix for the black screen on boot of edgy live cd?
[11:11] <fredl> volvoguy, nope, I haven't. I've heard about it though. is that production quality?
[11:11] <cge> ChrisNiemy: Interesting
=== vegansickle is now known as sephyraie
[11:12] <cge> ChrisNiemy: You should file a bug about it.
[11:12] <Jaeke555> Vuen: LTS?
[11:12] <Vuen> Jaeke555: even though edgy is newer, dapper will be supported for a full year longer on desktop, and two years longer on server
[11:12] <asdjjaad>  crimsun: thanks buddy
[11:12] <volvoguy> fredl, i don't know. some commercial distros are shipping it standard. i haven't tried it yet either though.
[11:12] <sephyraie> i was having the DCOPserver errors
[11:12] <Vuen> Jaeke555: LTS means long term support. it means it will be supported for 3 years desktop, 5 years server instead of the 1.5/3 years edgy will be supported
[11:12] <fredl> volvoguy, well there's plenty of xen packages in the edgy repos....
[11:12] <Vuen> which means dapper will still be getting security updates long after edgy is discontinued
[11:13] <volvoguy> fredl, it might be worth a look through howtoforge and the wiki/forums. :)
[11:13] <fredl> volvoguy, is xen supposed to give same functionality as VMWare?
[11:13] <volvoguy> fredl, AFAIK, yes.
[11:13] <A3on> cge, yeah a restart fixed it
[11:13] <ChrisNiemy> cge: ok, this morning im getting used to launchpad it seems ;)
[11:13] <volvoguy> fredl, maybe not as easy to configure though. not sure.
[11:13] <sephyraie> its this DCOPclient::attachInternal. Attach failed Authentication Rejected
[11:13] <fredl> volvoguy, can it also run standalone or does it need a host OS?
[11:14] <Jaeke555> Vuen: What support?
[11:14] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I actually get support with open-source?
[11:14] <volvoguy> fredl, it needs a host OS. i've seen how-to's for really stripped down debian though that wouldn't use much resources. i think there's a Xen livecd that might answer some questions for you.
[11:14] <Vuen> Jaeke555: of course.
[11:14] <Juhaz> fredl, similar, but no the same. it doesn't emulate few things vmware does, so it needs hardware virtualization support or modified guest os
[11:15] <Vuen> Jaeke555: you're installing the server edition of ubuntu dapper; it will be supported in security updates and patches for another four and a half years.
[11:16] <Jaeke555> vuen: sweet!
[11:16] <fredl> juhaz, do you know if Xen also has possibilities like what I've seen briefly from VMWare, like migrating a virtual server from one piece of hardware to another?
[11:16] <boink> dapper is a "LTS" release
[11:16] <jdt> whats the story with the fonts in kubuntu edgy?
[11:17] <Vuen> Jaeke555: ubuntu's is not just a piece of experimental throwaway software by a bunch of computer geeks. it's a real full-blown operating system, just like windows or osx.
[11:17] <A3on> cge, be back in a second again need to check something
[11:17] <steal> hi all
[11:17] <sephyraie> jdt : get automatix
[11:17] <Juhaz> fredl, no idea
[11:17] <steal> do you  ever seen  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1526129
[11:17] <boink> ubuntu is based on the debian OS
[11:17] <steal> i've got the same problem
[11:17] <volvoguy> fredl, i think you can move VMs to different hardware with Xen. you should doublecheck that fact though. :)
[11:18] <Vuen> ubuntu is serious business!
[11:18] <Vuen> :)
[11:18] <steal> what can i do?
[11:18] <Juhaz> fredl, looks like it does
[11:18] <jdt> sephyraie: Thanks, I have it. However I have noticed that under gnome fonts in applications and the internet are fine, however in KDE they are quite hard on the eye.
[11:18] <fredl> juhaz,volvoguy, just looking into the VMWare Infrastructure 3 suite....
[11:19] <volvoguy> ok. i'm set as away but i really need to go away for a while now. i'll be back  in a bit, i'm sure. :)
[11:19] <Spee_Der> Good day folks, time for me to get to work....  Stay cool.
[11:19] <sam_ubtoo> does anyone have the name for the Chinese chatroom? *****************
[11:19] <Spee_Der> !ch
[11:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ch - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:19] <fredl> juhaz,volvoguy: what I'm talking about is apparently called VMotion
[11:19] <fredl> Move running virtual machines from one physical server to another with no impact to end users.
[11:19] <volvoguy> fredl, never heard of that.
[11:20] <sam_ubtoo> :(
[11:20] <Spee_Der> SAM_theman: I think it is #ubuntu-ch, not sure though.
[11:20] <Juhaz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen#Virtual_machine_migration
[11:20] <fredl> it's part of the VMWare Infrastructure 3 Enterprise....
[11:20] <sam_ubtoo> i thik cn is switzerland
[11:20] <sam_ubtoo> not china.
[11:20] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I didn't know that some people actually contribute so much time on open-source :)
[11:20] <crimsun> sam_ubtoo: cn is china.
[11:20] <sam_ubtoo> china is something like zh or something i cant remmeber
[11:20] <Spee_Der> sam_ubtoo: #ubuntu-ch = china, i think
[11:20] <Jaeke555> Vuen: That sounds even better than Microsoft "support"
[11:20] <bill_> is there a christian channel
[11:20] <sam_ubtoo> ch isnt china.
[11:21] <Vuen> Jaeke555: well it's not entirely volunteer. a lot of open-source programmers get paid just like proprietary programmers
[11:21] <Spee_Der> Hang on I'll find it for you.
[11:21] <fredl> wow juhaz.
[11:21] <sam_ubtoo> bill??  ~~  does jesus support windows or Linux?
[11:21] <volvoguy> Jaeke555, these people in here are amazing aren't they?!
[11:21] <fredl> Xen sure sounds impressive.
[11:21] <crimsun> zh is the locale prefix, yes. cn is the iso CC.
[11:21] <bill_> LINUX
[11:21] <sam_ubtoo> oh is tht true?
[11:21] <sam_ubtoo> no wonder you can access more X rated vidos on linux
[11:21] <Vuen> Jaeke555: the way open-source projects make money is that corporations pay for enterprise versions of software
[11:22] <Jaeke555> Vuen: That sounds even better than Microsoft "support"
[11:22] <Spee_Der> sam
[11:22] <bill_> sam why bash me
[11:22] <Spee_Der> try #ubuntu-cn
[11:22] <fredl> juhaz, so are you running Xen yourself?
[11:22] <Jaeke555> Vuen: yeah, I knew that :)
[11:22] <Vuen> for example, you can install fedora core for free if you're a home user, or you can purchase red hat enterprise for a corporation. corporations purchase this for reasons of direct support and liability
[11:22] <bill_> i came in here like all friendly
[11:23] <Spee_Der> sam_ubtoo: I tried that, but no one in there.
[11:23] <Vuen> that's why the home versions can be free, because you pay big bucks for corporate support and liability.
[11:23] <Juhaz> fredl, nope. I don't have any virtualization needs
[11:23] <fredl> Hmm, anybody here who has first-hand experience using Xen?
[11:24] <bill_> I am a TRUE Christian and do not do that stuff (xrated)
[11:24] <Vuen> it's sortof the same model with ubuntu, except there isn't a public/generic costly server edition. rather, ubuntu makes specialized projects for a fee
[11:24] <volvoguy> sam_ubtoo, you could try asking here and hope translation isn't an issue. :)
[11:24] <volvoguy> bill_, amen.
[11:24] <Vuen> for example, say NASA wants a linux distribution to run the shuttle, they'd approach mark shuttleworth and he'd make them a customized ubuntu distribution just for them
[11:25] <Vuen> that's just an example, obviously.
[11:25] <bill_> vol is there a Christian Channel around
[11:25] <Spee_Der> Good morning volvoguy
[11:25] <Spee_Der> Interesting nick you have.
[11:25] <A3on> cge, esmtp is the way to go, no listening of ports and allows rkhunter to be installed as well - im just super paranoid about progs attached to ports - its bad enough that i use tor ^^
[11:25] <volvoguy> fredl, i haven't tried this, but there's a live cd that might be good for getting your feet wet. http://www.xensource.com/xen/downloads/
[11:25] <volvoguy> Spee_Der, thanks!
[11:26] <chad> i have a .bin file(cd image) how can i mount it?
[11:26] <Jaeke555> Vuen: I ran apt-get update and upgrade, so its time to reboot now?
[11:26] <Spee_Der> volvoguy: My Volvo is a 2001 with 565 HP and 18 forward gears.  8-)
[11:26] <sam_ubtoo> 
[11:26] <fredl> mega-cool volvoguy, I'll certainly try that before I decide spending money on VMWare.
[11:26] <Vuen> Jaeke555: did it say no upgrades available?
[11:26] <Jaeke555> Vuen: no, it got some stuff
[11:27] <Vuen> do it over again
[11:27] <Vuen> to make sure
[11:27] <Vuen> do update then upgrade
[11:27] <josh_> how do i gksudo?
[11:27] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Now its 0 upgraded
[11:27] <sam_ubtoo> 
[11:27] <sam_ubtoo> 
[11:27] <sam_ubtoo> 
[11:27] <Vuen> Jaeke555: perfect, you're finally ready to reboot :D. type sudo reboot
[11:27] <volvoguy> Spee_Der, unfortunately i had to finally get rid of my '85 240 wagon, as it seemed to be a good target for other people to run into and finding body parts got too difficult.
[11:27] <bilss_> hi
[11:27] <josh_> how do i gksudo?
[11:27] <Spee_Der> Bummer.
[11:28] <Jaeke555> Vuen: is 'sudo reboot' as gentle as 'sudo shutdown -r now' ?
[11:28] <Vuen> Jaeke555: yeah, it's the same thing
[11:28] <bilss_> what is the command line to see how much spave you have used on a partition?
[11:28] <fredl> Hmm not too many people talking on #xen
[11:28] <Spee_Der> Gott'a go to work, have a great day folks. . . . .
[11:28] <chad> i have a .bin file(cd image) how can i mount it?
[11:28] <fredl> volvoguy, downloading the iso right now, real curious :)
[11:29] <Vuen> Jaeke555: reboot whichever way you want. even pressing ctrl+alt+delete should give you the same soft reboot
[11:29] <volvoguy> fredl, cool. let me know how it works if you catch me here again!
[11:29] <josh_> how do i gksudo?
[11:29] <Jaeke555> Vuen: okays...
[11:29] <josh_> how do i gksudo?
[11:29] <sam_ubtoo>       #ubuntu-zh   
[11:29] <Vuen> josh_: what would you like to gksudo?
[11:29] <Vuen> josh_: press alt+f2, and type in your command
[11:29] <fredl> volvoguy, well I'll be around for a while :) one thing that most interests me is the hardware support in Xen
[11:29] <josh_> oh really?
[11:29] <josh_> ok
[11:29] <fredl> volvoguy, since for VMWare it's kinda picky I think....
[11:29] <bilss_> i think Xen comes with the new install of ubuntu
[11:30] <Jaeke555> Vuen: So the GUI I just downloaded and installed is most up-to-date?
[11:30] <chad> i have a .bin file(cd image) how can i mount it?
[11:30] <bilss_> or else try howtoforge.com plenty of howtos and help
[11:30] <cge>  A3on: you use tor for everything?
[11:30] <fredl> volvoguy, but that may be for ESX only...
[11:30] <Vuen> Jaeke555: for dapper, yes.
[11:30] <volvoguy> fredl, yes it's a bit picky.
[11:30] <Jaeke555> Vuen: It seems to start just fine :)
[11:30] <TLE> bilss_: df -h
[11:30] <Vuen> Jaeke555: :) congratulations.

[11:31] <volvoguy> bill_, there's a Christian Ubuntu, so I'd assume so.
[11:31] <Vuen> ichthux? :p
[11:31] <bill_> Thanks all

[11:32] <fredl> bill_ could you try #ubuntu-offtopic if you're going to yell?
[11:32] <Vuen> ben_underscore: what command did you type?
[11:32] <bilss_> TLE: i want to pate bin something for you is that ok?
[11:32] <Vuen> ben_underscore: and where did you type it?
[11:32] <TLE> bilss_: yeah sure
[11:32] <bilss_> TLE ; ok
[11:32] <ben_underscore> Vuen: well i just ran system --> administration --> networking
[11:33] <simira> what is a good application to get my webcam online?
[11:33] <ben_underscore> hey i just discovered a new feature of gnome irc - history through the up/down arrows!
[11:33] <A3on> cge, there is a something else it seems i have port 59340 tcp open but nothing showing up as to what prog my be listening on it though nmap and the command  sudo netstat -a doesnt even show the port as open - whats going on?
[11:33] <volvoguy> bill_, looks like #christian-ubuntu is the place.
[11:33] <volvoguy> bill_, i'll come check it out myself.
[11:33] <apokryphos> ben_underscore: I don't know of an IRC client that *doesn't* have that 8)
[11:34] <Vuen> ben_underscore: hmm, and it didn't do anything? that's very strange
[11:34] <Vuen> ben_underscore: i don't use gnome so i can't really help, sorry
[11:34] <TLE> bilss_: btw I just recently made a small script to modify df. So I have a partition called data. So I can do "DF data" and then it highlights the line containing the data partition
[11:35] <ben_underscore> apokryphos: :-p
[11:36] <bilss_> TLE: just a simple explaination would be fine  http://pastebin.ca/241583   - ok can you pastebin the script please
[11:37] <ben_underscore> Vuen: no it did something, it just didn't execute via sudo, and hence couldn't modify any of the system files with a root permission
[11:38] <cge> A3on: What about netstat -lt?
[11:38] <A3on> cge, btw this is on 127.0.0.1
[11:41] <TLE> bilss_: Well I can only explain some of it. The hda1 is the only HD partition. I don't actually know why all the other ones are listed here. So but anyway you have this partition hda1, it is mounted as / meaning that it is the absolute root of your filesystem and your entire ubuntu system is if that partition. And as you can see you have used 6% of the 36Gb on that partition
[11:41] <A3on> cge, yes that seems to show that the local host is listening on that port, which seems to go along with why on 127.0.0.1 that port is open as well - do you why it is open and that would be used or listening on it?
[11:42] <cge> A3on: use sudo netstat -ltp
[11:43] <ChrisNiemy> cge: rm ~/.grip and rm ~/.xine was it. I must have messed the settings in grip.
[11:43] <cge> ChrisNiemy: ah
[11:43] <ChrisNiemy> cge: no bug
[11:43] <A3on> cge, hmm it says python is on that port why is that?
[11:43] <cge> A3on: one moment
[11:44] <cge> A3on: what port was it again?
[11:44] <bilss_> TLE: ok thanks can you paste the script you have please
[11:44] <A3on> cge, localhost:59340
[11:45] <Jaeke555> Vuen: Do you remember the key combo how I change my screen from Graphical to text-based?
[11:45] <cge> A3on: Get the PID of the python process, and do ps axw | grep $PID
[11:45] <crimsun> Jaeke555: ctrl+alt+F1 ?
[11:45] <Jaeke555> Vuen: And do you know a command that shows all on going processes?
[11:45] <Jaeke555> crimsun: gotta try that when the machine starts :)
[11:46] <YogSothoth> hi
[11:47] <TLE> bilss_: But actually in your case since you only have one partition is might not be that usefull for you. Instead if you only want to see that one partition you can do something smarter. First do "df -T" to figure out which filesystem type your partion uses. Maybe ext3. And then if it is ext3 you can do like this "df -h -t ext3"
[11:47] <Vuen> Jaeke555: ps aux
[11:48] <Vuen> you can find a process like this: ps aux | grep <name>
[11:48] <fredl> volvoguy, burning the CD now :)
[11:48] <Jaeke555> Crimsun: how do I get back to graphical from text-based?
[11:48] <A3on> cge, it seems the PID number relates to python /usr/sbin/hpssd, which seems to suggest some hp printing service or deamon?
[11:48] <Vuen> Jaeke555: top is the more popular process-watcher, but i have no idea how it works :p. ps aux just spits out the list.
[11:48] <TLE> bilss_: If that is good for you we can make a alias instead it is easier
[11:48] <crimsun> Jaeke555: alt+F7
[11:48] <Jaeke555> crimsun: thanks

[11:49] <bilss_>  yes it is ext3
[11:49] <fredl> would be cool if it's Ubuntu :P
[11:50] <apokryphos> probably suse
[11:50] <YogSothoth> I try to run Loki's SimCity 3000 on Ubuntu Edgy. I have libg++2.8.1.3-glibc2.2 libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 installed and SC3U is patched with sc3u-2.0a-x86.run. I have an error when I try to launch the game:  sc3u: error while loading shared libraries: libdl.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. The lunch command I use is LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 /usr/local/bin/sc3u and I can find libdl.so.2 in /lib/tls/i68
[11:50] <YogSothoth> 6/cmov and in /lib.
[11:50] <fredl> is Xen a suse effort?
[11:50] <fredl> I thought I heard Redhat...
[11:50] <blujay> Could I get a dev to look at a bug that needs attention quite badly?  It at least needs a priority set, pronto.  Bug#64841
[11:50] <fredl> but it seems Novell is doing a lot of great work too.
[11:51] <halex> Xen is mainly Novell, but Red Hat wants a piece now..
[11:51] <bilss_> TLE thanks for that command it is useful you see i am thinking of installing Xen on dapper i have a mail server with mimimal X
[11:51] <halex> :)
[11:51] <blujay> YogSothoth: maybe you can make a symlink in the dir where it's looking
[11:52] <fredl> bills_ maybe getting the Xen demo CD is a good idea for you too?
[11:52] <Juhaz> neither, but no doubt they both are contributing and integrating it into their distros
[11:52] <blujay> YogSothoth: try linking it in /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib
[11:52] <YogSothoth> blujay, How can I now where it's looking?
[11:52] <YogSothoth> blujay, ok
[11:52] <blujay> YogSothoth: or maybe you need to adjust the path where the system looks for libs...but I don't remember how :)
[11:52] <YogSothoth> blujay, I already tried /usr/local/lib
[11:52] <fredl> well lemme reboot into that Xen demo brb
[11:52] <cge> A3on: It is the hplip printing system.
[11:52] <blujay> YogSothoth: try /usr/lib, I'd be surprised if that doesn't fix it
[11:53] <apokryphos> it could actually be debian

[12:00] <Vuen> beryl is that great though :D
[12:00] <thyko> how do i configure networking from the command line?
[12:00] <Tompu> is there any actual reason to use XGL anymore?
[12:00] <[118] Gatekeeper> i have a problem with edubuntu: the system read the kernel and initrd than it halted
[12:00] <[118] Gatekeeper> from cd boot
[12:00] <Vuen> thyko: depends what you want to do. a lot of networking commands start with if, such as ifconfig
[12:00] <Vuen> so you can start with "man ifconfig"
[12:00] <Vuen> i don't really know anything beyond that
[12:00] <BeanBag> Vuen: sorry, my mistake
[12:00] <azcazandco> Hi can anyone help me get my folders view back in nautalis?
[12:00] <gaurav> cge, Please refer to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30408/
[12:00] <bilss_> blujay: i think its the harddrive its a lbtop 18 months old but do not want to upgrade to dapper but nice to have Xen there
[12:01] <Vuen> BeanBag: look on youtube for videos of compiz in action
[12:01] <gaurav> cge, is it expected ??
[12:01] <BeanBag> Vuen: How does one install Beryl in ubuntu dapper drake?
[12:01] <blujay> bilss_: you are running...breezy?  and it's only an 18 month-old laptop?
[12:01] <bilss_> bluejay: sorry upgrade to efty
[12:01] <blujay> bilss_: ah :)
[12:01] <thyko> Vuen: my problem is i have put the right entries in /etc/resolve but its not resolving
[12:01] <blujay> BeanBag: google for the directions, they're quite available :)
[12:01] <gaurav> cge, from a fresh Edgy installation
[12:02] <cge> gaurav: strange
[12:02] <BeanBag> thanks, will do so
[12:02] <Vuen> BeanBag: these would be the most recent directions: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu
[12:02] <bilss_> blujay: dapper is ok as a server efty is not TLS
[12:02] <Vuen> gah
[12:02] <gaurav> cge, I think its broken, could you please check what's in your box
[12:02] <blujay> bilss_: yeah
[12:03] <Vuen> blujay: beryl has been in heavy development for a month and a half, so most installation guides are horribly broken
[12:03] <Vuen> it's best to send people to wiki.beryl-project.org
[12:03] <cge> gaurav: It is find on my box, let me find out what package it is.
[12:03] <bilss_> blujay: dapper is the first in the development as a server
[12:03] <gaurav> cge, I think linuxprinting.org-ppds
[12:03] <cge> gaurav: linuxprinting.org-ppds
[12:03] <azcazandco> anyone?  This is slowing down my workflow loads, ever since upgrading to edgy eft I can no longer use nautalis like I would windows explorer with a list of folders on the left and the folder contents on the right, this this something to so with SE Linux?
[12:03] <blujay> bilss_: yep
[12:03] <bilss_> blujay; efty is an addition
[12:03] <cge> gaurav: Is that not installed?
[12:04] <gaurav> cge, started Downloading that package
[12:04] <blujay> azcazandco: you can fix that by using Konqueror ;)
[12:04] <gaurav> cge, it seems PPD is missing, I've installed from Edgy "AMD64" alternate CD
[12:04] <fredl> Well this is definitely interesting.... I just booted the Xen demo CD and created a Suse virtual machine just like that.
[12:04] <cge> gaurav: that should be installed by default
[12:04] <thyko> why does the box not resolve?
[12:05] <cge> gaurav: do you have ubuntu-desktop installed?
[12:05] <badm0j0> anyone here who can help me with my installation?
[12:05] <blujay> azcazandco: seriously though, no it's not an SELinux problem, you just need to adjust some settings
[12:05] <scheuri> !ask
[12:05] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:05] <fredl> whoops

[12:06] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[12:07] <volvoguy> fredl, sometimes. what's up?
[12:07] <fredl> volvoguy, logged in from the Xen democd right now.
[12:07] <volvoguy> hey, is there a way to save the chat log for a particular channel?
[12:07] <volvoguy> fredl, cool!
[12:07] <azcazandco> blujay: do you know which settings?  I dont want to use KDE environment
[12:07] <badm0j0> i can configure my network device with a static ip, but when i try to ping the gateway i don't get any replys
[12:07] <fredl> volvoguy, looks pretty spiffy....
[12:08] <azcazandco> also, is Edgy SE Linux?
[12:08] <dools> i just typed 'mail' on the command line and it said the command was not found. how should i read locally delivered mail on ubuntu?
[12:08] <badm0j0> its all on dapper 64 bit version
[12:08] <fredl> doesn't come with a default way to create an Ubuntu VM though :P
[12:08] <volvoguy> fredl, are there virtual machines available on the cd?
[12:09] <azcazandco> blujay: if I browser to the root dir in nautalis, I can't see all the files but I can browse them no worries on the command line as my current user
[12:09] <fredl> volvoguy, yes, you can create a Debian Etch / CentOS 4.1 / OpenSuse 10.0 vm using a command as simple as 'xm create -c <configfile> name=my-vm-name'
[12:09] <Vuen> hey #ubuntu, how do i get the UUID of a partition?
[12:10] <volvoguy> fredl, sweet! now i'm going to need to download it. :)
[12:10] <fredl> volvoguy, I think the host distro is actually Debian.
[12:10] <mrgwen> hello i've a little question about the kernel options of ubuntu : is the kernel compiled with the midi support ?
[12:10] <fredl> well lunchtime here, bbl
[12:10] <gaurav> cge, is that bug that this package is excluded ?
[12:10] <halex> mrgwen, yes, but I think you also need to download a software synth to get any sound from your MIDI device..
[12:10] <edeca> Vuen: Check /proc/ide/<drive>*
[12:11] <mrgwen> halex: thanks
[12:11] <edeca> Anybody know the best place to ask about md RAID if I've got a broken array?
[12:11] <jarrad> What is the key combination to kill a task>?
[12:11] <edeca> jarrad: Control-c
[12:11] <Vuen> edeca: i can't find anything there of interest
[12:12] <jarrad> edeca: thanks mate
[12:12] <netpython> or kill <proces-id>
[12:12] <volvoguy> fredl, yeah - i think debian too.

[12:19] <gaurav> cge, thanks for the help :)
[12:20] <volvoguy> hey guys, slightly off topic - but do you know if it's possible to use two powersupplies in one machine? my fileserver is way overloaded with 6 drives in it and i can't afford a new PSU right now.
[12:21] <weardlan> mount and grub aint going to help me much until I can get the live CD up
=== cO_lazio is now known as c0_smapalas
[12:22] <Vuen> i can't believe this finally worked
[12:22] <Etapien> sure u can volvoguy, as long as you got space for it.
[12:22] <Vuen> i've finally converted my 180 gig partition from vfat to ext3 without losing any data
[12:22] <Vuen> that was amazing
[12:22] <netpython> weardlan, any livecd should do exept when you want to install ubuntu
[12:22] <Vuen> i can't believe my harddrive didn't catch fire and explode
[12:23] <volvoguy> Etapien, cool. it's a monster anyway, so i don't mind it just sitting on top. i was just worried there'd be grounding issues or something.
[12:23] <weardlan> nope, I boot of the live cd, it loads mini kernel, than crashes out with a cannot access tty error
[12:23] <Tompu> Etapien: how would he get it to start? PSU's dont just pump out power without getting flipped on
[12:23] <weardlan> ubuntu and kubuntu
=== cO_lazio is now known as c0_smapalas
[12:23] <Tompu> volvoguy: sounds like a serious electronics undertaking. you cant just give power to two psu's and expect attached devices to work
[12:23] <volvoguy> Tompu, good point.
[12:24] <Tompu> besides which, i have a fileserver with a 350W supply, and 8 HDD's
[12:24] <weardlan> volvoguy, serious danger of electronic interference, different earths and different timings and different levels.
[12:24] <Tompu> HDD's dont draw all that much power
[12:25] <Tompu> weardlan: he'd need multiple atx connectors on the mobo anyway
[12:25] <volvoguy> Tompu, really? mine is a 280W I think (donated hardware) and it's smokin' hot with 6 drives and 2 P3 550Mhz processors.
[12:25] <volvoguy> Most PSU makers claim heat is the first sign you're underpowered.
[12:26] <Rothbuntu> p2-400 2 hdds :(
[12:26] <Tompu> volvoguy: tried cleaning it out? :D
[12:26] <volvoguy> Tompu, oh yeah - and installed a new fan to make sure it wouldn't crap out.
[12:27] <Tompu> volvoguy: sounds like you really will need to splash out on a beefier psu then
[12:27] <Nabilux> hi all
[12:27] <scamboy> hi
[12:27] <Tompu> volvoguy: i really dont think the cost of a psu justifies the kind of risk you'd be taking trying to wire in two psu's
[12:27] <volvoguy> Tompu, i was afraid of that. I need one in my desktop too now with a new(ish) power-hungry gfx card and stuff.

[12:31] <Administrator__> chuckyp, kind a like yes

[12:31] <niksavel> I did this only once and forgot what I'm doing wrong - I have a fat32 partition mounted but only have read-only...   shown all files and folders as owned by root...  what to do?
[12:31] <i_am_stupid> ubuntu is very buggy
[12:31] <Administrator__> chuckyp, I have read about uck, but it's not advanced enough.
[12:31] <i_am_stupid> but hey
[12:31] <i_am_stupid> i mean
[12:31] <yakumo> help can't convert mp4 using ffmpeg
[12:32] <i_am_stupid> its better than debian
[12:32] <weardlan> I'd likde to help find the bugs, 'cept I can't boot it
[12:32] <Tschaka> ./ignore i_am_stupid imho :P
[12:32] <i_am_stupid> because debian is only for geek
[12:32] <i_am_stupid> s
[12:32] <Tompu> yakumo: try mencoder?
[12:32] <weardlan> and ubuntu support seems to be happy to ignore me

[12:32] <weardlan> or sugest I boot hr liveCD
[12:32] <scheuri> the nick says it all...:)
[12:32] <yakumo> ok
[12:32] <Administrator__> chuckyp, basicly, if it would be possible I would just like to modify init scripts of a ubuntu install cd

[12:32] <weardlan> which is exactly what *wont* booy
[12:32] <i_am_stupid> ask your question1!!!

[12:33] <weardlan> there is not likely look /dev/ device for the cd
[12:33] <volvoguy> yakumo, VLC is usually used as a media player, but it can encode files as well - using FFMPEG i believe.
[12:34] <yakumo> ok thnks

[12:36] <Administrator__> chuckyp, I already tried mkcdrec and mondo. But both are buggy.
[12:36] <weardlan> desktop
[12:36] <karlmarx> because i had to use nvidia-legacy-glx drivers

[12:36] <weardlan> desktop cd
[12:36] <karlmarx> so it didnt work
[12:36] <karlmarx> and nobody coul helped me
[12:36] <weardlan> what's 'alternate'
[12:36] <apokryphos> weardlan: using the alternate CD might be a short-term solution, but I recommend filing a bug report.
[12:36] <karlmarx> but i fixed it my self
[12:36] <apokryphos> weardlan: check the faq
[12:36] <karlmarx> its install cd
[12:36] <weardlan> did
[12:36] <volvoguy> yakumo, i use a few different programs to convert to mp4 but not on linux. they all use ffmpeg though in the background I think. you could check out "Videora iPod Converter" (a windows app) or "iSquint.org" (a mac app) to see if they have ffmpeg tweaking tips.
[12:37] <karlmarx> without live cd

[12:38] <lunchbox> morning all
[12:38] <niksavel> oh come on for the love of god somebody help me with my idiocy...  I normally mounted my fat32 partition but for some reason only have reading permission to it.... ???
[12:38] <thyko> is there a commandline network configuration tool like slackware's netconfig?
[12:38] <chuckyp> Administrator__, there is tons of documentation on it I just searchd google for customize ubuntu live cd
[12:39] <rigidus> hi all,
[12:39] <Tompu> niksavel: how are you mounting it? automagically via fstab? manually?

[12:40] <rigidus> could anybody help me guys, how to give -i option to postgresql's postmaster process? Thanks :-)

[12:41] <Dimensions> hi  i have a laptop with ubuntu installed i want to make it dual boot with xp how can i do that ? i dont have extra partition on it ... how do i resize and install xp with it ?
[12:41] <i-am-stupid> you can do it with the installer
[12:41] <volvoguy> can i paste a link in here for someone or do i need the pastebin thing?
[12:41] <apokryphos> actually, wrong unbanning. Hm.
[12:42] <chuckyp> Dimensions, you have ubuntu installed first or xp?
[12:42] <volvoguy> nevermind. he left.
[12:42] <Dimensions> chuckyp:  i have ubuntu installed i want to install xp with it now ...
[12:42] <chuckyp> volvoguy, pastebin is only for more than 4 lines
[12:42] <iwaterball> Dimensions: you can use qtparted to resize, them istall XP then you'll need to manually reinstall and configure grub
[12:42] <volvoguy> chuckyp, cool. thanks.
[12:42] <Dimensions> i dont have extra parition atm i am resizing it .. i have both xp and ubuntu cds with me ...
[12:42] <Dimensions> iwaterball: whats qtparted ?
[12:42] <fredl> Hmmm Xen uses a form of virtualization known as paravirtualization wherein the guest Operating System is modified to use a special hypercall ABI instead of using certain architectural features.
[12:43] <chuckyp> Dimensions, yeah after you resize install xp to the freespace then you can install xp.   Boot back to the ubuuntu live cd and reinstall grub.  Because xp will overwrite it.
[12:43] <iwaterball> Dimensions: its a Linux partitioning tool, similar to partition magic
[12:43] <Dimensions> i_am_stupid: and how ? i have ubuntu cd and xp i guess i can first resize with ubuntu ?
[12:43] <fredl> I wonder... does this mean that say, Ubuntu, needs to be modified to run 'hypercall ABI' under Xen?
[12:43] <chuckyp> Dimensions, yes
[12:44] <Dimensions> chuckyp: how do i resize with ubunttu desktop live cd ?
[12:44] <chuckyp> fredl, why not just use vmware
[12:44] <chuckyp> Dimensions, use gparted
[12:44] <volvoguy> chuckyp, with fredl - long story. :)
[12:44] <Dimensions> i dont have gparted thats the thingy ...
[12:44] <niksavel> tompu: how do I pastebin?  :)
[12:44] <volvoguy> fredl, that's way beyond me. :)
[12:44] <fredl> chuckyp - VMWare is cool. I've checked out the VMWare free server....

[12:44] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:44] <Tompu> fredl: it was my understanding that the 'modification' happens automagically from within Xen?
[12:44] <chuckyp> Dimensions, then install it sudo apt-get install gparted
[12:45] <Tompu> niksavel: are you on the system with the fat32 partition now?
[12:45] <Tompu> niksavel: or are you on a different computer
[12:45] <niksavel> tompu: yes
[12:45] <fredl> chuckyp, but I am looking into purchasing VMWare infrastructure.... volvoguy however complicated my issues and pointed me to Xen
[12:45] <niksavel> tompu: I am on the comp
[12:45] <mjr> fredl, generally, the kernel needs to be xen-aware, nothing else needs be modified. (Though with the latest VM-supporting processors from intel and amd, even the kernel may be unmodified, but it'll incur some overhead)
[12:45] <volvoguy> fredl, hehe. :)
[12:45] <niksavel> tompu: I can read the files normally but can't write
[12:45] <Tompu> niksavel: copy and paste the contents of /etc/fstab to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:45] <fredl> Tompu, I don't know for sure, it says something in the Xen wiki though about running paravirtualization on Windows OS and that it's illegal.
[12:45] <volvoguy> fredl, open-source man, you want open-source!!! hehe.
[12:46] <Tompu> fredl: but you're not wanting to paravirtualise a windows OS? are you trying to host ubuntu within windows?
[12:46] <niksavel> tompu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30412/
[12:47] <niksavel> tompu: I see all the files and folders as owned by root...  maybe that's the prob? :)
[12:47] <fredl> Tompu - basically I would *prefer* to have something like Ubuntu as a host OS for Xen. But I would *like* to be able to create Guest VM's from Windows XP, Linux variants and hopefully Nexenta.
[12:48] <Dimensions> thanks guys ...
[12:48] <netpython> +s
[12:48] <niksavel> tompu: what now?
[12:48] <fredl> volvoguy, you're right, and that's always been my philosophy after I bought a redhat CDE cd that broke on the next Redhat release....
[12:48] <CarinArr> niksavel, what are you trying tod o
[12:49] <volvoguy> fredl, been there - done that. :) SuSE in my case.
[12:49] <fredl> volvoguy, that's when I decided that commercial software on opensource distro's is just a bad idea. VMWare however pleases me to know end.
[12:49] <Tompu> niksavel: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30414/
[12:49] <niksavel> carnarr: don't have write permissions on mounted fat32
[12:50] <fredl> volvoguy, you really pissed me off with this Xen though :) what I'm seeing right now I really like.
[12:50] <xorllu> hi, how can i disable IPV6 or ignore ipv6 module loading on startup?
[12:50] <volvoguy> fredl, i didn't mean to steer you into infinte complexity on purpose. i just wanted to present another option. Xen might not be at the stage it'll work for you yet so might be better off with VMware.
[12:51] <weardlan> your d: drive niksavel?
[12:51] <Tompu> fredl: i guess you're right about the porting
[12:52] <Tompu> fredl: it does look like you need a modified version to me
[12:52] <niksavel> weardlan: yes
[12:52] <niksavel> tompu: still the same
[12:52] <CarinArr> niksavel, try changing umask to 007
[12:52] <Tompu> niksavel: did you remount?
[12:52] <fredl> yah 'infinite complexity' about covers it volvoguy :) See I will also look into buying hardware that would optimally be supported by either Xen or VMWare, and those may not have much overlap :P
[12:53] <niksavel> sudo mount -a
[12:53] <netpython> vmware is easier to setup and maintain
[12:53] <[118] Gatekeeper> is ohci firewire or usb2.0
[12:53] <Tompu> niksavel: does that remount already mounted filesystems?
[12:53] <[118] Gatekeeper> ?
[12:54] <weardlan> surely fastab line 10 ( from tomputs paste) should be rw?
[12:54] <Tompu> weardlan: oops
[12:54] <Tompu> weardlan: *hides*
[12:54] <fredl> netpython, that may just be a matter of time don't you think? Also, I see that Xen supports stuff that's only available in VMWare infrastructure 3 *enterprise* edition
[12:54] <volvoguy> fredl, if you need this setup sooner than later, i'd stick with VMware and keep an eye on Xen progress. that's my humble (and non-technical) opinion.
[12:55] <netpython> fredl, yes Xen will most likely catchup,and have a nice GUI too someday :-)
[12:55] <Tompu> niksavel: change the ro to rw, and if you mount again, use -v so you can see if it's actually remounting or just leaving the current mount alone
[12:55] <chrmm> Can somone help me with getting the harddrive partiton Windows is on to show in Ubuntu screen?
[12:56] <niksavel> k
[12:56] <fredl> volvoguy, nah I'm not on a deadline or anything. I just figured that VMWare looks like it's 'ready' for production use, in fact it has been for some time.
[12:56] <volvoguy> fredl, yes. that's true.
[12:57] <fredl> volvoguy, I've briefly seen VMWare enterprise and what you can do with that and it's quite amazing....
[12:57] <fredl> volvoguy, to make matters more complicated even, I'm a big Solaris fan....
[12:57] <chrmm> Can somone help me? I cant seem to find out how to show my c: drive (the one windows is installed on) to show in Drapper (6.06)

[12:58] <volvoguy> i really want to learn more about the nifty solaris features. i've even been looking at getting some of their hardware (when the money fairy pays me a visit).
[12:59] <fredl> volvoguy, you don't need to get Sun hardware for Solaris....
[12:59] <wedderburn> volvoguy: you can use it on x86 if you want to try it
[12:59] <niksavel> tomou: just sudo mount -v?
[12:59] <volvoguy> fredl, i know. it just seems to be a good value.
[12:59] <fredl> volvoguy, google for Nexenta, best of three worlds, Debian, GNU and Solaris.
[12:59] <niksavel> tompu: just sudo mount -v?
[12:59] <volvoguy> fredl, at quick glance.
[12:59] <volvoguy> fredl, yep. i've tried Nexenta.

[01:02] <volvoguy> fredl, ok ok.... downloading the ISO.
[01:02] <niksavel> tompu: should I try a reboot?

[01:04] <volvoguy> fredl, oh yeah. gotcha.
[01:04] <Tompu> niksavel: easy way will be a reboot then :)
[01:04] <fredl> and then in the alpha5 changed sources.list to unstable and apt-get dist-upgrades, worked like a charm!

[01:08] <andy_t_roo> i came in 1/2 way through the vmware discussion - i take it tbat that is a better vm machine to use?
[01:08] <fredl> volvoguy, you got VMWare running then?
[01:08] <fyrestrtr> andy_t_roo: isn't microsoft virtual pc for Mac, and isn't it only designed to be able to install Windows?
[01:08] <scheuri> andy_t_roo: with linux? definitively

[01:08] <netpython> what about qemu?
[01:09] <fredl> yeah but vmware server free doesn't have everything I'd want.
[01:09] <netpython> even has an accelerator kqemu

[01:11] <gunfus> anyone familiar with that error?
[01:11] <ailean> what program can i use to encode an ".avi file onto a DVD so that I can play it on DVD players?
[01:11] <fredl> volvoguy, to make matters more complicated there's also Xen Enterprise
[01:12] <volvoguy> fredl, yep - like Ubuntu I think that adds official tech support and such. not sure if it adds any features.
[01:13] <fredl> it's pricey too
[01:13] <netpython> fredl, is labmanager nothing suitable :-)
[01:13] <volvoguy> fredl, for those commercial customers. :)
[01:14] <fredl> haha yeah licenses to please managers that won't have to say then 'well it's, like, free...'  'oh you cheapskate, something that's free MUST suck'
[01:14] <volvoguy> fredl, exactly.

[01:27] <volvoguy> like that's necessary.
[01:28] <Rothbuntu> isnt that like dividing by 0
[01:28] <volvoguy> i think so.
[01:28] <XiXaQ> I have installed Xen using the guide at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenOnEdgy, and created a vm using the same guide. That gives me a virtual machine with the base system. I would like to have a complete ubuntu-desktop system. Can I get some help?
[01:29] <tempest130> is anyone having trouble with 6.10 not resuming with a Intel i810 video chip?
[01:29] <Rothbuntu> :D  opps just caused a rip in space time buy opening another vm in a vm
[01:30] <volvoguy> Rothbuntu, and without any Harlem Globetrotters! ;)

[01:31] <volvoguy> or maybe i'm just immature. :-P
[01:33] <andy_t_roo> well now that we have concusivly proved that you can put vm linux in vm linux in vm.... , does anyone know if anything can run windows at a sensable speed (its reported that xen 3 can do so)
[01:33] <tempest130> DOES ANYONE HERE USES EDGY ON A LAPTOP?
[01:33] <samir85> yes I do
[01:33] <volvoguy> i didn't know Xen could run windows at all.
[01:33] <iwaterball> andy_t_roo: vmware can do that, given you have enough processors (e.g. 2 or more...)
[01:33] <volvoguy> I DO TEMPEST. (ssssh.)
[01:34] <tempest130> volvoguy, does your suspend/resume work?
[01:34] <ndlovu> does anyone know of an open source program that will open .pub (Publisher) files?
[01:34] <volvoguy> tempest130, honestly i haven't tested it yet.
[01:34] <andy_t_roo> i'v a core duo =) thats roughly the answer i was looking for
[01:34] <iwaterball> volvoguy: you need special CPU fraeatures for that (available in newer 2-core CPUs)
[01:35] <volvoguy> iwaterball, for Xen and Windows?
[01:35] <iwaterball> Volstrup: yeah.
[01:35] <iwaterball> volvoguy: to many ppl match "vol*"...

[01:37] <jmspeex> What should I install as a simple ftp server?
[01:38] <volvoguy> iwaterball, gotcha.
[01:38] <Tompu> ndlovu: I can't find anything that will handle .pub
[01:39] <volvoguy> tempest130, i had closed the lid with edgy running and the machine was off when i opened the lid just now - so it didn't automatically suspend to disk. when it's done booting i'll try selecting it from the menu.
[01:39] <ndlovu> Tompu, thanks for looking
[01:39] <andy_t_roo> wiki/Xen  has info in hardware assisted virtualixation
[01:41] <Tompu> !ftp | jmspeex
[01:41] <ubotu> jmspeex: FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: ftpd, proftpd, pure-ftpd, twoftpd, vsftpd
[01:41] <tempest130> volvoguy. well my laptop suspends fine, but when I open the lid, the laptop either goes back to the login screen or does't resume when suspended for more than 10 mins.
[01:41] <tempest130> can't even get any help for that.
[01:41] <tempest130> fustrated. I've been using ubuntu for about 2 years now...
[01:42] <mikeymike-linux> hmm
[01:43] <tempest130> thanks volvoguy for checking your laptop. i've got to go.
[01:43] <tempest130> I've should just upgraded Gnome.  I would have been fine
[01:44] <mikeymike-linux> omg what kinda emo crap is going on here
[01:44] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[01:47] <Tompu> mikeymike-linux: australian?
[01:47] <mikeymike-linux> haha
[01:47] <mikeymike-linux> was he?
[01:47] <Tompu> mikeymike-linux: i was asking if you're aussie
[01:47] <mikeymike-linux> ohhhh
[01:47] <mikeymike-linux> no sir
[01:47] <mikeymike-linux> not a kiwi either :)
[01:48] <sowdog> hi all, i'm trying to get the new nvidia-glx drivers but it requires 'nvidia-kernel-1.0.9625'. Any idea where i can get this?
[01:48] <incorrect> is subversion 1.4 packaged?
[01:49] <gnomefreak> sowdog: did you get the drivers from nvidia?
[01:49] <incorrect> i would really like to use that over 1.3
[01:49] <volvoguy> oh well. X was broken when i rebooted my laptop anyway.
[01:49] <mikeymike-linux> how do you check what version of nvidia drivers you have
[01:49] <sowdog> gnomefreak, naw i'm getting it from amaranth's repositories
[01:49] <mikeymike-linux> i havent changed mine in a WHILE
[01:49] <Tompu> incorrect: ubotu says 1.3.2
[01:50] <Rothbuntu> LOL
[01:50] <mikeymike-linux> hmm
[01:50] <gnomefreak> sowdog: his repo has teh l-r-m package for them sowdog sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx let me know what the first choice it
[01:50] <gnomefreak> is
[01:50] <Rothbuntu> its ok im soon to be Swiss
[01:51] <incorrect> let me get this right, dapper will be supported for the next 3 years but edgy won't ?
[01:51] <mikeymike-linux> whats the latest nvidia-glx ??
[01:51] <gnomefreak> sowdog: first choice should be to install the 8xxx series drivers right?
[01:51] <mikeymike-linux> i have 1.0.8762+2.16.15.11-5
[01:51] <gnomefreak> !info nvidia-glx
[01:51] <ubotu> nvidia-glx: NVIDIA binary XFree86 4.x/X.Org driver. In component restricted, is optional. Version 1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1 (edgy), package size 3970 kB, installed size 12312 kB
[01:51] <mikeymike-linux> oh wow
[01:51] <mikeymike-linux> what about for dapper?
[01:51] <jmcdonald> Hi Ubuntu friends. Is anybody kind to answer a couple of questions regarding Ubuntu 6.06 and 6.10, new to this chanel and Ubuntu.
[01:51] <mikeymike-linux> im running dapper
[01:51] <Rothbuntu> Dapper is the main stable release
[01:51] <gnomefreak> mikeymike-linux: your on dappr thats why
[01:51] <mikeymike-linux> ah
[01:51] <Rothbuntu> edgy is a bit of a SP 2  :D
[01:52] <mikeymike-linux> so my version is the most up to date i can have?
[01:52] <gnomefreak> mikeymike-linux: yours is correct for dapper
[01:52] <sowdog> gnomefreak, yeap first choice is to install that
[01:52] <gnomefreak> sowdog: type n
[01:52] <mikeymike-linux> man
[01:52] <Tompu> jmcdonald: just ask away
[01:52] <gnomefreak> sowdog: give me next choice
[01:52] <defrysk> http://amaranth.selfip.com/ has the beta-drivers for nvidia-edgy
[01:52] <mikeymike-linux> its been a while
[01:52] <mikeymike-linux> i guess linux drivers are slower
[01:52] <gnomefreak> defrysk: right now there is issues and it will be a week or two before they are fixed
[01:52] <sowdog> gnomefreak, downgrade to 2.6.17.5-12~amaranth
[01:53] <mikeymike-linux> wow i dont have nvidia-settings installed
[01:53] <defrysk> gnomefreak, I installed it using aptitude
[01:53] <gnomefreak> sowdog: thats teh one you eanty
[01:53] <gnomefreak> want
[01:53] <jmcdonald> ok, I've been using linux now and then but not really serious, now I want to switch to Linux, and like ubuntu
[01:53] <gnomefreak> sowdog: type y
[01:53] <gnomefreak> sowdog: than yes
[01:53] <gnomefreak> than y
[01:53] <gnomefreak> than yes
[01:53] <Tompu> jmcdonald: so far so good
[01:53] <defrysk> gnomefreak, it did some downgrades but worked fine
[01:53] <gnomefreak> defrysk: dont upgrade
[01:53] <weardlan> edgy is borked to the point of pointlessness
[01:53] <jmcdonald> need to know something regarding new releases and packages...
[01:53] <mikeymike-linux> haha
[01:53] <sowdog> gnomefreak, i've no idea how you remembered that sequence... but thanks :D
[01:53] <defrysk> gnomefreak, I didnt
[01:53] <mikeymike-linux> jmcdonald, just ask
[01:53] <defrysk> I downgraded
[01:53] <gnomefreak> defrysk: it will continue to try to install the new l-r-m package
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[01:54] <gnomefreak> sowdog: cause i work with it everyday
[01:54] <jmcdonald> when ubuntu 6.06 was out, there were a certain amount of improvements right!, now I need to know if after the final release
[01:54] <gnomefreak> sowdog: do not run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade until its fixed
[01:54] <defrysk> the driver of amaranth runs like a charm here
[01:54] <defrysk> no dist-upgrade inseed
[01:54] <defrysk> indeed
[01:54] <jmcdonald> i can get more updated (NEW) versions of the same packages that came from the release, instead of getting 6.10
[01:55] <gnomefreak> defrysk: runs fine here too just conflicting version numbers and wont be fixed fopr atleast a week
[01:55] <defrysk> but the ones who did can fix the issue with aptitude
[01:55] <mikeymike-linux> jmcdonald, what
[01:55] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[01:55] <gnomefreak> jmcdonald: no
[01:55] <gnomefreak> defrysk: thats not a fix
[01:55] <jmcdonald> so no new version of packages after final release, just security stuff
[01:55] <mikeymike-linux> is he asking for edgy packages on dapper?
[01:55] <defrysk> no its a downgrade
[01:55] <jmcdonald> right?
[01:55] <lastnode> gnomefreak, pm?
[01:55] <gnomefreak> defrysk: workaround
=== Intimate` is now known as Juiced`
[01:55] <Tompu> jmcdonald: I'm not a dapper user
[01:55] <mikeymike-linux> is edgy worth the hassle
[01:55] <defrysk> gnomefreak, whats in a name
[01:56] <gnomefreak> lastnode: give me a few minutes im gonna run outside for smoke
[01:56] <mikeymike-linux> im happy in dapper
[01:56] <lastnode> gnomefreak, cool
[01:56] <defrysk> in
[01:56] <jmcdonald> I cant get gnome 2.16 instead of default 2.14 from official repos right!
[01:56] <Rothbuntu> everythign has gone smooth for me with edgy so far
[01:57] <weardlan> edgy wont even boot for me
[01:57] <mikeymike-linux> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[01:57] <mikeymike-linux> haha
[01:57] <defrysk> edgy is beryl playgroud
[01:57] <mikeymike-linux> NEW STARTUP!
[01:57] <mikeymike-linux> no wai.
[01:57] <mikeymike-linux> :P
[01:57] <Rothbuntu> mm edgy and xgl/beryl
[01:57] <Rothbuntu> on my core duo laptop
[01:57] <volvoguy> anybody in this room know who the laptop team lead is?
[01:57] <volvoguy> they're all asleep on their channel.
[01:58] <defrysk> with a lap on their top
[01:58] <volvoguy> most likely.
[01:58] <dom_f> mikeymike-linux:   I was also happy in Dapper but upgraded to Edgy.  Following a real horrible time I reinstalled Edgy from scratch - despite this I continued to have a number of problems which I worked thro - eventually however I gave up and am now back in Dapper.  I've decided to leave it a while for those with more knowledge wthan me to work through the issues.
[01:58] <jmcdonald> so to get things clear, I need to know the following:
[01:58] <mikeymike-linux> dom_f, i dont think i'd have a problem fixing the issues
[01:58] <mikeymike-linux> /var/log is your friend
[01:58] <mikeymike-linux> :)
[01:59] <jmcdonald> I will not get any new version of packages that are now shipping in EE from the official DD repositories.
[01:59] <dom_f> mikeymike-linux:  Nor did I - however the one that beat me was "hard" hangs whenever the machine was left overnight.  Serveral people suggested hardware problems but it hasn't happened since I moved back to dapper.
[01:59] <Rasman> Edgy seems worth it for my work desktop and home desktop. I'm not going to upgrade any servers except for a test server.
[01:59] <mikeymike-linux> hardware problems in edgy
[02:00] <mikeymike-linux> dom_f, that sucks
[02:00] <mikeymike-linux> there should be a community of linux hardware users where you input all your parts and it creates a profile... then you compare with other linux users in a database and they all report bugs and fixes.....
[02:00] <Ronaldo\> salut ! ii cineva on sa ma ajute ?
[02:01] <mikeymike-linux> that would be insanely awesome
[02:01] <dom_f> also, strangely, I had to boot with the IRQPOLL option in Edgy (caused by the newer kernel?) or I had no USB - again I don't see this in Dapper.
[02:01] <mikeymike-linux> like oyu can find people who have the same hardware as you... or the majority of the same hardware.....
[02:01] <mikeymike-linux> that owuld be so cool
[02:01] <mikeymike-linux> dom_f, ah that bites
[02:01] <mikeymike-linux> well no sense in leaving dapper when it works :)
[02:01] <iwaterball>  mikeymike-linux: we're almost there with the ubuntu hadware tool (whatitsname)
[02:02] <mikeymike-linux> iwaterball, hmm?
[02:02] <dom_f> iwaterball: Sounds interesting???
[02:02] <mikeymike-linux> wouldn't that be a sweet thing though
[02:02] <mikeymike-linux> i dont mean just in ubuntu though
[02:02] <iwaterball> iwaterball: it can upload which hardware you have, probably there is a db on some canonical server or another
[02:02] <mikeymike-linux> iwaterball, yeah but where's the hardware comparison
[02:03] <stojance> How to assign new shortcuts?
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> where you get like % matches with other people
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> thats the part that would make it good
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> you can find peopl ewho closely match your hardware and distro
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> and see if they've had bugs
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> ah god that would be so awesome........
[02:03] <iwaterball> mikeymike-linux: well, mkae a sujjestion of the next version features wiki...
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> haha
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> i should
[02:03] <Tompu> mikeymike-linux: there is also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
[02:03] <mikeymike-linux> dont you think that would be effin sweet?
[02:03] <stojance> !shortcuts
[02:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about shortcuts - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:04] <davro> Sounds like a good idea mike, something so you could register your hardware/system(s) and talk to like minded people with simular issues, sound like a great idea !
[02:04] <stojance> !hotkeys
[02:04] <ubotu> hotkeys: A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5.7.4 (edgy), package size 141 kB, installed size 384 kB
[02:04] <mikeymike-linux> Tompu, oh yeah
[02:04] <mikeymike-linux> davro, yeah it is a good idea
[02:04] <stojance> How TO ASSIGN KEYboard shortcuts???
[02:05] <mikeymike-linux> my idea requires way too much know-how
[02:05] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[02:05] <defrysk> stojance, system> prefs> keyboardshortcuts
[02:05] <mikeymike-linux> i dont even know how to make a database
=== test3421 is now known as test3422
[02:05] <stojance> NEW ONES
[02:05] <mikeymike-linux> much less write anything that could parse it up
[02:05] <dcraven> stojance, stop yelling. xbindkeys can do shortcuts, and so can metacity.
[02:06] <stojance> how?
[02:06] <mikeymike-linux> lol@ stop yelling
[02:06] <mikeymike-linux> QUIT YELLING!
[02:06] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[02:06] <iwaterball> sssssh....
[02:06] <mikeymike-linux> stojance, are you having gnome-settings-daemon issues?
[02:06] <mikeymike-linux> i keep losing all my shortcuts
[02:06] <mikeymike-linux> no workspace switching...... no printscreen no alt tab.....
[02:07] <mikeymike-linux> its sporatic
[02:07] <sowdog> gnomefreak, do i run dist upgrade now?
[02:07] <stojance> I don't know, I need a new key shortcut
[02:07] <mikeymike-linux> oh
[02:07] <gnomefreak> sowdog: no
[02:07] <gnomefreak> sowdog: dont run it
[02:07] <iwaterball> mikeymike-linux: using Edgy?
[02:07] <mikeymike-linux> no im in dapper
[02:07] <mikeymike-linux> beryl/xgl
[02:07] <iwaterball> mikeymike-linux: k.
[02:07] <gnomefreak> sowdog: dont run dist-upgrade til its fixed or you will be doing that all over again
[02:07] <dcraven> stojance, For metacity, you can configure them at /apps/metacity/global_keybindings, and for xbindkeys you can install it from apt.
[02:08] <sowdog> gnomefreak, so right now it's good to go? just stay away from the dist upgrade button till later?
[02:08] <defrysk> sowdog, yes
[02:08] <defrysk> exactly
[02:08] <gnomefreak> yes for a week or 2
[02:08] <Tompu> !shortcut
[02:08] <ubotu> Keyboard shortcuts can be set in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts (Gnome) or "input actions" in Kcontrol (KDE). If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try keytouch - http://keytouch.sourceforge.net
[02:08] <gnomefreak> brb
[02:08] <sowdog> defrysk, gnomefreak  thanks guys that's some sexy stuff
[02:08] <sowdog> going off to test beryl ;)
[02:08] <dcordes> how can i configure firefox to take up irc links`?
[02:09] <Tompu> dcordes: firefox 2?
[02:09] <dcraven> stojance, oops, I forgot to mention that that is /apps/metacity/global_keybindings in gconf-editor.
[02:09] <dcordes> Tompu: yep
[02:10] <stojance> yes, but I need it to run an app, and as far as I can see that is not possible
[02:10] <dcraven> stojance, of course it is.
[02:10] <MacSlow> Greetings everybody!
[02:11] <dcraven> dcraven, I have xbindkeys to run gmrun and gnome-terminal for example.
[02:11] <stojance> How should I select it as: Integer, Boolean, String, List...
[02:11] <kvs> hello! can anybode tell me how to rebuild .deb for linux-restricted-modules-* ?
[02:11] <kvs> err... anybody
[02:11] <defrysk> sudo apt-get build dep <package>
[02:12] <kvs> defrysk: what package it belongs to ?
[02:12] <defrysk> then sudo apt-get source -b <package>
[02:12] <dcraven> stojance, I'm not sure what you're asking.
[02:12] <mikeymike-linux> ok so my idea is really good........
[02:12] <mikeymike-linux> hahaha
[02:12] <mikeymike-linux> ubuntu should adopt it
[02:12] <mikeymike-linux> ubuntu is cutting edge anyway ;)
[02:12] <mikeymike-linux> linux for HUMANS
[02:13] <weardlan> who don't need to use their computers
[02:13] <Tompu> dcordes:  in about:config, set network.protocol-handler.app.irc = /usr/bin/xchat-remote-2    and     network.protocol-handler.external.irc = true
[02:13] <stojance> I Need to run an application called 3D Desktop. How to assign the keys?
[02:13] <defrysk> kvs, build-dep installs the dependencies needed to build the package
[02:13] <defrysk> source -b downloads the source and builds the .deb
[02:14] <Tompu> dcordes: that should probably be xchat-gnome-remote or similar
[02:14] <dcraven> stojance, open gconf-editor, navigate to /apps/metacity/global_keybindings and enter the keystroke you want to enter, say, command_1. Then go to /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands to assign the actual command for command_1.
[02:14] <eXistenZ> Does anyone know a channel on encryption?
[02:14] <dcordes> Tompu: i cant find the irc entry
[02:14] <dcraven> eXistenZ, hey.
[02:15] <Tompu> dcordes: you need to add it
[02:15] <eXistenZ> hey dcraven, how do you do? :-)
[02:15] <dcraven> :)
[02:15] <dcraven> I'm well buddy.

[02:22] <Tompu> dcordes: let me know if that works. it actually doesnt look like xchat-gnome-remote works correctly for me
[02:25] <compengi> i'm now running dapper i'm planning to format and install edgy, and i want someone's opinion, should i do it or it's still early because there are many problems in edgy
[02:25] <iwaterball> compengi: wait.
[02:25] <iwaterball> anyone here using Edgy on a desktop machine?
[02:25] <Hobbsee> compengi: as long as you havent used automatix, or installed beryl, you'll be fine to upgrade to edgy.  formatting and installing works fine, anyway.
[02:25] <Tompu> iwaterball: yep
[02:26] <Hobbsee> compengi: edgy wont change much from what it si nwo
[02:26] <iwaterball> Tompu: did you try Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus/Minus lately?
[02:26] <cyzie> does ubuntu support Dell Wireless 1390 802.11g 54Mbps Wireless Mini Card  ??
[02:27] <iwaterball> compengi: some breakage, depends on what you use, if you want everything to go smooth I'd recommand waitin a month or so
[02:27] <jmcdonald> thanks for the help, see you next.
[02:28] <compengi> iwaterball, okay i got your opinion concerning this :)
[02:28] <compengi> thanx
[02:29] <compengi> iwaterball, btw in applicatoins list the add/remove program disappeared do you know how to get it back?
[02:29] <iwaterball> compengi: I suppose you use the manu editor in preferences, I use Synaptic so I never noticed...
[02:29] <Tompu> iwaterball: doesnt work
[02:30] <compudaze> i'm using edgy as a desktop
[02:30] <compudaze> also as a server on my server
[02:30] <iwaterball> Tompu: thx, so it isn't just me... you mind responding for my thread in the forums, I'm trying to gather some info on this problem...
[02:31] <compudaze> link?
[02:31] <iwaterball> compudaze: you talking to me?
[02:31] <ailean> what program can i use to encode an ".avi file onto a DVD so that I can play it on DVD players?
[02:31] <Tompu> compengi: right click 'applications', Edit Menus, it's at the bottom of the list
[02:31] <c_lisp> anybody know of a program to record what your doing on the x server?
[02:32] <ailean> so Hobbsee, would you recommend not to install Beryl? :)
[02:32] <Hobbsee> ailean: well, you're free to, but dont expect to be able to dist-upgrade off it
[02:32] <ailean> hrm...
[02:32] <Hobbsee> ailean: beryl is very much bling - i dont understand why people like it so much
[02:32] <ailean> they like it because it's bling
[02:33] <c_lisp> :p
[02:33] <c_lisp> yep
[02:33] <Hobbsee> yes, but it gets boring
[02:33] <c_lisp> beryl is nice
[02:33] <mikeymike-linux> its not bling
[02:33] <mikeymike-linux> or boring
[02:33] <compengi> Tompu, i don't have it
[02:33] <c_lisp> and u can update after beryl to
[02:33] <ailean> the geeks need to understand what normal users want

[02:33] <c_lisp> not like you have to format

[02:36] <compengi> Tompu, yesterday i was trying to compile a software which requires libgtkhtml-3.8 i searched for it in the repos and found that i had it but i have also a previous version of it libgtkhtml-2.0 so i thought maybe i should remove it, so i did but when i removed it i removed phython files and other stuff, from which the add/remove program disappeared i tried to reinstall that pack but it only installed a single pack without the other files that it had re
[02:36] <compengi> moved
[02:37] <datil> hi
[02:37] <c_lisp> it works great Tompu
[02:37] <datil> is there support for Intel RAID (ICH8R controller) in 6.10?
[02:38] <Tompu> c_lisp: cool, might try it myself
[02:38] <c_lisp> :)
[02:38] <Hobbsee> compengi: run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop from a terminal.  and dont do that again.
[02:38] <Tompu> compengi: i dont know enough about the add/remove and synaptic to offer any other advice. im new to ubuntu
[02:38] <Hobbsee> compengi: if you're removing python, something bad is happening.
[02:38] <compengi> Hobbsee, the uninstalled thing did that
[02:39] <Hobbsee> compengi: yes, exactly.  libgtkhtml-2.0 is a lib that you need to keep.
[02:39] <ailean> I have a wiki loaded on my computer and I want to make it start serving automatically (and in the background) each time I log on.  The command is python ~/moin-desktop/moin.py and I typed that into the "Additional Startup Programs" section of the Sessions app.  But it doesn't load it.  What am I doing wrong?
[02:39] <compengi> Hobbsee, when i installed it again it didn't install the other files that it had removed
[02:40] <Hobbsee> compengi: no, it wouldnt.  you'll need to install ubuntu desktop again.  i can explain it if you want
[02:40] <Tompu> ailean: you could try the full path, /home/ailean/moin-desktop/moin.py or prefixing with python
[02:40] <compengi> Hobbsee, yes please
[02:40] <ailean> Tompu, I did prefix with python.  But, the point is that the command works in the terminal, so surely it should work there, no?
[02:40] <Tompu> Hobbsee: is ubuntu-desktop a metapackage?
[02:40] <Hobbsee> Tompu: yep
[02:41] <compengi> Hobbsee, it had finished
[02:42] <pokeypapaw> Goodmorning,  would anyone know how I would view the kernel documentation?
[02:42] <compengi> Hobbsee, yeah and the add/remove returned :)
[02:42] <Hobbsee> compengi: ubuntu, and other metapackages is kind of like a kiddy brick tower.  or that "pick up sticks" game, i think.  removing a lib like libgtkhtml-2.0 is like removing the bottom brick - expect all the stuff on top to need to be removed as well.  yet, when you only add the bottom brick again, it doesnt add the top bricks.  and ubuntu-desktop is the top brick of all.
[02:42] <Hobbsee> (unless you use aptitude, but that handles differently)
[02:43] <Hobbsee> worse, often
[02:43] <c_lisp> whats a good movie converter?
[02:43] <Tompu> c_lisp: vlc or mencoder
[02:43] <compengi> Hobbsee, wow i see :)
[02:43] <Tompu> c_lisp: mencoder is part of mplayer
[02:43] <Hobbsee> compengi: :)
[02:43] <kihai> Could anyone here help me on this? I did the update to edgy with update-manager -c and now there are some packages which can't be reconfigured (acpid, acpi-support, edubuntu-desktop) and the kernel installed is still the dapper kernel. Any ideas on how to solve this?
[02:43] <datil> is there support for Intel RAID (ICH8R controller) in 6.10? or just the SATA controller is supported and not the raid
[02:43] <compengi> Hobbsee, but nothing important had happened :)
[02:43] <Tompu> c_lisp: is this to convert your istanbul output?
[02:43] <c_lisp> yea
[02:43] <Hobbsee> compengi: hmmm?
[02:44] <c_lisp> from the .ogg I read the man
[02:44] <c_lisp> didn't see how to change it
[02:44] <c_lisp> say by default its .ogg but doesn't show how to change it lol
[02:45] <compengi> Hobbsee, btw do you know a command trick that will install all the files needed to be able to use a program or compile it?
[02:45] <dcraven> ogg is good.
[02:45] <gnomefreak> compengi: build-essential and if the app you want to compile is in the repos you can use sudo apt-get build-dep package
[02:46] <pokeypapaw> Hello can any here see what I am typing
[02:46] <Tompu> pokeypapaw: hai.
[02:46] <dcraven> no
[02:46] <gnomefreak> pokeypapaw: no
[02:47] <gnomefreak> ;)
[02:47] <pokeypapaw> ok well was wondering
[02:47] <compengi> gnomefreak, yeah i think it's in repos cause it's a new version of evolution (mail program)
[02:47] <pokeypapaw> hadn't much luck getting a question answered
[02:47] <gnomefreak> compengi: than build-dep command will install all depends for the app
[02:47] <esp> so many people ...
[02:48] <dcordes> where can i find a piece of code which allows me to convert bin images to iso images?
[02:48] <esp> anybody here?
[02:48] <gnomefreak> compengi: problem your gonna have is libc6
[02:48] <Tompu> c_lisp: just out of interest, does the Close button in the 'About' section of istanbul work for you?
[02:48] <Hobbsee> !b-e > compengi
[02:48] <gnomefreak> compengi: thats about the biggest issue you may run into
[02:49] <c_lisp> yep
[02:49] <esp> anybody play warcraft III ??
[02:49] <c_lisp> got to go to work bbl
[02:49] <Tompu> that's strange. i have a few apps where the close button of the About dialog does nothing

[02:50] <gnomefreak> unless your on edgy
[02:50] <jiger> hi does anyone know how to verfy if I am running upstart or init?
[02:50] <gnomefreak> jiger: are you on edgy?
[02:50] <jiger> yea
[02:50] <gnomefreak> upstart with some init things
[02:51] <gnomefreak> jiger: for now /etc/init.d/commands will still work
[02:51] <jiger> thing is I am not getting any boot improvements and I want to ensure I am running via upstart
[02:51] <iwaterball> jiger: I suppose ps is your fried, didn't look into this myself yet...
[02:51] <gnomefreak> jiger: apt-cache policy upstart
[02:51] <gnomefreak> jiger: if it says its installed you are using it to boot
[02:52] <jiger> gnomefreak: ya but can I verify if it is loading. I tried ps process 1 is init
[02:52] <tRSS> is there a software that would monitor the traffic generated from my ubuntu machine?
[02:52] <esp> is there anyone play Warcraft III ???
[02:52] <netpython> nagios
[02:53] <gnomefreak> jiger: you can see if taking splash and quiet out of the kernel args. in /boot/grub/menu.lst and reboot should show you everything it does
[02:53] <delight> every so often when i log out ... my system freezes .. got an ati with fglxr ... using gdm as a Desktop-manager
[02:53] <delight> this was happening with dapper too ... now on edgy seems to be more often

[02:53] <delight> does sombody got similiar problems ?
[02:53] <esp> is there anyone play Warcraft III ???

[02:58] <buti> anyone into kernel building can help me? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild seems outdated
[02:58] <esp> WikinG:plz use the chmod command
[02:59] <soundray> selutha: you can mount NTFS read/write using fuse, but I don't know if it'll work from the live CD. Try it out:
[02:59] <soundray> !fuse | selutha
[02:59] <ubotu> selutha: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[02:59] <buti> building a kernel takes ages. and the resulting header packages seem to be incomplete
[02:59] <WikinG> esp it does not work, sudo doesn't help too
[02:59] <selutha> soundray: cool thanks..
[02:59] <Tompu> WikinG: do other delete methods work?
[02:59] <|aSa|> I can't find in Google information about such problems, but i also don't have even single successful attempt to boot Eddgy on a computer with SATA.
[03:00] <ZorbaTHut> Edgy Server didn't work on my system, but curiously it seems to have been a glitch with only the server kernel. replacing it with the default kernel made it work
[03:01] <soundray> buti: how long does it take, and how long do you expect it to take?
[03:01] <WikinG> tompu, now i can't delete in any method.
[03:01] <esp> 1234
[03:01] <|aSa|> I tried to install it on 7 different computers with Promise, nVidia and Intel SATA controlers and both 32 and 64 bit disks hang after booting the kernel.
[03:01] <buti> soundray: well, i expected it to take no longer than "make" in a stock kernel.
[03:01] <zordid> which config file do I edit in ubuntu to load a module when the system boot?
[03:01] <ANaRcHiC> can some name a shell text editor plz?
[03:02] <ZorbaTHut> anarchic, emacs, vim, nano
[03:02] <buti> soundray: but it seems to do everything a few times.
[03:02] <|aSa|> Is 6.10 supposed to support SATA disks?
[03:02] <buti> soundray: also i'
[03:02] <compudaze> shell text editor?
[03:02] <soundray> zordid: /etc/modules
[03:02] <compudaze> u want to change your shell?
[03:02] <ANaRcHiC> nano and vim come with ubuntu?
[03:02] <ZorbaTHut> nano tends to exist on most systems, is very simple to use, and doesn't do much useful
[03:02] <Balachmar> I have two systems running Ubuntu, one is edgy and the other is dapper. I have installed beagle on both machines using Automatix.On one machine (dapper) the search is automatically updated if I create a new file, or edit a file which meets the criteria.On the other machine (edgy) it doesn't. On the edgy machine I already have activated user_xattr.But that doesn't help. Also on the dapper machine user_xattr isn't even enabled in the mtab or fst
[03:02] <Balachmar> ab.The edgy is running the 2.6.17-10-generic kernel and the dapper machine is running the 2.6.15-27-386 kernel.So what can I do to fix this? Because I want the search to be automatically updated!
[03:02] <ANaRcHiC> cuz emacs doesnt
[03:02] <buti> soundray: also i'm not sure about thos "flavours". do they still exist?
[03:02] <soundray> |aSa|: yes, but some chipsets are troublesome
[03:02] <ZorbaTHut> emacs and vim are both more powerful but much trickier to get used to, and often aren't packaged in default installs
[03:02] <compudaze> vim-tiny is installed as well as nano
[03:03] <ANaRcHiC> ok, i;ll try nano, thanks
[03:03] <compudaze> nano being easier to use
[03:03] <ZorbaTHut> all of those have apt packages
[03:03] <compudaze> u can install whatever u want though
[03:03] <ZorbaTHut> nano's perfectly capable if you're not trying to write code or something :)

[03:03] <Tompu> Balachmar: why did you use automatix to install beagle on edgy?
[03:03] <|aSa|> soundray: It failed with nForce 2, i945, i915.
[03:03] <buti> soundray: i've added some lines to drivers/ide/ide.c, now resume from suspend to ram works 100 % on my laptop
[03:03] <soundray> Balachmar: don't use automatix. It makes it next to impossible to give you support here.
[03:04] <zordid> soundray: should i just add the line wdreg windrvr6, if i want to load the windrvr6 module with the script wdreg?
[03:04] <buti> soundray: but building and installting the kernel and its includes is really a pain (compared to e.g. gentoo)
[03:04] <soundray> zordid: no, you can only add a module name there. Scripts won't work.
[03:04] <selutha> soundray: thanks for the link, cant do it with the live but it pointed me to where i could thanks for the help
[03:05] <zordid> soundray: then where should i edit if i want to load the module with a script?
[03:05] <soundray> buti: well, unlike gentoo, recompiling the kernel isn't really part of the plan in ubuntu.
[03:05] <soundray> zordid: /etc/rc.local
[03:06] <buti> soundray: you're right on that one.
[03:06] <|aSa|> sundari: Inever heard of other distro to have problems with them. And if i install in after disabling the controller and then use clean kernel from kernel.org everything works fine :(
[03:06] <Dimensions> hi .. where does ubuntu saves mysql database files ... ?
[03:06] <compudaze> /var/lib/mysql
[03:06] <constrictor> yes Dimensions
[03:07] <iwaterball> soundray, buti : there is the kernel-helper package that makes it rather easy
[03:07] <soundray> |aSa|: I'm surprised they give you trouble. Describe your problem in precise terms and post errors on the pastebin. Maybe someone here will know how to help you.
[03:07] <kihai> Could anyone here help me on this? I did the update to edgy with update-manager -c and now there are some packages which can't be reconfigured (acpid, acpi-support, edubuntu-desktop) and the kernel installed is still the dapper kernel. Any ideas on how to solve this?
[03:07] <buti> iwaterball: interesting...
[03:08] <buti> iwaterball: but isn't this what i'm using anyways? i tried to follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[03:08] <compudaze> kernel-helper??
[03:08] <buti> iwaterball: which is outdated, it seems
[03:08] <compudaze> there's kernel-package
[03:08] <gnomefreak> kihai: does sudo dpkg --configure -a  work?
[03:08] <compudaze> which is very nice
[03:08] <constrictor> i think the extra parameters to update-manager will be update-manager -c -d
[03:08] <constrictor> kihai
[03:08] <gnomefreak> constrictor: no -d
[03:09] <constrictor> right yeah that was for beta upgrade my bad gnomefreak
[03:09] <Dimensions> thanks compudaze
[03:09] <kihai> gnomefreak: Nope. It ends with an error about the unconfigured packages acpid, acpi-support and edubuntu-desktop

[03:10] <compudaze> just make-kpkg kernel_image
[03:10] <gnomefreak> vpol: it uses grub
[03:10] <iwaterball> buti: I donno, I seem to remember kernel-package had you use something like "make-kpkg", I can't find it in that wiki
[03:10] <compudaze> there are many options if needed though
[03:10] <gnomefreak> kihai: try to install them manually
[03:11] <compudaze> vpol, it used grub by default for me
[03:11] <vpol> gnomefreak: it uses lilo. i have fresh installed system in front of me. it used lilo.
[03:11] <buti> compudaze, iwaterball: i'll try it
[03:11] <gnomefreak> vpol: it does not use lilo
[03:11] <iwaterball> buti: try seing if there is a READM in /usr/share/doc/kernel-package (if you have the package installed)
=== Arrick_Sleeping is now known as Arrick
[03:11] <iwaterball> buti: I.e. README

[03:12] <buti> yes, ok
[03:12] <|aSa|> soundray: There are no errors at all. It just reaches the end of the kernel messages and does not start anything from the initrd. I have no idea how to debug this.
[03:12] <vpol> gnomefreak: actually i belive you, but also i belive my eyes. i haven't used OEM installation, used text-mode (default). and it installed lilo. even without a menu.
[03:12] <gnomefreak> vpol: what makes you think its using lilo?
[03:13] <compudaze> what are you installing onto?
[03:13] <soundray> |aSa|: why do you conclude, then, that the problem is with SATA?

[03:14] <soundray> vpol: what's the problem then?
[03:14] <gnomefreak> vpol: do you have a /boot/grub/menu.lst file?
[03:14] <vpol> gnomefreak: the actual qwestion wasn't like "help me installing grub", it was "WHY?" :)
[03:14] <vpol> gnomefreak: no. no /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:14] <|aSa|> soundray: Because it hapens only on computers with SATA controllers, because it hapend on all computers with SATA controllers i managed to find and because if i disable the SATA controller from the BIOS it boots.
[03:15] <soundray> vpol: wrong channel, then. This one is for support.
[03:15] <gnomefreak> soundray: its ok
[03:16] <gnomefreak> vpol: ubuntu installer under default install should not have installed lilo at all since lilo isnt used by ubuntu by default EVER
[03:16] <soundray> |aSa|: maybe your device names change when you enable SATA.
[03:16] <mc__> sorry for advertising,but you guys should really have a look at http://www.fon.com ,the company gives you a free wlan-router if you agree to share it,it really works,i have tried it already
[03:16] <crom> hey guys. Can anyone pass me a pointer on adding files to /bin/ directories and/or adding to $PATH ?
[03:16] <vpol> gnomefreak: i understand it. may it rechoose lilo if i've reconfigured LVM to be a default boot system (e.g. even /boot, / are in LVM)
[03:16] <gnomefreak> vpol: you didnt install lilo after install did you?
[03:16] <mc__> but after the 8. november the router wont be free anymore

Since I commented out my edgy kernels (stupid I know) they do not show up in the menu. can anyone tell me how to return to my e

[03:18] <geokok> .....Tompu any howto's?
[03:18] <iwaterball> constrictor: think of it like "cp"

[03:18] <geokok> Alcatel speedtouch 530 v6
[03:18] <Tompu> Cyberai: make sure /boot is being mounted properly. try manually mounting it

[03:19] <Tompu> geokok: do you have both computers connected to the modem now?
[03:19] <geokok> yes
[03:19] <gnomefreak> constrictor: example ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/scriptname ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun
[03:19] <geokok> one is through USB (win) and the other ethernet (ubuntu)
[03:20] <geokok> both on static ip's
[03:20] <gnomefreak> vpol: i dont know how you got lilo but i would file a bug on that so it can be looked into (this is very important)
[03:20] <Cyberai> Tompu, at what device would I typically find /boot?
[03:20] <constrictor> thanks guys
[03:21] <gnomefreak> vpol: would also attach your lilo conf to it
[03:21] <Cyberai> Tompu, I guess I'm asking what device I should manout to /boot

[03:24] <geokok> Tompu:......any tips?
[03:24] <gnomefreak> vpol: if you find one for installation please attach it to the bug also
[03:24] <Arrick> morning gnomefreak
[03:24] <Arrick> long time no see
[03:24] <gnomefreak> Arrick: hello
[03:24] <vpol> gnomefreak: sure. that's why i'm looking for it ;)
[03:24] <rsteele> sup
[03:24] <k1piee> Hi
[03:25] <Arrick> nope
[03:26] <Tompu> geokok have you got the two computers plugged into the modem?
[03:27] <geokok> yes both plugged and working
[03:27] <vpol> gnomefreak: btw. may be you can help. i've tryed to get nvidia binary drivers working "out of the box" (with default restriced modules and so on) and failed. anybody knows when that group of packages would be updated?
[03:27] <linux01> hello
[03:27] <Tompu> geokok: check their ip addresses
[03:27] <geokok> i got them
[03:27] <Tompu> geokok: are they different?
[03:28] <geokok> win can ping ubuntu but not vice versa
[03:28] <geokok> they are static set by me
[03:28] <Tompu> geokok: which is on usb?
[03:28] <geokok> windows machine
[03:28] <scheuri> geokok: windows XP SP2?
[03:28] <geokok> yes
[03:28] <gnomefreak> vpol: to use the binary drivers you need to let the installer build its own l-r-m first remove ubuntu's version than let nvidias installer build its own
[03:28] <scheuri> geokok: firewall on?
[03:28] <geokok> zone alarm
[03:28] <gnomefreak> !nvidia-beta | vpol
[03:28] <ubotu> vpol: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) Beta version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[03:28] <gnomefreak> or that way :)
[03:28] <scheuri> geokok: that will probably block the IP...
[03:29] <scheuri> geokok: turn it off and try again
[03:29] <vpol> gnomefreak: yeah. looked for second way ;) thnx.
[03:29] <geokok> .....hm wouldnt that be dangerous for a windows machine?
[03:29] <netpython> yep
[03:30] <Tompu> geokok: you'll be okay for a few minutes
[03:30] <doccy> why cant i apt-get install libqt3-dev? has this package been obsoleted?
[03:30] <Tompu> geokok: the alternative is to go into the zone-alarm set up and add the ubuntu box IP to the allowed range
[03:30] <variant> Tompu: on average an unprotected winxp machine lasted 16 minnits in some test i heard about :)
[03:30] <netpython> more likely
[03:30] <Tompu> geokok: or whatever zone-alarm calls it. trusted range, perhaps
[03:30] <scheuri> geokok: yes, of course...but AFAIK the firewalls will block the ping...and I am not talking about turning it off for ever...just for the test to make sure if its the firewall or not
[03:31] <compudaze> i dont see a qt3-dev
[03:31] <compudaze> theres libqt3-headers
[03:31] <Tompu> variant: even behind NAT?
[03:31] <compudaze> and qt4-dev
[03:31] <variant> Tompu: no
[03:31] <soundray> doccy: try libqt3-mt-dev
[03:31] <geokok> ok I turned it off and the ping got through
[03:31] <doccy> what does the mt stand for?
[03:31] <compudaze> threaded
[03:31] <soundray> doccy: threaded, I think
[03:31] <scheuri> geokok: now you can turn it on again...and there you go..it worked...:)
[03:32] <netpython> !nmap
[03:32] <geokok> ok...so I add the ubuntu ip to zone alarm.....and then what? how do I actually share teh files?
[03:32] <ubotu> nmap: The Network Mapper. In component main, is extra. Version 4.10-1 (edgy), package size 702 kB, installed size 2436 kB
[03:33] <Tompu> geokok: first thing is to see if you can now ping
[03:33] <ailean> gnomefreak, what is the difference between the beta nvidia drivers and the ones i installed on dapper?
[03:33] <variant> geokok: you know you will have to go via theinternet which is slow, it wont be like a lan..
[03:33] <variant> ailean: bugs probably
=== VisualStation is now known as VisualStat|Stu
[03:33] <Tompu> geokok: sorry missed your message
[03:33] <tabias> is there any certain reason I can not install keytouch anymore? If there is a reason, what is an alternative to keytouch?

[03:34] <ailean> variant, the beta driver hasn't given me any bugs and it's definitely better than the crap that was there before.  you just need to play a video to see it without the diagonal line across the middle...
[03:34] <Tompu> geokok: check Places/Network Servers
[03:34] <geokok> np..ok i opened the firewall.....

[03:34] <ubotu> Install gnome-themes (gnome) or go to menu, system settings, appearance (KDE).  For a good KDE guide, see http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1255036&postcount=3
[03:34] <soundray> !keytouch | tabias
[03:34] <ubotu> tabias: Keyboard shortcuts can be set in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts (Gnome) or "input actions" in Kcontrol (KDE). If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try keytouch - http://keytouch.sourceforge.net
[03:34] <gnomefreak> ailean: the beta drivers allow you to run beryl or aiglx
[03:35] <oyeT> where can i search for themes on gnome ?
[03:35] <tabias> that is the problem, keytouch makes a broken install
[03:35] <netpython> sigh
[03:35] <ailean> gnomefreak, but i installed drivers last year from nvidia's site that allowed me to install compiz
[03:35] <oyeT> what categorie i select for gnome ?
[03:35] <Tompu> oyeT: art.gnome.org
[03:35] <soundray> tabias: oops, that pointer isn't quite right -- there should be a keytouch package...
[03:35] <soundray> tabias: how does it break?
[03:35] <gnomefreak> ailean: compiz is not aiglx nor beryl
[03:35] <tabias> dunno exactly, it is saying it has done a broken install
[03:36] <geokok> Tompu: ok...but its empty
[03:36] <oyeT> Tompu: that link isn't available
[03:36] <ailean> gnomefreak, but beryl is a fork of compiz, is it not?
[03:36] <soundray> tabias: run 'sudo apt-get -f install' and put the output on pastebin
[03:36] <tabias> k
[03:36] <Squeee> !beryl
[03:36] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[03:36] <gnomefreak> ailean: it is. but its not the same. please see #ubuntu-xgl for more info on it
[03:36] <coz_> ailean, it is indeed
[03:36] <Tompu> oyeT: http://art.gnome.org/ works fine
[03:36] <geokok> variant: I know about slow. What would u suggest (cheap please.)?
[03:36] <ailean> gnomefreak, didn't know that channel existed. apologies
[03:36] <X-Ception2> Does anyone here use a Belkin router and have configured it for port forwarding? I need some help on how-to do this.
[03:36] <oyeT> Tompu: oh without www
[03:36] <buti> compudaze: make-kpkg kernel_headers stops with dpkg-gencontrol: error: package linux-headers-2.6.17.13-ubuntu1 not in control info
[03:37] <Tompu> geokok: whats empty? Windows Network?
[03:37] <tabias> soundray:  tnx for the advice, it seems adept did a wrong isntall screwing all. Just uninstalled it and now it is working. Thanks anyway
[03:37] <geokok> yes
[03:37] <Tompu> geokok: does the windows machine have file sharing enabled?
[03:37] <geokok> I try to add a new network place but once I choose ubuntu " ok "is greyed out
[03:38] <tabias> next problem is my volume wheel isn't working nor keytouch can fix it nor me.
[03:38] <geokok> ...hm how do I chech that? do I have to do the same to ubuntu as well?
[03:38] <Tompu> geokok: also, the windows network only advertises itself every few minutes i think
[03:38] <Tompu> geokok: should be enabled by default in ubuntu (at least in edgy)
[03:38] <Tompu> geokok: but for windows, you need to go to control panel, network
[03:38] <geokok> I see the mshome network but cant access it
[03:38] <Tompu> geokok: but i haven't really used windows for some considerable time
[03:39] <geokok> lucky u....
[03:39] <netpython> geokok, is zonealarm configured by default to allow windows file-sharing?
[03:39] <Tompu> geokok: that's good. refresh the window a couple of times
[03:39] <Jenyo> I am new to this whole linux thing...what software can you run on it ?
[03:39] <geokok> think so.....
[03:39] <vpol> gnomefreak: also i'm sure you have heard that gnome-vfs doesn't allow to play music from windows shares. when would it be fixed?
[03:39] <X-Ception2> Does anyone here use a Belkin router and have configured it for port forwarding? I need some help on how-to do this.
[03:39] <netpython> geokok, you might check the firewall log
[03:39] <gnomefreak> vpol: dont know didnt know it was an issue.
[03:39] <Tompu> Jenyo: http://packages.ubuntu.com
[03:40] <Jenyo> thanks
[03:40] <geokok> netpython: what am I looking for there\?
[03:40] <kyja> is there a way to have alsa do multiple threaded instances?? if I have firefox open and streaming music and I open a movie on my desktop firefox will crash and I will have no sound for anything until I end the frozen firefox session and restart the movie viewer. this is only telling me something realy is not right. it should be able to handle and play many sounds together I would think.
[03:40] <gnomefreak> kyja: are you on edgy?
[03:40] <kyja> yes gnomefreak
[03:40] <gnomefreak> kyja: edgy should do it by default
[03:40] <Tompu> kyja: sounds like OSS issue?
[03:40] <geokok> I see some logs that have the ubuntu machine ip
[03:40] <kyja> HMM K
[03:41] <paitart> ne1 here from manila, philippines?
[03:41] <geokok> all blocked...??
[03:41] <gnomefreak> paitart: please join #ubuntu-offtopic for general chat
[03:41] <soundray> vpol: rhythmbox will play from Windows shares. The program has to be vfs-aware, otherwise you will have to do a regular mount
[03:42] <netpython> geokok, if anything got blocked :-)
[03:42] <datil> is the pf firewall available in Ubuntu? or any gui for freebsd's ipfw?
[03:42] <Tompu> !ph | paitart
[03:42] <ubotu> paitart: Join #ubuntu-ph for tagalog
[03:42] <geokok> netpython: everything.......maybe i should open ip range instead of ip adddress in zone alarm?
[03:42] <Jenyo> i am so confused
[03:42] <tabias> is there anyone with a G5 (logitech) mouse that can tell me how I can bind the tilt buttons to another 'function' (like middle mousebutton)
[03:43] <gnomefreak> datil: firestarter is a GUI to IPtables
[03:43] <Tompu> Jenyo: are you after something in particular? or just general information
[03:43] <netpython> geokok, yes or maybe zonealarm has preconfigured settings
[03:43] <datil> gnomefreak, yeah i've seen that but there's just support for iptables in ubuntu?
[03:44] <gnomefreak> datil: im sure there are other firewall options. apt-cache search firewall    might help you
[03:44] <netpython> geokok, but in the log you ought to see the specific port that got blocked asweel
[03:44] <ss06r> hi, im having trouble installing zziplib to work with php4 under ubuntu
[03:44] <geokok> netpython: I see ubuntu's ip with various ports all blocked...how can i open them?
[03:44] <ss06r> well...less trouble more completely not understanding how one is supposed to set things like --with-zip=[-DIR]  in a package manager environment like ubuntu
[03:44] <ss06r> basically do i have to install php from source to set such an option?
[03:45] <netpython> geokok, zonealarm is blocking them i presume?
[03:45] <geokok> probably
[03:45] <Jenyo> tompu: i don't even know where to start ... I know i am tired of crashes on my computer... but i want to keep my existing abilities (i play warcraft, i write using dragon naturally speaking and an addon i got for word that formats my work in a form acceptable for submission for novels)
[03:45] <vpol> gnomefreak: ha-ha. i got why i have lilo by default. during installation i got in debug console: "[TIME]  grub-installer: /boot is a lvm volume (/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root), cannot install grub.
[03:45] <geokok> what should I open? Host/site, ip address. ip range, subnet???
[03:45] <Jenyo> tompu: I also trade on forex... but i don't know of any software that will let me do that on anything other than windows
[03:45] <gnomefreak> vpol: ah
[03:46] <Tompu> Jenyo: I don't think you'll be able to keep Dragon if you switch. there are alternatives, but they dont compare in my opinion
[03:46] <_3uG_> hi everyone.. is there any reason why df isn't showing /dev/hda? it's showing everything else...
[03:46] <Jenyo> tompu: and forex?
[03:46] <netpython> geokok, tcp/udp ubuntu ip port 445
[03:46] <weardlan> heh
[03:46] <weardlan> Jenyo
[03:46] <Jenyo> tompu: so no way for me to earn a living if I switch ??
[03:46] <gnomefreak> _3uG_: is hda ubuntu partition?
[03:46] <weardlan> CS: Primetrade: platform agnostic
[03:46] <geokok> netpython: ?what?...what should I do with that?
[03:47] <Jenyo> weardlan : pardon ?
[03:47] <_3uG_> gnomefreak, yes, it's mounted as /
[03:47] <_3uG_> gnomefreak, ext3 fs
[03:47] <weardlan> wana buy sel forex, use CS:primtrade,  is written in java
[03:47] <Tompu> Jenyo: I have only slight experience with voice recognition in linux
[03:47] <gnomefreak> dont know than
[03:47] <Tompu> Jenyo: I'm also English, and american voice recognition doesn't like my accent ;)
[03:48] <Jenyo> weardlan : ahh... can you get all your ema 200's, macd's , pivot points etc. with it ?
[03:48] <_3uG_> look into viavoice or xvoice
[03:48] <Jenyo> kk
[03:48] <netpython> geokok, you should open a port in your zonealarm in order for the ubuntu box to communicate with your windows box where apparantly zonealarm is installed,however you might know we can't possibly support non ubuntu issues :-)
[03:48] <weardlan> that's not forex trading that't tech trend anlysis
[03:48] <weardlan> they offer alternative platforms for that
[03:49] <Jenyo> weardlan : tech analysis is the basis for any intelligent trade imho
[03:49] <geokok> I have the free version ...no port settings. Main slidebar for trusted sites is set to allow sharing
[03:49] <geokok> and I can ping the win macine
[03:49] <weardlan> seperate function and form though
[03:49] <Tompu> geokok: did you try pressing reload on the network browser window?
[03:49] <livingdaylight> anyone know or hear about GNUSENSE?
[03:49] <netpython> geokok, have a look at http://myy.helia.fi/~karte/samba-quickstart.html
[03:49] <paolob-dirbasica> guys, asterisk has a problem in edgy: each time I reboot /var/run/asterisk's owner  is set to root:root, and asterisk can't start. Any hint?
[03:50] <Solidad> how to specifiy a ssl for each domain?
[03:50] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:50] <geokok> Tombu: yes
[03:50] <eNons3nse> can someone recommend a firefox extension for 2.0 that will expand tab options.  tab mix plus isn't available for 2.0.  i'm getting tired of my search bar searches overwriting my tabs and such.
[03:50] <Tompu> geokok: and you still cant open it?
[03:50] <Jenyo> weardlan : ok...still very important...without it ...one may as well be blindfolded and throwing darts at a target 50 feet away.
[03:50] <geokok> no luck..maybe I have to do something to samba first?
[03:50] <Jenyo> weardlan : after being spun around a bit :)
[03:50] <Tompu> eNons3nse: you can install 'non-compatible' plugins. most will still work. others dont
[03:51] <_3uG_> The goal of gNewSense is to provide users with a software package that offers the stability of Ubuntu with the addition of freedom.
[03:51] <eNons3nse> Tompu: how?
[03:51] <weardlan> better trading strategy than most ;o)
[03:51] <Tompu> geokok: if you can see MSHOME, then your ubuntu box is probably working
[03:51] <_3uG_> http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2006/11/how_entertainin.html
[03:51] <Jenyo> weardlan : ever read tom demark's work ?
[03:52] <eNons3nse> also, does anyone else have problems with youtube videos randomly freezing or getting static sounding audio?
[03:52] <geokok> I can see the pc but when I click on it it says " Cannot open. This is not a file"
[03:52] <netpython> eNons3nse, tabbrowser preferences
[03:53] <eNons3nse> thanks netpython
[03:53] <Tompu> eNons3nse: set extensions.checkCompatibility to false in about:config
[03:53] <soundray> Jenyo, weardlan: please ask yourself whether you're still on topic, and consider moving to #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:53] <netpython> eNons3nse, np
[03:53] <weardlan> nope
[03:53] <eNons3nse> i used to use tabbrowser preferences in fact, before tab mix plus was available.  i'll check that out.
[03:53] <Jenyo> weardlan : new science of technical analysis... tom demark... good stuff :)
[03:53] <geokok> so one pc can see the other but they cant see any files in them.............
[03:53] <eNons3nse> I'll do that too Tompu
[03:54] <weardlan> hardly new: TD moving average is an age old stop loss stratgey in stock world
[03:54] <netpython> geokok, being able to ping is not enough:-)
[03:54] <vpol> gnomefreak: found a bug in LVM configuration :)
[03:54] <geokok> no luck even with zone alarm off
[03:55] <geokok> :(
[03:55] <_3uG_> so when is ubuntu going to have the non-exploitable nvidia drivers in the repository?
[03:55] <Tompu> netpython: even if zone alarm was blocking him, if he can see the MSHOME group, he should be able to see the computer that created that group. accessing it is another matter
[03:55] <eNons3nse> does anyone else have video problems with sites like youtube, google video, daily motion, etc...?  Like videos freezing or getting bad audio at random times.  also crashing the browser?  same story on firefox or epiphany.
[03:55] <netpython> Tompu, correct
[03:56] <oaudry> someone has any experience on dapper and dl360 G5 ?
[03:56] <Tompu> eNons3nse: are you talking only about flash video? and which version of flash are you using?
=== mumbles-out is now known as mumbles
[03:56] <geokok> I thought it was piece of cake with samba but I have never networked 2 pc's before and its really hard
[03:56] <oaudry> I'have a problem with usb detection
[03:56] <tabias> can somone explain me how to install a bttv driver and tv (tuner) I had a list some weeks ago but the list isn't in my history anymore
[03:56] <eNons3nse> Tompu, well it mostly happens with flash video.  I put the Flash 9 upgrade in the .mozilla folder, but does that effect epiphany as well?
[03:57] <_3uG_> flash 9 does that to me sometimes.. it's a pain, but it's still beta
[03:57] <Tompu> eNons3nse: i haven't touched epiphany for a long time
[03:57] <cyzie> anybody with wireless laptop using hyperconnect technology?
[03:57] <skaos> oaudry: yes. it didn't work!
[03:57] <soundray> tabias: bttv cards should work "out of the box". Install xawtv to test.
[03:57] <tabias> k
[03:57] <eNons3nse> Tompu: the only reason i use it is when firefox crashes because of flash issues.  then it eventually crashes from flash too.
[03:58] <oaudry> skaos, mouarf
[03:58] <ss06r> can anyone tell me how modules like zziplib are supposed to be allowed for in ubuntu in php4?
[03:58] <oaudry> skaos, so, no solution :)
[03:58] <geokok> Guys..........any other ways to network the 2 pc's together?
[03:58] <ss06r> seeing as ubuntu doesnt do the whole ./configure --with-zziplib thing?
[03:58] <bezibaerchen> cyzie: what is hyperconnect technology?
[03:58] <buti> to kernel-building again... should i build falvuors=generic ?
[03:58] <eNons3nse> Once the browser crashes the first time I can sometimes re-open it, but it usually crashes again pretty easily, if it opens at all.  I have to restart my computer before it works right again.
[03:58] <gnomefreak> eNons3nse: remove the flash plugin and see if it still crashes. its well known that flash causes ff to crash
[03:58] <Tompu> eNons3nse: discovering which version of flash you're using in ephiphany is only a right-click away :)
[03:58] <skaos> oaudry: i took edgy...
[03:59] <cyzie> bezibaerchen, wireless for amd laptop cpu
[03:59] <alluc> on my system, each time I try to import a .svg image with fontforge, it returns: "Can't find libxml2." What can I do, how to know where it's looking for libxml2 which is installed, and works fine with inkscape ?
[03:59] <Tompu> geokok: buy a crossover cable
[03:59] <oaudry> skaos, ok thanks
[03:59] <geokok> and a second nic for the desktop?
[03:59] <eNons3nse> gnomefreak: that's kinda lame.  probably something they're working on though huh.
=== VisualStat|Stu is now known as VisualStat|Rep
[03:59] <Tompu> geokok: thats one way of doing it, sure
[04:00] <bezibaerchen> cyzie: i c
[04:00] <Tompu> geokok: a cheap hub or router would be better imBo
[04:00] <gnomefreak> eNons3nse: yes its being worked on. eNons3nse remember flash is not open source so its kind of hard to fix it other than throwing a few patches at it
[04:00] <eNons3nse> yeah
[04:00] <geokok> modem -->hub -----pc's\||||???
[04:00] <eNons3nse> plus flash 9 is in beta
[04:01] <Tompu> geokok: im not sure what your |||'s represent, but yes :)
[04:01] <gnomefreak> eNons3nse: in theroy we should not have to deal with any flash issues but we do.
[04:01] <eNons3nse> any word on when the regular release will be?
[04:01] <gnomefreak> eNons3nse: 2007 sometime
[04:01] <skaos> oaudry: just a hint: the install of edgy hung at one point - after i killed the hanging process it continued without errors
[04:01] <cyzie> bezibaerchen, any idea ?
[04:01] <bezibaerchen> cyzie: no, got centrino
[04:02] <Tompu> eNons3nse: http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/
[04:02] <geokok> ok......if I choose a nic however can u recommend any linux friendly brand?
[04:02] <brynk_> kom keif
[04:02] <eNons3nse> cool.  thanks Tompu & gnomefreak.
[04:02] <xukun> anybody knows something that can practice with that looks like the cisco's IOS ?
[04:02] <xukun> I,m trying to get my ccna
[04:02] <gnomefreak> !hardware | geokok
[04:02] <ubotu> geokok: For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[04:03] <eNons3nse> well, Tompu all my browsers are crashed out so I'm gonna have to restart, but i'll check the link later.
[04:03] <soundray> ss06r: still here?
[04:03] <Tompu> xukun cisco has a (free?) network simulator. *tries to remember the name*
[04:03] <_3uG_> the intel pro 100 (or something like that) series seems to be well-supported

[04:03] <Tompu> xukun: I think it's packet tracer
[04:03] <geokok> Tompu: are u sure hub goes to modem cause I thought hubs were connected to a pc that was connected to a modem
[04:03] <nolimitsoya> eNons3nse, use xkill to kill rampage programs
[04:03] <paitart__> ne1 from manila who's got an extra CD of 6.06 LTS?
[04:04] <SpComb> geokok: for 'normal' modems you can't plug them into switches, no
[04:04] <_3uG_> how do you kill a process that won't die with killall or kill -9?
[04:04] <eNons3nse> nolimitsoya: that will restart x?
[04:04] <nolimitsoya> geokok, if th
=== animal__ is now known as animal_
[04:04] <soundray> ss06r: there should be docs about how to integrate zziplib in /usr/share/doc/libzzip-0-12/
[04:04] <xukun> Tompu, thank you very much, I will try that
[04:04] <Tompu> SpComb: he has ethernet out on the modem
[04:04] <ss06r> soundray, cheers i'll have a look
[04:04] <nolimitsoya> geokok, if the modem has a dhcp server and nat capability you can share through a hub/switch
[04:04] <eNons3nse> nolimitsoya: is that the same as logging out and doing ctrl, alt, bkspce?
[04:04] <geokok> well I believe that mine is a very common one...so no i cant hub it
[04:04] <nolimitsoya> eNons3nse, no, that will kill the app you click on.
[04:05] <Tompu> geokok: you can do it. this is proven by your current setup
[04:05] <eNons3nse> nolimitsoya: that's not my problem.  but i'll remember that if i need it.
[04:05] <nolimitsoya> eNons3nse, if fex firefox is hung, open a terminal, type xkill, klick the browser window, restart firefox
[04:05] <geokok> I can? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,and have file sharing and internet sharing?
[04:05] <nolimitsoya> eNons3nse, ctrl+alt+backspace kills x
[04:05] <ss06r> soundray, there are no docs in that directory...just a couple chagelog gz
[04:06] <eNons3nse> nolimitsoya: usually if it's hung i can click close and it will give me a "program not responding" dialoge which will close it.
[04:06] <soundray> ss06r: how about /usr/share/doc/zziplib-bin/ ?
[04:06] <Tompu> geokok: i cant give you a guarantee, but im sure that you can
[04:06] <nolimitsoya> eNons3nse, that takes time, and doesnt work at all some times. killing manualy is the safe bet :)
[04:06] <geokok> .................................
[04:06] <ss06r> soundray, same deal...just a couple changelog gz
[04:06] <eNons3nse> nolimitsoya: thanks
[04:07] <chaplinux> my LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8, I want to modify for LANGUAGE=en_US.ISO-8859-1, which command that makes this?
[04:07] <geokok> well I ll let u know then...thank u very much for your help guys ..
[04:07] <Tompu> geokok: good luck
[04:08] <nolimitsoya> geokok, if you need a router for internet sharing, check out ipcop
[04:08] <nolimitsoya> (didnt catch what your problem was exactly...)
[04:08] <SpComb> Tompu: ethernet out? Is that IP or PPPoE?
[04:08] <buti> soundray: who can i talk to about getting a kernel patch included in ubuntu?
[04:08] <grndslm> why, when trying to use lvm, would pvscan list one of my devices as unknown??
[04:09] <gnomefreak> buti: file a bug on launchpad. with the patch attached

[04:09] <ss06r> soundray, can you see the docs atm?
[04:09] <MtJB> oh, my brothers, hear my plea, for i cannot hear them for myself.  my usbaudio, she does not play from the iNtarWEAVe, and this makes me very sad, esp when visiting youtube
[04:09] <ArmedKing> Anyone know how to update gnome (dapper) to version 2.16.1
[04:10] <buti> gnomefreak: ok
[04:10] <gnomefreak> ArmedKing: you have to install upgrade to edgy for 2.16
[04:10] <soundray> ss06r: no, just thought I'd point you to the defaults. I reckon you have to build the packages yourself.
[04:10] <ss06r> soundray, man thats annoying :D
[04:10] <ArmedKing> gnomefreak: I tryed that but edgy whas to buggy for me
[04:10] <ss06r> this is why i use gentoo at home :P
[04:10] <ss06r> stupid office computer :D
[04:10] <MtJB> it does work from applications on my computer, though
[04:11] <gnomefreak> ArmedKing: the only other way is to build it and its very very likely it wont work properly once its built
[04:11] <ArmedKing> gnomefreak: Tnx anyway man ;-)
[04:11] <gnomefreak> ArmedKing: looking at about 90% chance it wont work on dapper
[04:11] <soundray> buti: I think you file a wishlist bug

[04:12] <buti> yeah, ok
[04:12] <ArmedKing> gnomefreak: Well when i upgraded to edgy a lot like 60% of my system whas messed up so
[04:12] <gnomefreak> buti: if you give me bug number ill change it to wishlist
[04:12] <tabias> how do I "install" bttv driver?
[04:12] <soundray> buti: what changes did you make? Because I can never make hibernation work...
[04:13] <ailean> I'm trying to watch some films, and even with all the volume turned right the way up, it's not very loud.  Under Windows, it's fine, so it's not my hardware.  is there something I can do?
[04:13] <Tompu> ailean: run alsamixer from a console and play with the 'advanced' settings
[04:13] <nolimitsoya> ailean, check out alsamixer
[04:13] <buti> soundray: i fixed suspend to ram on my sony vaio, by adding an ide reset.
[04:13] <soundray> ailean: install gnome-alsamixer and make sure you have both master and PCM volumes turned up
[04:13] <buti> soundray: it has to be issued before IDLEIMMEDIATE
[04:13] <ailean> thanks Tompu, nolimitsoya and soundray
[04:13] <grndslm> why, when trying to use lvm, would pvscan list one of my devices as unknown??
[04:14] <soundray> buti: did you work that out yourself, or is it described somewhere?
[04:14] <Tompu> ailean: just be careful, you can generate some bad noise with alsamixer, especially with emu10k cards
[04:14] <ailean> Tompu, I can undo my changes though?
[04:15] <buti> soundray: myself. i already had made a similar change about 1/2 a year ago (using gentoo)
[04:15] <soundray> buti: you might consider submitting it to the mainline kernel IDE subsystem maintainer, or to LKML
[04:15] <gnomefreak> buti: if you /msg me the bug number or link i will look at it when i get home. i have a meeting in a few.
[04:15] <Tompu> ailean: yes, you'll lose them on reboot
[04:15] <buti> gnomefreak: not ready yet.
[04:15] <gnomefreak> buti: msg me when it is ill look at it when i get home
[04:15] <buti> soundray: submitting to kernel developers sounds like PAIN
[04:15] <buti> gnomefreak: ok, thanks
[04:16] <buti> bye gnomefreak
[04:16] <eNons3nse> oh.  one more firefox question.  the new spellcheck in forms feature.  does it just underline misspelled words which you have to then check yourself or is there a way it will show you what the correct spelling is?
[04:16] <soundray> buti: possibly. On the other hand, if you post it on LKML informally, you might trigger a discussion that leads to a more widely applicable solution.
[04:16] <buti> soundray: i don't believe my fix is "correct", "in the right place" ...
[04:17] <buti> soundray: but it makes resume from suspend2ram work 100% on my sony vaio
[04:17] <Tompu> eNons3nse: cant you right click the words?
[04:17] <buti> soundray: i was hoping for some ubuntu-kernel developer to do that...
[04:17] <tabias> !bttv
[04:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bttv - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:17] <ailean> thanks Tompu, nolimitsoya and soundray - worked perfectly
[04:17] <soundray> buti: I'm sure your post would be welcome
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> ailean, np hf :)
[04:18] <Tompu> ailean: if your volume settings are lost on reboots, you might want to look at alsactl
[04:18] <eNons3nse> Tompu: it doesnt suggest any alternate spellings when i do.  it just gives me the usual right click menu
[04:18] <ailean> k
[04:18] <Tompu> ailean: though im sure there is a more Ubuntu way
[04:18] <Cheery> Hi, I need help with keymaps, there is such line as:
[04:18] <ailean> I reckon that advanced mixer should be installed by default
[04:18] <eNons3nse> Tompu: is it supposed to?
[04:18] <Cheery> keymaps 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14
[04:19] <ailean> @ Tompu
[04:19] <Cheery> what does this mean?
[04:19] <buti> soundray: ok, i'll first report on bugs.ubuntu.com, see what it leads to, and then post to lkml, maybe
[04:19] <Cheery> its from .kmap -file
[04:19] <Tompu> ailean: im pretty sure you can get to most of those settings though gnomes volume mixer
[04:19] <Tompu> ailean: you just have to enable them in the gnome volume mixer preferences
[04:19] <Tompu> eNons3nse: no idea. my swiftfox doesnt seem to have spell checking enabled
[04:21] <ailean> Tompu, you can :) I'm obviously just stupid
[04:21] <Cheery> I read from manual it it defines what does the keymap specity
[04:21] <Tompu> ailean: i use alsamixer anyway ;)
[04:23] <Cheery> I have a problem with my keymap, it doesn't go on when I put it into xorg.conf
[04:23] <Cheery> And I don't know how to test those things :s
[04:23] <Tompu> Cheery: any hints in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> Cheery, have restarted x?
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> *you
[04:23] <Cheery> nolimitsoya: yes
[04:23] <tuxub> hello, i am buying a webcam for my pc and like to know which one works out of the box and got the best performance?
[04:24] <Cheery> Tompu, lookin at it
[04:24] <Tompu> tuxub: 64 bit system?
[04:24] <tuxub> 32bit
[04:24] <doccy> how do i start and stop services?
[04:24] <Tompu> tuxub: ah. then the world is your oyster
[04:24] <Tompu> doccy: /etc/init.d/servicename start | stop | restart
[04:24] <doccy> thanks
[04:24] <tuxub> Tompu, not quite... i have a creative live effects and it doesnt work
[04:25] <eNons3nse> when i enable the "album artwork" plug-in on rhythmbox, where is it supposed to show the art?  i know i have album art in some of these ID3 tags, but it's not coming up anywhere.
[04:25] <Cheery> ok, it is open here and I read it now through, Tompu.
[04:25] <Tompu> Cheery: look for lines that start with (WW) and (EE), or that mention the name of your keymap
[04:26] <Tompu> eNons3nse: for me it shows at the bottom left
[04:26] <Tomcat_> eNons3nse: Bottom left, yes... and it loads them off the net, not from the ID3. (never heard that :))
[04:26] <doccy> where can i find login screen themes?
[04:26] <Tomcat_> doccy: gnome-looks.org
[04:27] <Tomcat_> doccy: Sorry, http://www.gnome-look.org/
[04:27] <doccy> thanks
[04:27] <Tomcat_> doccy: "GDM Themes"
[04:27] <me_> BitTorrent question
[04:27] <eNons3nse> Tomcat_: really?  you can attatch photo files inside of ID3 tags.  my archos mp3 player displays them from there.
[04:27] <doccy> this linux thing is quite nice :)
[04:27] <LuisMendes> hi, how can I burn .mdf files in Ubuntu?
[04:27] <Tomcat_> eNons3nse: Never heard or seen that... but interesting. :)
[04:27] <Cheery> Tompu, mysterious, there reads
[04:27] <Cheery> (**) Option "XkbLayout" "henkke-dvorak"
[04:27] <Cheery> (**) Generic Keyboard: XkbLayout: "henkke-dvorak"
[04:28] <me_> how do I start using BitTorrent that comes with Ubuntu included; it keeps asking for some BitTorrent metafile
[04:28] <Daro> !xgl
[04:28] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL)  -  Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager  -  Help in #ubuntu-xgl  -  See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[04:28] <eNons3nse> Tomcat_: you can do it through easytag.  that's also how iTunes stores artwork to your files.
[04:29] <Janchi> @ me, what do you know about bittorrent?
[04:29] <me_> not much aside from some theory how it works
[04:29] <unfun> Can someone help me understand why I get this error when I try to play a movie in mplayer?
[04:29] <unfun> "there seems there is no Xvideo support for your video card availble"
[04:29] <Daro> !beryl
[04:29] <Tomcat_> eNons3nse: From an architectural standpoint it's not really intelligent though... usually, about 10 to 15 files have the same cover art :)
[04:29] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[04:29] <Janchi> You need a torrent file, which you can find in various public places liek ThePirateBay and MiniNova
[04:30] <eNons3nse> Tomcat_: do you know where rhythmbox grabs artwork from then.  i know i listen to some obscure music, but it should be finding something that i've got.
[04:30] <compengi> does ubuntu have any problems with old compac leptop drivers?
[04:30] <Janchi> Or, for instance, from the Ubuntu download page to get the latest ISO
[04:30] <me_> Janchi: thanz, I'll do some homework
[04:30] <miguelinux> Hola a todos
[04:31] <LuisMendes> Hi, how can I burn .mdf files in Ubuntu? **********
[04:31] <Tomcat_> eNons3nse: As I said, the web... probably last.fm or something.
[04:31] <kaptengu> Gnome takes forever to start up, after about 5 minutes after logging in I get the message: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.
[04:31] <Janchi> @me, enjoy the bittorrent realm :-)
[04:31] <kaptengu> Can someone help me?
[04:31] <miguelinux> Alguien me podra prestar ayuda para resolver un problema con Beryl?
[04:31] <eNons3nse> Tomcat_: yeah, that's true.  you can also attatch multiple images to the same file, to display stuff like band photos, event flyers for live recordings, etc...  it's actually pretty cool, but yes not very efficent.
[04:31] <netpython> LuisMendes, they are poweriso files?
[04:32] <LuisMendes> netpython, dunno about poweriso, but yes they are images
[04:32] <Tomcat_> eNons3nse: /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/artdisplay has the python files for the plugin... it seems to use Amazon for the covers.
[04:32] <maxflax> kaptengu, sounds like a IRQ polling error
[04:32] <cycom> Why would my console be showing an accented letter 'a' instead of things like ' or block graphics?
[04:32] <dom_f> miguelinux: try ubuntu-es
[04:32] <netpython> LuisMendes, i know poweriso on windows is about the only one if i recall
[04:33] <cycom> my apostrophies and a few other things are acting funny.
[04:33] <LuisMendes> netpython, actually they are alcohol 120% images
[04:33] <eNons3nse> Tomcat_: I see.  well, that's probably why much of my music doesn't have artwork with it.
[04:33] <hou5ton> How do I  make the G-Mail notifier automatically launch whenever I boot up?
[04:33] <kaptengu> maxflax: what can I do to fix it?
[04:33] <netpython> LuisMendes, i see,have you googled yet?
[04:33] <eNons3nse> i just found a few more well known things that do, so it is working.
[04:33] <Tomcat_> eNons3nse: It also tries to search files like "cover", "album", "albumart", ".folder", "folder".... maybe you could write an ID3 cover art plugin? :)
[04:33] <LuisMendes> netpython, I'm trying, but cant find anything good...
[04:34] <eNons3nse> heh.  i don't know anything about writing software.
[04:34] <Tomcat_> :)
[04:34] <Cheery> bah, I will try to find a way myself to get my kmap working :(
[04:34] <eNons3nse> ah.  so maybe if i put a "cover.jpg" image file in each albums folder it would use that.
[04:34] <anders9034> hey i just installed ubuntu and i want  to know how do i install gstreamer so i can play mp3s in rythmbox?

[04:35] <LuisMendes> netpython, actually there is a program on synaptic called 'mdf2iso', and it works good ;)
[04:36] <tabias> how do I install bttv drivers, I can't get the module to load or I can't just install it
[04:36] <maxflax> kaptengu, find out what hardware is causing it.. check dmesg
[04:36] <anders9034> thanks
[04:37] <netpython> LuisMendes, http://freshmeat.net/projects/mdf2iso/
[04:37] <compudaze> bttv should load if you card is detected
[04:37] <netpython> oops you where first
[04:37] <eNons3nse> Oh.  Here's a Big question.  Lets say I don't use .m3u playlist files so I want to delete all of them from all my album folders.  Is there a way that I can do that without going to each individual folder and doing it for each file?  Like can I go to a top music directory in the shell and tell it to recoursivly delete every file with a .m3u extension?
[04:37] <savvas> tabias: try vstream: sudo apt-get install vstream
[04:37] <ZorbaTHut> anyone remember the program you can use to find out what shared libraries a program depends on? (not apt-related, it's outside apt)
[04:37] <Juhaz> ldd program
[04:38] <ZorbaTHut> ah, right. thanks juhaz
[04:38] <LuisMendes> netpython, weird.. it says the resulting iso file is not valid...
[04:38] <tabias> savvas: I installed vstream. Now I need tv ^^ (installed tvtime but blue screen and happauge bt878 card)
[04:38] <grndslm> why, when trying to use lvm, would pvscan list one of my devices as unknown??
[04:38] <eNons3nse> I messed that up once and ended up deleting a lot of my music accidentally.
[04:39] <xorllu> how can i configure konqueror (e.g. konqueror with splitview 2 panels) to show location toolbar (address bar) on each splitview panel? (that will be very useful)
[04:39] <savvas> tabias: sorry, i don't know any other solutions, maybe someone else does :\
[04:40] <savvas> xorllu: ctrl+l ?
[04:40] <mrbond82> What's a good (STABLE) IDE for C++ under ubuntu. I'm looking to just write console applications.. kind of like bloodshed dev c++ for windows
[04:40] <savvas> i use gnome though :p
[04:41] <netpython> vcdgear -raw2mpg videocd.mdf videocd.mpg
[04:41] <netpython> vcdimager -b videocd.bin -c videocd.cue videocd.mpg
[04:41] <netpython> cdrdao write videocd.cue
[04:41] <savvas> mrbond82: scite :)
[04:41] <kaptengu> maxflax: what should I look for in dmesg?
[04:41] <Tompu> mrbond82: anjuta is good if you're not using edgy
[04:41] <mrbond82> Tompu-- anjuta+edgy = broken
[04:41] <Tompu> mrbond82: otherwise i'd suggest eclipse with the c/c++ addon
[04:41] <xorllu> savvas, i need on each splitview panel one location toolbar (address bar)...
[04:42] <netpython> dinnertime
[04:42] <mrbond82> Tompu-- I tried using the eclipse with c++ addon and it stopped working after a while something about a plugin... :(
[04:42] <tuxub> anyone recomends a webcam for use on ubuntu edgy out of the box?
[04:42] <Tompu> mrbond82: have you tried another version of anjuta?
[04:42] <hou5ton> how can i find out what the command line is for a particular program?
[04:42] <wastrel> ubunto lunix
[04:43] <jvolkman> does anyone know how to find the domain controller for a particular domain?
[04:43] <jvolkman> using samba
[04:43] <wastrel> hou5ton:  what program
[04:43] <mrbond82> Tompu - how can I specifiy another version of anjuta in edgy ?
[04:43] <hou5ton> wastrel:    Gmail Notifier
[04:43] <wastrel> hou5ton:  apropos gmail  perhaps
[04:43] <Tompu> mrbond82: remove anjuta, then install without using synaptic or apt-get
[04:43] <Tompu> mrbond82: i.e download from sourceforge etc
[04:44] <Tompu> mrbond82: i havent been following the anjuta bug though
[04:44] <Tompu> mrbond82: there might be a fix for it
[04:44] <savvas> mrbond82: have you tried SciTE?
[04:44] <hou5ton> wastrel:   what is apropos?
[04:44] <mrbond82> Tompu -- anjuta froms ource?
[04:44] <MtJB> is flash 9 available?
[04:44] <mrbond82> savvas-- scite is just like a text editor
[04:45] <mrbond82> thaanks for the help bbl
[04:45] <maxflax> kaptengu, look if u can find errors when loading hardware!
[04:45] <kitche> !flash > MtJB
[04:45] <Tompu> mrbond82: from source or use a precompiled version other than the version in the repos
[04:45] <savvas> well there are plugins to make it better, with gui interface etc
[04:45] <Tompu> MtJB: flash9 beta is 'available' if you're feeling brave
[04:46] <MtJB> Tompu :)
[04:46] <cheesy> MtJB: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/
[04:46] <wastrel> hou5ton:  man apropos    it's a command to look for keywords in the manual
[04:46] <MtJB> cheesy, i thank you, and my grandchildren thank you
[04:46] <dakira> hi. has anyone ever seen the problem that after loging in the xserver just terminates and you go back to the graphical login (again)? xorg.0.log has no errors or warnings.. an fglrx driver is used
[04:47] <hou5ton> wastrel:   ok ... thanks
[04:47] <kitche> MtJB: there is also a package ubotu should have sent a link to you that had it
=== mrc_001 is now known as mrc_001|away
[04:47] <cheesy> MtJB: no problem
[04:47] <compudaze> XGL is so much faster than the beta nvidia driver/aiglx
[04:47] <savvas> tuxub: http://www.google.com/search?q=webcam%20linux
[04:47] <Tompu> compudaze: not for me
[04:47] <compudaze> really?
[04:47] <Tompu> compudaze: unless you mean aiglx with the driver
[04:48] <Tompu> compudaze: i use the beta nvidia driver and then i dont need xgl
[04:48] <Tompu> compudaze: i can compiz from X etc
[04:48] <compudaze> thats what i was doing
[04:48] <compudaze> but i switched to XGL so i wouldn't have to use the beta driver (problems, etc) and it's much faster for me

[04:49] <jessid> hello, some of you know how can I connect a palm?  thanks
[04:49] <Kannix> jessid: What palm?
[04:49] <jessid> zire72, Kannix
[04:50] <Kannix> jessid: There is "jpilot".
[04:50] <jessid> thanks, Kannix
[04:50] <Kannix> jessid: and gnome-pilot.

[04:51] <miguelinux> Hello Friends
[04:51] <wastrel> palm sync is broken in dapper
[04:52] <miguelinux> I've got aproblem with Beryl Aiglx on Edgy
[04:52] <ClayDragon> yes palm sync works again in edgy
[04:52] <wastrel> ClayDragon:  the wiki howto worked for me
[04:53] <ClayDragon> wastrel, it worked for me in the past releases as well, but this time strangely not (with edgy)
[04:53] <miguelinux> when I maximize a window this goes black. I've got Strict Binding activated
[04:53] <wastrel> ClayDragon:  did you turn off composite in your xorg.conf ?
[04:54] <miguelinux> I don't find such bug in Beryl
[04:54] <JaZyXGL> got a question i did apt-get --download-only source network-manager-gnome
[04:54] <JaZyXGL> now i have the tar.gz's
[04:54] <compudaze> weird problem i do have with XGL, my numpad doesn't work with numlock on as it should
[04:54] <JaZyXGL> how can i install it on another machine without  any access
[04:54] <nuse> hello
[04:54] <ClayDragon> wastrel: as in the wiki written, i put "composite" to "0" but theres still only the mesa driver loaded
[04:54] <JaZyXGL> to the net that is
[04:55] <ClayDragon> but ive only restarted my x server, should i give it a try with a reboot?
[04:55] <nuse> hi
[04:55] <miguelinux> wrastel:do you speak with me
[04:55] <wastrel> ClayDragon:  try reboot for sure.
[04:55] <lk11mn> hello
[04:55] <ClayDragon> ok ill give it a try. ;-) ill be back again in a few minutes. bye!
[04:55] <nuse> help me configure iptables amule
[04:55] <lk11mn> can someone help me with a RAID question????
[04:56] <osfameron> should WPA access "just work" on Edgy?
[04:56] <jessid> Kannix nothing, man...nothing happens...
[04:56] <JaZyXGL> osfamer
[04:56] <JaZyXGL> do this
[04:56] <hou5ton> wastrel:   yes ... that led me to the solution ... gmail-notify.    Now, can I sync a Treo 650 on Edgy?  :-)
[04:56] <JaZyXGL> sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
[04:56] <osfameron> I'm trying to connect to dad's wireless, and the usual iwconfig essid and iwconfig key: doesn't work
[04:56] <JaZyXGL> and use that applet for wpa
[04:56] <wastrel> miguelinux:  i don't knowanythingabout beryl or xgl .  maybe ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:57] <JaZyXGL> use that applet
[04:57] <wastrel> hou5ton:  yes, do you want to use jpilot or evolution ?
[04:57] <dknet> a
[04:57] <kitche> osfameron: so I take it WEP and not WPA?
[04:57] <JaZyXGL> i'm using that applet
[04:57] <osfameron> JaZyXGL: ok, I'll try that :-)  I notice that edgy has wpa_supplicant, but couldn't get it to work
[04:57] <wastrel> hm is my spacebar flaky ?  know anything about...  :] 
[04:57] <osfameron> kitche: well, I think it's WPA
[04:57] <psb154> where can I find an install image of ubuntu for Sun sparcs?
[04:57] <miguelinux> thanks
[04:57] <JaZyXGL> well i'm using that app with no problems :) using WPA EAP
[04:58] <hou5ton> wastrel:   I don't suppose I have a preference, unless you would tell me one is much better than the other.  I quit using MS Outlook quite some time ago, and have all my business and personal email sent to a gmail account ... but need to get the Treo back in the loop.
[04:58] <osfameron> kitche: as iwlist scan gives me a line like: IE: WPA Version 1
[04:58] <kitche> osfameron: yep you need wpa_supplicant and just use a applet to get it set up right
[04:58] <nuse> hola
[04:58] <nuse> speal spain?
[04:58] <wastrel> !es | nuse
[04:58] <hou5ton> wastrel:   I have used Evolution in the past .. and don't have any problems with it
[04:58] <ubotu> nuse: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:58] <nuse> speak
[04:59] <lk11mn> can someone help me with a RAID question????
[04:59] <Tomcat_> !meta | lk11mn
[04:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about meta - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:59] <Tomcat_> !metaquestion | lk11mn
[04:59] <ubotu> lk11mn: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:59] <osfameron> kitche: ok :-)  damn this networking not just working nonsense :-)
[05:00] <wastrel> hou5ton:  jpilot is more like classic palm desktop, but isn't as integrated as evolution.    in evo the palm sync stuff seems to be a bit tacked on (the memo interface is very clunky) but it integrates with gnome calendar applet and stuff...  both work reasonably well
[05:00] <osfameron> JaZyXGL: right, installed... how do I use it? :-)
[05:00] <lk11mn> k, is it possible to install linux on an existing raid array? eg. i have windows on a striped array, id like to put ubuntu on it too
[05:00] <lk11mn> what does !metaquestion mean?
[05:00] <osfameron> (that's the biggest problem with apt-get, it doesn't report back on what menu item or command to use to run the stuff you just installed)
[05:00] <JaZyXGL> restart gdm and it should have a new network applet where you current one is
[05:01] <wastrel> hou5ton:   apt-get install jpilot   if you want to giveit a try or for evolution go to   System > Preferences > Palm OS Devices  and configure the gnome-pilot sync conduit
[05:01] <JaZyXGL> disable whatever adapter you want to use
[05:01] <JaZyXGL> with the new app
[05:01] <kitche> lk11mn: it means don't ask to ask for help just say your problem
[05:01] <JaZyXGL> iin the current network prefs
[05:01] <wastrel> hou5ton:  try  /dev/pilot  for the device
[05:01] <JaZyXGL> in network-monitor disable the adapters
[05:01] <ClayDragon> wastrel: thanks! i really needed just the reboot *blushing*
[05:01] <lk11mn> k, well i was just kinda askin to see if there was anyone around with that knows raid in ubuntu
[05:01] <hou5ton> wastrel:   the thing I wondering about is ... when I sync with Evolution I will probably lose all the extra programs I have on it ....
[05:01] <wastrel> one gets used to not rebooting in linux :] 
[05:01] <osfameron> JaZyXGL: ok, disabled eth1
[05:01] <JaZyXGL> restart gdm and then enable the devices on network-manager and you should be able to connect
[05:02] <osfameron> JaZyXGL: restart gdm?
[05:02] <ClayDragon> wastrel: thats true ;-)
[05:02] <JaZyXGL> logout log back in
[05:02] <JaZyXGL> will work
[05:02] <JaZyXGL> shoudl not sure if i rebooted
[05:02] <JaZyXGL> holw up
[05:02] <gebruiker_> how do I set debconf priority?
[05:02] <JaZyXGL> hold up saw a good wiki
[05:03] <ubuntu> hi
[05:03] <wastrel> hou5ton:  i don't think that's a danger- the real problem is sometimes your data in the  address, todo, datebook & memo can get zapped.  backup first is a good idea, or carefully configure a "one time" behavior for 4 PIM conduits...
[05:03] <ubuntu> does someone know, if its hard to use debian etch?
[05:03] <lsc> how doi  get my computer to see a win nt network and print from it smb4k  see it  but i can't get kde print manger to print from it
[05:03] <JaZyXGL> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy/Networking
[05:03] <kitche> ubuntu: it's a step above ubuntu in hardness
[05:04] <JaZyXGL> hard like how Ubuntu
[05:04] <hou5ton> wastrel:   good idea .... but I think I'll waIt till I have a little more time .... thanks for the guidance
[05:04] <JaZyXGL> i'm using etch on my server machine
[05:04] <lk11mn> k, so i assume people arent just ignoring me because i smell... they just dont know if ubuntu can be installed on an existing raid array
[05:04] <lsc> does not see it in kde print mrg
[05:04] <JaZyXGL> ubuntu server wouldn't install
[05:04] <JaZyXGL> so went with debian
[05:04] <ubuntu> but is it hard to install or uninstall?
[05:04] <ubuntu> in case that i dont like it?
[05:05] <JaZyXGL> no it's not hard
[05:05] <JaZyXGL> to install
[05:05] <kitche> ubuntu: it's the same installer pretty much well not hte live cd but the alternate install
[05:05] <ubuntu> what about unistall :P?
[05:05] <JaZyXGL> yeah it's similar to the alt. install
[05:05] <psusi> lk11mn: what kind of raid array?
[05:05] <JaZyXGL> ..just format :P
=== Carry_ is now known as Carry
[05:05] <ubuntu> but anything else :D?
[05:05] <lsc> how doi  get my computer to see a win nt network and print from it smb4k  see it  but i can't get kde print manger to print from it
[05:05] <lsc> does not see it in kde print mrg
[05:05] <chuckyp> Hrm.... alright I have an avi that I converted to mpeg2 with avidemux  how do I burn it to DVD so that a dvd player can play it?
[05:06] <ubuntu> cause i wouldnt like to loose information :P
[05:06] <lk11mn> raid 0 psusi
[05:06] <psusi> lk11mn: I mean is this a software raid?  hardware?  hardware fakeraid?
[05:06] <B-Minus> how can i extract .001 .002 etc .. files in CLI ?
[05:06] <lk11mn> sry, its hardware SATA i can give you the chipset... psusi
[05:06] <kitche> ubuntu: well I would recommand using partimage to back up your system
[05:07] <JaZyXGL> if you download the source of a pkg from apt-get using -d source myPKG
[05:07] <TC`> I use to connect to internet a static IP and DNS, but if i want to share internet it to laptop, what i should do? firestarter is shown that it uses DHCP, but i don't use it to connect to internet :|
[05:07] <Tompu> chuckyp: most dvd players will read standard mpeg files
[05:07] <psusi> lk11mn: unless you paid $400 for a raid card, then it is fake hardware raid... I wrote a howto on the subject on the wiki... see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto
[05:07] <chuckyp> Tompu, so just burn the mpeg to the dvd?
[05:07] <ubuntu> ok, thx for help
[05:07] <chuckyp> Tompu, or do I need some sort of dvd authoring software?
[05:07] <psusi> lk11mn: it is possible to get it working, but it will likely take some effort on your part
[05:07] <Tompu> chuckyp: that'll work for most new dvd players, afaik
[05:08] <lk11mn> great thx psusi (i hope its possible)
[05:08] <psusi> lk11mn: actually, I need to go update that wiki now for edgy ;)
[05:08] <fuffe> I thought of a script that can output statistics like these: http://area51.phpbb.com/statcvs/ but with subversion instead of cvs
[05:08] <fuffe> is there any?
[05:08] <chuckyp> Tompu, hrm.. well i'm looking for compatibility with all dvd players so I geuss i need k3b or something similiar
[05:08] <osfameron> JaZyXGL: I killed and restarted gdm, which logged me back in again.  I've just opened network admin and it's the same applet
[05:09] <Tompu> chuckyp: you're never going to get compatibility with all dvd players
[05:09] <JaZyXGL> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy/Networking
[05:09] <JaZyXGL> goto that guide osfameron
[05:09] <JaZyXGL> brb
[05:09] <pbx> fuffe: Have you seen CIA?
[05:09] <chuckyp> Tompu, i'm talking of the vob system etc...
[05:09] <Tompu> chuckyp: there are dvd players that just wont play dvdr / dvdrw
[05:09] <JaZyXGL> i've got a class :-(
[05:09] <Tompu> chuckyp: yeah i realise that :)
[05:09] <TC`> I use to connect to Internet a static IP and DNS, but if i want to share Internet it to laptop, what i should do? firestarter is shown that it uses DHCP, but i don't use it to connect to internet :|
[05:09] <lk11mn> well its got its own bios and is configured before os, and it needed drivers etc... Silicon Image 3114 chipset?? psusi is this still fake raid? (like i know its not configured in the os like dynamic disks or something like that)
[05:09] <chuckyp> Tompu, well you say newer players will be able to play mpeg.   what about first gen dvd players?
[05:10] <Tompu> chuckyp: have a look at dvdstyler
[05:10] <TC`> is there a channel to ask about networking questions?
[05:10] <Tompu> chuckyp: http://dvdstyler.sourceforge.net/
[05:10] <psusi> lk11mn: yes... read the intro of that howto and it explains what fakeraid is
[05:10] <lk11mn> kk, thx
[05:11] <TC`> I use to connect to internet a static IP and DNS, but if i want to share internet it to laptop, what i should do? firestarter is shown that it uses DHCP, but i don't use it to connect to internet ... help please
[05:11] <fuffe> tried ubuntu yesterday and it was really neat!
[05:11] <Trist_an> Hello there
[05:11] <Trist_an> Is there any free equivalent of Maple on Linux?
[05:12] <kmaynard> accounting software?
[05:12] <Tompu> !dvdauthor
[05:12] <ubotu> dvdauthor: create DVD-Video file system. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.6.11-4 (edgy), package size 137 kB, installed size 356 kB
[05:12] <ifireball> TC`: it depends on what you want to do, if you don't mind setting a sattic IP and DNS on your laptop then you can just setup your Linux box to do NAT
[05:12] <psusi> lk11mn: getting it working is eactually much easier in edgy than it was back in breezy.... so don't be too scared of the instructions there ;)

[05:13] <TC`> i got ubuntu on PC on laptop win xp sp2
[05:13] <ifireball> TC`: if you want it to be all automagic like windows connection sahring you'll need to setup your linux box as a DHCP server as well as a DNS proxy and a NAT
[05:13] <TC`> how to do that?
[05:13] <iami89> excuse me , where to download "dpkg development files"(dpkg-dev)?
[05:13] <lk11mn> k, cool i'm reading psusi - just i dont like the term "fake raid" it makes me feel like i was an idiot to think it was raid in the first place... could you call it "genuine impaired raid" or something like that?
[05:14] <Tompu> iami89: apt-get install dpkg-dev
[05:14] <TC`> ifireball: can talk in private about this question?
[05:14] <psusi> lk11mn: lol.... I didn't make up the name ;)
[05:14] <iami89> after power cut{failure}, what will happend, is it serious
[05:14] <akaDruid> hey all, I have an odd upgrade problem with edgy. I get "dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_1%3a7.1.1ubuntu6_i386.deb (--unpack): trying to overwrite `/usr/X11R6/bin', which is also in package xli" and it won't proceed
=== variant is now known as ballball
[05:14] <ifireball> TC`: sure, though I'd rather find you a HOWTO or something because there is quite a lot to explain...
[05:14] <iami89> <Tompu>->i want a link to download it
[05:14] <psusi> lk11mn: but it does describe it to a Tee... it is not hardware raid.... it is fake hardware raid ;)
[05:15] <psusi> cause it pretends to be
[05:15] <iami89> i'm now using windows to chat with you
[05:15] <psusi> for practical purposes though, it is close enough
[05:15] <savvas> iami89: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/dpkg-dev
[05:15] <psusi> I use one myself and am quite happy with it
[05:15] <iami89> i still cant setup and connect to internet by modem
[05:16] <lk11mn> wait tho, can i just clear something up before i read the entire document and realise something.... i can do this on an existing raid array without having to reformat it ?
[05:16] <kitche> iami89: what's your modem?

[05:17] <iami89> PCtel HSP v.92
[05:17] <iami89> after power cut{failure}, what will happend, is it serious?
[05:17] <iami89> how to setup my modem?
[05:18] <Juhaz> Trist_an, see wikipedia entry for maple, for example.
[05:18] <lk11mn> oh nvm :p
[05:19] <iami89> kitche -> can you answer my question?
[05:19] <Poser> Hello all.
[05:19] <Tompu> iami89: rephrase your powercut question
[05:19] <netpython> iami89, is it an asdl modem or an dial-up modem,winmodem.....
[05:19] <Tompu> netpython: dialup
[05:19] <netpython> oh
[05:20] <Poser> I'm sure people come in here all the damn time with XGL/Beryl questions, but I have a few issues I want to know if anyone else is having them.
[05:20] <psusi> lk11mn: yes
[05:20] <iami89> dialup modem
[05:20] <netpython> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto
[05:20] <Poser> Anyone?
[05:20] <me_> me
[05:20] <paitart> ne1 know a linux/FOSS alternative to adobe pagemaker? i need it for my ubuntu at home and at work
[05:20] <mram> Poser what is your question maybe I can help
[05:20] <lk11mn> great thx psusi, and reading the how to, it seems very simple yet detailed, good job, thx
[05:20] <Akuma_> my x86 copy boots, but not the x64 one, why is that?
[05:20] <Poser> Awesome.
[05:20] <svensko> can anyone provide me with a link to a walkthrough to install the hp driver?
[05:20] <iami89>  <netpython>  after power cut{failure}, what will happend, is it serious?
[05:20] <Poser> I followed the instructions on this page: http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html
[05:21] <Tompu> Akuma_: what processor?
[05:21] <Akuma_> Tompu: AMD turion 64
[05:21] <Poser> mram: I have a Radeon 9700 Pro, AGP
[05:21] <psusi> lk11mn: just read the parts about what fakeraid is and hwo it works... ignore the parts about how to get it working as you don't have to do any of that in edgy
[05:21] <mram> Poser: I have a Radeon 9550 and mine worked fine
[05:21] <Poser> mram: And basically, everyone seems to work fine... at first.
[05:22] <Poser> mram: Well, Beryl starts.
[05:22] <tsoler> hello to all
[05:22] <mram> Poser: okay so you did get it working?
[05:22] <Yawner> Howdy guys, got a little problem with my wireless networking.. Ive just updated to Edgy and although my wireless card is recognized, ndiswrapper says its installed and detects all the hardware.. but when I try to scan for avaiolable connectons I keep drawing a blank.. Any Ideas?
[05:22] <psusi> lk11mn: in edgy it is prety much as simple as booting from the livecd, installing the dmraid package, partitioning the array hwo you like, including shrinking the windows partition by hand, then running the installer
[05:22] <tsoler> need a question
[05:22] <psusi> I think... ;)
[05:22] <Poser> mram: but after it loads the manager, the window borders blink like crazy
[05:22] <Poser> mram: and so does the shadow under the top menu bar.
[05:22] <mram> Poser: have you messed around with the setting to see if that helps out
[05:22] <phaedrus44> Yawner   did you blacklist the driver or module that ubuntu loads for the network adapter?
[05:23] <netpython> iami89, " after power cut{failure}, what will happend, is it serious?" what do you mean?
[05:23] <Poser> mram: they blink and blink and eventually, stop blinking, so all my windows are left without borders and buttons. :(
[05:23] <mram> Poser: Beryl has it's own settings
[05:23] <Poser> mram: nope, followed the instructions on the page I listed below.
[05:23] <iami89> only that?
[05:23] <mram> Poser: dude that sucks
[05:23] <iami89> is it serious?
[05:23] <Yawner> phaedrus44: yes i did
[05:23] <phaedrus44> unload the ndiswrapper module and load it back after blacklist....
[05:24] <Yawner> hmm ok
[05:24] <Yawner> 1 sec
[05:24] <phaedrus44> what card you have?
[05:24] <Poser> mram: any clues?
[05:24] <netpython> iami89, as long as there isn't smoking coming out of the device i guess not :-)
[05:24] <tsoler> guys can a have a remote connection on a windows 2003 server?
[05:24] <Yawner> phaedrus44: WG121 (Netgear USB)
[05:24] <mram> Poser: I am trying to figure out what would cause that
[05:24] <kitche> tsoler: yes you can use a couple of tools to login to the TS of 2003 server
[05:24] <Poser> mram: on dapper and Berly v0.1, it worked fine, but I had the SAME EXACT ISSUE when Beryl upgraded to .1.1 in dapper, so I got on Edgy and now it's happening again.
[05:24] <iami89> thank ^___^
[05:25] <phaedrus44> Yawner:  did you read that it works with ndiswrapper?
[05:25] <netpython> iami89, anytime
[05:25] <iami89> can you answer my question about my modem?
[05:25] <tsoler> i use the dafault tool for ubuntu ,
[05:25] <mram> Poser: hmm...i am wonder if has to do with Beryl .1.1
[05:25] <Poser> Same here.
[05:25] <Tompu> !dialup | iami89
[05:25] <ubotu> iami89: You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[05:25] <mram> Poser: is there a way you can go back .1.0
[05:25] <Yawner> phaedrus44: yes, it even comes with linux drivers, on the cd it has a folder labelled ndis5
[05:25] <Akuma_> anyone has any idea why my computer boot ubuntu x86 but not x64?

[05:26] <bthibault> any ideas?
[05:26] <Tompu> bthibault: 32bit?
[05:26] <netpython> Tompu, i think he might want to use the scanmodem tool?
[05:26] <phaedrus44> Yawner :  cool
[05:26] <tsoler> kitche: i can not get connected
[05:26] <sharperguy> how can I access the disks partition GUI from the Edgy live-cd (its not there by default)
[05:26] <phaedrus44> did you use the windows xp driver with ndiswrapper?
[05:26] <mram> Poser: sorry man I can't think of anything else
[05:26] <savvas> bthibault: choose sun jre: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[05:26] <kitche> tsoler: well what are you using to connect?
[05:26] <Tompu> netpython: i have no idea at all. im blissfully free of dialup
[05:26] <mram> Poser: have you tried http://www.ubuntuforms.org
[05:27] <tsoler> terminal server client
[05:27] <Tompu> netpython: but i dont think he's been through the dialup guide
[05:27] <savvas> bthibault: then restart firefox and go to www.java.com to test it
[05:27] <tsoler> ii comes with ubuntiui installation
[05:27] <eXistenZ> What email client do you guys recommend? I didn't like evolution that much
[05:27] <Akuma_> is it possible to update to edgy x64 from dapper x86 ?
[05:27] <Poser> mram: it just bugs me that other people have it working on the same hardware. :(
[05:27] <netpython> Tompu, yeas you're right he should have been through that first
[05:27] <compudaze> Akuma_, reinstall from scratch
[05:27] <iami89> do you know where to download driver for my modem :PCtel HSP modem v.92?
[05:28] <Poser> mram, the forums turned up nothing
[05:28] <Akuma_> compudaze: thats fine with me, but x64 wont boot
[05:28] <mram> Poser: I hear you, it's frustrating.
[05:28] <mram> Poser: :-(
[05:28] <phaedrus44> Yawner: ?
[05:28] <tsoler> ive beenn connected once in the begging when i first installed ubuntu but i cannot anymore:(
[05:28] <bogdanp9> can i use gaim to talk to some1 that has windows with a mic ?
[05:28] <kitche> tsoler: hmm that should allow you to connect to it, you can also try nxclient since I believe that will allow you to connect to TS servers as well
[05:28] <mram> Poser: well sorry man I have to run, school time, hope you can find a solution soon
[05:29] <compudaze> bogdanp9, i dont think gaim does voice
[05:29] <bogdanp9> ok, thanks
[05:29] <Yawner> phaedrus44: hmm.. still doesnt work

[05:29] <bogdanp9> ahhm
[05:29] <bogdanp9> thanks
[05:29] <kitche> tsoler: nxclient should have an option that will let you specify TS connection
[05:30] <tsoler> kitche : i see many protocolls here what is the correct one?

[05:37] <weardlan> format c:
[05:37] <variant> iami89: reboot to the dapper live cd and just install over the existing installation, making sure format is selected for the / parttion
[05:37] <iami89> when i insert my ubuntu disk after installed ubuntu, it cant run livecd, why?
[05:37] <melon> nm - found my answers :)
[05:37] <bogdanp9> when i use anjuta for programming in C++, i can't build the pr, i can't make an .exe file
[05:37] <sharperguy> what about system>administration>disks, i  would prefer to use it nut its not there
[05:38] <variant> iami89: fix bios
[05:38] <iami89> how to fix it?
[05:38] <psusi> bogdanp9: there is no such thing as .exe in linux
[05:38] <likwid> iami89: change boot order
[05:38] <variant> iami89: add the cd as the first bootable device
[05:38] <defrysk> hit DEL when starting pc ?
[05:38] <bogdanp9> hmm, then i'm stupid
[05:38] <bogdanp9> :d

[05:39] <sharperguy> psusi: what about system>administration>disks, i  would prefer to use it nut its not there
[05:39] <iami89> nope, the cd still is the first bootable device
[05:39] <iami89> and it still show me setup menu
[05:39] <defrysk> iami89, how did you burn the cd ?
[05:39] <sharperguy> #ubuntu
[05:39] <variant> iami89: well then it should boot, having ubuntu isntalled will not affect the way the bios works

[05:41] <variant> iami89: the cd is busted?
[05:41] <likwid> if you run the GUI installer and have a premade partition from partition magic
[05:41] <Skenvoy> does anyone know if there's a 1.4.0 subversion package out for dapper?
[05:41] <likwid> it says "no root partition selected"

[05:41] <kitche> Skenvoy: no there isn't one I even checked backports
[05:41] <sharperguy> will there be a 6.10.1?
[05:41] <likwid> you have to go back to the partitioner, delete your partition and remake it with that thing
[05:41] <iami89> i've just burn it
[05:41] <Skenvoy> arrg.
[05:41] <defrysk> sharperguy, nope
[05:41] <variant> iami89: try the one you used to isntall with
[05:41] <sharperguy> bloomineck
[05:41] <sharperguy> :P
[05:42] <defrysk> iami89, try burning it at a slower speed
[05:42] <LordDiabolus> who
[05:42] <iami89> i burned it at 8x
[05:42] <iami89> very slow
[05:42] <weardlan> edgy is bust, liveCD wont boot on many MBs (particularly laptops)
[05:42] <variant> iami89: does it boot witht he cd that you used to isntall with?
[05:42] <variant> weardlan: works 100% here
[05:42] <iami89> yes
[05:42] <wastrel> use the alternate CD instead
[05:42] <weardlan> so what, works 0% here
[05:42] <variant> iami89: then the cd you have is bust
[05:43] <sharperguy> i coulndt get it to brun etiher so i bought a cd from <advertising removed>

[05:46] <chuckyp> I've converted an avi to a mpeg2 file using avidemux now I just need to know how to burn it to a dvd.  I tried following someones instructions just buring the file to the dvd and its there however my dvd player won't play it.
[05:47] <chuckyp> Is there a program to create the vob tos etc... for the dvd?
[05:47] <defrysk> chuckyp, install dvdauthor
[05:47] <chuckyp> defrysk, k
[05:47] <variant> chuckyp: dvdauthor

[05:48] <chuckyp> Tompu, You are the one who said burning the mepg would work?  I was busy doing other stuff to read all of what you said.
[05:48] <defrysk> easyest way to set it up fore dvd (without menu) I can give your chuckyp
[05:48] <weardlan> and there are others
[05:48] <axisys_> weardlan: is there other way to verify what tty my serialport is map to?
[05:48] <Tompu> chuckyp: I said it'd work with most new dvd players. and it does. i do it regularly enough. but qdvdauthor works well for 'real' dvd's
[05:48] <weardlan> axisys_i: I have no idea what your talking about
[05:48] <defrysk> dvdauthor -o /dvd <dvdmpg>
[05:49] <grndslm> how can i tell if a patch i need was included in an ubuntu specific version??  after apt-get source-ing??
[05:49] <defrysk> try that chuck
[05:49] <wastrel> axisys_:  weardlan is complaining about bugs in edgy, not helping you out.  his google suggestion wasn't related to your problem.

[05:50] <defrysk> chuckyp, did that work ?
[05:50] <chuckyp> Tompu, it could be that the file did not have a .mpeg extension dunno if that matters for the dvd players or not.

[05:51] <preaction> chuckyp, Video DVDs are a file system containing folders called AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS containing (the important file) Vobs. you can't just put any file on a DVD and expect it to work
[05:51] <axisys_> i have system connected to my laptop's serial port.. i could access it w/ dapper and now w/ edgy not working any more
[05:51] <chuckyp> preaction, according to Tompu you can.
[05:51] <axisys_> i use minicom to access
[05:52] <chuckyp> defrysk, I have it installed just trying to figure out how to use it now.
[05:52] <defrysk> chuckyp, it can be done on the cli very fast and almost automated
[05:52] <netpython> !gtkterm
[05:52] <chuckyp> k
[05:52] <preaction> chuckyp, because Tompu assumed you had a bleeding-edge DVD player capable of understanding and interpreting arbitrary video codecs, not the MPEG-2 that is the DVD standard

[05:53] <chuckyp> preaction, it is an mpeg2 file
[05:53] <Tompu> preaction: I did point out that it only works with newer players. I dont appreciate your ingratitude, chuckyp
[05:53] <axisys_> netpython: was it a response to mine?
[05:53] <netpython> y
[05:53] <poopybutt> can i get ff 2.0 with apt-get?
[05:53] <preaction> chuckyp, but it's not a Vob. it must be exactly as the DVD specification says, and there are programs to do it

[05:55] <defrysk> chuckyp, dvdauthor -o dvd/ -T
[05:55] <defrysk> that should be sorry
[05:55] <kitche> preaction: I have a dvd player that can play avi's

[05:56] <defrysk> chuckyp, the second files them
[05:56] <chuckyp> defrysk, and the growisofs?
[05:56] <defrysk> chuckyp, in this way you can put more then one movie in the /dvd folder
[05:56] <netpython> Tjoels, what are the file permissions,did you use sudo?
[05:56] <defrysk> chuckyp, tha growisofs burns it for you on dvd
[05:56] <preaction> growisofs makes the ISO filesystem for DVDs (ISO9660)
[05:57] <Tjoels> netpython, oh, maybe that's the problem ;)
[05:57] <defrysk> chuckyp, if its a rewritable it automaticly wipes it befor burning
[05:57] <netpython> Tjoels, you never know:-)
[05:58] <axisys_> netpython: would u know how do I find the serial port device I can find out ?

[06:02] <netpython> Tjoels, you might try this cp -R /../.. /.../...
[06:02] <netpython> -R for recursive
[06:02] <Phaqui> how come my UI is so slow?
[06:02] <Tharkun> I have installed xubuntu 6.06 and was upgrading via the CD image to 6.10 and it seemed to hang after a while and I got frustrated with it and unplugged the PC is that a bug or was I just not patient enough?
[06:02] <Tjoels> netpython, ok. thanks
[06:02] <Phaqui> firefox is slow, amsn
[06:02] <iqon> Tompu, edgy's not that bad is it?
[06:02] <netpython> Tjoels, welcome
[06:03] <protocol1> Phaqui.maybe you should get your 3d acceleration running?
[06:03] <Tompu> iqon: i dont think so, but hang around in here for a couple of hours and you might change your mind
[06:03] <Phaqui> yea, but how
[06:03] <Phaqui> ?
[06:03] <protocol1> whats the latest edgy kernel?
[06:03] <protocol1> and how do I go about installing it from the console?
[06:03] <mc__> protocol1: 2.6.17
[06:03] <nonnis> Oh thanks guys, and Im just using 7 so ill be ok thanks

[06:04] <grndslm> if i download the lvm userspace tarball and make install it....will it automaticaly update from version 2.02.06 to 2.02.13??
[06:04] <preaction> iqon, Tompu, I had no problem installing xubuntu edgy on my own computer, but no end of problems installing it on my friend's computer, ymmv
[06:04] <protocol1> mc__, do you know how I can install the latest one from the console?
[06:04] <axisys_> netpython: but if i choose wrong device for terminal it wont give u any output correct?
[06:04] <protocol1> for a centrino?
[06:04] <LinuxHelp> How does one change the "Preferred Application" in Gnome for .mp3 files, from Totem to XMMS?
[06:04] <axisys_> netpython: by default i see it picks /dev/ttyS0
[06:04] <netpython> axisys_, yep
[06:05] <netpython> com1
[06:05] <mc__> has someone got enemy territory running on edgy? it complains about glibc
[06:05] <tabias> I've succesfully installed tvtime and bttv and I got television, BUT no audio. Not even when I plug in my sound directly in the tv-card (bt878) someone can help me?
[06:06] <protocol1> is there a 686 version kernel for edgy?
[06:06] <Tjoels> netpython: err, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30456/
[06:06] <axisys_> netpython: i had it on ttyS2.. i changed it back to ttyS0
[06:06] <axisys_> netpython: its working now
[06:06] <mc__> protocol1: apt-cache search
[06:07] <a_l_e> which package do i have to install to compile software against the alsalibs? i haven't found a libalsa-dev package :-((
[06:07] <preaction> tabias, open your sound mixer and see if the correct input is selected
[06:07] <ifireball> protocol1: it seems they decided to drop architecture flavoring in edgy
[06:07] <grndslm> LinuxHelp, open nautilus and right click an mp3 file.....go to Properties --> Open With...select XMMS, and you're done
[06:07] <protocol1> ok cool
[06:07] <netpython> axisys_, cool :-)
[06:07] <tabias> the input is set to line-in, where the cable is plugged in
[06:07] <protocol1> i'll stick with i386
[06:08] <Skyrail> anyone know why flash doesn't fully work on ubuntu 6.06?
[06:08] <nonnis> I have a "storage" partition in ext3, currently "empty" but still using some space. Can i do like this "tune2fs -m 1 /dev/hda7" to free up that space?
[06:08] <ifireball> protocol1: afaik "generic" is waht you need in Edgy, the rest are dummy packages
[06:08] <preaction> Skyrail, because it's flash 7, and linux has no flash 8
[06:08] <c_lisp> home!
[06:08] <protocol1> i will stay with what I got
[06:09] <protocol1> dont want to complicate things for myself
[06:09] <Skyrail> oh...I wish people didn't make flash for the newest of the new, there are still thousands without the newest versions :(
[06:09] <gordonjcp> hello
[06:09] <nonnis> skyrail: you could try the beta
[06:09] <tabias> it is like the audio isn't getting decoded
[06:09] <Tompu> Skyrail: most versions of flash will ask you to update on winblows
[06:09] <Unimatrix9> Skyrail - what does not work?
[06:10] <netpython> Tjoels, press the tab key after cp -R /home/../.mozilla
=== TC1 is now known as TC`
[06:10] <tabias> altho the volume in tvtime doesn't seem to increace (still 0)
[06:10] <overridex-laptop> anyone else's swap get disabled after hibernating on edgy?
[06:11] <brenlae> how do i use xmms to play an audio cd?
[06:11] <Unimatrix9> xmms cd plugin
[06:11] <Skyrail> Unimatrix9: some videos on youtube and something on another site which looks like its off myspace
[06:11] <Skyrail> oh and radioblogclub doesn't work for me fully either
[06:11] <TC`> ifireball answer me
[06:11] <Tjoels> netpython, then it sais like "Display all 2277 possibilities? (y or n)"
[06:12] <Skyrail> Tompu: eh?
[06:12] <netpython> Tjoels, press no
[06:12] <Unimatrix9> Skyrail, wich version of ubuntu, and wich browser?
[06:12] <Agrajag> Skyrail: there's a flash 9 beta version available
[06:12] <nonnis> skyrail: There is flash9 beta, for me it works better then flash7
[06:12] <Tjoels> oh

[06:13] <Unimatrix9> ah, you are faster..
[06:13] <Tjoels> netpython, should it then have made the symbolic link?
[06:14] <Unimatrix9> but i dont think that thats the problem on your system,,,
[06:14] <defrysk> Brp!
[06:14] <netpython> nah
[06:14] <barnetod> i bet you guys memorized that :)
[06:14] <Skyrail> lol ok thanks people, I'll give that a try and hopefully it works, ah I don't want to switch back to windows for anything other then gaming. Also does anyone know if PSP X or PSP XI work with Wine?

[06:14] <Brio> anyone can tell me what this means.. --prefix=your_gnome_prefix   ?????
[06:14] <Tjoels> netpython, why does it make this error?
[06:14] <netpython> Tjoels, place a slash forward "/" after .mozilla
[06:14] <Unimatrix9> becuase i would have noticed, since i run the same system
[06:15] <Tjoels> netpython: oh, ok :D
[06:15] <kitche> Byan: why did you CTCP version the whole channel?
[06:15] <Byan> kitche: see, what people are using
[06:15] <Brio> what does your_gnome_prefix   mean ?
[06:15] <kyja> I would like to stream various video media from a web server for private inhome network use. any ideas?
[06:15] <Skyrail> Unimatrix9: do you use radioblogclub? or myspace videos?
[06:15] <barnetod> anyone use anjuta or other c ide environments?
[06:15] <Byan> err, take off that comma
[06:16] <Brio> anyone can tell me what this means.. --prefix=your_gnome_prefix   ?????
[06:16] <Unimatrix9> youtube runs fine over here
[06:16] <Byan> turns out almost everyone is using either X-chat or irssi
[06:16] <Tjoels> netpython: it still does the same error.
[06:16] <netpython> Tjoels, f!#!@ :-)
[06:16] <Brio> anyone can tell me what this means.. --prefix=your_gnome_prefix   ?????
[06:17] <Unimatrix9> Skyrail, for some issue's whith sites that dont work i use the rather funny http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
[06:17] <Tjoels> netpython, i think it' like one file or so that it won't copy
[06:17] <kkrusty> can i install kubuntu from the cd image without having to burn it?
[06:17] <Unimatrix9> yes internet explorer..on rare occasions...
[06:17] <kkrusty> kubuntu edgy that  is
[06:17] <Brio> where should I ask for help?
[06:17] <netpython> Tjoels, yes i thought so too
[06:17] <Tjoels> netpython, isn't there an argument for copying symbolic links too or something?
[06:18] <Brio> WHERE should I go to ask  for help?
[06:18] <netpython> Tjoels, and the same but now copied to /tmp
[06:18] <barnetod> brio ubuntuforums.org????
[06:18] <Akuma_> anyone knows why i'm able to boot an x86 cd but not an x64? i'm on amd turion 64

[06:18] <Brio> ok
[06:18] <barnetod> bad burn?
[06:18] <Tjoels>  netpython, what did you mean by that last thing you said. i didn't understand it.
[06:18] <lilgg> is this the right channel for support on ubuntu powerpc?
[06:18] <Unimatrix9> ah , ok
[06:19] <Akuma_> barnetod: nop, i tried two different copies
[06:19] <kkrusty> nevermind i found it on google
[06:19] <netpython> instead of copying to yout lacie nas copying to /tmp dir
[06:19] <chrmm> Does anyone feel like helping a noob?
[06:19] <barnetod> did you verify the data?
[06:19] <Skyrail> Unimatrix9: oh thanks for that I do some web development and I need to view it in IE aswell :D
[06:19] <Unimatrix9> chrmm state the nature of your problem
[06:19] <barnetod> might be a bad cluster in there

[06:20] <kkrusty> chrmm: only another noob :)
[06:20] <chrmm> Unimatrix9: I cant seem to find the partition Windows is installed on... Using Drapper
[06:20] <chrmm> How do i get it to show?
[06:20] <Tompu> chrmm: maybe you got lucky wrote over it
[06:20] <Unimatrix9> Skyrail, if you have an powerfull pc, you could consider to install vmware , and run an virtual "you know what" operating system...
[06:20] <barnetod> use konqueror
[06:20] <barnetod> :)
[06:20] <Skyrail> Unimatrix9: to see if it is another problem do you mind checking this site out for me to see if the flash video at the bottom works?
[06:21] <Unimatrix9> sure..
[06:21] <barnetod> sky whats the url
[06:21] <barnetod> im in windows right now

[06:24] <Tjoels> netpython: what did you mean with "and the same but now copied to /tmp"
[06:24] <preaction> kkrusty, you have to burn the CD then
[06:24] <preaction> kkrusty, or you could order one from canonical
[06:24] <netpython> Tjoels, if you Use -R cp doesn't preserve symbolic links, so we have to use -aR :-)
[06:25] <paradizelost> howdy all, i'm having trouble getting flash to work in FF2 on edgy
[06:25] <kkrusty> preaction: that will take ages
[06:25] <paradizelost> anyone have some guidance?

[06:26] <paradizelost> and the instructions don't work
[06:27] <defrysk> paradizelost, do you have multiverse universe in your sources.list ?

[06:31] <Unimatrix9> chrmm where are you?
[06:31] <preaction> kkrusty, how are you going to get your computer to boot from the smb share?
[06:31] <defrysk> paradizelost, just make sure to accept download and licence during install of flash
[06:31] <stewski> are there any work arounds for this audio issue?
[06:31] <preaction> kkrusty, you're telling me you don't have a cd burner? even at 4x takes only 20 or so minutes
[06:31] <defrysk> paradizelost, probably you missed that

[06:32] <barnetod> know anyone with a burner?
[06:33] <plato`> is there anyone here who have tried to change ntfs to ntfs-3g?
[06:33] <kkrusty> barnetod: i have a burner but no cd
[06:33] <stewski> so you have incorrect speed audio

[06:35] <Unimatrix9> chrmm, fat32 or ntfs?
[06:35] <Bardamu> netpython:  ?
[06:35] <jstarcher> preaction: hmmm wonder what would be using it. I just mounted it for 5 seconds and because I realized I need to remount it with permissions to the user
[06:35] <iqon> i thought suggested packages weren't required
[06:35] <yohskar> someone can help me with environment variables?
[06:35] <kkrusty> preaction, barnetod: i was just wondering whether i could do all that without having to burn the cd
[06:35] <chrmm> Unimatrix9, It doesnt say
[06:35] <preaction> kkrusty, not from a fresh first linux install, it'd be possible to finagle it from another linux install though

[06:38] <Tjoels> netpython, good idea.. but it's annoying that cp won't just copy everything and preserve it's state.......
[06:38] <Tompu> LjL: thanks, i'll take a look
[06:38] <preaction> kkrusty, usually it means your computer boots from a floppy disk or bootable CD containing minimal software, and installs most of the software from the internet
[06:38] <Falstius> how do you set up a swap file (not a swap partition)?
[06:39] <preaction> kkrusty, you can find "business-card CD" network installers, those CDs that are cut in the shape of credit-cards, or the mini-cd thingys

[06:40] <chrmm> Unimatrix9: well, I used the alternate installation CD for drapper....
[06:41] <Unimatrix9> chrmm, you get an long list, in there you should pay attention to hda, and sda ...
[06:41] <kkrusty> preaction: ow well ubuntu will have to wait for tomorrow. thanks for the help though.
[06:41] <Tjoels> netpython: oooooooooooooh, it was because it was a broken link!!
[06:41] <Unimatrix9> chrmm, some will be the cdrom/dvd drives, and others should show your harddrive...

[06:44] <Blacken> Can anyone point me in the right direction? I'm getting "not a block device" errors, which are a bit weird...

[06:46] <KTurbo> I just bought a pc with ubuntu on it. And I wanna know how to make a new user, since I can't login. I have the root + password.
[06:46] <Unimatrix9> chrmm,  what type , as in brand ..dell/etc?
[06:47] <KTurbo> I tried to "adduser" but that doesn't work when I try to login
[06:47] <chrmm> Unimatrix9: FSC Amilo m1437g
[06:47] <KTurbo> Compac? Coould that be it.
[06:47] <georgeb> Blacken: what command do you run when you get not a block device ?
[06:47] <Lynoure> KTurbo: sudo adduser ?
[06:47] <KillerDemon> compaq is dead allready
[06:47] <KTurbo> yes, tried that

[06:48] <barnetod> are there good statistics programs for ubuntu?
[06:48] <Blacken> georgeb: Uh, let's go with "any". I've tried sd0, sda, sda3...
[06:48] <KTurbo> god damn, I hate command-line inviorment.
[06:48] <nonnis> Ive got serious issues with grub. Error18 on boot after fresh ubuntu install and now i can t use XP nor Ubuntu. Anyone can help me?
[06:48] <chrmm> How do I remove the "Shift+Backspace"shortcut btw?? I log out all the time
[06:48] <dvheumen> guys, I've got a very strange problem which may be hardware related, but I'd like some help from someone to point me to the correct log files...
[06:49] <georgeb> Blacken: hmm.. you are in livecd ?
[06:49] <Lynoure> KTurbo: does not work how? if it complains about the password you were given, it might be best to ask the people who sold it to you... or boot with a cd and go change it :)
[06:49] <_azrael> !ask > dvheumen
[06:49] <Blacken> georgeb: Right; I've chrooted into my box.
[06:49] <KTurbo> Well.
[06:49] <Blacken> er, partition...sorry, just woke up
[06:49] <KTurbo> He gave me his login and pass but it didn't work
[06:49] <KTurbo> and I do not have a cd here.
[06:49] <barnetod> nonnis hold on :)
[06:49] <Lynoure> KTurbo: call him?
[06:49] <barnetod> i may have something for you
[06:50] <georgeb> Blacken: you have a sata hard drive or ide ?
[06:50] <fdoving> chrmm: edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf Search for and find 'ServerLayout' In that section, add: Option "DontZap" "true"
[06:50] <KTurbo> I send him some mess. and he told me his password and login but I just can't login.
[06:50] <KTurbo> sent*
[06:50] <georgeb> Blacken: if sata, then grub-install --root-directory=/boot/ /dev/sda should work
[06:50] <Blacken> georgeb: SATA, hence the "sd". =)
[06:50] <Unimatrix9> chrmm, you will need to do an reading on your laptop and support of linux on it, you have got an sata drive in this version, and might have to go for an long search for solutions..
[06:50] <barnetod> 18 : Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS. This error is returned when a read is attempted at a linear block address beyond the end of the BIOS translated area. This generally happens if your disk is larger than the BIOS can handle (512MB for (E)IDE disks on older machines or larger than 8GB in general).
[06:50] <nonnis> barnetod: oh thanks you so much, I only found 1 post about it in the forums i have no idea what it is
[06:51] <Lynoure> KTurbo: you are a paying customer to him. But you can also choose the Recovery mode from the grup menu and change the password through that
[06:51] <barnetod> nonnis  Try an update for your BIOS and/or move your boot partition to the front (or at least into the appropriate range).
[06:51] <KTurbo> I have the root pass atleast, thing is I'm not really good at linux.
[06:51] <Blacken> georgeb: Nope, and I just figured out why. There's no /dev when you're in a chroot.
[06:51] <KTurbo> No, I am not.
[06:51] <chrmm> Unimatrix9: Thanks for the try then! :)
[06:51] <dvheumen> I've got an Ubuntu 6.06 linux PC ... it's running now for a few weeks and I haven't noticed any strange behaviour, except... Sometimes when I come home from school, the PC is on but all LEDs (Power + HDD) are off and I doesn't repond to anything.
[06:51] <chrmm> fdoving: Tnx! :)
[06:51] <nonnis> barnetod but I have winXP on the first partition
[06:51] <georgeb> Blacken: depends on how you mount the partitions;
[06:51] <dvheumen> The problem is that this occured 3 times in the 2 or 3 weeks I'm running Ubuntu now
[06:51] <Tompu> dvheumen: hibernation?
[06:51] <KTurbo> I can make a user I just don't know what I am doing while I'm doing it. :P
[06:52] <barnetod> you did a fresh install right?
[06:52] <dvheumen> Tompu:  how can i check that?
[06:52] <KTurbo> password and such
[06:52] <barnetod> did you install windows xp first?
[06:52] <dvheumen> I didn't initialize hibernation myself
[06:52] <georgeb> Blacken: I think you could also install grub without chroot
[06:52] <Tompu> dvheumen: hibernate the system (and leave it for ten minutes or so) and then come back and see if it's how you described
[06:52] <TC`> is there a program like "nassi" to talk, send files ect.. in LAN?
[06:52] <yohskar> why bash environment variables are diferent depending i'm in a text console or desktop xterm
[06:52] <nonnis> barnetod: Yes ubuntu, XP on the first partition worked without problem before ubuntu install
[06:52] <yohskar> ?
[06:52] <TC`> for ubuntu and for win?
[06:52] <Unimatrix9> chrmm,  http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=363325
[06:52] <dvheumen> Tompu:  it occurs most times after at least 2 days
[06:52] <Unimatrix9> for the first reading...
[06:53] <ifireball> yohskar: because a lot more scripts get to run and setup your environment when you login to a graphical desktop
[06:53] <Tompu> dvheumen: well, if you're sure it isnt hibernation, try looking through your log files to see if you can see what caused it
[06:53] <Unimatrix9> chrmm,  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79127
[06:53] <Lynoure> KTurbo: man adduser , then just add one for yourself and add it to /etc/sudoers mimicing the limes already there.
[06:53] <KTurbo> I just wanna get into the graphical user interface then I'm alright, I could simply just manager the users there
[06:54] <dvheumen> Tompu: yeah I figured that the log files should show me something, but I can't find anything... what log file should I look at?
[06:54] <KTurbo> well, how do I change password?
[06:54] <kkrusty> preaction: sorry but this was too hard to resist. I have got some old ubuntu 4.10 and 5.04 cds (live and installer) with me
[06:54] <Unimatrix9> chrmm,  sorry i could not be of more help...you can try asking here again.,, good luck :)
[06:54] <Falstius> KTurbo: passwd <username>
[06:54] <kkrusty> preaction: now what can i do?
[06:54] <yohskar> oh, and which file i should modify to set an environment variable for mine desktop xterm?
[06:54] <Lynoure> KTurbo: a well installed ubuntu shoul put you into graphical environment by default...
[06:55] <Skyrail> Agrajag: hey are you there?
=== LaCReMeL|afk is now known as LaCReMeL
[06:55] <KTurbo> yeah, I just need a login to get into it. :P
[06:55] <Agrajag> Skyrail: no
[06:55] <KTurbo> so I type: sudo useradd [NAME] /etc/sudoers?
[06:55] <Skyrail> Agrajag: ok :D wait a minute sorry I think I may have foiund an answer
[06:55] <Falstius> yohskar: ~/.bashrc should set environment variables for both xterm and the console (assuming you haven't changed your shell to something else)
[06:55] <ifireball> is there a nich gui (not swat) to do smbpasswd, its a shame the way Sys->admin->Share doesn't "just work" because they forgot about this...
[06:55] <Agrajag> Skyrail: ok
[06:55] <magickal1> Does anyone have any information on the possible cause or even better the solution to the random system lockups that seem to be plaguing quite a few people in the edgy upgrade?
[06:55] <SupremacyGnu> Hello! Does aoss work with Teamspeak to use both Teamspeak and then play games and hear the sound from both of them? I can't get it to work... or do I really need two soundcards? Thanks
[06:55] <nonnis> barnetod: I had XP and from there I fixed a partition for ubuntu (partition magic). And after installation of ubuntu I cant use either window nor ubuntu.
[06:55] <Tompu> dvheumen: /var/log/messages and /var/log/dmesg.0 if it's there
[06:55] <preaction> kkrusty, you can install one of them, and once it's installed you can try to do an apt-get dist-upgrade (but i wouldn't recommend it)
[06:56] <Skyrail> Agrajag: actually maybe not, do you use flash 9?
[06:56] <yohskar> falstius, i will tried
[06:56] <preaction> kkrusty, but it would be good practice, AND you'd get a taste of ubuntu (with Edgy being the main course when you buy a burnable CD)
[06:56] <dvheumen> Tompu: k, was looking at debug and debug.0 at the moment, but they don't show anything useful AFAICT
[06:56] <alecjw> is there any bulk file ranmeer for gnome?
[06:56] <Lynoure> KTurbo: if you can do sudo, you should already be able to log in x with that very password you use with sudo
[06:56] <alecjw> *renamer
[06:56] <kkrusty> preaction: so i cant update from the cd image that i downloaded?
[06:56] <Agrajag> Skyrail: yes
[06:56] <ifireball> alecjw: the command-line :P
[06:56] <tsoler> hey guys
[06:57] <magickal1> alecjw,  thats something you would do in a bash script using sed/awk
[06:57] <Skyrail> Agrajag: do you have any audio problems?
[06:57] <Agrajag> Skyrail: nope
[06:57] <tsoler> how do i get to this folder ~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/GoogleSearch.wsdl
[06:57] <tsoler> :(
[06:57] <preaction> kkrusty, yes, you can, i just wouldn't recommend it
[06:57] <KTurbo> I don't know what I use with sudo? I just use the root and password. You know I have no idea what I'm doing really.
[06:57] <KTurbo> If I try to login to X with root it says it can
[06:57] <KTurbo> can't
[06:57] <Dimensions> Hiya ... i have just installed ubuntu and then installed xp as dual boot ... but i dont get any grup or select option for ubuntu ... instead it directly goes to xp ... what to do ?
[06:57] <Lynoure> tsoler: cd ~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/ I bet the rest of it is a file not a folder
[06:57] <alecjw> ifireball and magickal1: i hav about 100 files to renam, i want to call them photo 001, photo 002, photo 003 etc.
[06:58] <preaction> kkrusty, i believe it's apt-get dist-upgrade. or there are instructions for pointing your apt repositories to Edgy
[06:58] <dvheumen> Tompu: I have found a curious reference in 'messages'. It says: 'syslogd 1.4.1#17ubuntu7: restart.'
[06:58] <Unimatrix9> Skyrail do you use alsa as sound system?
[06:58] <Skyrail> Agrajag: hmm ok, its just that when I open something that requires flash its ok for about 30 seconds or so and then the audio just crashes and repeats the same little bit over and over again...
[06:58] <Unimatrix9> flash depends on that...
[06:58] <kkrusty> preaction: and what are the reasons for not recommending it?
[06:58] <ifireball> alecjw: and how are they called now?
[06:58] <preaction> kkrusty, because it might not work right the first time, and then you're left trying to fix a mess
[06:58] <Skyrail> er...I don't know, I'm pretty much new with linux so you might have to explain a bit further
[06:58] <magickal1> alecjw, SOrry mate Im not going to write a script for you   but there are many out here   google for it  you will be pleased
[06:58] <tsoler> Lynoure : what is thi sign for ~  ???
[06:59] <KTurbo> so I type: sudo useradd [NAME] /etc/sudoers?  <<----------- is that right?
[06:59] <Agrajag> Skyrail: don't know what to tell you, flash is still beta, could be a bug in that, or your sound drivers
[06:59] <Tompu> dvheumen: that's the log daemon starting
[06:59] <KTurbo> Then I typ passwd <username>
[06:59] <georgeb> Blacken: did it work ?
[06:59] <alecjw> ifireball: they are called DSCF0563, DSCF0564 etc. i'm sure there's a graphical way of doing this
[06:59] <Tompu> KTurbo: that's wrong.
[06:59] <xordali> why i can't start kde (xserver) http://paste.debian.net/16212
[06:59] <KTurbo> yeah?
[07:00] <Lynoure> KTurbo: No, useradd [NAME]  if you are in as a root is enough
[07:00] <Skyrail> Agrajag: hmm, ok thats the problem, its still in beta...well I'll have to wait until it drops out of beta, any idea how long that will be?
[07:00] <Lynoure> tsoler: that's called tilde
[07:00] <KTurbo> good.
[07:00] <dvheumen> Tompu: k, do you know anything about '-- MARK --' ? because I have never seen that? It repeats every 20 minutes
[07:00] <ifireball> alecjw: nope, GUIs are pretty much useless in this cases of power-use, you can't design a GUI strong enough
[07:00] <Lynoure> tsoler: it marks the home of the current user
[07:00] <tsoler> can i find this folder manually not but changing dir please?
[07:00] <ifireball> alecjw: so basically you want to remove the "DSCF" ?
[07:00] <Lynoure> tsoler: so probably /home/tsoler/.gnome and so on
[07:00] <Tompu> dvheumen: I'm not sure what its purpose is. it's normal though
[07:01] <Blacken> georgeb: Yeah, worked fine, thanks.
[07:01] <boggle> dvheumen: it's there so you know that logging is still working
[07:01] <Tompu> dvheumen: timestamp perhaps
[07:01] <KTurbo> I'll try that now, bbl
[07:01] <georgeb> alecjw: for images you can use gwenview; it has a batch rename function and I think it does exactly what you want; install gwenvie and in Plugins -> Batch Processing -> Rename images
[07:01] <finalbeta> Is it possible to have system wide equalization?
[07:01] <alecjw> ifireball: yes, but i ant to replace it with somethig like Photo  instead and make the numbers start from 0
[07:01] <Agrajag> Skyrail: no clue, don't know if that's where your problem lies either. Anyway, meeting time.
[07:01] <tsoler> so  ~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/GoogleSearch.wsdl  is for home/tsoler/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/GoogleSearch.wsdl ???
[07:01] <kkrusty> preaction: i wonder if theres something i could do with the live cds then
[07:02] <Lynoure> tsoler: almost, for /home/tsoler/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/GoogleSearch.wsdl  if your user is tsoler
[07:02] <Dimensions>  Hiya ... i have just installed ubuntu and then installed xp as dual boot ... but i dont get any grup or select option for ubuntu ... instead it directly goes to xp ... what to do ?
[07:02] <Lynoure> tsoler: the beginning / is very important
[07:02] <yohskar> Ifirebal, Falstius, many thanks, i've modified .bash_profile but didn't work, modifying .bashrc i get my environment variable
[07:02] <Skyrail> Agrajag: er ok
[07:02] <dvheumen> Tompu: k, the only other thing I see in the log is: 'Nov  6 17:51:24 pegasus kernel: [17446627.716000]  skge eth1: Link is down.' and the next message about 'link up' ... but that's normal because I've got a crosslink connection to my other PC... Is Linux maybe reacting to this down-up behaviour?
[07:02] <ifireball> alecjw: yeah impossible with a GUI, and rateh coplex with a script, I suppse I can one-line it though, gimme a moment (I'm too nice...)
[07:02] <Gwildor> Dimensions, you will need to re-isntall grub.....always install windows THEN linux...
[07:02] <Dimensions> Gwildor:  how do i reinstall grub ?
[07:03] <Gwildor> Dimensions, i recommend, jstu re-isntall ubuntu
[07:03] <Tompu> dvheumen: i dont think that's the source of your problem
[07:03] <alecjw> ifireball: i think its soreted noww. georgeb's pointed me in the right driection
[07:03] <alecjw> thanks georgeb
[07:03] <tsoler> lynoure: how comes that i cannot find this folder in my home directory??
[07:03] <Tompu> dvheumen: next time it happens,
[07:03] <Daro> !shockwave
[07:03] <ubotu> Shockwave is currently only available for Windows. To run it under !Wine, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave
[07:03] <Tompu> dvheumen: look at the end of each log
[07:03] <Dimensions> Gwildor:  i remember doing same thing once before when my windows got crashed i installed it again and then i had done something in there but dont really remember ...
[07:03] <tsoler> .gnome2 doesnot apears
[07:04] <Lynoure> tsoler: where did you get that location anyway?
[07:04] <Tompu> dvheumen: I can't really suggest anything else unless you have more information
[07:04] <Daro> !explorer
[07:04] <Gwildor> Dimensions, 1 sec
[07:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about explorer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:04] <ifireball> alecjw: you're luckey, someone bothered making a GUI for exactly what you want...

[07:05] <dannis_> O.K.
[07:05] <dannis_> GRACIAS SOY UN NEWBIES
[07:05] <tsoler> not on my computer but on google results it does
[07:05] <ompaul> KTurbo, sudo passwd username
[07:06] <dannis_> #UBUNUT-ES
[07:06] <KTurbo> so I type: sudo passwd username... and then?
[07:06] <ompaul> KTurbo, do the password change for that user
[07:06] <Tompu> tsoler, are you sure deskbar supports live google search? i see a live yahoo plugin
[07:06] <Skyrail> Anyone know where there is a large range of linux fonts I can download?
[07:06] <KTurbo> ok, so it asks me for it.
[07:06] <KTurbo> thanks I'll try that
[07:06] <dvheumen> Tompu:  I understand, I'm looking at dmesg at the moment but it doesn't look like it offers any useful information either
[07:07] <Lynoure> tsoler: well, I do not even know what page you are looking at...
[07:07] <tsoler> its like the suggestions options on firefox
[07:07] <dannis_> #UBUNTU-ES
[07:07] <Tompu> dvheumen: dmesg only shows information relevant to this boot
[07:07] <phenex> upgrade from dapper to edgy - no sound. i hear my mic, but can't play music or record... what's the problem?
[07:07] <ifireball> Skyrail: linux can use truetype fonts, so I guess you could use any windows fonts website
[07:07] <ompaul> dannis,    /join #ubuntu-ed
[07:07] <ompaul> dannis,    /join #ubuntu-es
[07:07] <Tompu> dannis_ try /join #ubuntu-es
[07:07] <tsoler> deskbar is an option for ubuntus panel
[07:07] <dannis_> o.k.
[07:08] <Skyrail> ifireball: ok I'll look into it :) its just that some of the links from the wiki aren't loading :(
[07:08] <tsoler> it adds different searcing options
[07:08] <ompaul> KTurbo, it asks for your password first then you give the new one for the user in question
[07:08] <dvheumen> Tompu: I do have a distributed.net client running on this pc... could it be possible that linux reboots because of a process that's continuously eating away cpu power?
[07:08] <tsoler> it does a google search, but if you want suggestion you need to add this file to the folder that i cannot find
[07:09] <Dimensions> Thanks Gwildor
[07:09] <jstarcher> argh, can someone help me with mount permissions please?
[07:09] <Gwildor> Dimensions, NP
[07:09] <Tompu> dvheumen: userspace apps shouldnt be able to do that :)
[07:09] <vostorga> mmm there is more people here than #debian
[07:09] <tsoler> lynoyre : try add to panel>deskbar
[07:09] <Greyscale> Question: Can I use a Debian netinstaller to install ubuntu from a repo?
[07:10] <Gwildor> Greyscale, its possible, sure.....not sure how well it would work, though
[07:10] <dvheumen> Tompu: I was actually referring to something like selinux checking for this sort of behaviour...
[07:10] <Greyscale> hmm
[07:10] <jstarcher> I try $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/flash -o gpid=1000 and it mounts fine but I still can't write to it unless I'm root
[07:10] <jstarcher> why?
[07:10] <Greyscale> we need a netinstaller CD
[07:10] <KTurbo> ok great :D
[07:10] <KTurbo> Now
[07:10] <KTurbo> How do I make a home catalog?
[07:10] <ifireball> Skyrail: here is a tip that seems to be not well documented, and not dumbed down in Ubunto: to install fonts go into "fonts:" in nautilus and drag the ttf files in there
[07:10] <Lynoure> tsoler: Sorry, I'm on kubuntu
[07:11] <barnetod> dude my college sucks
[07:11] <tsoler> its an all in one action bar
[07:11] <Tinned_Tuna> heya
[07:12] <tsoler> runs terminal , and aplies searces to folders files and the internet through predifined search engines
[07:12] <Tompu> tsoler, did you install a google live search plugin for deskbar?
[07:12] <jstarcher> I try $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/flash -o gpid=1000 and it mounts fine but I still can't write to it unless I'm root
[07:12] <Tinned_Tuna> what's the likley hood of getting M$ Orofice 2K3 Basic Edition running under Wine?
[07:12] <tsoler> im trying
[07:12] <tsoler> cant find the proper folder
[07:12] <KTurbo> How do I make a home catalog? sry ;)
[07:12] <Lynoure> KTurbo: What's a home catalog? Do you mean something related to real estate or home directory?
[07:12] <haakonn> i really can't get flash to work in edgy. it worked in dapper, but after the upgrade, it just crashes firefox/mozilla. how exactly do i get flash to work? any hints?
[07:12] <barnetod> why run it if you have open office tinned tuna?
[07:12] <plod> whats the name of the partitioner that used to be in the non gui install
[07:12] <Tompu> tsoler: give me a link to the plugin, i'll sort you out ;)
[07:12] <Tinned_Tuna> tsoler: you talking about Wine?
[07:12] <KTurbo> home directory
[07:12] <KTurbo> same thing. ;)
[07:12] <Tompu> Tinned_Tuna: no :)
[07:12] <oangefly> can anyone help setting up groups in ubuntu server....???....

[07:13] <NET||abuse> hey does anyone know what ports i need to forward to connect to my exchange server with putty??
[07:13] <phenex> upgrade from dapper to edgy - no sound. i hear my mic, but can't play music or record... any idea what can cause this?
[07:13] <FlyingSquirrel32>  I did an apt-get upgrade and now sendmail won't start. It just hangs. Googling the prob. didn't help. Any help?
[07:13] <bthibault> anybody else having problems with FF 2.0 and Java?
[07:13] <NET||abuse> i have a linux box with ssh mapped to it inside my network, i'm stuck out on site and urgently need my email...
[07:13] <haakonn> java works, but flash won't
[07:13] <jstarcher> I try $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/flash -o gpid=1000 and it mounts fine but I still can't write to it unless I'm root
[07:13] <jstarcher> I try $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/flash -o gpid=1000 and it mounts fine but I still can't write to it unless I'm root
[07:13] <NET||abuse> really really stuck here...
[07:13] <Tinned_Tuna> NET||abuse: I believe the ssh flag is -D<port no>
[07:13] <jstarcher> no one?
[07:13] <Skorgu|Work> hey, I'm trying to install from the amd64 alternate cd and the boot hangs at libata initialization, anyone seen this?
[07:13] <bthibault> i got flash working, but no java
[07:14] <Tinned_Tuna> then config ur mail client to use that port
[07:14] <tsoler> tompu:  go to google acounts get the developers kit and a a google api key
[07:14] <NET||abuse> Tinned_Tuna: yeh, i need to figure out what port no to use
[07:14] <Tinned_Tuna> localhost:<portno>
[07:14] <Tinned_Tuna> anything
[07:14] <Tompu> tsoler: i have an api key
[07:14] <Tinned_Tuna> I tunnel web traffic over 7070
[07:14] <poopybutt> how do i figure out what version of java i have?
[07:14] <tsoler> for soap search?
[07:14] <KTurbo> cause it says it can't find my user's home directory
[07:14] <_-benz-_> poopybutt: java -version
[07:14] <NET||abuse> Tinned_Tuna: yeh, i know i can forward any port , but i don't know what ports i need to forward to allow my outlook 2003 to connect to the remote exchange server
[07:15] <Lynoure> KTurbo: it's easiest done by adduser, when making the user, that's why I recommended reading  man adduser  first, but you can just use mkdir /home/yourusername and then copy stuff from skel to there and change the ownership
[07:15] <Tinned_Tuna> NET||abuse: it should be any, you just need to force the client to use that port on local host as a proxy
[07:15] <NET||abuse> Tinned_Tuna: problem here is that OWA is currently broken on the exchange server
[07:15] <Tompu> tsoler: just give me a link to the plugin you're trying to install so i can see where it needs to go

[07:15] <ubuntu_newb> Definitely seems to run better than 6.06
[07:16] <cedd> Hi! i downloaded ubuntu 6.10 alternate iso... to install on my amd64 with raid... but when the installation gets to the partitioning step, i dont have the option to create raid, so i was woundering hoe to c reate it
[07:16] <magickal1> Does anyone have any information on the possible cause or even better the solution to the random system lockups that seem to be plaguing quite a few people in the edgy upgrade?
=== dannis is now known as Dannilion
[07:16] <NET||abuse> Tinned_Tuna: i don't know what ports exchange server uses for exchange type connections... i'm totally pickled on this one
[07:16] <oangefly> can you show me step by step how to create 1 group with 1 user....i should have it from there....
[07:16] <DShepherd> why does the firefox icon in the gnome's main menu differ from the one in application's (firefox icon)....
[07:16] <KTurbo> bbl
[07:16] <ubuntu_newb> cedd: you will probably need raid drivers
[07:17] <ubuntu_newb> How can I see how much ram Ubuntu is currently using on my system?
[07:17] <Tompu> tsoler: are you looking at this: http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/02/deskbar-applet-integrating-google.html ?
[07:17] <tsoler> tompu : Now download the developers kit and extract the GoogleSearch.wsdl file from it.  Copy this file to ~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/GoogleSearch.wsdl
[07:17] <cedd> well i know how to make the raid work from breezy, i had the option to create raid... but i dont have this option in edgy in the partitioning menu
[07:17] <tsoler> tompu : where is this folder?
[07:17] <lilgg> Hello I just installed ubuntu 6.10 on my ibook and I'm tryin to install software using the Add/Remove Applications wizard.

[07:18] <ProActive> Hi all
[07:18] <Skorgu|Work> I'm trying to boot Edgy from the amd64 alternate iso and the boot hangs at libata version 1.20 loaded. The x86 desktop CD boots fine, but I need to setup RAID on this box. Anyone seen this behavior?
[07:18] <Tompu> Lynoure: I dont think he understood ;)
[07:18] <tsoler> i cannot not see .gnome2 folder
[07:19] <dvheumen> Tompu: the most curious thing I find is that log messages all stop after the 1000 Mbit crosslink connection comes up (which means my main PC has just booted into Windows) ... I've seen it in 2 different log files. And I do remember that the last time I encountered this problem, it also just occured when I started working on my PC. Any suggestions on how to get more information? (also when my Linux pc is frozen, the PCI (1 Gbit) LAN adapter

[07:19] <Tompu> tsoler: are you using the console or the file browser (nautilus)?
[07:19] <coNP> ubuntu_newb: don't panic, most of it is cache
[07:19] <sonics> hi
[07:20] <Skorgu|Work> ProActive: I'll try that, thanks

[07:25] <bthibault> am i missing something?
[07:26] <Lynoure> KTurbo: and even after it: chgrp -r yourusername /home/yourusername
[07:26] <Skorgu|Work> Anyone trying to do RAID, you should be aware that you need the server or alternate install CDs to do it easily.
[07:26] <eldon> does nebody know how to fix the lag with mplayer streaming quicktime movies in HD?
[07:26] <ifireball> bthibault: can you see java in about:plugins
[07:26] <cedd> i have the alternate cd
[07:26] <bthibault> ifireball: let me check
[07:26] <ifireball> eldon: buy a stronger machine :P
[07:26] <Lynoure> KTurbo: the first one changes the owner of your newly made home directory and stuff below it, the second changes the group
[07:27] <netpython> !dri
[07:27] <ubotu> dri is direct rendering infrastructure, a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware under the X Window System in a safe and efficient manner.
[07:27] <KTurbo> oh, ok. I see.
[07:27] <bthibault> ifireball: nope, i can't see java , only Flash
[07:27] <Gabby_Hayes> Howdy
[07:27] <KTurbo> change owner I guess. :P
[07:27] <roryy> Lynoure: the man pages say '-R', not '-r', fwiw
[07:27] <KTurbo> brb and I'll see
[07:27] <bthibault> when i got to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins though, the libjavaplugin.so is there
[07:27] <Lynoure> roryy: the man pages are more correct than me
[07:28] <ifireball> bthibault: your FF is the one that came with ubuntu or a one you've installed on your own?
[07:28] <barnetod> so why do people charge for some linux software and others don't
[07:28] <bthibault> one i've installed on my own
[07:28] <bthibault> ifireball: should i unstall it?
[07:28] <Juan___> hmm
[07:28] <Juan___> Anyone using NFS?

[07:28] <eldon> ifireball: i got a P4 3,00 Ghz with 512 MB of SDRAM and a 264 kB DSL connection
[07:28] <ifireball> bthibault: no, but you should link the plugin to where you've installed it
[07:28] <eldon> should be sufficient, no?
[07:29] <Juan___> coNP: do you know if you need to do something else than a sudo mount -o -P 192.168.1.3:/media/sda1 /Users/juanmedinpineiro/sda1/ in the client ?
[07:29] <ifireball> eldon: apt-get install sense-of-humor
[07:29] <J-_> what flash plugin can I use for Opera?
[07:29] <coNP> Juan___: maybe give the type "-t nfs", but not sure; does it not work the way you try it?

[07:30] <barnetod> alphonso which wine

[07:32] <lullabud> what's the name of the chat room for discussing edgy?
[07:32] <Lynoure> tsoler: I'm not about to walk you through a gui I do not have, so cli it is
[07:32] <KTurbo> eh, yeah. I'm back
[07:32] <barnetod> sorry ubuntu unleashed
[07:32] <coNP> Juan___: how did you setup the other machine?
[07:32] <barnetod> and complete idiots guide to linux
[07:32] <barnetod> :)
[07:32] <KTurbo> I tried what you said and it didn't accept my "-r" so I just skipped it.
[07:32] <Lynoure> KTurbo: see above
[07:32] <barnetod> beginning ubuntu to professional is a great ebook too
[07:32] <KTurbo> ok
[07:32] <KTurbo> capital R
[07:32] <KTurbo> anyway
[07:32] <Lynoure> KTurbo: I got my cases mixed up, sorry about that
[07:32] <tsoler>  found the place for the file and  putted there
[07:33] <KTurbo> I need to make a group
[07:33] <barnetod> conp need um?
[07:33] <Lynoure> tsoler: good :)
[07:33] <coNP> barnetod: what do you mean?
[07:33] <KTurbo> That's ok, I'm just glad you can help
[07:33] <barnetod> the books :)
[07:33] <cedd> ...
[07:33] <coNP> barnetod: yep, sure I'm interested
[07:33] <Gabby_Hayes> barnetod  .. I thought M$ was publishing the book "Complete Idiot's Guide to Linux"  (which hade all the places that existed where you could buy M$ OS's  :-(
[07:33] <bthibault> ifireball: libjavaplugin.so is linked to /etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so
[07:33] <bthibault> is this correct
[07:33] <Lynoure> KTurbo: I'm glad to be of help. Soon going to sneak to watch more DVDs, though.
[07:33] <barnetod> no gabby not the version i have
[07:33] <tsoler> next thing is to put the key but dont know where
[07:33] <tsoler> haha
[07:34] <KTurbo> ok, but first
[07:34] <Juan___> coNP: Just added a NFS share using the system settings share. NFS options:: public
[07:34] <barnetod> whats best way to send to you conP?
[07:34] <KTurbo> How do I make a group?
[07:34] <dvheumen> Lynoure: Could you give me some pointers on how to investigate my problem? Tompu didn't have a clue, but I'm still stuck with this strange problem :-s. It's about a Ubuntu linux PC that freezes up without a trace of it in the logs...
[07:34] <barnetod> you want the torrent links?
[07:34] <cedd> any1 have the answer?
[07:34] <Juan___> coNP: Allowed hosts: * asynch, squash
[07:34] <glisse_> hi
[07:34] <Lynoure> dvheumen: lets see (doing lastlog)
[07:35] <ifireball> bthibault: its ok, "ls -l /etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so" to make sure its not a dead link, but I don't think it will be
[07:35] <roryy> KTurbo: if you're using gnome ('normal' ubuntu), try System -> Admin -> Users and Groups (valid in Ubuntu 6.06, not sure about 6.10)
[07:35] <coNP> Juan___: I see, it should work
[07:35] <glisse_> any easy way to boot with framebuffer desactived ? (no vesafb or any things like that just good old vga)
[07:35] <bthibault> ifireball: yes its there
[07:35] <coNP> Juan___: what does it write, when you try to cd in it?
[07:35] <KTurbo> roryy: I'm still in the terminal
[07:35] <Alphonso> Ok I found wine under usr/bin it says wine 4.5 kb executable..but it wont when I click ,double click or right click>open it.... :O(
[07:35] <roryy> KTurbo: ah
[07:35] <bthibault> ifireball: so its in my plugin dir. but firefox isn't accepting it apparently
[07:36] <dvheumen> Lynoure: what should I do with lastlog?
[07:36] <Juan___> coNP: bash: cd: sda1: Permission denied
[07:36] <Juan___> (as root)
[07:36] <Falstius> Alphonso: did you run winecfg?
[07:36] <roryy> KTurbo: in that case you can use the command 'addgroup'; try 'addgroup --help' or 'man addgroup' for more information
[07:36] <cedd> 4w8j55j8463w8j63988
[07:36] <ifireball> bthibault: its becasue FF2 is a custom install its probably looking for the plugins elsewhere, where did you install it?
[07:36] <KTurbo> what's the diffrence between man and the usuall
[07:36] <Juan___> I could try samba, but I'd like to know what isn't working
[07:37] <roryy> KTurbo: 'man addgroup' will show the manual page for the addgroup command
[07:37] <dvheumen> Lynoure: just running it doesn't produce any useful information
[07:37] <coNP> Juan___: what are the permissions on the directory (on the server machine?)
[07:37] <Lynoure> dvheumen: I was using it to see what you and Tompu talked about. He gave good pointers tou you
[07:37] <KTurbo> ok ok, I'll try that
[07:37] <KTurbo> oh wait
[07:37] <ifireball> bthibault: most howtos I've seen have you install FF2 somehere under /opt etc.
[07:37] <dvheumen> Lynoure: sorry, thought you meant a command... which actually exist and I didn't know :P
[07:37] <KTurbo> I tried "addgroup" but it said I only could use two names or something. :S
[07:37] <Alphonso> Falstius: nah.. OK I am now.. should I try Run interminal ,Display, or Run it ?
[07:37] <Lynoure> dvheumen: and I do not have that much time now, it's an interesting problem though
[07:37] <leofender_> hi
[07:38] <roryy> KTurbo: try 'addgroup --help' first
[07:38] <Falstius> Alphonso: when ever you are having problems, run things in the terminal so that you can see any errors.  So do it in the terminal.
[07:38] <leofender_> i need help please
[07:38] <Juan___> drwxrwx---
[07:38] <KTurbo> ok, I'll be back for more help later. ;)
[07:38] <dvheumen> Lynoure: I think it has something to do with the Gbit network adapter... is there some way to monitor such a thing?
[07:38] <bthibault> ifireball: yes its under opt
[07:38] <bthibault> ifireball: /opt
[07:38] <Juan___> coNP: drwxrwx---

[07:38] <burgermann> Hi. I run a web server with dapper the last few month and occasional reboots. However when I access it through ssh, it has suddenly begun to lag. So does the webserver and the users are complaining. There's no load on CPU and neither on the network. There's also plenty of space on the disk, so what could be wrong?
[07:38] <glisse_> leofender_, go ahead and shoot your question :)
[07:38] <barnetod> conP check your email im sending you an invite in a second
[07:39] <leofender_> how must i do for use partition magic on linux ?
[07:39] <bthibault> burgermann: .htaccess file possibly
[07:39] <ifireball> bthibault: something like /opt/firefox ? so you should probably add a link to /opt/firefox/plugins ...
[07:39] <coNP> barnetod: what kind of invite?
[07:39] <J-_> what java plugin can i use with Opera?
=== mrc_001 is now known as mrc_001|away
[07:39] <coNP> Juan___: I see, now I have no idea
[07:39] <barnetod> to a torrent site
[07:39] <coNP> barnetod: thanks
[07:39] <Lynoure> dvheumen: I really need to go now, but there are some trace (strace) commands you could look into if monitoring the logs do not help you...
[07:39] <J-_> JRE1.4?
[07:39] <Juan___> coNP: Well, I'll try Samba then. Thank you anyway.
[07:40] <dvheumen> Lynoure: tnx, will look :D
[07:40] <barnetod> if you haven't heard of oink yet be prepared
[07:40] <ifireball> burgermann: do you have some kind of traffic shaping setup?
[07:40] <leofender_> i need know how to use partition magic on linux
[07:40] <barnetod> your hard drive is going to explode
[07:40] <Alphonso> Falstius: thnx for the tip ...I ran it ..it seems it is having problems says fixme:midi:OSS_MidiInit Synthesizer supports MIDI in. Not yet supported.
[07:40] <pazemlsqdfmoj> when i try to crontab -e, i get: Error reading /home/myuser/.nano_history: Permission denied
[07:40] <Alphonso> err:advpack:create_tmp_ini_file Unable to create temp ini file
[07:40] <Alphonso> Failed to open the service control manager.

[07:40] <Alphonso> fixme:midi:OSS_MidiInit Synthesizer supports MIDI in. Not yet supported... but I see the configuration window just been opened
[07:40] <barnetod> just search ubuntu when you get logged in
[07:40] <LjL> !paste
[07:40] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[07:40] <barnetod> and a whole list of books comes up
[07:40] <tale-wkstn> I'm running dapper.  For some reason, rhythmbox locks up when I start it each time.  I've deleted my ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox directory already and it still occurs.  Rhythmbox use to work fine.
[07:40] <coNP> Juan___: altough this makes me unhappy, I hate unsolved problems
[07:40] <J-_> can i use jre 1.4 for Opera?
[07:40] <leofender_>  i need know how to use partition magic on linux
[07:40] <Tinned_Tuna> heya, does anyone know how to fix broken deps? I tried sudo apt-get install gcc
[07:40] <burgermann> ifireball: Not at all. I not very experienced with server administration
[07:40] <Tinned_Tuna> and got broken deps :/
[07:40] <J-_> can i use jre 1.4 for Opera?
[07:40] <Skorgu|Work> Anyone have success installing 6.10 amd64 to a Dell E521?
[07:40] <barnetod> leo why not use gparted?
[07:40] <glisse_> leofender_, it's more a partition magic question than a linux one
[07:41] <bthibault> ifireball: i owe you a beer
[07:41] <Skorgu|Work> Mine is hanging on libata init with both alternate and server install CDs
[07:41] <pazemlsqdfmoj> when i try to crontab -e, i get: Error reading /home/myuser/.nano_history: Permission denied
[07:41] <Juan___> coNP: Don't worry It must be something that I'm missing here
[07:41] <bthibault> ifireball: i was working out of /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
[07:41] <coNP> Juan___: sure :)
[07:41] <burgermann> bthibault: I guess it can't be the .htaccess file, since that doesn't explain the laggy ssh connection
[07:41] <barnetod> juan whats the problem?
[07:41] <Falstius> alphonso, it is normal to see lots of warnings and "this command not yet supported" stuff in wine.  Just configure it how you want it, and then you run a .exe in wine with "wine windows_program.exe"
[07:41] <ifireball> bthibault: and where in the world should you be, may I decide to collect?
[07:41] <glisse_> leofender_, if you can do what you want to do with partition magic maybe partition magic cannot do it
[07:41] <bthibault> ifireball: i'll be in Vegas next week for PubCon
[07:42] <bthibault> ifireball: other than that Columbus, OH
[07:42] <pazemlsqdfmoj> anyone?
[07:42] <ifireball> burgermann: sounds like something you should solve with the network experts at your ISP
[07:42] <Juan___> barnetod: I've shared a dir using NFS. I'm unable to access it from another computer.
[07:42] <leofender_> i need to make a new partition in ma hda for install windows on this little partition!
[07:42] <burgermann> I've tried doing a tcpdump to watch what kind of traffic is going on, but there doesn't seem to be any suspicous things
[07:42] <leofender_> how do that ?
[07:42] <barnetod> whats are you using to navigate
[07:42] <J-_> can i use jre 1.4 for Opera?
[07:42] <barnetod> i had a problem until i used konqueror
[07:42] <pazemlsqdfmoj> how to cron a php job in ubuntu?
[07:42] <burgermann> ifireball: the desktops using same connection doens't have any problems at all :/
[07:43] <Legendre> Hey all.. has a fix been made for the 'can't print PDFs' in Edgy?
[07:43] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, install php-cli package
[07:43] <barnetod> im in windows right now so can't look at NFS
[07:43] <gh0st> ??? i have a very strange problem: my sound card SUDDENLY doesn't give sound anymore !!?
[07:43] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: i would prefer to use cron
[07:43] <ifireball> bthibault: cheers
[07:43] <tale-wkstn> you have to install php-cli
[07:43] <leofender_> other similar partition magic soft but for linux ?
[07:43] <barnetod> legendre i can print them in edgy
[07:43] <tale-wkstn> then you can call it from cron
[07:43] <Juan___> barnetod: I'm unable even to cd to it.
[07:43] <barnetod> leofender use Gparted
[07:43] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: what exactly does php-cli do?
[07:43] <Elko> gh0st: muted?
[07:43] <Legendre> barnetod - not here, and it's only PDF and PS
[07:43] <shwag> If I run ./script/server in this app I brought down from svn...it doesnt launch. But if I do it in my own project that I created with  rails myapp , then the server starts fine.
[07:44] <tale-wkstn> command line interpreter for php
[07:44] <gh0st> Elko: no :-)
[07:44] <barnetod> hmm juan let me look for a minute
[07:44] <leofender_> oh thanks barnetod
[07:44] <pazemlsqdfmoj> gh0st: ubuntu has been giving me a lot of crap with my soundblaster as well
[07:44] <barnetod> legendre is there a config file for printing?
[07:44] <tale-wkstn> allows you to run a php script like $ php somepage.php
[07:44] <J-_> can i use jre 1.4 for Opera?
[07:44] <Juan___> barnetod: ok
[07:44] <pazemlsqdfmoj> on installing nvidia driver, my sound went dead, and on installing a general update, my soundcard was just uninstalled :|
[07:44] <barnetod> im new and not sure what all configs there are
[07:44] <leofender_> bye. i will make that. will look ;)
[07:44] <barnetod> so mine may be different
[07:44] <KTurbo> well
[07:44] <KTurbo> damn
[07:44] <gh0st> <pazemlsqdfmoj> so what did you do? i hav sb live too
[07:44] <Alphonso> Falstius: k I am trying to run PS7 ..I can see my window partition but dont see Ps7 folder under programe files.. Infact I see only one folder that too is empty
[07:45] <KTurbo> I couldn't make it, alot of things I didn't understand there
[07:45] <ifireball> burgermann: its way too freaky for me to try and deagnose over IRC... could be anything from bad cable to faulty NIC, to slow CPU
[07:45] <burgermann> ifireball: ok, thanks anyway ;)
[07:45] <pazemlsqdfmoj> gh0st: after the nvidia problem i followed http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Comprehensive_Sound_Problems_Solutions_Guide#Configuring_default_soundcards_.2F_stopping_soundcards_from_switching <--
[07:45] <chuckyp> hrm... ktorrent is a no go in edgy all kinds of problems
[07:45] <barnetod> juan is it a windows folder?
[07:45] <pazemlsqdfmoj> im not entirely sure wot steps i took to fix ita fter the update (a friend helped me)
[07:45] <chuckyp> what are you guys using out there for torrents?
[07:46] <barnetod> azureus in ubuntu
[07:46] <barnetod> and u torrent in windows
[07:46] <Juan___> No. It's a directory in a ubuntu box
[07:46] <Falstius> Alphonso: I don't know what PS7 is
[07:46] <Alphonso> Photoshop 7
[07:46] <dacableguy> utorrent also works well under wine
[07:46] <dacableguy> i used to use it
[07:46] <tale-wkstn> there is a new torrent client for gnome
[07:46] <dacableguy> deluge?
[07:46] <tale-wkstn> pretty slick
[07:46] <roryy> KTurbo: what group name do you want create?
[07:46] <tale-wkstn> yep
[07:46] <barnetod> utorrent is the only stable one for me
[07:46] <chuckyp> barnetod, isn't azureus borked atleast the one in the repos?
[07:46] <KTurbo> "Familj"
[07:46] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: php-cli is installed, now what?
[07:46] <ProActive> Ok. I've decided! I want webmin!!!
[07:46] <dacableguy> ive looked at it...but i still like the options/customizability of utorrent and azureus
[07:47] <barnetod> chucky thats why im logged into windows
[07:47] <barnetod> and downloading something
[07:47] <barnetod> :)
[07:47] <ProActive> anyone have webmin with 6.10 working?
[07:47] <KTurbo> (That's the swedish word for family)
[07:47] <roryy> KTurbo: i recommend using lowercase.  Did you try 'sudo addgroup familj' ?
[07:47] <KTurbo> no, I did not.
[07:47] <Falstius> Alphonso: how are you trying to run it?  I would think you'd run: wine "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop\photoshop.exe"
[07:47] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, call your web page from the command line.  i.e. $ php /path/to/my/php/page.php
[07:47] <chuckyp> dacableguy, what are you using?
[07:47] <KTurbo> I'll try that.
[07:47] <tale-wkstn> once you verify it works, put it in a cron script
[07:47] <chuckyp> dacableguy, for torrents that is.
[07:47] <phaedrus44> ProActive:   usermin?
[07:47] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: this will not pop a browser screen right? :)
[07:47] <lullabud> what's the chat room where the edgy discussion happens?
[07:48] <Falstius> Alphonso: replacing photoshop.exe with whatever the photoshop executable is ... I don't have it.
[07:48] <tale-wkstn> no
[07:48] <KTurbo> brg
[07:48] <KTurbo> brb
[07:48] <dacableguy> what am i using for what?
[07:48] <dacableguy> ah
[07:48] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, I use this in a cron job to update my jinzora install
[07:48] <dacableguy> i use azureus at the moment, but utorrent works great under wine too
[07:48] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: what do i do when i want to add ?something=something at the end?
[07:48] <barnetod> bittorrent is the worst client out besides bitcomet
[07:48] <glisse_> anyone know how to boot with framebuffer disabled under edgy ?
[07:49] <tale-wkstn> just add it
[07:49] <gh0st> <pazemlsqdfmoj> i just figured out it switched to another, and unfortunately your link is not for ubuntu :-(
[07:49] <Alphonso> Falstius: U dont have it and dont know what it is .. but still u still got it perfectly alright :)
[07:49] <pazemlsqdfmoj> "could not open input file"
[07:49] <dacableguy> bittorrent is just good for people who need it to just work without wanting to configure a bunch of stuff
[07:49] <barnetod> dacable if i use utorrent under wine will it still keep my activities under windows in there?
[07:49] <lullabud> glisse_:  can you use a vga= string on boot?
[07:49] <pazemlsqdfmoj> gh0st: its the link i used, so should work :|
[07:49] <barnetod> i havent bothered trying it
[07:49] <chuckyp> dacableguy, how idd you install azureus from the repos?
[07:49] <tale-wkstn> is that output from your script?
[07:49] <Alphonso> k let me give it a try
[07:49] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: no
[07:49] <glisse_> lullabud, this parameter seems quietly ignored
[07:49] <Gabby_Hayes> !edgy
[07:49] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[07:49] <dacableguy> if you dual boot with windows, utorrent wont touch your windows activities....the 2 installs of utorrent will be completely separate from each other
[07:49] <tale-wkstn> verify the path to the php file you are trying to run
[07:49] <gh0st> <pazemlsqdfmoj> i have no /proc/asound/modules !?
[07:50] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: i tabbed my way to it
[07:50] <macaco> hello
[07:50] <lullabud> glisse_:  edgy is freakin weird man... i'm having troubles with it too.
[07:50] <dacableguy> i didnt install it from the repos, as its broken...i dled it from the officical site and extracted the tarball into /opt and voila, it worked
[07:50] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, check out the docs in /usr/share/doc/php-cli
[07:50] <michaels_> on Xubuntu Edgy on a very weak system I tried to play around with UI and WM settings and now after I logged out and then in most fonts are tiny and hardly readable. this is only the case on my own account. what do I do?
[07:50] <macaco> can I ask ubuntu server's questions here?
[07:50] <Falstius> sometimes I forget that I still have windows installed on a partition of my machine.
[07:50] <lullabud> glisse_:  like, why the hell is /bin/sh symlinked to dash?  it messed up a custom kernel compile. =/
[07:50] <barnetod> chucky im looking for a good repo site for you
[07:50] <tale-wkstn> it has it's own php.ini file for the cli
[07:50] <barnetod> fal if it werent for school and statistics and calculus i wouldnt use windows
[07:50] <tale-wkstn> you may need to enable some parameters
[07:51] <Gabby_Hayes> lullabud .. am trying to get edgy on a 64-bit AMD system ... sigh  :-(
[07:51] <macaco> I need to set up my ipaddress thru dhcp on a ubuntu server
[07:51] <pazemlsqdfmoj> gh0st: hmm, could be the file location is different, i dont recall, and im no ubuntu expert :)
[07:51] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: k
[07:51] <psusi> Gabby_Hayes: what's the problem?
[07:51] <dacableguy> edgy is working great for me
[07:51] <barnetod> edgy works great for me
[07:51] <chuckyp> dacableguy, extract to /opt and then you made a symlink or you launch it from there?
[07:51] <lullabud> Gabby_Hayes:  i'm trying to get it on a 64-bit xeon system.  *sigh*
[07:52] <dacableguy> every now and then ill have it randomly freeze though...not sure why
[07:52] <lullabud> Gabby_Hayes:  actually it installed pretty well.  dapper had trouble recognizing the raid array for me, but edgy recognized it fine.  no network though.
[07:52] <barnetod> i had it freeze one time

[07:55] <femi> actually i have to configure a ethernet connection between 2 pcs
[07:55] <psusi> Gabby_Hayes:  I'm confused... if you have not finished downloading it yet, what is the problem?
[07:55] <Legendre> in short, I can't print any PS or PDF.
[07:55] <fredl> Pensacola - you're not on #solaris
[07:55] <barnetod> you using a router?
[07:55] <femi> and i dunno howto

[07:55] <barnetod> legendre what file is ps
[07:55] <femi> one has ubuntu 6.06, the other ubuntu 6.10

[07:55] <barnetod> ?
[07:55] <Legendre> barnetod - postscript
[07:55] <leofender_> how can i install "gaparted.tar.gz" ??
[07:55] <Gabby_Hayes> psusi  .. this is a different attempt
[07:55] <femi> no, i am using simple ethernet connection
[07:55] <femi> just a cable
[07:55] <fredl> Pensacola, Ubuntu isn't even an OS dweeb.
[07:55] <kikiwitc1> Pensacola: should you not thank Linus for the Linux Kernal then?
[07:56] <leofender_> im new in linux
[07:56] <Legendre> All other printing seems to work just fine, it's only ps/pdf that will not print
[07:56] <barnetod> leo ill get you a site
[07:56] <Pensacola> well yeah, that's why I said everyone :)
[07:56] <barnetod> legend let me search :)
[07:56] <psusi> Gabby_Hayes: ok... so what did you try the first time and what went wrong?
[07:56] <leofender_>  how can i install "gaparted.tar.gz" ??
[07:56] <femi> how can i configure it?
[07:56] <JasonF> Hey, I'm having trouble finding the download page for edgy pxe images .. anyone have a link?
[07:56] <femi> i mean what do i have to configure?
[07:56] <MarcN> leofender_: do you mean gparted?
[07:56] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, I'm sure it is because of the paths
[07:56] <doccy> how do i find out what kernel im running?
[07:57] <Legendre> doccy - uname -a
[07:57] <barnetod> leo you have synaptic?
[07:57] <jvolkman> doccy: uname -a
[07:57] <doccy> thanks
[07:57] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: what paths?
[07:57] <meherenOS-X> how do i install a soure tarball again? (without doing the hole ./configure...make...sudo make install thing)
[07:57] <tale-wkstn> run the script from the directory were the file is
[07:57] <barnetod> go to administration then synaptic software manager or whatever
[07:57] <leofender_> i got a gparted.
[07:57] <barnetod> and look for gparted on there
[07:57] <lullabud> isn't there a separate edgy discussion room?  i remember the mods always used to get pissed when we'd talk about dapper in here before it was released....
[07:57] <psusi> meherenOS-X: you don't
[07:57] <meherenOS-X> psusi, yes you can... ive done it before
[07:57] <barnetod> synaptic will install it for you
[07:57] <psusi> meherenOS-X: install the package via synaptic
[07:57] <barnetod> rather than use a tarball install
[07:57] <dacableguy> edgy is released
[07:57] <femi> cause i have two ethernet cards: one for the dsl router and one to connect to my lapto
[07:57] <MarcN> meherenOS-X: that is the definition of installing a source tarball!  ./configure ; make install, etc
[07:58] <tale-wkstn> the paths are probably are relative to the directory where the script is ran
[07:58] <leofender_> i have gparted.tar.gz
[07:58] <fredl> some people need to get their credits right methinks.
[07:58] <barnetod> hold on leo :)
[07:58] <lullabud> dacableguy:  right, but i remember there was a chat for next-gen cutting edge unstable type stuff.
[07:58] <psusi> meherenOS-X: no.. you can not... source code needs to be compiled to get a program
[07:58] <leofender_> and i dont know what make!
[07:58] <Gabby_Hayes> psusi .. tried to d/l to the target 64-bit system (using Dapper 32-bit) .. and then upgrade .. but it never starts upgrading .. just hangs .. doing nothing
[07:58] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: you mean where the php-cli is installed or the original page that i call is located?
[07:58] <meherenOS-X> psusi, there is some program that did it for you
[07:58] <meherenOS-X> i mean it compiled it turned it into a .deb then installed it
[07:58] <Gabby_Hayes> so will try to d/l to another box, and burn a DVd
[07:58] <psusi> Gabby_Hayes: you can not upgrade from 32 to 64 bit
[07:58] <MarcN> leofender_: it is better to install the gparted package that is prebuilt.  Use synaptic or apt-get install gparted
[07:58] <meherenOS-X> maybe it was alien...
[07:58] <psusi> Gabby_Hayes: you need to install 64 from the get go if you want to run that
[07:59] <fredl> Ubuntu should thank Debian, Debian should thank the FSF and Linux, and Linux should thank Minix and Minix should thank Andrew Tanenbaum.
[07:59] <fredl> or something.
[07:59] <JasonF> Hey, I'm having trouble finding the download page for edgy pxe images .. anyone have a link?
[07:59] <fredl> get it right :)
[07:59] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, if the script is located in /var/www/yoursite/script.php, then cd into /var/www/yoursite and then run the script like php script.php
[07:59] <Gabby_Hayes> ahh .. hxs .. psusi  .. didn't see that problem anywhere  :-(
[07:59] <psusi> meherenOS-X: alien takes rpms and turns them into debs
[07:59] <barnetod> leo
[07:59] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: ah, and how would i solve this in the crontab?
[07:59] <psusi> meherenOS-X: to work with a source tarball though, you have to ./configure and make
[07:59] <barnetod> i pmd you
[07:59] <tale-wkstn> make a script that cd's to the proper directory and then calls php script.php
[08:00] <meherenOS-X> psusi, i know there is a way! i have done it before!
[08:00] <leofender_> yeah. but not install gparted because not know where is the package
[08:00] <fredl> anybody wanna give a cheer to Linus? Let's all just say one big Hurray!
[08:00] <meherenOS-X> psusi, doesn't matter though...
[08:00] <femi> help
[08:00] <oangefly> dumb queston....how do you delete files in the command line....???....
[08:00] <Gabby_Hayes> psusi  .. will try to d/l and burn it to a DVD  then
[08:00] <fredl> *hurray* ! :)
[08:00] <leofender_> the console
[08:00] <barnetod> leo load up synaptic
[08:00] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: k, thats working now :)
[08:00] <fredl> ok I will stop now.
[08:00] <meherenOS-X> oangefly, rm
[08:00] <pazemlsqdfmoj> just need to fix the ?something=something and im set :)
[08:00] <oangefly> ty....
[08:00] <pazemlsqdfmoj> tale-wkstn: thx ;)
[08:00] <meherenOS-X> oangefly, np
[08:00] <Ayabara> you guys use nautilus as your gui file browser? are there any good alternatives? I tried krusader, but it didn't hit the spot, even though total commander is my favorite in windows
[08:00] <tale-wkstn> pazemlsqdfmoj, glad to help
[08:00] <fredl> hey guys, I'm trying to install a theme in firefox, any idea why that doesn't seem to work??
[08:00] <Legendre> Ok, so this is a known issue for HP printers, with NO fix?
[08:00] <leofender_> synaptic ? whats this ?
[08:00] <Legendre> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279306

[08:01] <barnetod> go to applications
[08:01] <barnetod> then accessories
[08:01] <barnetod> then terminal
[08:01] <kronoman> Ayabara: try midnight commander (console) or gnome commander
[08:01] <psusi> leofender_: synaptic is the package management program you will fine in the admin menu... you use it for installing and removing things
[08:01] <kronoman> they are very similar to norton commander
[08:01] <chuckyp> Okay i'm trying to figure this out
[08:02] <barnetod> psusi im trying to help him he is lost
[08:02] <barnetod> maybe you can spell it out for him
[08:02] <Ayabara> kronoman: I'll check them out. thanks
[08:02] <chuckyp> I extracted azureus to /opt/azureus   so now I want to make it system wide executable
[08:02] <leofender_> oooh
[08:02] <leofender_> okey
[08:02] <leofender_> will look

[08:02] <kronoman> Ayabara: as far as  I know, they aren't in the main repository of ubuntu
[08:02] <barnetod> the terminal? or synaptic
[08:03] <Legendre> barnetod - find anything useful?
[08:03] <barnetod> legend still looking
[08:03] <barnetod> these sites suck :)
[08:03] <kronoman> Ayabara: check here : http://www.nongnu.org/gcmd/
[08:03] <MarcN> Ayabara: that is eVIl
[08:03] <Legendre> I found the link about, someone else same issue, older HP printer
[08:03] <Legendre> *above
[08:03] <Ayabara> MarcN: maybe I should state clearly that it's a joke :-)
[08:03] <chuckyp> Anyone know how I make a symlink in /usr/bin to /opt/azureus/azureus   ???
[08:03] <Ayabara> in case someone tries it out
[08:03] <Legendre> chuckyp - man ln
[08:04] <fredl> the Firefox themes appear to be using some different icons.... but nothing about color schemes Hrmmm
[08:04] <barnetod> legendre you tried /usr/bin/lp -d printername
[08:04] <chuckyp> Legendre, I looked at the man pages for ln
[08:04] <chuckyp> Legendre, but i'm not sure if thats what I have to do make a symlink or a hardlink  and I tried it and it didn't make it.  Or if it did I have no idea where it created it.
[08:04] <fredl> Tangerine is 950K and all it's getting me is some different navigation icons Htmmm
[08:04] <Legendre> chuckyp - what part about ln -s doesn't make sense?
[08:04] <psusi> chuckyp: sudo ln -s /usr/bin/azureus /opt/azureus/azureus
[08:04] <voluspa> ln -s /opt/azureus/azureus /usr/bin/azureus
[08:05] <Legendre> barnetod - well, lpr -P lj4 in this case, yes, I tried it
[08:05] <voluspa> the target comes first
[08:05] <barnetod> k :)
[08:05] <Legendre> barnetod - there are no errors generated in any log, or on the console
[08:05] <barnetod> you trying to print from firefox?
[08:05] <barnetod> or from reader itself?
[08:05] <chuckyp> ahh I was in /usr/bin and was just doing ln -s azureus /usr/bin/azureus
[08:05] <Legendre> in any PDF viewer app
[08:05] <chuckyp> Normal users can write to /opt
[08:05] <barnetod> ah
[08:05] <Legendre> evince, xpdf, from the commandline etc
[08:05] <voluspa> yep good thing ln warns you by "theres already a file named..."
[08:06] <Ayabara> kronoman: gnome-commander looks like what I need. kinda similar to krusader..
[08:06] <Legendre> voluspa - unless you ln -sf ;-)
[08:06] <voluspa> hehe
[08:06] <leofender_> i cant install gparted because  is not possible to find the package
[08:06] <leofender_> why ?
[08:06] <voluspa> bad move...
[08:06] <leofender_> if i have the package
[08:07] <Ayabara> kronoman: gnome-commander is in universe
[08:07] <graveson> how cna i find out which java verion i am usinr and is it worth it to upgrade to jre 1.5
[08:07] <Legendre> barnetod - this issue is screwing me badly at work..
[08:07] <barnetod> i understand legendre lol
[08:07] <Legendre> barnetod - I blew away a stable slackware system for Ubuntu..
=== inu|sleep is now known as inuyasharenegade
[08:07] <barnetod> im searching
[08:07] <chuckyp> Okay it said it created the symlink but its not there.
[08:07] <barnetod> you have the cups pdf package installed?
[08:07] <Legendre> barnetod - I have a default install
[08:08] <barnetod> leo load up the terminal
[08:08] <fredl> anybody know what this message means: ALSA lib confmisc.c:1105:(snd_func_refer) Unable to find definition 'defaults.pcm.ipc_key'
[08:08] <voluspa> Legendre: I blev away a LinuxFromScratch for Ubuntu today :-) I'm very satisfied.
[08:08] <leofender_> and ?
[08:08] <Legendre> voluspa - get my pdfs to print, and I might be satisfied as well..
[08:08] <barnetod> type this leo
[08:08] <Legendre> the rest works OK so far
[08:08] <barnetod> sudo apt-get install gparted
[08:08] <leofender_> ok
[08:08] <leofender_> tell me :)
[08:08] <leofender_> ok
[08:08] <Legendre> what's this about a cups-pdf package, barnetod ?
[08:09] <barnetod> sudo apt-get install cups-pdf
[08:09] <barnetod> try that
[08:09] <barnetod> see if it works
[08:09] <Legendre> heh.
[08:09] <voluspa> Legendre: Sorry, I'm a newbie in ubuntu... totally different concept than a selfcompiled system
[08:09] <fredl> oh, known error....
[08:09] <fredl> and nobody fixed it yet two weeks after releasing edgy grr
[08:09] <Elko> voluspa: heh, finally decided it's better to be lazy, too? ;^)
[08:10] <leofender_> oh no!. its not possible to find the package!. i will cry!
[08:10] <leofender_> lol
[08:10] <chuckyp> voluspa, Okay I did ln -s /usr/bin/azureus /opt/azureus/azureus  it said it created the symlink but its not there.
[08:10] <barnetod> not able to find package?
[08:10] <voluspa> Elko:  Yep. Slackware in 1996, then lfs 2000 and now ubuntu. Progress!
[08:10] <MarcN> leofender_: please go read up on how to use synaptic.  I
[08:11] <cybervegan> hello guys... can anyone help with an adsl modem problem, please?
[08:11] <chuckyp> voluspa, I was using sudo as well.  forgot to add that.
[08:11] <barnetod> leo
[08:11] <barnetod> ubuntuguide.org
[08:11] <leofender_> que ?
[08:11] <leofender_> yep? :P
[08:11] <barnetod> read a little bit on synaptic
[08:11] <barnetod> it will help you
[08:11] <Elko> voluspa: about the same here, only some little bite of gentoo in between
[08:11] <leofender_> okey
[08:11] <dfcarney> cybervegan: just state the problem -- hopefully, someone will know the answer
[08:11] <leofender_> thank!
[08:11] <leofender_> :D
[08:11] <cybervegan> ok, here goes ;-)
[08:11] <barnetod> legend im searching forums real fast
[08:12] <barnetod> ill brb
[08:12] <charle97> chuckyp, it's ln -s /opt/azureus/azureus /usr/bin/azureus
[08:12] <cybervegan> i'm in th uk, using a bt voyager 105
[08:12] <voluspa> chuckyp: Ah, I've done away with sudo. Did a "sudo su", then "passwd root", now I just "su" .
[08:12] <cybervegan> i've tried an old (2005 - hoary) procedure that uses pppoa from debian

[08:12] <rich_> hey guys i have a boot question.  I have linux-686-smp installed but its only showing 2.6.17-10-generic for an option to boot in.  any suggestions?
[08:12] <cybervegan> plus eciadsl from ubuntu i think
[08:13] <chuckyp> charle97, that didn't work either.
[08:13] <cybervegan> the procedure says to use a special .bin file rather than the default
[08:13] <ubuntu_newb> in ubuntu if you want to run as root just type sudo in front of the command (for example sudo apt-get remove program-name)
[08:13] <cybervegan> but it's not in the .deb files apparently
[08:13] <barnetod> i use the generic rich
[08:13] <charle97> chuckyp, you installed azureus in opt?
[08:13] <anuvis07> http://teletrece.canal13.cl/t13/html/
[08:14] <rich_> hmm im trying to install vmware and i think having the wrong headers is giving me a problem
[08:14] <chuckyp> charle97, voluspa perhaps you guys don't understand.  I've downloaded azureus and extracted it to /opt/azureus  I want to make it system wide executable so don't I just create a link in /usr/bin  but for some reason the link is not being created.
[08:14] <fredl> anybody have a clue why totem locks my mouse??
[08:14] <thor> chuckyp: are you creating it as root (sudo)
[08:14] <pazemlsqdfmoj> whats the extension of a linux script again? :D
[08:14] <chuckyp> charle97, voluspa i've tried both sudo ln -s /usr/bin/azureus /opt/azureus/azureus  and the other way around.  Neither puts a link in /usr/bin
[08:15] <pazemlsqdfmoj> the linux equivalent of .bat
[08:15] <chuckyp> thor, yes i'm using sudo
[08:15] <rich_> what kernel is everyone running on edgy?
[08:15] <ubuntu_newb> kernel?
[08:15] <fredl> 2.6.17-10
[08:15] <ubuntu_newb> how can I find that out?
[08:15] <pazemlsqdfmoj> rich_: im running none at all!!
[08:15] <chuckyp> pazemlsqdfmoj, it doens't need an extension it just needs to be executable
[08:15] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed edgy
[08:15] <thor> chuckyp: leave off the last azureus
[08:15] <pazemlsqdfmoj> chuckyp: k thx :)
[08:15] <ubuntu_newb> not sure
[08:15] <fredl> ubuntu_newb, uname -r
[08:15] <ubuntu_newb> thanks
[08:15] <thor> chuckyp: and the source is first, then the link location
[08:15] <chuckyp> thor, so just link to the directory?
[08:15] <ifireball> chuckyp: what does "ls -l /usr/bin/azureus" give you ?
[08:16] <chuckyp> ifireball, its not there.
[08:16] <voluspa> chuckyp: ? I'm a newbie here... Perhaps something with security is preventing you. Don't know
[08:16] <fredl> cool, I can watch por... ehr video in my browser again.
[08:16] <d-snp> hey, where does an application throw an error if it exits unexpectedly?
[08:16] <thor> chuckyp: sudo ln -s /opt/azureus/azureus /usr/bin
[08:16] <_bt> hi guys im trying to install xgl following instructions in the wiki, when i try to install the packages im getting "beryl not found"
[08:16] <d-snp> dmesg is empty..
[08:16] <ifireball> chuckyp: ok, what does "/opt/azureus/azureus" give you
[08:16] <ubuntu_newb> Kernel version for my edgy is 2.6.17-10-generic
[08:16] <chuckyp> ifireball, that will launch azureus
[08:16] <voluspa> Anyways. Off I got to find instructions how to compile a kernel in this environment... Should be funl.
[08:17] <ifireball> chuckyp: sorry i mean "ls -l /opt/azureus/azureus"
[08:17] <barnetod> legendre what reader you using?
[08:17] <chuckyp> thor, ty
[08:17] <ifireball> chuckyp: also, what thor said should work
[08:17] <charle97> rich_, the 2.6.17-10 kernel should already be smp
[08:17] <gh0st> .why do i have 2 things in my gnome-mixer: my soundblaster 5.1 AND another one i don't know what it is. It does mute the card however!?
[08:17] <chuckyp> thor, didn't realize that i didn't need to name the link
[08:18] <thor> chuckyp: you are free to rename it after it is created
[08:18] <CarlFK> what is the package name of the java plugin for firefox?
[08:19] <ifireball> chuckyp: naming it shouldn't have given you any trouble though
[08:19] <green-earz> cybervegan: the adsl modem you have now is usd connection ? which can be setup but you need to google for " linux bt voyager 105 "  I would say that you would be better off getting a netgear DG384 of ebay
[08:19] <fredl> ever get the impression that there are too many people here asking too many questions about often rather specialized subjects?
[08:19] <chuckyp> thor, but for some reason the program won't launch if i'm using the link it errors out.  But if I go to /opt/azureus and ./azureus it works just fine.
[08:19] <lukas_> CarlFK: apt-cache search j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin
[08:20] <thor> chuckyp: open a terminal, type 'azureus' and tell me the error indication
[08:20] <fredl> I don't often see 'dumb questions' nor do I ask them myself I think, but to have exactly the same conditions as somebody who's asking a question is frequently a small chance.
[08:20] <rixxon> where to clear "recent documents" history for the gnome-main-menu package applet?
[08:20] <fredl> oh well, I should stop babbling.
[08:20] <CarlFK> lukas_: thanks
[08:20] <IA-Outdoors> is there an ubuntu channel specific to laptops?
[08:20] <chuckyp> thor, java errors in "main"
[08:21] <ifireball> chuckyp: that just bad head-in-ass scripting for you... its probably looking for other scripts in the directory it was launched from, you're better off making a script rather then a link in /usr/bin
[08:21] <tim167> hi all, I plan to install ubuntu as second boot on my (now xp) thinkpad G40, any do's and don'ts before I start ?
[08:21] <chuckyp> thor, then it terminates  to many lines to paste bout 5 lines in all.  But like I say if I cd to opt and launch it it works.
[08:21] <thor> chuckyp: I just checked and /usr/bin/azureus is a script...so a link won't work
[08:22] <ifireball> chuckyp: or just add /opt/azureus to the path
[08:22] <fredl> are the fglrx kernel modules still in the linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` ?
[08:22] <gh0st> how can i disable OSS without recompiling kernel?
=== mrc_001|away is now known as mrc_001
[08:22] <charle97> ghost, blacklist it
[08:22] <concept10> !swap
[08:22] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[08:22] <chuckyp> thor, yeah it is a script bummer.   So do I need to create a hardlink then instead of a symlink or am I totally confused.
[08:23] <sybariten> dear ubuntuers
[08:23] <thor> chuckyp: it looks like you need to be in /opt/azureus.
[08:23] <sybariten> i needed a tool to check the installed memory in a headless box
[08:23] <fredl> hmm I have the fglrx kernel modules loaded but get Mesa GL
[08:23] <sybariten> i did an apt-cache search for "memtest"
[08:23] <ifireball> chuckyp: no a hardlink won't help you here
[08:23] <leofender_> hi
[08:23] <leofender_> de synaptic its installed
[08:23] <thor> chuckyp: I think a simple bash script that changes to /opt/azureus and then runs ./azureus would work
[08:23] <chuckyp> ifireball, I thought making the link was just executing it from /opt
[08:23] <chuckyp> thor, yeah I could just do that.
[08:23] <sybariten> i tried installing a tool called "memtest86+", but apt says i already have the latest version. anybody know what the binary is called, that i wanna run?
[08:24] <sybariten> cause its not "memtest"
[08:24] <thor> chuckyp: I think that is the easiest solution
[08:24] <chuckyp> ifireball, but it copied the script to /usr/bin
[08:24] <thor> (assuming it works
[08:24] <Juan___> Do you know any human way to connect a Mac to an Ubuntu server ? NFS doesn't work
[08:24] <psusi> sybariten: in a headless box?  that's going to be hard
[08:24] <CarlFK> sybariten: you pick memtest from your boot options
[08:24] <sybariten> psusi: how so ?
[08:24] <mel> Does anybody know how to add a search result to an existing search result ?
[08:24] <chuckyp> thor, yeah it will work.  So how do I remove the link now just rm it?
[08:24] <psusi> sybariten: how do you expect to see its output?
[08:24] <IA-Outdoors> anybody here speak hungarian by chance?
[08:24] <sybariten> psusi: in the shell ?
[08:24] <coNP> IA-Outdoors: sure
[08:24] <thor> chuckyp: yes...just 'rm' it
[08:24] <IA-Outdoors> coNP can I msg you?
[08:24] <ifireball> chuckyp: no it didn't copy it, but symling essentially makes the system behave as if the file is there
[08:24] <psusi> sybariten: memtest is not a linux program... it has to run outside the kernel
[08:24] <coNP> IA-Outdoors: sure
[08:24] <chuckyp> ifireball, gotcha
[08:25] <sybariten> CarlFK: ok ... its a server ... i was hoping do do something shell-wise
[08:25] <mel> For example user1 = account.users.first; users2 = account.users.last; user3 = user1 + user2
[08:25] <psusi> sybariten: you boot directly into it instead of linux... so you will need to plug a monitor into this box at least to see the results
[08:25] <sybariten> psusi: i see.... strange then that apt senses it
[08:25] <sybariten> psusi: ok
[08:25] <CarlFK> sybariten: memtest wants to be the only thing running so it can test all memory - it moves itself around
[08:25] <thor> chuckyp: I usually put scripts like we are talking about in ~/bin so I remember "I" wrote them
[08:25] <mel> eerrr wrong channel
[08:25] <psusi> sybariten: the package installs the program and configures grub to boot into it... it is installed by default so when you are booting up you can choose it as a boot option from the grub menu
[08:25] <chuckyp> thor, yeah I don't really know the proper directory structure i'll put it in bin
[08:25] <sybariten> so, anyone know any bulletproof way of checking via shell how much installed memory i have? i'm sure there is some easier way to do it thatn installing 3d party software
[08:26] <gh0st> how can i disable OSS without recompiling kernel?
[08:26] <leofender_> i m going to sleep!. thank guys!
[08:26] <sybariten> psusi: cool
[08:26] <leofender_> thanks for all!
[08:26] <thor> chuckyp: that is 'bin' in your home directory
[08:26] <ubuntu_newb> N tud beszl magyar.
[08:26] <leofender_> xD
[08:26] <psusi> sybariten: you just want to see how much memory you have or test that it is workign properly?
[08:26] <atlas95> hello
[08:26] <thor> chuckyp: it should be in your path...should be added at login
[08:26] <atlas95> could you help me please?
[08:26] <gh0st> how can i disable OSS without recompiling kernel?
[08:26] <ifireball> chuckyp: /usr/local/bin may be a better choice here
[08:26] <sybariten> psusi: just see how much i got
[08:26] <atlas95> Starting Music Player Daemon: cannot open music_directory "/media/DOCUMENTS/Ma musique/" (config line 14): Permission denied
[08:26] <atlas95> failed.
[08:26] <psusi> sybariten: ohh, then just run free or vmstat
[08:26] <ifireball> !ramdrive
[08:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ramdrive - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:26] <sybariten> psusi: well, the optimal would be to see if its PC100 or 133, but i doubt a simple shell tool can do that
[08:26] <ifireball> !ramfs
[08:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ramfs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:27] <sybariten> psusi: i did try vmstat, but the output didnt make me any smarter ... never tried "free" though
[08:27] <thor> atlas95: just a guess...did you mount /media/DOCUMENTS as root?
[08:27] <sybariten> well, whaddaya know. Looks like i have 256 megs installed.
[08:27] <atlas95> it is an usb disk
[08:27] <atlas95> and i can read it
[08:27] <chuckyp> ifireball, IS that the proper one?  Both are in my path however.  /usr/local/bin doens't exist but its in my path.
[08:27] <atlas95> but it is just mpd which bug :/
[08:28] <atlas95> when i do ls -l /media/DOCUMENTS/Ma \Musique
[08:28] <hoelk> hmm i have two soundcards (and a tv card which is also recognized as soundcard), and whenever i boot they are adressed differently (eg: plughw:0,0 plughw:1,0 etc...), how can i assign them a fix adress?
[08:28] <atlas95> I have atlas:atlas
[08:28] <hoelk> (alsa)
[08:28] <sybariten> thanks psusi
[08:28] <ifireball> chuckyp: basically its where you put stuff you install locally so you can neatly seperate is from the package system
[08:29] <chuckyp> ifireball, gotcha also is /opt supposed to be writable by users?
[08:29] <ragnar_123> hey guys
[08:29] <atlas95> thor: ... :
[08:29] <atlas95> (
[08:29] <bieb_work> I am having an issue with installing 6.06 on my system with a 3ware 80062LP, 2 80gb drives in RAID1, after the install when it reboots, it comes up with "Boot from CD/DVD" but there is no CD or DVD in the drive, then it just dies
[08:29] <thor> atlas95: <thinking>
[08:29] <chuckyp> ifireball, cuz it doesn't look that way but I just wrote to it as a user without using sudo
[08:29] <ifireball> chuckyp: /opt is a redhat invention I'm opposed to, but users shouldnt be able to write anywhere outside of /home and /var
[08:30] <jvolkman> and /tmp
[08:30] <chuckyp> ifireball, yeah but I can try it  write to /opt
[08:30] <thor> atlas95: don't have experience with mpd...and don't have it installed so I can't try it.
[08:30] <selinuxium> since upgrading to edgy totem has  taken over instead of mozilla-mplayer. how do i get mplayer working in the browser again
[08:30] <selinuxium> ?
[08:30] <thor> atlas95: but it sounds like a permission problem. I have run into those before with usb drives.
[08:30] <atlas95> erf ok :(
[08:31] <ifireball> chuckyp: if you can write there I suppose you should chown and chmod it
[08:31] <chuckyp> ifireball, wth I know I moved azureus here and didn't use sudo maybe I did let me scrool up
[08:31] <lullabud> ifireball:  is opt really a redhat thing?
[08:31] <lullabud> ifireball:  i'm pretty sure i saw that in solaris too...
[08:31] <coNP> I think it is a unix thing :)
[08:31] <thor> atlas95: I found I have to give the system a minute after plugging in the drive to sort things out or I have permission problems
[08:31] <psusi> bieb_work: what is the name of the device you installed to?  can you get an fdisk -l on it?
[08:31] <lullabud> coNP:  that's what i think.
[08:31] <jvolkman> yeah, it is in solaris
[08:31] <coNP> lullabud: okay...
[08:31] <ifireball> lullabud: it came from old some unix, redhat afaik were the 1st to adopt it
[08:31] <psusi> yea, /opt was around long before redhat
[08:32] <bieb_work> psusi... I can look with the Ubuntu CD
[08:32] <atlas95> but my hard disk is plug since ...
[08:32] <lullabud> coNP:  oh, i mean i was agreeing with you... haha, not underscoring my opinion or anything
[08:32] <rukuartic> Hey all, figured I might ask here. I did some poor programming and ended up with lots of coredumps. Where does Ubuntu store coredumps? (They weren't in the working directory)
[08:32] <ifireball> lullabud: e.g. in Linux, note that everything from sourceforge ususally goes to /usr/local
[08:32] <psusi> bieb_work: and are you sure you have your bios configured to boot from the array?
[08:32] <bieb_work> yeah
[08:33] <psusi> rukuartic: iirc, they are disabled by default via setting the ulimit for core dump size to 0
[08:33] <bieb_work> psusi, I think Ubuntu sees it as a scsi array... one sec
[08:33] <chuckyp> ifireball, nm I did have sudo in there i'm retarded.
[08:33] <chuckyp> ifireball, if you are apposed to /opt where would you put software such as this in /usr/local/bin?
[08:33] <rukuartic> psusi: I'm sure I've gota bout a gig sitting around somewhere... but how would I check the ulimit? Is itin /etc?
[08:33] <psusi> bieb_work: yes, it should see one big scsi disk
[08:33] <ifireball> chuckyp: indeed
[08:34] <fredl> anybody happen to have bcm43xx_microcode2.fw for me?
[08:34] <chuckyp> ifireball, so just mv /opt/azureus /usr/local/bin/azureus
[08:34] <concept10> fredl, get it from the main site
[08:34] <ragnar_123> i have set up a tiny server, here at home. and i installed ubuntu successfully. right now everything works fine, but it's a server without screen, so i thougt of improving preformance by disabling the gui. how do i do that?
[08:34] <psusi> rukuartic: man ulimit... since it is set to 0 by default, you get no core dumps... but they usually go to the cwd of the process
[08:34] <fredl> I wanted to use bcm43xx-fwcutter but don't have the driver disk anywhere.
[08:34] <ifireball> chuckyp: dont bother, it isn't that important
[08:34] <Vaske_Car> What command it used to start real player from bash?
[08:34] <concept10> you dont need the driver disk
[08:34] <rukuartic> psusi: Thanks for the info :3
[08:34] <dcordes> all join #ubuntu-ch
[08:35] <fredl> concept10, oh they have a copy there? cool.
[08:35] <rukuartic> psusi: no man for ulimit. Found the exe though. I'll probably look online though. Thanks again.
[08:35] <fredl> concept10, http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/ ?
[08:35] <concept10> fredl, just go there, you'll see its easy... yes
[08:35] <chuckyp> ifireball, did you have to sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin  cuz I noticed on my edgy install its not there but its in my users path
[08:36] <recon0> In apt-cache, there is emacs and emacs21. What's the difference?
[08:36] <fredl> concept10, I must be blind then....
[08:36] <lullabud> recon0:  emacs is for minors.
[08:36] <Vaske_Car> its realplay   forun it....
[08:36] <thor> chuckyp: bin dirs should only contain executables...if you don't want /opt I would suggest /usr/local/share/azureus
[08:36] <jvolkman> nice one lullabud
[08:36] <thor> chuckyp: but I use /opt and I think it is part of LSB
[08:36] <ifireball> chuckyp: I have it, bun my system isn't a clean install, I suppose you should make it if you don't have it
[08:37] <bieb_work> PSUSI... if I go into System --> Admin --> Disks, the partition is listed as /dev/sda1
[08:37] <ifireball> chuckyp: sorry for my bad typing
[08:37] <quintin> I need a command line software sound equalizer
[08:37] <quintin> any ideas?
[08:37] <recon0> lullabud: does that amount to "don't use emacs"?
[08:37] <concept10> fredl, ok, let me refresh my mind on this.  I know that you get the files (looking) and the fwcutter tool should be in the repos
[08:37] <jvolkman> chuckyp, just use /opt, man
[08:37] <ifireball> quintin: you mean a volume control?
[08:37] <rukuartic> jvolkman: would you just ln -s something to /usr/bin then?
[08:37] <psusi> bieb_work: and it only shows sda correct?  no sdb?
[08:37] <ifireball> !aumixer
[08:37] <lullabud> recon0:  well, are you over 21?
[08:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about aumixer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:38] <quintin> ifireball: I mean what I just frikkin said.  equalizer.  not volume control.
[08:38] <ifireball> !aumix
[08:38] <ubotu> aumix: Simple text-based mixer control program. In component universe, is extra. Version 2.8-17 (edgy), package size 75 kB, installed size 440 kB
[08:38] <rukuartic> ubotu: uptime
[08:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uptime - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:38] <recon0> lullabud: no.
[08:38] <lullabud> recon0:  actually i don't know what i'm talking about.  i use vim.
[08:38] <recon0> ...
[08:38] <darklinux> i have problems to compile amarok with ubuntu patches 1.44 with helix support
[08:38] <fredl> concept10, all I've found so far is that you need to have the driver disk for your NIC and then use bcm43xx-fwcutter to extract the firmware.
[08:38] <lullabud> recon0:  it was a joke man!
[08:38] <darklinux> http://paste.lisp.org/display/29381
[08:38] <bieb_work> psusi... sda1 is swap and sda2 is 72gb of unused
[08:38] <darklinux> sorry
[08:39] <psusi> bieb_work: then where did you install to?
[08:39] <jvolkman> recon0: apt-cache show emacs
[08:39] <jvolkman> recon0: clearly says that it simply points to the current version of emacs (emacs21)
[08:39] <concept10> fredl, no, that shouldnt be correct. You need to get the bcm43xx linux drivers. the fwcutter just extracts the firmware into a directory on your system
[08:40] <psusi> bieb_work: it looks like you never installed ubuntu
[08:40] <bieb_work> that is a good question.. I thought Ubuntu auto built the /boot partition, cause I didnt see an option for it when it gave me the install properties list
[08:40] <concept10> fredl, are you on dapper or edgy?
[08:40] <fredl> concept10, well I got the Linux driver installed but it complains it can't find the firmware so I think I need to extract the firmware from the original driver CD now.
[08:40] <fredl> concept10, Edgy
[08:40] <psusi> bieb_work: you don't have to have a seperate /boot, but you certainly need a root
[08:40] <quintin> My java plugin works with firefox.ubuntu, but not with my /opt/firefox which is mozilla.com build.  any ideas?
[08:40] <bieb_work> psusi... I am restarting the installer...
[08:41] <Gnewf> any way from the command line to get a frame from a video file and save it as an image?
[08:41] <concept10> fredl, okay, gimme a sec, im still looking
[08:41] <thor> quintin: just copy all the files in the original firefox/plugins directory to the /opt/firefox/plugins directory
[08:41] <yah_> bonjour a tous
[08:42] <bieb_work> psusi... I am at the install/edit partition screen
[08:42] <fredl> concept10 I also still have the original windows installed on another partition so I *should* have the driver files, no?
[08:42] <fowlduck> anyone have ubuntu running on the intel macs?
[08:42] <chuckyp> F it i'm just going to use gnome-bt
[08:42] <psusi> bieb_work: ok... the big unused partition should be set to be mounted as /
[08:42] <B_Lizzard> My Ubuntu has gone wild!
[08:42] <justin_> To remove a "binary" program I compiled myself to /usr/local/bin -- can I simply delete it? and the menu entry? - Or do I need to find the equivalent to windows dll/libs etc?
[08:43] <quintin> justin_: 'make uninstall clean' from the source dir.
[08:43] <fredl> B_Lizzard, cool.
[08:43] <justin_> quintin: There is no uninstall file :(
[08:43] <fowlduck> psusi, if there isn't an OS installed on it, don't mount it as /
[08:43] <bieb_work> psusi.. I have linux swap at 2gb
[08:43] <justin_> I have tryed that before, program in question is Amule
[08:43] <B_Lizzard> It failed to recongise my sound card at startup for the first time in 1 year, and the system beep has moved it's way to my speakers!
[08:43] <quintin> justin_: no, there is a Makefile.  In the source directory.
[08:43] <psusi> justin_: hopefully the original tarball contains a rule for make uninstall, otherwise yea, you have to hunt down all the files by hand
[08:43] <cdubya> I have an older Debian system that was running dual drives and the machine froze at one point and has since only gotten worse (I suspect the primary drive is failing). That said, I tried to boot the Dapper LiveCD and try to mount the drives from there, but I couldn't even get it to boot fully without errors if the primary was hooked up and wouldn't finish booting with just the secondary hooked up. Anyone have any ideas for me to 
[08:43] <cherubiel> justin_: there should be an uninstall target in the makefile
[08:43] <yah_> je me demandais avec ma config (cpu:600mhz ; ram:128) si je pouvais passer de ubuntu 5.10 a unbuntu/kubuntu 6 ?
[08:44] <quintin> justin_: make uninstall.
[08:44] <quintin> justin_: or make deinstall
[08:44] <psusi> fowlduck: there will be when he tells the installer to use it for /
[08:44] <quintin> yah_: speak frikkin english. :)
[08:44] <cherubiel> !fr | yah_
[08:44] <ubotu> yah_: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:44] <quintin> ooh
[08:44] <B_Lizzard> allez!
[08:44] <quintin> there are channels for different languages?  cool
[08:44] <concept10> fredl, Check this out.  Youre not understanding me.  You dont need the windows drivers anymore.  this is not ndiswrapper, these are drivers written for linux.  They call it 'firmware'  You have to find the source and the bcm43xx-fwcutter just extracts them to /usr/lib/firmware
[08:44] <Vaske_Car> I had a lot less problems with 6.06 than with Edgy....
[08:44] <yah_> sorry I though be in ubuntu-fr
[08:44] <justin_> I deleted the /Amule/ source directory, so I guess I removed the make 'uninstall' file huh lol :()
[08:45] <fowlduck> psusi, oh, i thought something else was goin on, ignore me :)
[08:45] <fredl> concept10, oh okay cool. So where do I find the source for my NIC?
[08:45] <quintin> justin_: so get it again then.  and next time install with apt ;)
[08:45] <psusi> bieb_work: and?
[08:45] <bieb_work> psusi, I added the 72.5 gb as ext3 and will give it a mount point of /   correct?
[08:45] <justin_> quintin: Apt is not bad, but I like to watch my PC "make" files ;D
[08:45] <psusi> bieb_work: yes
[08:45] <thor> justin_: when I compile a program I always move the source to /usr/local/src...just for this reason
[08:45] <bieb_work> ok
[08:45] <Poser> How do I add new apps to start when my system starts? IE Gmail Notifier?
[08:45] <quintin> justin_: uhm.  right!
[08:45] <fredl> concept10, I find a lot of different sources in /usr/share/doc/bcm43xx-fwcutter/README.gz
[08:45] <concept10> fredl, I dont know where they moved the driver download (im looking) ... they have since moved the driver into the linux kernel so I think they took the download down
[08:45] <cherubiel> Poser: gnome?
[08:46] <secretum> I have a question
[08:46] <Poser> Yup.
[08:46] <justin_> thor: Yeah, seems like I will do that from now on.. - I always thought Linux binaries were stand alone files, that simply were dependant on libs already installed.
[08:46] <Poser> System>Prefs>Sessions>Startup... but what if I don't know the exact name of the executable? How can I find it?
[08:46] <thor> justin_: no, if anything they are sometimes worse than windows dll files (did he really say that!)
[08:46] <recon0> I just compiled a perfectly good c "hello world" program with gcc, and when I try to run it, I get "Segmentation Fault (core dumped)". I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen.
[08:47] <psusi> justin_: the make process does not install any libs... you have to do that yourself... but it probably installs a number of files including man pages, help files, config files, in addition to any binaries
[08:47] <concept10> fredl, hmm, i didnt have that readme on my system
[08:47] <denmagisketanogp> Is there anyone who has a script which can show the syslog onto the desktop background?
[08:47] <bieb_work> psusi... the installer is running
[08:47] <quintin> recon0: pastebin the source
[08:47] <justin_> Oh well you learn something new every day, and now I guess I understand why I am losing so much freespace so quickly.. even though I "Delete" the programs heh
[08:47] <secretum> I am testing out Ubuntu using the live CD right now, I have tried both Dapper and Edgy, but I have a problem with Edgy which is not a problem in Dapper
[08:47] <fredl> concept10, it's part of the bcm43xx-fwcutter package on Edgy.
[08:47] <pumaandre> Q: I want to set up an MTA on my Ubuntu box. I need IMAP/POP/SMTP. I know it might be a silly question, but what is the best server software for this task?
[08:47] <justin_> alright thanks
[08:48] <recon0> quintin: after including stdio.h, the source is "void main(){printf("\nHello World\n");}".
[08:48] <quintin> pumaandre: define 'best'.
[08:48] <concept10> fredl, thats cool
[08:48] <fredl> concept10, I just don't have a clue which 'source' to chose though.
[08:48] <mnepton> pumaandre: postfix or exim, depending on your kink
[08:48] <quintin> pumaandre: that's VERY ambigous, don't you think?  I use courier-imap and courier-imaps
[08:48] <concept10> fredl, te edgy package?
[08:48] <quintin> pumaandre: and postfix
[08:48] <fredl> concept10, this wireless card is built in on the mobo and I don't have a clue what brand/make it is.
[08:48] <psusi> pumaandre: I use dovecot for imap and postfix for smtp
[08:49] <pumaandre> quintin: does postfix support imap?
[08:49] <concept10> fredl, what does lspci tell you?
[08:49] <secretum> Edgy doesn't allow me to set my monitor to my normal resolution, 1280x1024, only 1024x768.  However, on Dapper it works fine. Does anyone have an idea why?
[08:49] <fredl> concept10, I just see it in lspci output: 03:01.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4303 802.11b Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
[08:49] <psusi> pumaandre: no... postfix is an smtp server...
[08:49] <fredl> OH!
[08:49] <fredl> argh
[08:49] <fredl> wait
[08:49] <fredl> I suck
[08:50] <fredl> DUUUUUH, I'm sorry it's not in the mobo it's a linksys card I put in!
[08:50] <fredl> by god am I forgetfull sometimes.
[08:50] <fredl> sjeez.
[08:50] <drarem> is there a way to free up some space on my dev/hda2?  after installing a few games and utils, my freespace dropped from 1.2Gb to 570Mb
[08:50] <secretum> Edgy doesn't allow me to set my monitor to my normal resolution, 1280x1024, only 1024x768.  However, on Dapper it works fine. Does anyone have an idea why?
[08:50] <pumaandre> ok, thanks. So why would I want postfix+some imap server when courier gives me both? (sorry if this seems stupid:-D)
[08:50] <fredl> now that should make it easier to choose since it's a linksys card.
[08:50] <jgarbers> hi - sorry for newb question but it looks like i installed Ubuntu without the development packages -- need to do a quick build, but i don't seem to have make, etc -- what's the appropriate package(s) for me to get, and how?
[08:51] <quintin> jgarbers: apt-get install build-essential
[08:51] <cherubiel> jgarbers: build-essential
[08:51] <concept10> fredl, so youre trying to get the linksys card working not the broadcom?
[08:51] <jgarbers> thanks
[08:51] <fredl> concept10, there's a broadcom chipset on the linksys card.
[08:51] <quintin> ifireball: I installed aumix, but I don't have a bass or treble control inside it
[08:51] <psusi> drarem: yea... delete some stuff?
[08:51] <rukuartic> From my ephesius fredl and concept10, the bcm drives that come preloaded don't work
[08:51] <drarem> i guess, is there like an uninstall or something
[08:52] <drarem> or resizing the partition?
[08:52] <bulong> ISO the download from ubuntu site should be bootable right?
[08:52] <rukuartic> *experience = ephesius
[08:52] <cherubiel> drarem: gparted
[08:52] <quintin> bulong: yes
[08:52] <rukuartic> bulong: You can boot from it, but you don't need to "burn it as bootable"
[08:52] <kikokos> hi I have short q: "I want to have ftp server" what application program you can reccomend me ?
[08:52] <psusi> drarem: if there is free space or another partition you can shrink, sure
[08:52] <quintin> drarem: what are you trying to resize?  partition or filesystem ?
[08:52] <mnepton> kikokos: vsftpd
[08:52] <rukuartic> kikokos: proftpd, it should be in the repositories
[08:52] <kikokos> thankyou
[08:53] <rukuartic> kikokos: either way you can search with apt-cache search ftpd
[08:53] <quintin> proftpd sux
[08:53] <psusi> drarem: fire up gparted from the livecd to resize partitions
[08:53] <cedd> ok i finaly partition the disk in raid 0 --- i created a non raid 1g boot on sda (/media/sda1)... when ubuntu finish installing all package, it want to install the boot loader, so i specify the location /dev/sda1 .. but it fails to install any idea why
[08:53] <mnepton> vsftpd has the lowest security silouhette
[08:53] <concept10> fredl, I checked the bcm43xx-fwcutter, it looks like it doesnt include the firmware
[08:53] <drarem> its the /dev/hda2 - contains my ubuntu
[08:53] <fredl> concept10, I know!
[08:53] <bulong> my system doesnt seem to recognize its a bootable CDROM after I burned it..its the ISO download, i can mount it okay thoug via -o loop, any other checks  I can make to see if its bootable?
[08:53] <drarem> the /dev/hda1 is the windoze one
[08:53] <fredl> heh
[08:53] <concept10> fredl, i dont know why the hell they moved the downloads
[08:54] <pumaandre> quintin: you say you use courier. Why is that? Why is it better than the rest?
[08:54] <fredl> concept10, copyright issues maybe?
[08:54] <mnepton> fredl: you get the fw cutter app, use it to extract the firmware injected into the card or from the Windows driver, and then inject that firmware into the card to use it under Ubuntu
[08:54] <quintin> pumaandre: I use it because it works.  please don't bother me on this topic.  just use what works for you
[08:54] <ifireball> bulong: you can try hex-reading the 1st 1024 bytes, othewise try booting it with vmware or some other vm
[08:54] <chuckyp> Anyone know how to redraw the desktop without restarting X or loging out?
[08:54] <zukalk> has anyone got any idea on why i have to manually enter the nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf (i do it through network-admin) every time i boot? i connect wirelessly to a router
=== vegansickle is now known as sephyria
[08:55] <psusi> bulong: check its md5sum?
[08:55] <pumaandre> ok, sorry
[08:55] <phanter> hi people. I am strugling with lvm2 and it is not going as planned. I just had to fix a hardware problem and then a drive changed from location in /dev/hdc1 to /dev/hdb1. How do I now remove the old (non excisting) drive from the lvm and how to isntall the new one (the man pages are very unclear about this)
[08:55] <recon0> quintin: forget about it. I recompiled it, and it worked. weird.
[08:55] <fredl> mnepton, well that's the issue, I can't find my friggen driver CD for that card anymore :)
[08:55] <quintin> zukalk: /etc/resolv.conf is reset by dhcp when you boot.   search the ubuntu forums for /etc/resolv.conf
[08:55] <concept10> fredl, no, it cant be copyright issues, they wouldnt have included the firmware in the kernel
[08:55] <quintin> quintin: ok.  I forget what I'm forgetting about.  but I trust you
[08:55] <zukalk> quintin: i will, thanks
[08:55] <mnepton> fredl: download the Windows driver from Linksys
[08:56] <psusi> cedd: could you be more specific?   also 1 gig is HUGE for /boot, 50-100 megs should be sufficient

[08:58] <Juan___> Is anyone using NFS ?
[08:58] <fredl> mnepton I found the disk, it's a linksysWAP11v2.6
[08:58] <psusi> cedd: for starters, what do you mean by "it fails to install"?  "it does not work" is not a good error description... and why are you installing the boot loader manually?  the setup program does this for you

[08:59] <malcobich> hi
[08:59] <malcobich> hi
[08:59] <malcobich> hi
[08:59] <lk11mn> howdy... so anyway, i downloaded and installed dmraid, and done dmraid -ay and it activated 2 of the disks i have in raid 1 on isw, but my sil disks dont seem to activate, any ideas psusi?
[08:59] <fredl> concept10, you are *sure* about that?
[08:59] <malcobich> hi
[08:59] <dredhammer> hmm it seems to give me an error related to x264 about an unknown parameter
[08:59] <GaiaX11> Which is the best linux mp3 downloader?
[08:59] <ifireball> quintin: yea, I suppose you want a REAL soft DSP, I donno any such programs
[08:59] <dv_> GaiaX11, mplayer
[08:59] <cedd> psusi yes it ask me do i want to install it in raid or i can choose a specifique location... i create a /boot partition outside the raid on my first hd
[08:59] <dv_> -dumpstream is your friend
[08:59] <GaiaX11> dv_: Not a player.
[08:59] <fredl> concept10, I mean I'm happy to go along with what you're saying but it's different from what mnepton just said and what I have understood in the past.
[08:59] <quintin> GaiaX11: no war3z talk, eh
[09:00] <drarem>   /dev/hda2     ext3     11G  9.3G  353M  97% /
[09:00] <savvas> GaiaX11: wget
[09:00] <cedd> thats where i m trying to install it in /sda1
[09:00] <psusi> cedd: and?
[09:00] <concept10> fredl, thats what I attempted to explain earlier
[09:00] <mnepton> pazemlsqdfmoj: >/dev/null 2>&1
[09:00] <dv_> GaiaX11, with -dumpstream mplayer behaves just like a downloader
[09:00] <drarem> that means i have 3% available?
[09:00] <dv_> it dumps the stream into "stream.dump"
[09:00] <GaiaX11> dv_: A program to download mp3 songs
[09:00] <dv_> yes, I know
[09:00] <savvas> GaiaX11: wget is a downloader
[09:00] <psusi> drarem: yes
[09:00] <sioux> a programamm to lissen radio?
[09:00] <drarem> and /dev/hda1     ntfs     60G   38G   23G  63% /media/windows
[09:01] <concept10> fredl, bcm43xx is a friver (firmware) written for linux for broadcom based cards, youre not wrapping a windows driver
[09:01] <ubuntu_newb> pazemlsqdfmoj: as long as rss_update is the name of the file you wish to run.  It don't have an extension such as .php
[09:01] <cedd> when i tell lilo to install it in /dev/sda1.. its telling me this partition is not active, then ask me if i wanna make it active, i said yes.. then i get the error that lilo failed to install in /dev/sda1
[09:01] <dv_> whats so special about an "mp3 downloader" that cannot be done with wget or mplayer?
[09:01] <zukalk> quintin: found a very, ahem, technical solution to my problem, which is to sudo chmod -w /etc/resolv.conf. i'll still have to find out what caused this in the first place (problem started a few days ago)
[09:01] <pazemlsqdfmoj> ubuntu_newb: i know, its a small script which has a php command inside it
[09:01] <savvas> dv_: maybe he meant p2p, like frostwire heh
[09:01] <psusi> cedd: why not use grub?  and you want to install to /dev/sda... not sda1
[09:01] <fredl> concept10, well then there's still the issue where I find the firmware for this card that I have identified as a WAP11v2.6 card.
[09:01] <dv_> savvas, oh
[09:02] <sioux> runs froswire?
[09:02] <cedd> ok so i dont need to put the 1 after sda
[09:02] <lk11mn> psusi i used dmraid, it picks up both of my raid controllers, but it only activates the intel one, the sil one doesnt seem to activate, even tho dmraid -r lists it and all the drives on it
[09:02] <GaiaX11> savvas: I know, but i'd like something similar to kazzar. But, better
[09:02] <dv_> GaiaX11, amule (emule cross-platform version). but if you download ILLEGAL stuff with it the **AA will bite you.
[09:02] <cedd> well lilo is the one that popup in the installation
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[09:02] <dv_> so download only legal stuff. </disclaimer>
[09:02] <psusi> lk11mn: you run dmraid -ay and you only see the one array in /dev/mapper?
[09:02] <concept10> fredl, is that the same one based on the 4303 chipset
[09:03] <volvoguy> i'm back with more questions, aren't you thrilled?!
[09:03] <ubuntu_newb> pazemlsqdfmoj: Then you will probably want to add .php at the end of that cron command
[09:03] <ubuntu_newb> it is most likely a .php script
[09:03] <zukalk> volvoguy: i sure am
[09:03] <volvoguy> zukalk, :)
[09:03] <GaiaX11> dv_: I tried this, but it is very slow
[09:03] <ubuntu_newb> I believe that cron should run every 30 mins the way you have it configured.
[09:03] <fredl> concept10, yup. this is the WAP card: 03:01.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4303 802.11b Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
[09:03] <dv_> GaiaX11, probably you didnt forward the ports correctly
[09:04] <dv_> are you behind a router?
[09:04] <lk11mn> psusi well yeh, the same one shows up twice isw_hebacbgjj_data/data_1
[09:04] <pazemlsqdfmoj> ubuntu_newb: the script has a cd, a php and a wget command in it
[09:04] <volvoguy> is the server kernel SMP capable?
[09:04] <cedd> i thought i needed to say /dev/sda1 since i got a /boot swap and raid in sda
[09:04] <psusi> lk11mn: but not the via?  yet it shows up in dmraid -r?  hrm...
[09:04] <dv_> anyway, if your ID is low, then your ports dont forward correctly
[09:04] <savvas> GaiaX11: frostwire: www.frostwire.com
[09:04] <zukalk> volvoguy: the thrill has faded away... can't help you on that one ;)
[09:04] <psusi> lk11mn: what raid type is it?
[09:04] <volvoguy> zukalk, dang.
[09:05] <Poromenos> What's a good program for burning CDs and DVDs?
[09:05] <sioux> here frost does not start
[09:05] <savvas> GaiaX11: you'll also need sun java: sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin sun-java5-jre
[09:05] <psusi> cedd: the boot loader needs installed to the master boot record of the drive rather than in an individual partition
[09:05] <savvas> sioux: it starts for me
[09:05] <lk11mn> psusi Sil is stripe and isw is "group"
[09:05] <pazemlsqdfmoj> is cron turned on by default?
[09:05] <pazemlsqdfmoj> or do i have to activate it somewhere?
[09:05] <psusi> cedd: but I would suggest you use grub, and a smaller /boot... 50-100 megs is sufficient
[09:05] <sioux> savv how you did?
[09:05] <cedd> so it will auto detect /boot sda1 if i say sda
[09:05] <dv_> savvas, aint kazaa very much dead by now?
[09:06] <savvas> sioux: you have to change #!/usr/sh to #!/usr/bash in the script :P
[09:06] <savvas> dv_: gnutella is not kazaa :)
[09:06] <volvoguy> i have RAID questions too, but i'll let these settle down before i add to the confusion. :)
[09:06] <sioux> savv which script?
[09:06] <psusi> cedd: no... it is asking where to install the MBR... that goes in the first sector of the disk... it has nothing to do with where /boot is
[09:06] <yahalom> can someone tell me where i can find the fedora equivalent of etc/sysconfig/network in ubuntu?
[09:06] <fr500> hello
[09:06] <concept10> fredl, the reason is as I expected, they removed the drivers due to the fact that they are now included in the kernel.  but you still should be able to download them somewhere
[09:06] <Poromenos> What's a good program for burning CDs and DVDs?
[09:07] <psusi> lk11mn: which one doesn't show?  the strip or the group?
[09:07] <Tinned_Tuna> Foromenos: K3b
[09:07] <dv_> savvas, IIRC gnutella was a bandwith killer?
[09:07] <quintin> where is the default firefox plugins folder ?
[09:07] <Poromenos> Tinned_Tuna: great, thanks
[09:07] <volvoguy> but anyone feel free to chime in about the server kernel as i continue to google.
[09:07] <fr500> is there a filesystem that can make HDs on other computers appear as part of my local hod?
[09:07] <fr500> HD
[09:07] <quintin> Poromenos: k3b
[09:07] <savvas> sioux / GaiaX11 : when you install frostwire, do: sudo gedit /usr/bin/frostwire
[09:07] <cedd> ok ill try it if it doesnt work ill come back with more details in the error msg
[09:07] <Tinned_Tuna> lol, I can neither spell nor read
[09:07] <quintin> fr500: ehm.  smbmount, nfs, etc, etc
[09:07] <savvas> sioux / GaiaX11 : then change #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash
[09:07] <fredl> concept10, Hmmm. so if it's included in the kernel now... could it be I'm still using the old module which I built to try and get it to work?
[09:07] <sioux> ok i will
[09:08] <lk11mn> the one i want doesnt show... group (isw)shows up, but stripe(sil) is missing
[09:08] <fr500> quintin: hmm
[09:08] <fr500> not exactly
[09:08] <lk11mn> psusi the one i want doesnt show... group (isw)shows up, but stripe(sil) is missing
[09:08] <notwist> where is the default apache dir? with the .html file that says "apache is installed" and whatever?
[09:08] <fr500> i want them to work as a part of my main partition
[09:08] <quintin> notwist: /var/www
[09:08] <psusi> lk11mn: strange....
[09:08] <notwist> quintin: thanks
[09:08] <quintin> fr500: so mount them wherever.
[09:08] <quintin> where are firefox plugins at ?
[09:09] <psusi> lk11mn: only 2 disks in the stripe?
[09:09] <bieb_work> psusi... the installer has completed, and rebooted... still the same issue.. no boot
[09:09] <concept10> fredl, the problem is that edgy used 2.6.17, they are in the 2.6.18 kernel, I know, I downloaded it the other day
[09:09] <Scorpmoon> how do you know beforehand buying a monitor, if Ubuntu supports it?
[09:09] <fr500> quintin: still not, i know i can mount, i want some disk on a remote pc to appear as it was part of my main HD, like it was one bigger HD. Like LVM ovcr the net or something
[09:09] <concept10> fredl, but try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174&highlight=broadcom
[09:09] <foysavas> generally all monitors are supported
[09:09] <Rick-uk> new to this - could someone help me with getting the bbc.co.uk website audio/video to work?  I am running Edubuntu and Firefox.  Plug-ins don't install on thislike they do on Windoze or Mac
[09:09] <lk11mn> psusi dmraid -r shows all 5 disks, 2 in "group" (isw) and 3 in "stripe" (sil)
[09:09] <fredl> concept10, according to http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/: This driver was included into the Linux kernel since 2.6.17-rc2
[09:09] <spamyboy> Pleas anyone click on this link (afiliat): http://www.tufat.com/aff.php?id=3138 (i need more 40 click to purcha one script) Thank you
[09:10] <quintin> fr500: beyond me.
[09:10] <foysavas> support for certain video cards is the issue most the time
[09:10] <fr500> i think gfs had such thing
[09:10] <concept10> fredl, oh
[09:10] <anan> hi, can someone help me please ? Where is the startup programs lists(default) located ?
[09:10] <psusi> bieb_work: which partition did you assign to the root?
[09:10] <Scorpmoon> Does anyone use Mirai DML-519W100 19" widescreen with Ubuntu ?
[09:10] <psusi> lk11mn: and is that information correct?
[09:10] <bieb_work> sda2 is /
[09:10] <concept10> fredl, that forum page says you need the driver cd, but if you read it, it doesnt even use it in the instasll
[09:10] <foysavas> System -> Preferences -> Sessions has the startup stuff for individual users
[09:11] <lk11mn> psusi yeh 100%
[09:11] <volvoguy> seems strange that it's not documented anywhere (that i can find) if the server kernel supports SMP. weird.
[09:11] <psusi> bieb_work: and what does the disks applet on the livecd say about that partition?
[09:11] <fredl> concept10, well the readme for bcm43xx-fwcutter says you need the driver CD too.
[09:11] <anan> thanks foysavas, but i need the file where this list is stored
[09:11] <GaiaX11> savvas dv_ thx a lot. I am downloading frostwire to have a go
[09:11] <bieb_work> hold one sec as I restart with the livecd
[09:11] <psusi> lk11mn: try asking dmraid to activate that set explicitly
[09:11] <concept10> fredl, try this http://boredklink.googlepages.com/wl_apsta.o
[09:12] <bmk789> flash player wont output any sound, is there a simple solution to solving this?
[09:12] <lk11mn> yeh i went dmraid -ay sil (which is supposed to do that)
[09:12] <fredl> concept10, but maybe we're talking apples and oranges and is that forum page for pre 2.6.17 kernels and I'm just having problems because of earlier attempts that mess up the running kernel somehow
[09:12] <grndslm> lvm, anyone?
[09:12] <GaiaX11> dv_: Can mplayer download mp3 songs?
[09:12] <dv_> GaiaX11, not like a p2p app
[09:12] <savvas> GaiaX11: if it's still not running after changing that line in the script, select sun jre: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[09:12] <dv_> but for example if you have an mp3 stream
[09:12] <Poser> Hey! Are there any "Must have" apps for ubuntu I should know about? Like cool applets for the desktop and such?
[09:12] <dv_> you can get it directly with -dumpstream
[09:12] <lk11mn> psusi i tried dmraid -ay sil (which is supposed to do that)
[09:12] <dv_> this way you can also grab mms/rtsp streams
[09:12] <sioux> savv it already was as y mentioned
[09:13] <kamui> anyone have any knowledge on why the synaptic touchpad driver is so unstable after upgrading to edgy?  the mouse cursor sometimes sticks, and occasionally just warps around the screen when I touch the pad
[09:13] <lk11mn> and also with the name quoted from dmraid -r
[09:13] <jsteidl> Hi all!
[09:13] <psusi> lk11mn: and what did dmraid say?
[09:13] <jsteidl> Is there any sources.list-specialist in here? ;)
[09:13] <fredl> concept10, what's the http://boredklink.googlepages.com/wl_apsta.o ??
[09:13] <fredl> a .o file?
[09:13] <psusi> lk11mn: ohh, you ARE using the package attached to the bug linked from the howto right?
[09:13] <lk11mn> psusi it just came back to the command prompt
[09:14] <concept10> fredl, that is the file that the fwcutter extracts for you.. thats the one we have been looking to download
[09:14] <volvoguy> i wonder if the devs would be pissed if i asked 'em there.
[09:14] <savvas> sioux: select java-1.5.0-sun: sudo update-alternatives --config java && frostwire
[09:14] <yahalom> where is the IPv6 setting in ubuntu?
[09:14] <sioux> ok i will
[09:14] <yahalom> NETWORKING_IPV6=yes
[09:15] <yahalom> where is that?
[09:15] <bieb_work> psusi... you want the properties or the partitions?
[09:15] <jsteidl> anybody: i have a problem with the sources.list of my fileserver. a apt-get update does not work because of 404 Errors, allthough i can browse the repos of my source.list with my browser without a problem... anybody has a hint for me?
[09:15] <KenSentMe> !easysource | jsteidl
[09:15] <ubotu> jsteidl: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[09:15] <fredl> concept10, ehr... okay, but the Driver wants to see a file called bcm43xx_microcode2.fw
[09:15] <anan> can someone help me, where is the startup list file ? (and not the UI one of session)
[09:15] <savvas> sioux: if you still get an error, paste it here, by running frostwire in terminal
[09:15] <psusi> bieb_work: it doesn't say it is unused does it?  you should be able to moun it and see files on it
[09:16] <sioux> savv I did it started but is froze in starting connection
[09:17] <concept10> fredl, hehe, thats what the fwcutter does.  it extracts those files from the wl_apsta.o file
[09:17] <sioux> is it a isp filter?
[09:17] <bieb_work> psusi... If I look at the partitions it says Swap is sda1 and partition 2 is inaccessible, but I can set an access path and mount it
[09:17] <hamsterman> i need help with a sound problem
[09:17] <fredl> whoah bcm43xx-fwcutter -l wl_apsta.o
[09:17] <fredl> that gives a ton of output
[09:17] <lk11mn> psusi DMRAID 1.0.0rc11 is the one suggested on the bug report, but im pretty sure it was rc6 maybe rc7 that installed from synaptic... right, well i guess i'll go at it again (i kinda thought i'd be getting the latest version using the updater :S )
[09:17] <Spee_Der> yahalom: etc/sysconfig/network
[09:18] <psusi> bieb_work: and can you see files on the partition once you mount it?
[09:18] <sioux> savv it is up but i can't get connection
[09:18] <magicmike> I need help with a display problem.
[09:18] <bieb_work> yes
[09:18] <hamsterman> my sound works in firefox, and at the ubuntu login, but not on any other apps.
[09:18] <psusi> lk11mn: attached to the bug report is a package of rc13, use that one
[09:18] <psusi> lk11mn: the one that got shipped with edgy was borked unfortunately
[09:19] <bieb_work> psusi, once mounted, sda2 has all the files you would expect from an install including the home dir for the default user
[09:19] <fredl> concept10, LOL: *****: Sorry, it's not possible to extract "bcm43xx_microcode13.fw".
[09:19] <fredl> *****: Extracting firmware from an old driver is bad.
[09:19] <psusi> bieb_work: and /boot/grub?
[09:19] <concept10> fredl, thats what it is saying?
[09:19] <psusi> bieb_work: err, wait, that's on the other partition right?
[09:19] <jsteidl> KenSentMe, although i've allready tried to use the default sources.list i tried it again with this one... same error: "connection error". Any clues?
[09:19] <vapo> hi, i got a problem im installing edgy from the net and the installer fails to download a file ,says the mirror doesnt have it, i tried alot of different mirrors but none seems to host it
[09:19] <concept10> fredl, i d/led the file, im trying noiw
[09:20] <bieb_work> which partition?
[09:20] <fredl> concept10, yeah but it does extract a bunch of other files from wl_apsta.o
[09:20] <KenSentMe> jsteidl: no, but maybe you can ask to someone in general
[09:20] <lk11mn> psusi just another thing i noticed. when i was going to do the install, and it detected the isw. When im in "select a disk" it gives me both of the mirrored drives in /dev/mapper as an option?! surely it should only show me one?
[09:20] <psusi> bieb_work: did you assign a seperate /boot partition?
[09:20] <bieb_work> no
[09:20] <vapo> its one of the installer components : nic-restricted-firmware-2.6.17-10-386-di
[09:20] <hamsterman> can anybody please help me with a sound problem?
[09:21] <bobby_> I have a little problem, i want to connect my mic or my guitar into my Ubuntu for recording/processing, when I do it, i can hear the guitar through the speakers, but no program can detect the input, anyone can help?
[09:21] <psusi> lk11mn: there is one disk and one partition on that disk ( the one ending in 1 ) in /dev/mapper
[09:21] <lk11mn> psusi /dev/mapper/isw_hebacbgjj_DATA and /dev/mapper/isw_hebacbgjj_DATA1 is this normal, and does it matter which i choose?
[09:22] <psusi> lk11mn: the one not ending in 1 is the whole raid array... the 1 is the first partition on it
[09:22] <hamsterman> daper drake sound trouble
[09:22] <psusi> lk11mn: if you want to install to that partition, then go with the one ending in 1
[09:22] <sephyria> anyone knw how to deal with this DCOPserver problem?
[09:22] <sephyria> ive read it has something to do with the FireFox
[09:22] <sephyria> and reinstalling it
[09:23] <bieb_work> psusi... There is a /boot/grub dir.. what do I need to check in there?
[09:23] <hamsterman> does anyone know about sound problems in 6.06 with abit mobos?
[09:23] <sephyria> but anyway my KDM session wont start cuz it doesnt think the DCOPserver is running
[09:23] <sioux> savv is it possible a java network problem?
[09:23] <fredl> concept10, it *does* extract bcm43xx_microcode2.fw however
[09:23] <ifireball> !hotkeys
[09:23] <ubotu> hotkeys: A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5.7.4 (edgy), package size 141 kB, installed size 384 kB
[09:23] <donfilipo> i have a few files reported with errors...can not install them without showing errors and can not remove them because of errors in synaptic...is there a way to repair errors in my installed packages?
[09:23] <hamsterman> :(
[09:23] <fredl> concept10, which is what daemon.log complaints about.
[09:23] <concept10> fredl, look.. http://pastie.caboo.se/21490
[09:23] <lk11mn> psusi ok, so i have 2 partitions on my striped set, when that's going it'll probably show me sil_xxxx_data , sil_xxxx_data1, sil_xxxx_data2 (so in windows data1 would be my c partition and data2 my d partition) ?? would that be right?
[09:23] <Poser> !applets
[09:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about applets - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:24] <Poser> !desklets
[09:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about desklets - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:24] <psusi> bieb_work: it's got stuff in it right?  and by /boot/grub I mean under the location where you mounted the hard disk, not literally /boot
[09:24] <deternal> request for help: I can't get my usb drive to work on 6.10, it worked on 6.06 and works in windows - the system detects the drive but doesn't recognize the partitions - the drive is formatted with fat
[09:24] <fredl> concept10, well I might not need the microcode13.fw file
[09:24] <concept10> fredl, is that the same out put you had?
[09:24] <psusi> lk11mn: yes
[09:24] <Lattyware> Anyone know of a bug in any recent update that kills twinview?
[09:24] <bieb_work> psusi... I mounted sda2 to a dir called "Sample".. I can see the /sample/boot/grub dir
[09:25] <fredl> concept10, yup, but hang on, getting something new now :)
[09:25] <Lattyware> Because I have been using it and suddently one of my monitors doesn't do anything
[09:25] <psusi> bieb_work: ok... then smack your bios around and configure it to boot from the hard drive and only the hard drive
[09:25] <fredl> concept10, eth1      IEEE 802.11b  ESSID:""  Nickname:"Broadcom 4301"
[09:25] <volvoguy> ok. server kernel IS SMP capable. Just FYI.
[09:25] <bieb_work> there are 11
[09:25] <Lattyware> (Not in a broken-hardware way)
[09:25] <bobby_> I have a little problem, i want to connect my mic or my guitar into my Ubuntu for recording/processing, when I do it, i can hear the guitar through the speakers, but no program can detect the input, anyone can help?
[09:25] <psusi> volvoguy: all kernels currently shipped in ubuntu are smp capable
[09:25] <bieb_work> is there something in /boot/grub I would check
[09:25] <fredl> concept10, I copied the extracted bcm43xx_microcode2.fw that daemon.log complained about into /lib/firmware
[09:26] <hamsterman> ac'97 problem- PLEASE HELP!
[09:26] <ifireball> Lattyware: closest thing I've seen recently was a kernel module update that made X segfault, reboot solved it; other thenm that twinview works fine for me
[09:26] <lk11mn> psusi ok thanks again - (and i dont know howwww the hell you can have that patience to do tech support x5 newbs at a time) thx again, dont forget to relax!
[09:26] <volvoguy> psusi, well where were you five minutes ago? hehe.
[09:26] <Lattyware> hmmm
[09:26] <concept10> fredl, huh? paste in that link I gave you
[09:26] <mc__> hi guys,im running a legacy 32-bit oss application on amd64,how to get the sound working? artsdsp and aoss did not work for me
[09:26] <Lattyware> Well, I just reinstalled Ubuntu (for other reasons) and the problem persists.
[09:26] <psusi> bieb_work: no... everything looks good, you just need to get the machine to boot off the disk
[09:26] <bieb_work> ok
[09:26] <rixxon> where to clear "recent documents" history for the gnome-main-menu package applet?
[09:26] <bieb_work> let me see what I can do
[09:26] <psusi> lk11mn: lol
[09:27] <volvoguy> duh. i forgot i could just cat /proc/cpuinfo
[09:27] <hamsterman> odd sound problem- please help
[09:27] <ifireball> Lathiat: take a look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log it may give you a hint
[09:27] <fredl> concept10, http://pastie.caboo.se/21491
[09:27] <hors> hola/hi
=== reZo is now known as phpError
[09:28] <hors> hola!!! / Hi!!!!
[09:28] <hamsterman> sound only working in firefox and at ubuntu startup- please help!
[09:28] <fredl> concept10, see? I now seem to have an eth1 after I copied that bcm43xx_microcode2.fw file into /lib/firmware
[09:28] <bilss_> hi
[09:28] <hors> hi
[09:28] <Justy-> Hello
[09:28] <Spee_Der> hi
[09:29] <hors> hello =3
[09:29] <vapo> what can i do when the net installer fails to download an installer-component (nic-restricted-firmware-2.6.17-10-386-di) from any mirror i choose ?
[09:29] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: What's up ?
[09:29] <concept10> fredl, you have to load the drivers into memory, do this:  lsmod | grep bcm
[09:29] <Tim90> hamsterman: try changing sount cards or testing the sound
[09:29] <bilss_> whats the apt-get for this missing library please libstdc++.so.5
[09:29] <fredl> concept10, yeah I have the drivers loaded already.
[09:29] <hamsterman> my soundcard came with my mobo
[09:29] <claviola> hi, where can I find this year's signing keys for the ubuntu archives?
[09:29] <hamsterman> it works in ff using flash
[09:29] <fredl> concept10, that's why it was probing constantly for the firmware
[09:29] <iqon> i can't get the <ctrl>+<alt>+L shortcut to work
[09:29] <Tim90> when dose it not work
[09:29] <volvoguy> next question. on this server, i just did a fresh install of the ubuntu server edition to replace an old and screwed up desktop-trying-to-be-a-server install. i unplugged my software RAID arrays for the install. in theory, can i just copy my old config files back in, plug in the hardware and reboot?
[09:29] <hors> ups. i thot than this place was to chating abot tribal thinks
[09:30] <fredl> concept10, it *works* ok? :)
[09:30] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Do you have a sound icon on your task bar somewhere please ?
[09:30] <hamsterman> no, sorry
[09:30] <concept10> fredl, oh, because you modprobed the  drivers?
[09:30] <Poromenos> I have mounted some NTFS partitions through fstab, how can I make them invisible except to some users in some particular group?
[09:30] <bilss_> volvoguy: you.ve been here a while?
[09:30] <fred_> anyone running beryl had the white-cube problem?
[09:30] <dave> hi all
[09:30] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Ok, look in the menu for your audio or sound control and open it and then go into preferences.
[09:30] <volvoguy> bilss_, i come and go. :)
[09:30] <fredl> concept10, exactly. I'm still a bit confuzzled why it doesn't see my AP, you see the rausb interface? it does see the AP.
[09:31] <dave> anyone having slow-downs on edgy with nvidia?
[09:31] <fredl> concept10, but from here I should be able to get it going.
[09:31] <bilss_> volvoguy: whats the apt-get for this missing library please libstdc++.so.5
[09:31] <CITguy> Does anybody know where I can find the source files for Tomboy?
[09:31] <volvoguy> dave, running fine here - with the beta nvidia driver though.
[09:31] <hamsterman> ok, done
[09:31] <concept10> fredl, try a reboot (i dont think it will actually help, but I would try it)
[09:31] <cbx33> how do I pipe both stdout and stderr to a file again
[09:31] <foysavas> http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/
[09:31] <cbx33> 2&>1 ?
[09:32] <fredl> concept10, nah I just need to configure the interface now.
[09:32] <dave> volvogo: I had the beta driver - nearly ruined my install getting rid of it -it wrecked all my 3d games
[09:32] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Click on EDIT, then PREFERENCES
[09:32] <CITguy> thanks foysavas
[09:32] <volvoguy> bilss_, probably "libstdc++5"
[09:32] <hamsterman> done
[09:32] <segfault> CITguy, sudo apt-get source pkgname
[09:32] <marcin1984> hello
[09:32] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Ok, now. Click on CAPTURE.
[09:32] <volvoguy> dave, weird. i guess that's why it's still beta. i haven't gamed much with it yet, but google earth ran fine.
[09:32] <foysavas> CITguy, have you done any coding with mono?
[09:33] <hamsterman> tick or untick?
[09:33] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Start adding componets and the window will add items. Be sure they are not turned off by default.
[09:33] <dave> volvoguy: I'm getting X.0.log errors about fonts not being found
[09:33] <hamsterman> there all turned on
[09:33] <grahamldlw> are they're any programs i can use in linux that lets me compile and run pascal outside of a terminal
[09:33] <hamsterman> sound works in flash in ff
[09:33] <bieb_work> psusi.. same problem.. except it doesnt say "boot from CD/DVD".. in the bios the only bootable device is HDD, and the HD boot priority is SCAI-0 3ware storage control
[09:33] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: I had to add a number of things in diffenernt windows to make my surround sound system work properly.
[09:33] <dave> volvoguy:compiz works though :-)
[09:33] <fredl> concept10, thanks for all your help dude!
[09:34] <psusi> bieb_work: what does it say?
[09:34] <volvoguy> dave, hmm.... i haven't seen those in ages. i don't recall what i did to fix 'em. maybe a "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" - although the new Xorg packages might be named differently now.
[09:34] <fredl> concept10, appreciate it :)
[09:34] <concept10> fredl, so that download got it?
[09:34] <hors> pleace, some body speak spanish??????
[09:34] <volvoguy> dave, i'm using compiz and AIGLX. looks GREAT!
[09:34] <hamsterman> all mine are on and unmuted
[09:34] <bieb_work> psusi.. nothing.. it goes through the bios and posting then just sits there
[09:34] <georgeb> !es | hors
[09:34] <ubotu> hors: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[09:34] <dave> volvoguy: google earth uses the GL not ...
[09:34] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: I had to tweak and re-tweak things to make every work properly.
[09:34] <psusi> bieb_work: sounds like your motherboard is retarded then ;)
[09:34] <dave> volvoguy: me too :-D
[09:34] <bieb_work> lol
[09:34] <fredl> concept10, think so yeah. It doesn't seem to want to bind to my AP yet though but I'll reboot and come back later.
[09:34] <psusi> it should say SOMETHING
[09:34] <volvoguy> dave, yeah.... google earth is OpenGL
[09:34] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Ok,  so raise the levels to mid raange and see what happens.
[09:35] <kamui> help with edgy upgrade
[09:35] <grahamldlw> anyone????
[09:35] <kamui> Xorg is broken
[09:35] <dave> volvoguy: well it runs fien here too - try nexuiz or tremulous and let me know?
[09:35] <volvoguy> dave, sure. gimme a minute or ten.
[09:35] <marcin1984> i have a problem with firefox 2.0 and flash, animation not will open and firefox is down
[09:35] <kamui> whenever I exec a Xorg -configure the only driver listed is fglrx, and I get an error, signal 11
[09:35] <DrNick> hi all.  strange problem, sound has stopped working.  sound plays from line in, but not from videos or music files. it was working yesterday, and now after a reboot its not. if I select the sound device directly under 'sound' in preferences then music files work but videos still don't. any more ideas?
[09:35] <hamsterman> also, my media player says it cannot connect with the sound server
[09:35] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Some of the controls are confusing as I take the streaming audio here and send it out to a three hundred watt amplifier. But the proper control for that was of all things the PCM and WAVE control(s).
[09:36] <bruenig> marcin1984, how did you install flash
[09:36] <cedd> executing grub install (/dev/sda) failed... this is a fatal error
[09:36] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: What is you OS please and version ?
[09:36] <marcin1984> i install plugin flash in firefox
[09:36] <hamsterman> ubuntu daper drake 6.06 + updates
[09:36] <dave> volovoguy: thanks
[09:36] <kronus> I've lost wireless and some other strange stuff, can anyone help?
[09:36] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Same here dude.
[09:36] <bruenig> marcin1984, but how. The repositories? Did you do it manually from the adobe website. Was it flash 9 or flash 7 or what?
[09:37] <volvoguy> i need a desk about 10 times bigger than my already monster sized one. sheesh.
[09:37] <kamui> umm, nevermind
[09:37] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: I am using the ADEPT program as well as sudo apt-get update commands for upgradiing.....
[09:37] <Poromenos> how can i mount partitions in fstab so they are visible only to users in a certain group?
[09:37] <DrNick> if anyone's got a spare couple of mins to help with a sound problem, gimme a shout.  cheers
[09:37] <hamsterman> oddly, the sound works in flash and when it plays the ubuntu startup sound
[09:38] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: I took a while for me to get it all going, but it works fine now, just had to play around with the sound cotrols.....
[09:38] <grahamldlw> are they're any programs i can use in linux that lets me compile and run pascal outside of a terminal
[09:38] <marcin1984> not i install in firefox automatic qestion did install flash? so i agree this
[09:38] <hamsterman> ill try that
[09:38] <DrNick> Poromenos, I'd just set the permissions on the directory appropriatly
[09:38] <recon0> Is there a faster way to search than "find / | grep term"?
[09:38] <Spee_Der> Have you tried any streaming audio ?
[09:38] <hamsterman> no.
[09:38] <Poromenos> DrNick: on the mounted one?
[09:38] <kronus> so I compiled and installed the 2.6.18 kernel and have lost wireless
[09:38] <ifireball> Poromenos: make the mount points or parent dirctories accessible only to that group with chmod
[09:38] <Spee_Der> hamsterman: Ok.
[09:38] <fredl> concept10, LOL this is the wireless NIC from hell dude!
[09:38] <Poromenos> ah, so simple :(
[09:38] <Poromenos> ok, thanks :)
[09:38] <kronus> the driver still shows up in lsmod
[09:38] <kronus> how can I activate it?
[09:38] <bruenig> marcin1984, did it work? Usually the install fails when you do that, at least with the firefox ubuntu ships with.
[09:38] <fredl> hmm wait
[09:38] <aaaaaaaaaaaaaa> how do i update from kbuntu 6.06 to 6.10?
[09:39] <Spee_Der> brb, need to  remove my boots.....
[09:39] <DrNick> Poromenos, yep.  change its group to the one you want to access it, deny access to everyone else
[09:39] <bruenig> !upgrade | aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[09:39] <ubotu> aaaaaaaaaaaaaa: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[09:39] <fredl> concept10, maybe it's now time to connect the antenna again LOL
[09:39] <Poromenos> DrNick: ahh, okay, thanks a lot
[09:39] <DrNick> Poromenos, np, that should work
[09:39] <volvoguy> dave, about 15 minutes to download nexuiz. i'll let you know when it's done.
[09:40] <Poromenos> DrNick: how do i set that permission? chmod <group> /media?
[09:40] <hou5ton> i have a new wireless card to put in the slot cuz the internal one on this lappy doesn't work ..... should I turn off the machine, put in the card, and reboot, .... or does it really matter?
[09:40] <deternal> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30477/
[09:40] <DrNick> Poromenos, easiest way just use Nautilus.  change its group and permissions from there.
[09:40] <Poromenos> DrNick: ah, i forgot about that, thanks :
[09:40] <Poromenos> :)
[09:40] <DrNick> :)
[09:41] <CheshireViking> marcin1984: Sounds like you have this problem where flash causes websites to crash & firefox to shutdown, this website lists a solution, but I haven't tried it yet, so far I've not needed flash - http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Flash_Player_.28Macromedia_Flash.29_Plug-in_for_Mozilla_Firefox
[09:41] <kola> WWW.MYSPACE.COM/raintear WWW.MYSPACE.COM/raintear WWW.MYSPACE.COM/raintear
[09:41] <DrNick> Poromenos, if you need to run it as root, just do sudo nautilus
[09:41] <bruenig> deternal, you realize that is not what the pastebin is for right? You are supposed to post terminal output or error messages or some other large text
[09:41] <Poromenos> DrNick: ah, great. by the way, i want a launcher for it on my panel, do i just make one for nautilus?
[09:41] <marcin1984> i don't know whats this meaning
[09:42] <bruenig> marcin1984, what language do you speak?
[09:42] <marcin1984> polish
[09:42] <Poromenos> ah ok, that worked
[09:42] <dave> volvoguy:thankyou - I'll wait
[09:42] <deternal> bruenig, that questions seems backwards - the real question is, why have a link to a pastebin and no explenation for it's usage
[09:42] <DrNick> a launcher for the folder?  easiest way just add the folder to your Nautilus bookmarks, then it will appear on your places menu
[09:42] <hou5ton> i have a new wireless card to put in the slot cuz the internal one on this lappy doesn't work ..... should I turn off the machine, put in the card, and reboot, .... or does it really matter?
[09:42] <vapo> what can i do when the net installer fails to download an installer-component from any mirror i tried ? otherwise internet access seems to work , it only fails to retrieve this one file
[09:43] <Poromenos> DrNick: no, a launcher for nautilus, so i don't have to go to "places" all the time
[09:43] <bruenig> deternal, perhaps that is a problem, but I was just informing you retroactively
[09:43] <recon0> Is there a faster way to search than "find / | grep term"?
[09:43] <DrNick> Poromenos,  ah I see.  yep just add a normal launcher to the panel :)
[09:43] <cryptonic> could someone help me install sauerbraten on ubuntu?
[09:43] <ploom> recon0, locate
[09:43] <Poromenos> DrNick: great, thanks :)
[09:43] <marcin1984> do you help me??
[09:43] <DrNick> np
[09:43] <Armades> someone could help me enabling SMP on a dual xeon setup, Ive checked forums and google, but neither has the correct solution...
[09:43] <ploom> recon0, and man find would help very much
[09:44] <DrNick> Armades, I had the same problem with a quad-xeon server at work
[09:44] <DrNick> Armades, I just installed the linux-686-smp kernel and it worked ok
[09:44] <bruenig> !pl
[09:44] <ubotu> Mozesz uzyskac pomoc w jezyku polskim na #ubuntu-pl
[09:44] <marcin1984> thx
[09:44] <Poromenos> DrNick: so I don't make any mistakes, which users that currently have access will NOT after I do this?
[09:44] <deternal> bruenig, yes thanks - didn't mean to bite at you :)
[09:45] <hamsterman> audacity- "there was an error initiating the audio i/o layer"
[09:45] <deternal> added dmesg output for the hell of it :P
[09:45] <dredhammer> trying to compile the latest mplayer svn, i already compiled the latest x264 svn and well x264 won't play nice with mplayer, when i go to compile i get "x264_param_parse" errors
[09:45] <cryptonic> sudo chmod +x /home/cryptonic/Desktop/sauerbraten/sauerbraten_unix that doesnt install it for some reason
[09:45] <Armades> DrNick, have you had problem with that kernel? like it freezes your computer earlier?
[09:45] <fredl> concept10, ?
[09:45] <fredl> concept10, you there?
[09:45] <DrNick> Armades, seems ok as far as I can tell
[09:46] <Poromenos> hmm, this is rather complicated, the folders belong to the "plugdev" group
[09:46] <concept10> fredl, yep
[09:46] <Spee_Der> Armades: I have two computers here with two cpu's each and using the i686-SMP kernel no troubles.
[09:46] <Poromenos> i should leave it alone
[09:46] <concept10> fredl, this i miss a post?
[09:46] <fredl> concept10, it works now ! :) I had to copy a few more .fw files
[09:46] <wall-keeper> HYI
[09:46] <DrNick> Poromenos, the folders user and its group will have the access you specify, everyone else will not have access
[09:46] <kamui> I've upgrade successfully now, but I can't get acceleration working with fglrx.  I've checked and I have the module for my kernel loaded (it appears in lsmod), I've also got X to start using teh fglrx driver.  but fglrxinfo says mesa indirect still, and when I check the logs it says failed to initialize dri, (could be missing or broken kernel module)  Im not sure what to do next
[09:46] <blackvd> just did a fresh install of Kubuntu 6.10 on a compaq v500z with broadcom wireless card which doesnt work. found a few forums with info on getting them to work but all the info seemed to be out dated. is there an easy way to get this working? Also I know this isnt #kubuntu.
[09:46] <fredl> concept10, thanks a lot! now I can mess around a bit with this old card!
[09:46] <Armades> DrNick Ive tried to install that kernel a unknown number of times, but my computer wont accept any inputs from mouse or keyboard when GDM starts
[09:47] <concept10> fredl, where to/from ? (files)

[09:47] <cryptonic> could someone help with this?
[09:47] <DrNick> Armades, how are you installing the kernel?  using aptitude?
[09:47] <fredl> concept10, /lib/firmware/bcm43xx_initval01.fw   /lib/firmware/bcm43xx_pcm4.fw
[09:47] <fredl> /lib/firmware/bcm43xx_microcode2.fw are the ones it needs to work

[09:49] <fredl> concept10, network-manager only supports very specific cards.
[09:49] <dave> blackvd: there's a package called ndiswrapper-gtk (not sure about the hyphen) -- makes it obvious
[09:49] <fredl> concept10, I got nm to recognize my Intel wireless NIC but that's one of the best supported NIC's coz it's on most centrino laptops.
[09:49] <concept10> fredl, it used to show up when I used ndiswrapper, but not this bcm43xx fandangle
[09:50] <DrNick_> right, back.

[09:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ac'97 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:50] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[09:50] <fredl> concept10, I think the NIC's driver needs to support something called WEXT
[09:50] <grndslm> how would i check an ubuntu package to see if it has a specific patch that i need?  after apt-get source-ing the package, at least??
[09:50] <tag> so
[09:50] <hamsterman> needing help with sound problem
[09:50] <hamsterman> please help
[09:51] <tag> to upgrade to edgy, should I just vim /etc/apt/sources.list and :%s/dapper/edgy/g ?
[09:51] <DrNick_> hamsterman, well so am I.  whats the problem?  just no sound?
[09:51] <tag> and then dist-upgrade?
[09:51] <concept10> tag, NO!
[09:51] <dave> hamsterman: start at the beginning please
[09:51] <tag> concept10: and so what should I do instead?
[09:51] <l1tch> HY
[09:51] <fredl> concept10, even with the Intel card I had to install new ieee80211 modules dunno if that'd be neccesary on Edgy still though
[09:51] <hamsterman> no sound except in ff and at startup
[09:51] <bobby_> I have a little problem, i want to connect my mic or my guitar into my Ubuntu for recording/processing, when I do it, i can hear the guitar through the speakers, but no program can detect the input, anyone can help?
[09:51] <bruenig> tag, you will need to do that at some point

[09:53] <hamsterman> audacity- there was an error initiating the audio i/o layer
[09:53] <matahari> does anyone of you know how i can get a bluetooth usb dongle to work (it's a broadcom 203x)
[09:54] <cedd> executing grub-install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error
[09:54] <cedd> ...

[09:54] <matahari> i treid to install the bluez packages
[09:54] <matahari> but i fail at the hotplug script - edgy isn't using hotplug anymore
[09:54] <matahari> do you have an idea how i can get it to work?
[09:54] <dave> hamsterman: have you looked at System-->Preferences-->Sound
[09:55] <hamsterman> yes. nothing odd. that i can see, atleast
[09:55] <cedd> !bootloader
[09:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bootloader - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:55] <dave> autodetect or ALSA?
[09:55] <volvoguy> doesn't hamsterman need to change which sound system is the default? seems like i remember that being a common problem.
[09:56] <fredl> concept10, and what's even cooler I just noticed that my rausb wireless interface also came online somewhere between our digging into this bcm43xx card and my Edgy upgrade.
[09:56] <hamsterman> thers only one option for the sound
[09:56] <cedd> here i have my cpu partitioned in raid0 succesfully, i created a /boot B ext3 in sda outside the raid... when i point grub where to install the bootloader i receive this... executing grub-install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error

[09:58] <g333k_work> is it now avaiable xfce beta 2 for ubuntu dapper?
[09:59] <concept10> fredl, its not there
[09:59] <volvoguy> hamsterman, are you using dapper or edgy.
[09:59] <concept10> fredl, I will leave that for another day.  I will be back later.
[09:59] <fredl> concept10, I don't see either rausb0 or eth1 in my nm-applet.
[10:00] <zeasier> is there a pam module for centralized users, groups, and authentication?
[10:00] <fredl> zeasier, like pam LDAP ?
[10:00] <zeasier> fredl, that can be configured to access a server?
[10:01] <telnet> hi. i have a problem with flash player 7 & 9 in edgy. the animations cover all desktop. see http://img506.imageshack.us/my.php?image=pantallazotg4.png
[10:01] <fredl> zeasier, well yeah
[10:01] <fredl> zeasier, an LDAP server.
[10:01] <nexeus> beryl!
[10:01] <Don-DiZzLe> how can i make torrent files open automaicly with utorrent?
[10:01] <nexeus> compiz!
[10:01] <fredl> zeasier, apt-get install libpam-ldap, proceed with caution though.
[10:02] <kronus> I upgraded my kernel to a new one from kernel.org, and now the wireless driver isn't talking to the hadware - it's not listed in iwconfig or ifconfig.  How do I fix this?
[10:02] <dave> hamsterman: have you tried "sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart" and then audacity?
[10:02] <regeya> ajust joined:  are we randomly shouting out eyecandy software names?
[10:02] <sparkleytone> kronus: you go back to your ubuntu-supplied kernel

[10:02] <volvoguy> dave, i think he left.
[10:02] <tag> rad
[10:02] <sparkleytone> kronus: as it most likely had ubuntu-supplied magical patches applied
[10:02] <dave> blackvd: looking on google for it
[10:02] <tag> this is gonna take forever.
[10:02] <kronus> ubuntu-supplied kernel has problems with suspend for me
[10:02] <nexeus> any1 try fire effect yet
[10:02] <zeasier> fredl - i'm looking for docs, or guides. any sugguestions?
[10:02] <Don-DiZzLe> anyone?
[10:02] <dave> volvoguy:eep! something I said? :-)
[10:02] <fredl> zeasier - libnss-ldap can bite you in the behind if you don't carefully configure it, it can lock you out of your local root :)
[10:03] <volvoguy> dave, i found his answer too.
[10:03] <zeasier> fredl: i know how to chroot so i'll be ok
[10:03] <volvoguy> dave, 2 minutes on this download btw.
[10:03] <dave> blackvd:ndisgtk
[10:03] <kronus> sparkleytone - vanilla ubuntu kernel has suspend problems, i.e. not waking up.  It also sometimes hard locks if I disconnects the AC adapter.  the kernel update fixed all these issues
[10:03] <dave> volvoguy:cool
[10:03] <blackvd> dave:thanks
[10:03] <claviola> where can I find this year's signing keys for the archives?
[10:03] <fredl> zeasier, okay if you say so :) PADL is a great resource for LDAP: http://www.padl.com/OSS/nss_ldap.html
[10:03] <kronus> sparkleytone - except the wireless, which is now gone :/
[10:04] <sparkleytone> kronus: you're going to have to find the patches that they made to the kernel and apply them to the new one
[10:04] <volvoguy> dave, will this game make any sense or is it one of those "out there" kinda games?
[10:04] <dave> blackvd: http://linuxappfinder.com/package/ndisgtk
[10:04] <dave> volvoguy: fps game
[10:04] <volvoguy> dave, ok.
[10:05] <dave> volvoguy:I tend to die a lot :-D
[10:05] <fredl> zeasier, the headlines are that you need to install libnss-ldap at the least if I remember correctly and you can optionally install libpam-ldap
[10:05] <zeasier> fredl: ok, thanks for the help
[10:05] <dave> volvoguy: define: out there game? :-)
[10:05] <fredl> zeasier, but, you also need to have an LDAP server up and running....
[10:05] <strabes> is the generic kernel that comes with edgy good for centrino processors or is there a better one available in a repo?
[10:05] <zeasier> fredl: yeah that is the tricky part
[10:05] <fredl> zeasier, and you need to populate that LDAP server with some NSS stuff like hosts, users, groups etc.
[10:05] <zeasier> fredl: i really need to learn ldap anyway
[10:06] <fredl> zeasier, for the latter the PADL website can help, hang on a bit
[10:06] <telnet> i have the problem in opera, firefox and swiftfox . http://img506.imageshack.us/my.php?image=pantallazotg4.png
[10:06] <TC`> how to  run who directory with wine? i got a dictionary in .iso i mounted it, but this iso is for win.. it has .ini .exe ect...
[10:06] <cedd> here i have my cpu partitioned in raid0 succesfully, i created a /boot B ext3 in sda outside the raid... when i point grub where to install the bootloader i receive this... executing grub-install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error
[10:06] <gnomefreak> strabes: generic kernel is 686/smp .... kernel
[10:07] <fredl> zeasier - one package that's not obvious to find it 'migrationtools'
[10:07] <fredl> zeasier - migrationtools - Migration scripts for LDAP
[10:07] <volvoguy> sorry 'bout that. did you get my reply dave?
[10:07] <strabes> gnomefreak: cool that's what i was wondering...if there was a specific 686 kernel or something
[10:07] <fredl> zeasier - those scripts will help you populate an LDAP server.
[10:07] <dave> volvoguy:no
[10:07] <gnomefreak> generic = 686 now
[10:07] <volvoguy> dave, i dunno. i've seen some RPG's where it's just a bunch of blobs floating around. i was totally lost.
[10:07] <zeasier> zeasier: with existing authentication data?
[10:07] <strabes> right awesome
[10:07] <zeasier> ope
[10:07] <zeasier> ops
[10:07] <volvoguy> dave, your game is loading.... that's a good sign.
[10:08] <TC`> so WINE just runs .exe
[10:08] <TC`> ?
[10:08] <zeasier> fredl: with existing authentication data?
[10:08] <dave> volvoguy: that's those funny shrooms guy!
[10:08] <TC`> i meed the whole directory to run with .exe
[10:08] <fredl> zeasier - yup
[10:08] <zeasier> fredl: i thought the whole point of pam is to had the useradd etc tools write to different systems
[10:08] <TC`> need*
[10:08] <volvoguy> dave, it's working for me... just a little slow on a laptop
[10:08] <dave> volvoguy: it runs but staggers - I have 1G RAM and 256M on my Geforce 6600 you know ....
[10:09] <zeasier> fredl: well, i guess you still have to migrate
[10:09] <cedd> well i guess no1 wanna help me
[10:09] <TC`> so can't anyone help me ? :|
[10:09] <cedd> where can i get support
[10:09] <alecjw> TC`: what program is it? you could try runjing it using the command: wine <filename>.exe
[10:09] <dave> volvoguy: my apps, especailly gnome-terminal take about 30 seconds to load now too
[10:09] <hyperactivecrond> cedd: try re-asking/re-phrasing your question
[10:09] <TC`> setup.exe
[10:09] <TC`> ;] 
[10:10] <alecjw> setup for waht, TC`
[10:10] <fredl> zeasier - well I said that PAM is optional. What you're interested in (I think) is NSS. PAM only comes to the rescue for things that don't use NSS
[10:10] <TC`> !.exe
[10:10] <cedd> thats the best i can do
[10:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about exe - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:10] <TC`> for a dictionary
[10:10] <volvoguy> dave, no staggering here.... just a lot of death. mostly mine.
[10:10] <TC`> i need there to type cd-key ...
[10:10] <cedd> here i have my cpu partitioned in raid0 succesfully on a fresh edgy installation, i created a /boot B ext3 in sda outside the raid... when i point grub where to install the bootloader i receive this error msg... executing grub-install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error
[10:10] <TC`> !exe
[10:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about exe - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:10] <dave> volvoguy: bugger - I don't want to reinstall either - thanks man
[10:10] <cedd> all this happen in the first time install
[10:10] <fredl> a CPU partitioned in raid0 ???
[10:11] <alecjw> TC`: Applications >> Acessories >> Dictionary?
[10:11] <cedd> my hd are
[10:11] <menko> Hi, I just upgraded to edgy from dapper. My fonts look different though. The difference is especially noticeable in wikipedia. HOw do I get my fonts looking how they were in dapper?
[10:11] <TC`> lithuanian
[10:11] <dave> volvoguy:run away shooting - its' the best thing to do :-)
[10:11] <TC`> there isin't ;] 
[10:11] <volvoguy> dave, i think it's a bit too doom-ish for me. i'm more of a battlefield2 FPS'er.
[10:11] <fredl> that's kind of a shame to partition your CPU in a redundant array of inexpensive disks.
[10:11] <alecjw> i expect that you can add lituanian, TC`
[10:11] <TC`> yeh right
[10:11] <fredl> I'd rather partition my RAID into a new CPU.
[10:11] <TC`> a couple of milion words
[10:11] <zeasier> fredl: ah nss, i hadn't heard of that, thought something was missing
[10:12] <dave> volvoguy: need for speed most wanted in cedega - it just flies (well .. it used to :-( )
[10:12] <cedd> what do you mean
[10:12] <alecjw> TC`: ok, so what did you say went wrong with the EXE?
[10:12] <telnet> Is this a bug in flashplayer 9? http://img506.imageshack.us/my.php?image=pantallazotg4.png
[10:12] <volvoguy> dave, so i have a fresh edgy install, beta nvidia drivers, and a pentium m 1.7Ghz, 512Mb RAM, Geforce GO 6200 video.
[10:13] <dave> volvoguy: what processor you on there? I'm AMD64 but switched back to 32bit edgy
[10:13] <bthornton> so has the variety of different kernels been reduced in Edgy?  There used to be x86_64, xeon, k8 kernels--now there's just "generic".
[10:13] <dave> volvoguy:okay
[10:13] <GaiaX11> I managed to install frostwire, but now i cannot connect to the net for downloading the files!
[10:13] <TC`> i need to type there the cd-key, but this exe uses msi and ini files..
[10:13] <cedd> whats wrong with stripping anyway
[10:13] <rixxon> where to clear "recent documents" history for the gnome-main-menu package applet?
[10:13] <TC`> so when i run with wine setup.exe those other files are not involved
[10:13] <GaiaX11> Is there a frostwire channel in freenode?
[10:14] <dave> volvoguy: it's bed time - thanks for the support - see you around
[10:14] <GaiaX11> #join frostwire
[10:14] <alecjw> TC`: i don't knowwhat files seup.exe uses. you can't open MSIs though. you need windoze installer whihc doesn't work in wine.
[10:14] <alecjw> GaiaX11: the command would be /join #frsotwire
[10:14] <alecjw> but spelt correctly
[10:15] <TC`> so any sugestions?
[10:15] <LordMetroid> found some intersting survey: http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-545269
[10:15] <lakcaj> TC`, use msiexec
[10:15] <TC`> bah
[10:15] <cedd> i have my hds partitioned in raid0 succesfully on a fresh edgy installation, i created a /boot B ext3 in sda outside the raid...everything installed correctly until the bootloader, when i point grub where to install the bootloader witch is /dev/sda i receive this error msg... executing grub-install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error
[10:15] <TC`> !msiexec
[10:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about msiexec - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:15] <cedd> might be clearer now
[10:16] <TC`> what is that? msiexec
[10:16] <TC`> ?
[10:16] <bthornton> Is anybody who installed Edgy having problems with their mouse and keyboard in X?  My keyboard is now "tttyping   in muuultiples" randomly, and also my mouse stops responding to clicks periodically (i.e. until I change workspaces, then it responds again for a few more clicks, and then have to change the workspace again, etc.).
[10:16] <lakcaj> TC`, it comes with wine, and you use it with msi files
[10:16] <GaiaX11> someone could help me to get a frostwire connection here
[10:16] <psusi> cedd: and /boot is where?  /dev/sda1?
[10:16] <kevin> anyone know why my wireless card isnt recognized? its a netgear wg511t pc card and the restricted drivers come with dapper, right?
[10:16] <cedd> psusi correct
[10:17] <WikinG> how to restart X???
[10:17] <lakcaj> WikinG, ctrl-alt-backspace
[10:17] <l1tch> ctrl+alt+backspace
[10:17] <Jaak> I am looking for a dvd ripper for ubu, any tips?
[10:17] <[H] 3b0R> how do i get wine xubuntu Edgy AMD64?
[10:17] <l1tch> Jaak dd
[10:17] <lullabud> WikinG:  /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[10:17] <lullabud> WikinG:  or ctrl-alt-backspace
[10:18] <blackvd> having trouble finding bcmwl5.inf and ,sys for download so i can install them
[10:18] <psusi> cedd: do you see files in /boot/grub?
[10:18] <cedd> no im still at the first time installation
[10:19] <psusi> cedd: from the livecd or the alternate install cd?
[10:19] <cedd> alternate
[10:19] <psusi> cedd: and what is it doing currently?  can you proceed and complete the rest of the installation?
[10:19] <WikinG> still don't work... how to reinstall X???
[10:19] <cedd> i can without any bootloader though
[10:20] <lullabud> WikinG:   dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
[10:20] <psusi> cedd: you can install it by hand later
[10:20] <cedd> i dont know how to do this though
[10:20] <psusi> cedd: I will walk you through it
[10:20] <cedd> ok wait ill go and complete the instaltion :)
[10:21] <WikinG> lullabud, thanx!
[10:21] <Hans-Martin> hi folks
[10:21] <l1tch> HY
[10:21] <vciaglia> problems with the latest EDGY: checking whether the C compiler works... configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs. What happened here ?
[10:21] <bthornton> does Edgy still have kernels for different CPUs (i.e. k8, xeon, generic, etc.) as in Dapper?  Or has all that been put into one generic kernel?
[10:21] <l1tch> apt-get install gcc
[10:22] <Hans-Martin> I've upgraded from dapper to edgy, and now hibernation does not seem to work anymore.
[10:22] <geokok> I can not add any process in the sessions-->starting programs menu. I define it, hit ok, close but when I open session again it is gone
[10:22] <Paddy_EIRE> !seen Jack_Sparrow
[10:22] <vciaglia> already done...nothing happened after installation of "gcc, g++, binutils, build-essentials"
[10:22] <Hans-Martin> does anyone have an idea what might have gone wrong (AMD processor, ASUS MoBo)
[10:22] <bthornton> grr sorry about that... gaim crashed
[10:22] <bthornton> did anybody answer my question RE: kernels?
[10:23] <cafuego> Hans-Martin: yeah, the upgrade. it doesn't work, generally.
[10:23] <Hans-Martin> bthornton: no
[10:23] <bthornton> kay
[10:23] <Hans-Martin> cafuego: bad bad bad
[10:23] <cafuego> BHSPitLappy: it's all one generic kernel.
[10:23] <abo> I have lost the sound in my Edgy! can't really see any obvious reason, can anyone help?
[10:23] <cafuego> Hans-Martin: hey, at least yours booted. Mine didn't.
[10:23] <geokok> Has anyone experienced the bug in session menu I mentioned?Am I doing something wrong?
[10:24] <Hans-Martin> cafuego: did take some twiddling, though - I had a too small /boot partition, and the initrd didn't fit
[10:24] <geokok> !bug

[10:25] <Hans-Martin> Arcad3: edubuntu is targeted towards schools
[10:25] <Hans-Martin> TC`: umount?
[10:25] <cryptonic> how do i use install compiz themes?
[10:26] <cafuego> Edubuntu dersktop has a set of KDE educational apps aswell as Gnome. The server contains an LTSP netboot server/client setup.
[10:26] <Arcad3> theme and some school aplications tht is the diference
[10:26] <hyperactivecrond> i have a creative soundblaster sound card that ordinarily uses the emu10k1 driver
[10:26] <hyperactivecrond> all of a sudden it won't work at all. nothing comes out
[10:26] <Arcad3> in rest is plain ubuntu
[10:26] <hyperactivecrond> even when i do a low-level cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp nothing works
[10:26] <abo> I have lost the sound in edgy, any one have an idea?
[10:27] <hyperactivecrond> abo: what sound card? i think we may both have the same problem
[10:27] <hyperactivecrond> btw i'm using edgy
[10:27] <hicham> hello
[10:27] <abo> hyperactivecrond, how can I tell?
[10:27] <abo> hyperactivecrond, it used to work, even after I installed edgy, I don't know what happened
[10:27] <abo> hyperactivecrond, how can I tell?
[10:28] <geokok> How can I set a program to load at startup through sessions menu?
[10:28] <hicham> does anybody know how to remove ubuntu from a dual boot machine without causin errors to the grub?
[10:28] <Arcad3> everyone has probs in edgy....
[10:28] <geokok> Arcad3: perhaps too many problems
[10:29] <steppenwolf> s
[10:29] <hyperactivecrond> abo: aplay --list-devices
[10:29] <Arcad3> yes hicham remove windows partitions and make them ext3
[10:29] <Arcad3> then delete windows from menu.lst
[10:29] <Arcad3> the best way
[10:29] <gnomefreak> Arcad3: not everyone
[10:29] <gholen> Please, can someone awnser thes: Why does the install of ubuntu 6.06 goes from 20 minits, to 140 minits?
[10:29] <hyperactivecrond> hicam: reinstall the windows mbr?
[10:29] <Arcad3> most of them
[10:29] <hicham> well I'm using the edgy I'm having no problems at all

[10:30] <statters> My neighbour allows me to use his AP to connect to the Internet, is it possible to encrypt my traffic /web and chat so he cannot sniff it without decoding?
[10:30] <geokok> hickam: you r one of the few

[10:30] <hyperactivecrond> abo: i have creative SB Live!
[10:30] <Arcad3> aa
[10:30] <gholen> 212 min, and counting..
[10:30] <gnomefreak> edgy runs fine on the 4 pcs that are running it for me atm
[10:30] <hyperactivecrond> abo: try this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToConfigureSoundBlasterAudigySEinBreezy
[10:30] <abo> hyperactivecrond, ... did you manage to fix it?
[10:30] <hyperactivecrond> abo: no.
[10:30] <Arcad3> after u format u will get a NTDLR hicham
[10:30] <hyperactivecrond> i'm here for that reason
[10:30] <hyperactivecrond> Arcad3: no
[10:31] <geokok> gnomefreak: r u sure? how about a quick test?
[10:31] <Hans-Martin> gholen: it can only estimate, and sometimes it errs...
[10:31] <gnomefreak> geokok: ok
[10:31] <JDahl> geokok, it's works perfectly well for me also on x86... AMD64 is a different story
[10:31] <hyperactivecrond> arcad3: run fixboot and fixmbr from a windows cd
[10:31] <Arcad3> NTDLR error sorry
[10:31] <gnomefreak> geokok: is it edgy or an app that you are having issues with?
[10:31] <hyperactivecrond> Arcad3: that'll install ntldr
[10:31] <FlimFlamMan> hello.  i need to schedule backups of multiple machines (some ubuntu, some debian) to a single ubuntu server.  any recommendations for software?  i've used amanda in the past but haven't looked at alternatives in years.
[10:31] <geokok> gnomefreak: ok test 1...open OO base and create a form using the wizard..and hit finish at the end
[10:31] <geokok> both
[10:31] <Arcad3> i never heard of that option
[10:31] <Hans-Martin> statters: only if you use some VPN, or transport level security
[10:31] <gholen> Hans-Martin: Okej, but it does seems like it hangs itself when coming to 53 % of install
[10:31] <gnomefreak> geokok: talking about the crash that sometimes happens?
[10:32] <hyperactivecrond> geokok: MYSQL is broken by default in base iIRC
[10:32] <abo> hyperactivecrond, is it normal that I install a driver? I mean it was working untill 2 days ago (When I last tried it)
[10:32] <gnomefreak> geokok: i was never able to reproduce it
[10:32] <Hans-Martin> gholen: is it still downloading stuff? or already installing?
[10:32] <geokok> gnomefreak: I can with FSF java and SUN JAVA
[10:32] <statters> Hans wouild I be correct in saying a TLS is possible if I use a proxy?
[10:33] <hicham> hell how can I get back the main toolbar to the xchat?
[10:33] <hyperactivecrond> abo: same here
[10:33] <hicham> lol
[10:33] <_bt> is anyone using beryl/xgl?
[10:33] <geokok> hyperactivecrond: Other OS dont have that problem
[10:33] <hyperactivecrond> abo: ordinarly it would have come with it
[10:33] <gnomefreak> geokok: its a known bug for some reason i am not able to produce it here. but thats not edgy thats OO.o 2.0.4
[10:33] <hyperactivecrond> _bt: /join #ubuntu-xgl but good luck
[10:33] <_bt> ive got it working hyperactivecrond , just the fonts are reeeeealy tiny
[10:33] <Hans-Martin> statters: don't know for sure - depends on your setup
[10:33] <hyperactivecrond> i still have my slackware 11.0 dvd i'm going to switch back because ubuntu has went through a serious quality dip.
[10:34] <geokok> gnomefreak?: test 2 ....try to set a program to start on login through the sessions menu
[10:34] <gnomefreak> geokok: hint it does the same thing on any ubuntu version 2.0.4 is installed on
[10:34] <hicham> somebody answer me how can I get back the Xchat toolbar?
[10:34] <gnomefreak> geokok: i have beryl starting from there just fine
[10:34] <statters> okdokey
[10:34] <abo> hyperactivecrond, another thing, here the author is talking about some application that may have muted the sound, which seems a reasonable cause, is there a way I can check?
[10:34] <cryptonic> where is xorg.conf?
[10:34] <geokok> gnomefreak: well I try to set firestarter or firefox or anything and it just wont be saved in the menu....
[10:34] <rukuartic> cryptonic: /etc/X11/
[10:34] <Hans-Martin> cryptonic: /etc/X11
[10:35] <cryptonic> thx
[10:35] <gnomefreak> cryptonic: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:35] <geokok> gnomefreak: seems I got the worst copy of edgy..lol
[10:35] <hicham> killall gnome-panel geokok
[10:35] <hyperactivecrond> abo: it depends on what you're running. try this: cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp at a terminal. cryptonic: if you have to ask you don't want to know. abo: stop the static by hitting ctrl-c at a prompt
[10:35] <Hans-Martin> statters: what kind of proxy would you use?
[10:35] <hyperactivecrond> cat my_slack_dvd > /dev/hdc
[10:35] <geokok> hickam:why issue that command?
[10:36] <gholen> Hans-Martin: is it something that alwaus happends from 40% to araound 60?
[10:36] <hicham> geokok, it kills the gnome-panel and then restarts it
[10:36] <hicham> so that u can see new installed programs
[10:36] <gnomefreak> hicham: restarting the panels shouldnt affect what is happening with him
[10:36] <hicham> try it out
[10:36] <GaiaX11> Any1 there use frostwire in ubuntu?
[10:36] <Hans-Martin> gholen: don't know - but I've seen long pauses in all kinds of installer thingies...
[10:36] <geokok> hickam: yes but how will it help me? I even restarted the system
[10:36] <gnomefreak> geokok: on edgy?
[10:36] <gnomefreak> oops
[10:36] <abo> hyperactivecrond,  cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp gave no sound, what does this test mean?
[10:36] <geokok> gnomefreak: yes
[10:36] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: on edgy?
[10:37] <gholen> Hans-Martin: Okej, so lets hope that this is something overgoing?
[10:37] <hyperactivecrond> this means that we can't even low-level feed random crap to your sound card and hear static
[10:37] <xerophyte> does anybody know why phpmyadmin reject the password but command line mysql works with root password ??
[10:37] <geokok> gnomefreak: dapper was smooth for me
[10:37] <hicham> ah ok geokok, gnomefreak I missunderstood
[10:37] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: gonna take a guess at this and say you cant run frostwire on edgy
[10:37] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: Dapper
[10:37] <abo> hyperactivecrond, I'll restart in windows to eliminate all possible hardware issues
[10:37] <geokok> hickam: can u reproduce the problem?
[10:37] <Hans-Martin> gholen: I'd be worried if it does not proceed in maybe 2-3 minutes...
[10:37] <hyperactivecrond> abo: don't
[10:37] <abo> hyperactivecrond, other suggestions?
[10:37] <hyperactivecrond> abo: it probably will take a few bug reports
[10:38] <cafuego> xerophyte: You didn't configure phpmyadmin to use the mysql root pw to check for user/password combos in the `mysql' tables?
[10:38] <hicham> what geokok ?
[10:38] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: maybe you should try asking the question was the point i was getting at
[10:38] <Lattyware> Hey all: Having a problem, every time I try and play any video, in either VLC or mPlayer, my system crashes and can only be revived by the reset button.
[10:38] <hyperactivecrond> to get this going. i suggest you change distros to something a little more stable such as slackware. just as i am. <as i get /kickbanned>
[10:38] <abo> what do u mean?
[10:38] <geokok> hickam: to add to the third tab of the sessions window a program for autostarting
[10:38] <xerophyte> cafuego, i have older version of phpmyadmin that works
[10:38] <xerophyte> cafuego, i have done something to get it work before but i forgot what
[10:38] <geokok> hickam: I add the command and it wont save it
[10:38] <gnomefreak> hyperactivecrond: you know its wrong why did you say it?
[10:38] <fredl> hmm where do I tell GNOME I want more than two virtual desktops?
[10:39] <gholen> Hans-Martin: The thing is that it does proceed sometimes. but it seems like it has problems finding itself
[10:39] <xerophyte> cafuego, i guess i configure the phpmymadin to http
[10:39] <blackvd> um how do i uunzip a exe file?
[10:39] <Lattyware> fredl: Right click the widget, preferences, number of workspaces
[10:39] <gnomefreak> blackvd: with wine
[10:39] <xerophyte> cafuego, its ask for the password and says denied
[10:39] <abo> gnomefreak,hyperactivecrond: what's wrong to say, what should I do to fix the sound?
[10:39] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: I've tried to connect with frostwire, but I haven't been luck so far.
[10:39] <infodroid> blackdvd: try doing it under wine, i think there's a free decompressor that is open source
[10:39] <fredl> ahh cool, thank Lattyware
[10:39] <Lattyware> NP
[10:40] <gholen> been stuck now forr 3 minutes, on 55%, but the CD runs fine :(
[10:40] <rukuartic> GaiaX11: You're not the only one. Limewire is an aceptable alternative until it's fixed...
[10:40] <Takmadeus> Greetings
[10:40] <cafuego> xerophyte: Set it to sue cookie auth, see if that makes any difference...
[10:40] <Takmadeus> May I ask something that has been bothering me?
[10:40] <Lattyware> Hey all: Having a problem, every time I try and play any video, in either VLC or mPlayer, my system crashes and can only be revived by the reset button. - Also, nVidia's twinview has suddenly stopped working, any ideas as to why?
[10:40] <l1tch> Takmadeus no
[10:40] <gnomefreak> abo: sound problems are not fixed by changing distros just avoided. i dont ever have to do anything with sound so not the person to ask
[10:40] <Lattyware> rukuartic: Limewire... ugh.
[10:40] <rukuartic> Takmadeus: You don't need permission, this is a great channel to ask questions.
[10:40] <rukuartic> Lattyware: I know... :P
[10:41] <blackvd> how come no wine in the repos?
[10:41] <gholen> the time touh, thats pending, is it good or bad?
[10:41] <Hans-Martin> gholen: so you already tried a number of times? weird.
[10:41] <Bluhd> I did a distribution upgrade to Ubuntu 6.10 and now I can't get sound through AIM. My friend told me it might be ESD/ALSA conflicts. Any solutions?
[10:41] <Bluhd> er
[10:41] <Takmadeus> Totem and Xine are working quite strangely
[10:41] <Bluhd> GAIM that is
[10:41] <gnomefreak> !wine | blackvd
[10:41] <ubotu> blackvd: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[10:41] <Takmadeus> they play my video files quite slow
[10:41] <abo> gnomefreak, ok .. I'm not changing distro to get sound fixed, definetly not slackware :P
[10:41] <Takmadeus> and jumpy
[10:41] <Takmadeus> and quality is quite low
[10:41] <Takmadeus> I don't know what to do
[10:41] <DanSchnell> Is it possible for Ubuntu not to work on computer at all?
[10:41] <Takmadeus> never happened to me with a linux distro
[10:41] <gholen> Slow connection, and no CD's
[10:42] <gholen> Ohh! 56% now
[10:42] <Hans-Martin> DanSchnell: yes of course. wrong type of computer, for example
[10:42] <geokok> Takmadeus: have u installed vga drivers or updated them recently?
[10:42] <hicham> does anybody know how can I get the Xchat main toolbar back?
[10:42] <jatt> due the fonts edgy bug (bad looking fonts in gnome-terminal, and other applications) I am trying the following:
[10:42] <jatt> xterm -fa "Bitstream Vera" -fs 8
[10:42] <jatt> which displays an xterm with a true type just fine.
[10:42] <Takmadeus> yeah
[10:42] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, even like a computer that was built this summer?
[10:42] <GaiaX11> rukuartic: So, do you think that there are other people facing the same connexion problem with frostwire?
[10:42] <Takmadeus> using latest ati drivers (fixed with the previous LibGL.so
=== Spec is now known as Spec[x] 
[10:43] <Lattyware> Hey all: Having a problem, every time I try and play any video, in either VLC or mPlayer, my system crashes and can only be revived by the reset button. - Also, nVidia's twinview has suddenly stopped working, any ideas as to why?
[10:43] <rukuartic> GaiaX11: Possibly. I know there's a problem using dash to run /var/lib/run(Frost|Lime).sh
[10:43] <jatt> However when I try to set the resources in the .Xresources (and then an xrdb -load .Xresources) that fonts doesn't look fine in a new opened xterm...
[10:43] <geokok> Takmadeus: I have nvidia and after update video went crazy. I reinstalled and it was fine
[10:43] <rukuartic> GaiaX11: Look around on the support forums for Frostwire and Ubuntu
[10:44] <naut> Is it just me, or is nfs on dapper really broken?
[10:44] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: yes
[10:44] <jatt> does anybody here uses xterm (or another terminal application) using a true type font?
[10:44] <Hans-Martin> DanSchnell: you're asking if it's possible. The answer is yes, but you probably don't really want to know that since you already know it from experience, true? so why don't you just tell the problem?
[10:44] <hicham> will somebody answer me pls!
[10:44] <Takmadeus> so you siggest me to reinstall totem and xine?
[10:44] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: im working on a build for edgy
[10:44] <gholen> ohh! 57 %
[10:44] <Takmadeus> OK, I'll wait until some packages download and then try ;)
[10:44] <GaiaX11> rukuartic: I have seen it and they don't have a clue.
[10:44] <gholen> Weird, mu computer is qute fast
[10:44] <gholen> *quite
[10:44] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: the #!/bin/sh is trying to run a bash script on dash
[10:44] <geokok> Takmadeus: No reinstall vga drivers...but on your own risk
[10:44] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, I have never been able to boot liveCD or install ubuntu.  I'm own a home-made computer and I have been trying for the last month or so to get ubuntu to work with no success
[10:44] <mabus> What's a safe size for /boot, /, and /home in my partitioning scheme, if I want to keep as much space as possible reserved for /var ?
[10:44] <fignew> gnomefreak: why did you kick bouncer?
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[10:45] <hughsie> guys, any of you know if there is a restricted modules deb for 2.6.19? I need it for my wireless for OLPC work
[10:45] <naut> I've beeen having to do about one hard reset a day on our server due to kernel lock-ups
[10:45] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: changing #!/bin/sh to bin/bash
[10:45] <gnomefreak> fignew: spamming
[10:45] <Takmadeus> geokok: hmmm but they are working fine
[10:45] <fignew> ahh
[10:45] <naut> Has anybody else been having rpoblems with nfs?
[10:45] <Hans-Martin> DanSchnell: so what's happening when you boot from the CD?
[10:45] <hicham> DanSchnell, I had the same problem at last it was the builtin soundcard
[10:45] <Takmadeus> the only thing that is not working as it should is totem and xine :p
[10:45] <hicham> It was making a problem
[10:46] <geokok> Takmadeus: I believe you. I am just saying reinstalling them fixed my problem
[10:46] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, This happens every single time: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v512/tathar902/other%20stuff/screenshots/100_0151.jpg
[10:46] <rukuartic> gnomefreak: I think you also need to edit /usr/bin/frostwire because it runs "sh ...whatever.sh"
[10:46] <rukuartic> gnomefreak: In addition to changing that
[10:46] <geokok> Takmadeus: U can try to reinstall the audio - video codecs as well through automatix
[10:46] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: yes but just to run it you shouldnt have to
[10:47] <Takmadeus> hmmmm then I should try...... I just hope it works because low quality jumpy videos are not really my thing :p
[10:47] <mikebot> can someone help me with ubuntu and lan?
[10:47] <gholen> hans martin, kan it be becouse I have a Nvidia graphicscard?
[10:47] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: there are a bunch of things i have to change to build it
[10:47] <archangeleon> I want to upgrade to kernel 2.6.19 RC4 and I compiled and installed it, but I crashed after grub loaded the kernel.  Does anyone know anything about this?
[10:47] <geokok> Takmadeus: try the codecs first
[10:47] <psusi> mabus: why bother splitting up the different partitions?
[10:47] <SeanTater> When printing from debian etch to ubuntu dapper, my printer prints dollar signs. Why? How can I fix that?
[10:47] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, I've tried installing the latest nvidia drivers (sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx, then sudo nvidia-xonfig) then when I try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart it says "Starting GNOME Display Manager [FAIL] 
[10:47] <mikebot> all i'm trying to do is connect to a lan with ubuntu
[10:47] <psusi> mabus: /boot should be 50-100 megs though
[10:47] <gnomefreak> archangeleon: we dont support user compilied kernels in here please join #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:47] <Takmadeus> I'll do so then.... but now with automatix but synaptic :p
[10:48] <archangeleon> Alright, thanks.
[10:48] <Takmadeus> I ust hope I do not have to download everything again :p
[10:48] <mabus> psusi: for security and safety of data?
[10:48] <geokok> Takmadeus: whatever feels right :)
[10:48] <LjL> !automatix
[10:48] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[10:48] <GaiaX11> How to avoid sudo to ask me a passwd?
[10:48] <Takmadeus> I am on 56K after all :p
[10:48] <mikebot> anyone know about configuring ubuntu with a lan?
[10:48] <mentok> GalaX11: be root all the time
[10:48] <psusi> mabus: how does splitting up the filesystem enhcnace security and safety?
[10:49] <Hans-Martin> DanSchnell: what happens if you revert to the non-proprietary drivers? I had some problems with the latest nvidia drivers (which was the reason I switched from dapper to edgy) but the "nv" driver did the trick.
[10:49] <Takmadeus> geokok: thanks ;)
[10:49] <gholen> 59%
[10:49] <mentok> GalaX11: but probably not a good idea
[10:49] <geokok> Takmadeus: hope codecs work. Good luck
[10:49] <mabus> psusi: if one filesystem corrupts, the other is still up
[10:49] <mentok> GalaX11: if you just want to be root for a while, try sudo su -
[10:49] <rukuartic> gnomefreak: Did you end up getting it running?
[10:49] <Takmadeus> geokok: arigato ;)
[10:50] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, so Install nvidia-glx but then reconfigure xorg to say nv instead of nvidia?
[10:50] <rukuartic> mentok, GalaXII: No, from what I hear "sudo -i" is safer
[10:50] <mentok> GalaX11: it will only prompt you for a password once
[10:50] <psusi> mabus: yea... but if you loose your data, do you really care that you still have the root?  that can easily be reinstalled...
[10:50] <Hans-Martin> DanSchnell: at least try it - I have no idea whether it would work
[10:50] <gnomefreak> rukuartic: i havent finished yet im working on something else with it to hopfully get it in feisty
[10:50] <mikebot> anyone? LAN? ubuntu
[10:50] <Hans-Martin> you could also have a look at the various log files
[10:50] <pablouyyyy> hi which package should i install so i can have a 2nd X login?
[10:50] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, So would i still need to include sudo nvidia-glx?
[10:50] <rukuartic> mikebot: If you have openssh-server installed, you can get a terminal.
[10:50] <DanSchnell> Hans-Martin, and then change back to nv?
[10:51] <rukuartic> mikebot: If you start a TightVNC server you can use VNC as well
[10:51] <mentok> rukuartic GalaX11: 'sudo -i' if its safer
[10:51] <mikebot> rukuartic: i don't know what that means
[10:51] <mentok> rukuartic GalaX11: I haven only used sudo su -
[10:51] <Bluhd> I cannot get any sound through GAIM, but VLC and RhythmBox work. I just upgraded to 6.10
[10:51] <mikebot> rukuartic: i just want to connect to the internet with ubuntu
[10:51] <mikebot> rukuartic: that's what i meant
[10:51] <Hans-Martin> DanSchnell: sorry I don't know which sequence of magic tricks will work :-(
[10:51] <Lattyware> So, does anyone know if there is a problem with the nvidia-glx pacakge? Because TwinView won't work, and I'm having video problems too.
[10:51] <macaco> here's the issue:  I had an ubuntu server with fixed ip and now I try to set it up with a dhcp address and it isn't working.  I went to /etc/network/interfaces and resolv.conf and there's no way I can reset the configuration so it can accept dhcp ip address.  Any help?
[10:51] <bthornton> Anybody here running a Pentium D CPU?  If so, what kernel are you using?
[10:51] <xopher> anyone here who could try something out for me? does this repo work: deb http://files.beep-media-player.org/packages/ubuntu edgy testing (both amd64 and i386)
[10:51] <phanter> During the server install of 6.10 I made a lvm volume group. Now I cannot find it in my /etc/fstab. How can I make it to mount?
[10:51] <rukuartic> mentok: I think if you do sudo su you end up getting your environment variables messed up. You just restart bash but apparently the guys here told me to use sudo -i
[10:51] <mabus> psusi: ok and what if I lose all of my users data? I would still care that I have /var around
[10:52] <rukuartic> mikebot: Are you useing ethernet or wireless?
[10:52] <mikebot> rukuartic: ethernet
[10:52] <finalbeta> Is there a way to do system wide equalizing on sound? At the alsa core, or software mixers perhaps?
[10:52] <mentok> rukaurtic: I think it maintains the users environment, but I'd have to double check that
[10:52] <mabus> psusi: or what if I have a malicious user take over one of my quickly written perl scripts? they wouldnt be able to write across filesystems
[10:52] <psusi> mabus: I'm not sure what use /var is if /home is lost...
[10:52] <`Christine> Has anyone actually gotten the nvidia drivers working with direct rendering on edgy eft? If so, I need help.
[10:52] <rukuartic> mikebot: You should just plug the cable into your computer and be right on. Did you see the rx/tx lights on the back turn on?
[10:53] <mentok> rukaurtic: I'm guessing that -i loads the root environment
[10:53] <mabus> psusi: well, I have most of my data in var
[10:53] <mentok> ??
[10:53] <psusi> mabus: ok, then if /var is lost, what use is / and /home?
[10:53] <mikebot> rukuartic: not sure./..it's a school sconnection though, so i don't know if there is soemthing else i have to do...for windows i have to download a cisco cleanaccess agent
[10:53] <DanSchnell> whats the command to edit xorg in terminal? (sudo nano.....
[10:53] <mabus> psusi: to get the machine running again?
[10:53] <mentok> sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:53] <DanSchnell> mentok, thanks
[10:53] <`Christine> sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:53] <`Christine> yeah
[10:53] <`Christine> :)
[10:54] <`Christine> that  :)
[10:54] <Bluhd> Can anyone please help me with this problem of mine?
[10:54] <mentok> DanSchnell: np
[10:54] <epsilon_> yes Bluhd?
[10:54] <Bluhd> ok
[10:54] <SeanTater> !helpme | Bluhd
[10:54] <ubotu> Bluhd: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:54] <Bluhd> I can't get any sound from GAIM
[10:54] <mabus> psusi: to still have something? :/ I think I proved my point enough to justify installing it because I can. Although I agree it's not necessary.
[10:54] <lullabud> "nano".  worst spelling of "vim" ever.
[10:54] <Lattyware> So, does anyone know if there is a problem with the nvidia-glx pacakge? Because TwinView won't work, and I'm having video problems too.
[10:54] <psusi> mabus: my point is that a single failure is not any less likely when using multiple partitions, and Murphys Law says if it does fail, it will be the one you wish didn't
[10:54] <Bluhd> but any other thing like RhythmBox and VLC work
[10:54] <gnomefreak> `Christine: open synaptic and remove all linux-restricted-modules packages than remove nvidia-glx. than install nvidia-glx run sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[10:54] <Bluhd> GAIM is not muted, I think something's wrong with the audio device
[10:54] <Bluhd> or a conflict or something
[10:54] <epsilon_> Bluhd thats not very good make sure in the settings of gaim sound is on and soundfiles are selected :)
[10:54] <`Christine> gnomefreak: what repos should I have selected prior to doing this
[10:55] <Bluhd> epsilon_: already checked ;)
[10:55] <mabus> psusi: fair enough, but I got to get working and we're kind of spamming.. #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:55] <psusi> mabus: but if you really want to... /boot should be 50-100 megs... and / should be 2-3 gb
[10:55] <onur> after every apt-get install i get this error message: http://www.ubuntuusers.de/paste/4974/ how could i solve that?
=== maddlah is now known as maddler
[10:55] <gnomefreak> `Christine: multiverse is the only repo you need for nvidia-glx
[10:55] <epsilon_> Bluhd theeen... go to gnome sound settings and turn on ESD just turn it on maybe it will work then. if not, try other sound systems there.
[10:55] <livingdaylight> HI Guys! any of you have any experience with a Video Codec for windows media Video8?
[10:56] <gnomefreak> `Christine: you already know this. everything im saying now i have told you for the past 3 weeks but instead you do something else i guess. this time do it ;)
[10:56] <gnomefreak> `Christine: stop trying to use the beta drivers
[10:56] <cedd> psusi now all is installed except grub... i cant boot in the system, when booting it says loading grub.. Error 15 then stays there
[10:56] <Bluhd> epsilon_: apparently only OSS works with the "test" button
[10:57] <Bluhd> epsilon_: all the others give me an "opening resource for write" error
[10:57] <psusi> cedd: now you need to install grub... boot from the livecd
[10:57] <Bluhd> epsilon_: this is strange considering most of my audio is all ALSA
[10:57] <macaco> here's the issue:  I had an ubuntu server with fixed ip and now I try to set it up with a dhcp address and it isn't working.  I went to /etc/network/interfaces and resolv.conf and there's no way I can reset the configuration so it can accept dhcp ip address.  Any help?
[10:57] <epsilon_> Bluhd ok. on the other thab in that window turn on esd and try it now
[10:57] <livingdaylight> Anybody aware of playing windows media Video8 in Ubuntu successfully?
[10:57] <cedd> ok ill boot from my alternate cd
[10:57] <adie> ok, this is a slightly ubuntu related question.. does anybody know about insight server vs exchange licensing prices?
[10:57] <lullabud> macaco:  i've had problems going between static and dhcp without doing a reboot.
[10:58] <psusi> cedd: well, I said the live cd, not the alternate cd...  but you can also use the alternate if you boot in rescue mode I think
[10:58] <Bluhd> epsilon_: esd is already on since 6.06 LTS for me
[10:58] <epsilon_> Bluhd well ... sound in linux is well not perfect :) especially with those integrated soundcards... but hell volunteers write every piece of driver!
[10:58] <lullabud> macaco:  you can edit the /etc/network/interfaces file to your liking, then reboot.  i did that on a few machines and it worked only after rebooting.
[10:58] <adie> and does isnight work on ubuntu fine?
[10:58] <lotusleaf> Is there a program or other automated means whereby one may take a bookmarks.html file and split it up into several .html files? I tried bk2site but it wants to create a database file in addition to .html files, I just want several .html files created. Any ideas?
[10:59] <psusi> cedd: either way you need to get to a command line and mount the hard disk
[10:59] <epsilon_> Bluht i think that i wont be able to help you more... thats all i know (though i use 6.10 edgy)
[10:59] <macaco> lullabud: I tried to do so but it seems that it is still looking for the dns I configured once when it was a fixed ip
[10:59] <lullabud> lotusleaf:  that'd be something easy to script in perl or whatever.
[10:59] <cedd> ok ill try the rescue mode since i dont have the livecd
[10:59] <furraymurray> hey i just installed ubuntu and I need to know my root pass to update a file in grub
[10:59] <lotusleaf> lullabud: hi, thanks, yeah I'd imagine =) I guess I could scrounge around for some scripts
[10:59] <lullabud> macaco:  did you change the domain?  if so you may need to change /etc/resolv.conf
[11:00] <lotusleaf> lullabud: since there's probably no one program that does this
[11:00] <furraymurray> can anyone help me
[11:00] <lullabud> lotusleaf:  well, there may be, but there are probably a hundred different implementations.  it depends on how you want the output formatted.
[11:00] <RegalEagle> furraymurray: With what?
[11:00] <macaco> lullabud: I changed it to match this pc.
[11:00] <adie> furray: no you don't
[11:00] <psusi> !root
[11:00] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:00] <epsilon_> furraymurray i'd say RTFM but no.
[11:00] <adie> furray: sudo bash ;)
[11:01] <cryptonic> could someone help me out with using compiz, whenever i activate gl desktop the window borders disapear
[11:01] <epsilon_> furraymurray use sudo and your OWN password
[11:01] <furraymurray> okay so is !root the default root pass?
[11:01] <lotusleaf> lullabud: I'm not picky, just a simple output of an .html file per section
[11:01] <pablouyyyy> what sould i install so i can hace 2 x logins at same time?
[11:01] <lotusleaf> lullabud: any particular program recommendations? :)
[11:01] <adie> furray: if you want root, just sudo bash and then set a root password.
[11:01] <psusi> furraymurray: no... !root was the command for the bot, ubotu, to tell you the standard answer to your question
[11:01] <epsilon_> furraymurray no.
[11:01] <epsilon_> furraymurray dont set a root password its opkay this way
[11:01] <furraymurray> @adie: thanks:)
[11:02] <lullabud> lotusleaf:  nah, honestly that's something so simple i'd probably write my own rather than look for something pre-made.
[11:02] <cryptonic> can anyone help?
[11:02] <epsilon_> furraymurray if you want gedit: "sudo gedit /..filename"
[11:02] <mentok> cryptonic: what do you need help with?
[11:02] <lotusleaf> lullabud: ok, thx, I'll go hunt down a script or bug someone in the know, thanks again for your time =)
[11:02] <epsilon_> cryptonic thats a quite specific question... try the forums
[11:03] <macaco> lullabud: it says Dhcpdiscover on eth0  to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval -number-
[11:03] <adie> epsilon_: I expect he wanted grub-install /dev/sda ??
[11:03] <psusi> cedd: you at a command prompt yet?
[11:03] <lk11mn> psusi: we're at least making progress my sil is now active, but when i go to install there's only /dev/mapper/sil_afagdecefebg: LVM VG ... there's no data1, data2 or anything like that
[11:03] <cedd> well
[11:03] <`Christine> gnomefreak: yeah
[11:03] <azureal> lo, any reason why some programs in /usr/local/bin can be started by typing their name in terminal, but others cannot?
[11:03] <macaco> lullabud: it can't retrieve the ip address no matter what I configure
[11:03] <`Christine> gnomefreak: I have a fresh install
[11:03] <epsilon_> adie: i dunno
[11:03] <cedd> i had 3 installation type plus rescue a broken system to choose from
[11:03] <gnomefreak> `Christine: thats what you said yesterday too
[11:03] <psusi> lk11mn: what do you have in /dev/mapper?  are there partitions?
[11:04] <nolimitsoya> azureal, perhaps you arent typing the right name?
[11:04] <`Christine> gnomefreak: well, I have a fresh install and I haven't done anything to it this time
[11:04] <azureal> i am =)
[11:04] <ailean> is it possible to have a movie playing as desktop wallpaper?
[11:04] <`Christine> gnomefreak: so now we try things your way.
[11:04] <lullabud> macaco:  try pump -i eth0
[11:04] <psusi> cedd: yea... boot into rescume mode and it should give you a command prompt
[11:04] <`Christine> gnomefreak: and if it works I will come back and kiss you. :)
[11:04] <cedd> ok brb
[11:04] <macaco> lullabud: pump command not found
[11:04] <gnomefreak> `Christine: if it is really a clean install dont remove l-r-m
[11:04] <adie> epsilon_: the way ubuntu does things isn't neccessarly correct, or your way of working.. though anything will seem to break the dapper upgrade to edgy :(
[11:04] <lullabud> macaco:  install it. ;-)
[11:04] <azureal> nolimitsoya, sry, works now... opened new terminal =P
[11:05] <gnomefreak> `Christine: unless you tried to isntall beta drivers on it
[11:05] <nolimitsoya> :)
[11:05] <macaco> apt-get install pump ?
[11:05] <lullabud> macaco:  yes sir
[11:05] <`Christine> gnomefreak: oops, too late
[11:05] <lullabud> macaco:  ...or ma'am
[11:05] <azureal> nolimitsoya, must have been something not being updated, for i had just compiled it
[11:05] <`Christine> gnomefreak: it looks like it put l-r-m back though
[11:05] <`Christine> gnomefreak: yeah, it did
[11:05] <lk11mn> psusi: it has the 2 that were there before, isw_x_DATA and isw_x_DATA1 and the new one which is sil_x but it doesnt seem to be showing me the partitions from that array
[11:05] <Gabby_Hayes> need a command:  apt-get install brain  (sometimes wonder...)
[11:05] <ailean> anyone?
[11:05] <ailean> is it possible to have a movie playing as desktop wallpaper?
[11:05] <epsilon_> adie: i like this sudo thing... imho. it makes the whole thing easier to understand for everyone but still secure (and there is no root-login thing:))
[11:05] <macaco> lullabud:  ... I'm a sir... heheh ....  how can I download the package if I can't connect to the internet?
[11:05] <Jaak> a time ago i asked for a tip on a dvd ripper for ubu, i got DD as result, but i can't find anything on it, can someone give me a link of something??
[11:06] <qubix__> ailean: why would you do that?
[11:06] <lullabud> macaco:  ah, true...
[11:06] <psusi> lk11mn: then you don't have any partitions on that array
[11:06] <lullabud> macaco:  you could set yourself up statically with the correct settings.
[11:06] <macaco> lullabud: I put the cd on it... ='(
[11:06] <epsilon_> ailean: i dont think so... or if even its quite complicated... and what type of movie do you want to play? ;)
[11:06] <Hans-Martin> bye folks... bed is calling
[11:06] <ailean> qubix__, advertising on public computers. it'll mean i don't have to charge for their use
[11:06] <Poromenos> do automatix and easyubuntu really break stuff?
[11:06] <PuRu_> Can anyone tell me what i need to do to get 2D accelleration and TV-out on my geforce 420 go? Should i install the standard nvidia drivers or use drivers from ubuntu?
[11:06] <ailean> epsilon_, a short advert without sound
[11:07] <epsilon_> ailean: yea :D
[11:07] <lk11mn> psusi: Ohhh but i do! i have 2 ntfs partitions on it! (christ well i did an hour ago!!)
[11:07] <radam> Hi. I was wondering if it was possible to set the umask for a file system - so that if a user creates a new file/directory it will, by default, be group writable?
[11:07] <macaco> lullabud:  In order to set it up as dhcp what should I check out?  1. /etc/network/interfaces ; 2. resolv.conf  ; 3. and?
[11:07] <psusi> lk11mn: are you sure?  fdisk -l on it and see
[11:07] <abo> I have lost the sound in my edgy, the sound works fine in windows (just tried it) anyone can help?
[11:07] <Yoshi> Hi
[11:07] <Yoshi> Who used Vim with the Project plugin ?
[11:07] <macaco> lullabud:  as far as I know that should be enough for it, right?
[11:07] <epsilon_> PuRu_: ubuntu drivers are OK, easier to install (type !nvidia for a guide link)
[11:07] <ailean> epsilon_, qubix__ any idea where i should start?
[11:07] <mabus> How come my edgy server install cd didn't have a lamp server option, like it did in dapper and below?
[11:08] <mcphail> radam: this is possible, but not from nautilus
[11:08] <dirtbag> !ati
[11:08] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:08] <Triplemeh> good afternoon, I have a question
[11:08] <radam> mcphail: thats fine, im working on the command line
[11:08] <epsilon_> ailean: no. absoultely no...
[11:08] <Triplemeh> why does nautilus keep saving all of my firefox downloads with a .bin extension? (Edgy)
[11:08] <lullabud> macaco:  yeah, /etc/network/interfaces is the main one.  resolv.conf can stay the same as long as there's a valid DNS server in there.
[11:08] <Poromenos> do automatix and easyubuntu really break stuff?
[11:08] <Yoshi> nobody use Vim with the Project plugin?
[11:08] <cedd> the only command line i can have is selct rescue a broken system then select execute a shell from the menu
[11:08] <ailean> epsilon_, "absolutely" no? is that because you don't know, or don't agree with advertising?
[11:09] <epsilon_> Poromenos: i dunno if automatix uses official universe & multiverse. easyubuntu doesnt work on edgy for me :(
[11:09] <psusi> cedd: yes... thats what you should be doing
[11:09] <epsilon_> ailean: i dont know :D
[11:09] <cedd> ok im there
[11:09] <ailean> k :)
[11:09] <adie> epsilon_: yeah, I understand what you mean, but the sudo thing is for people who don't understand what they're doing or the justification of it.
[11:09] <mcphail> radam: have a look in /etc/login.defs
[11:09] <Bluhd> epsilon_: I did some investigating and it seems that I cannot output audio through ALSA. If I set the Audio Playback device to ALSA then RhythmBox cannot start any audio files.
[11:09] <Poromenos> epsilon_: hmm, i think automatix doesn't, it always overwrites the sources.list file
[11:09] <adie> epsilon_: otherwise you have your own way of doing it.
[11:09] <wiseman> hallo
[11:09] <epsilon_> Bluhd: ok :(
[11:09] <psusi> cedd: ok... now which partition is your /boot and which is your / again?
[11:09] <dirtbag> Anyone use Mplayer?
[11:09] <Triplemeh> I use mplayer
[11:09] <epsilon_> Poromenos: you need codecs?
[11:09] <Triplemeh> mpg support seems broken
[11:09] <Yoshi> anyone use Vim with the Project plugin?
[11:10] <PuRu_> would this be the best way to setup my tv out and drivers: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[11:10] <wiseman> kan somebody help
[11:10] <epsilon_> !restrictedformats
[11:10] <PuRu_> ?

[11:10] <lk11mn> psusi ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ fdisk -l /dev/mapper/sil_afagdecefebg
[11:10] <lk11mn> Cannot open /dev/mapper/sil_afagdecefebg    like that?
[11:10] <Poromenos> epsilon_: among other stuff, but my previous installation broke and i don't know if that was the reason
[11:10] <epsilon_> yes PuRu_
[11:10] <avagant> Oh lawdy what I would give for a 250gb hd.
[11:10] <dirtbag> Is it the only on that plays wmv?
[11:10] <radam> mcphail: thanks. Is it possible to set it to 0002 for just one filesystem/directory?
[11:10] <psusi> lk11mn: yes... sudo it
[11:10] <epsilon_> Poromenos: you can go without them, it's not that hard.
[11:10] <PuRu_> thanx epsilon
[11:10] <Triplemeh> I don't think we can discuss wmv
[11:10] <mcphail> radam: don't know about that one
[11:10] <dirtbag> Oh
[11:10] <avagant> Or 2 250's or even 2 250's and a 20...oh the power.
[11:10] <epsilon_> Poromenos: installing codecs is ONE command see guide.
[11:11] <DrNick_> 250Gb HDD's are fairly cheap now.  I got one a couple of months back for around 50 quid, including VAT and delivery
[11:11] <radam> mcphail: thats ok, thanks for the help
[11:11] <Poromenos> epsilon_: ah, okay, thanks :)
[11:11] <josh_> hello all, i am having a problem accessing a windows share... i have it shared out... i have it setup correctly (as in i can log into it with root) and its mounted through my fstab
[11:11] <macaco> lullabud: I'll reboot and check out what happens... I've rebooted several times... I'm just going to pay attention to iy
[11:11] <dirtbag> I did install codecs
[11:11] <avagant> DrNick_: That's what I was just reading.
[11:11] <josh_> but now i cant get into it as my normal user account
[11:11] <josh_> nothing has changed that i know of
[11:11] <avagant> DrNick_: I saw one for 59 dollars.
[11:11] <josh_> what do i need to look at?
[11:11] <avagant> Oh if only I had 59 extra dollars.
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
=== exmethix is now known as exmethix_
[11:11] <PuRu_> i LOVE that ubuntu boots in 1600x1200 on my laptop without even changing any settings :-)
[11:11] <creator> hi all
[11:11] <avagant> I wouldn't even need to use my 2 10gb hd's.
[11:12] <epsilon_> adie: anyway i still like sudo you can hate it .... geez my dream is to write a 1 minute linux quick-scan guide for guys like me who hate reading docs just want INFO :D
[11:12] <psusi> lk11mn: you there?
[11:12] <avagant> I could just use 10gb for winxp and the rest of ubuntu!
[11:12] <creator> slmm
[11:12] <josh_> anyone know what is going on with it?
[11:12] <DrNick_> avagant, yeah, thats very good. around the same price here I think roughly if i've converted to 's correctly
[11:12] <nolimitsoya> josh_, chown the mount directory
[11:12] <josh_> tried
[11:12] <josh_> wont let me change permissions
[11:12] <avagant> DrNick_: Oh man, I never knew it would be that awesome.
[11:12] <DrNick_> avagant, this particular one I bought was a Seagate as well so a very good drive :)
[11:12] <lk11mn> psusi k just figured sudo is actually a command (i thought it just meant do soething from root)
[11:12] <nolimitsoya> josh_, you have to chown as root
[11:12] <ailean> hardware is generally the same price in  as it is in $ (i.e. number of  or $)
[11:12] <avagant> DrNick_: I saw one of those on Tiger.com?
[11:12] <psusi> lk11mn: it is a command that runs the rest of the line as root
[11:13] <avagant> Or something like that.
[11:13] <nolimitsoya> josh_, chown username:username /directory
[11:13] <cedd> boot is in sda (sda1) and / is in raid md0
[11:13] <josh_> yeah i know that... doesn't work though
[11:13] <avagant> I'll have to remember seagate is a good hd.
[11:13] <Bluhd> epsilon_: The only audio library that works is OSS. Are there any packages I can reinstall to attempt to get ALSA working again?
[11:13] <DrNick_> avagant, if its a PC hardware store its bound to have Seagate drives they're very popular, and in my opinion the best hard drives.
[11:13] <nolimitsoya> josh_, are you owner? is the drive mounted as writable? (using ntfs-3g or captive)
[11:13] <avagant> I have a maxtor and something else right now, 10gb's on seperate drives and that's not enough for what I want to do.
[11:13] <wiseman> I am wiseman
[11:13] <macaco> lullabud:  I did it ... and ... eth0 is not getting nay ipv4 address
[11:13] <wiseman> a begginer in freenet
[11:14] <Poromenos> how do i delete a line in pico?
[11:14] <josh_> no, not mounted as writeable
[11:14] <lk11mn> psusi: it lists the two partitions!! in fdisk
[11:14] <josh_> i only want to access the backup files
[11:14] <lk11mn> sil_afagdecefebg1 sil_afagdecefebg2
[11:14] <psusi> cedd: then do this... mkdir /target ; moun -t ext3 /dev/md0 /target
[11:14] <avagant> I don't know how to make them one drive and I don't dare try after what I've read.
[11:14] <macaco> Poromenos: with ctrl + k
[11:14] <josh_> and i can do taht as root, and i used to be able to as my user
[11:14] <wiseman> hoe kan add me please
[11:14] <epsilon_> Bluhd: in my edgy (sorry now im in Window$) both is installed by default... search for alsa in synaptic thats all i can say (you need an alsa library)
[11:14] <Poromenos> macaco: great, thanks!
[11:14] <livingdaylight> XChat isn't letting me put tabs at the bottom....arrrr....
[11:14] <teenprogrammer> dual monitors ... ubuntu ... is it possible?
[11:14] <psusi> lk11mn: but dmraid -ay does not create them in /dev/mapper when you look there?
[11:14] <avagant> But dualbooting feels good.
[11:14] <macaco> Poromenos: it is not a delete
[11:14] <nolimitsoya> avagant, if you are looking for a harddrive for desktop use id suggest samsung spinpoint 120, or hitachi t7k250. for storage, the seagate is fine :)
[11:14] <PuRu_> whats the difference between the regular nvidia driver or this one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[11:14] <PuRu_> ?
[11:14] <DrNick_> avagant, it will mean setting things up agian, but you can with LVM.
[11:15] <khirr> ello
[11:15] <lullabud> macaco:  that sucks man...
[11:15] <Poromenos> macaco: what is it?
[11:15] <`Christine> teenprogrammer: you want to use xinerama
[11:15] <macaco> Poromenos: it is a cut... as in cut-past  if you need the line again just press ctrl+u
[11:15] <TGPO> livingdaylight, how are you going about it?
[11:15] <`Christine> ubotu, tell me about xinerama
[11:15] <josh_> anyone?
[11:15] <avagant> DrNick_: You mean reinstalling everything?
[11:15] <lullabud> macaco:  try `sudo tcpdump -i eth0` and see if anything comes out.
[11:15] <Poromenos> macaco: ah, also good, thanks
[11:15] <DrNick_> avagant, afraid so yeah.
[11:15] <nolimitsoya> josh_, are you trying to change permissions on a driva thats not mounted writable?
[11:15] <nolimitsoya> *drive
[11:15] <cedd> ok
[11:15] <khirr> i'm suse user, i'd like know if kubuntu, the lastest verion of 64 bits, is good
[11:15] <teenprogrammer> Christine: whats xinerma ?
[11:15] <avagant> DrNick_: Now that's something I don't think I can do again.
[11:15] <`Christine> !xinerama > teenprogrammer
[11:15] <josh_> nolimitsoya: no... im trying to just access it
[11:15] <livingdaylight> TGPO, seetings>preferences>tabs>bottom
[11:15] <josh_> 2 days ago i could
[11:15] <josh_> now i cant
[11:15] <avagant> DrNick_: It took pretty much all of yesterday to get winxp and ubuntu installed.
[11:15] <lk11mn> psusi: RAID set "isw_hebacbgjj_DATA" already active
[11:15] <lk11mn> RAID set "sil_afagdecefebg" already active
[11:15] <lk11mn> RAID set "isw_hebacbgjj_DATA1" already active
[11:15] <lk11mn>                   no, it doesnt show the partitions for it
[11:15] <josh_> unless im root
[11:15] <macaco> lullabud: I see the arp requests
[11:16] <TGPO> livingdaylight, odd, that should do it ....
=== exmethix_ is now known as exmethix
[11:16] <lullabud> macaco:  no replies though?
[11:16] <josh_> cant change permissions/owner of mount either
[11:16] <DrNick_> avagant, ah well, whats a day when it all works nicely in the end :p
[11:16] <nolimitsoya> josh_, and whats not working for you then? error message?
[11:16] <macaco> Poromenos:  u welcome
[11:16] <epsilon_> PuRu_: a regular driver is the newest one from nvidia.com . the ubuntu driver is still regular, but not the newest, it is easier to install, and your system won't crash after every kernel update (you need to reinstall nvidia.com drivers after every update). its simply better :)
[11:16] <josh_> yeah, not read permission
[11:16] <avagant> My cdrom doesn't work so I had to netboot.
[11:16] <dirtbag> Triplemeh: Did you get it from the site or Synaptic?
[11:16] <DrNick_> :/
[11:16] <livingdaylight> TGPO, i know... it used to, but in Edgy this is how it is
[11:16] <avagant> On top of netbooting which took about 3 hours itself.
[11:16] <lullabud> macaco:  if you don't see anything that's not from your own MAC address then it's probably not your system that's the problem.
[11:16] <macaco> lullabud: I see the arp requests... from the Class C subnet I'm in right now
[11:16] <lk11mn> psusi: sil_afagdecefebg shows up as active but not the partitions on it, and they dont show up in dev/mapper
[11:16] <adie> epsilon_: that's your personal oppinion, and it's mine... however people like to do things differently... atm I'm trying to convince the country manager of my company that he doesn't want an exchange server for a unix company with 3 windows laptopsl, 80 linux desktops, and 600+ linux servers and 100+ *nix servers...
[11:16] <Triplemeh> did I get what where?
[11:16] <avagant> It took an hour to run winxp.
[11:16] <Triplemeh> win32 codecs?
[11:16] <lullabud> macaco:  oooh, so you see ARP requests from other hosts?
[11:16] <nolimitsoya> josh_, unmount, and chmod the mount dir
[11:16] <TGPO> livingdaylight, I using edgy and have no probs with xchat, tabs on bottom
[11:16] <PuRu_> with that info, i can only agree, epsilon
[11:17] <ph8> hi all, i'm having trouble using logwatch with postfix
[11:17] <Triplemeh> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[11:17] <psusi> lk11mn: do dmraid -an to deactivate them, then reactivate with --verbose
[11:17] <avagant> And then it took even longer to get them set up so that I can access my windows drive.
[11:17] <nolimitsoya> josh_, and chown again, if ownership gotmessed up forsome reason...
[11:17] <livingdaylight> TGPO, did you install xchat only or systray with it?
[11:17] <PuRu_> gonna try it after smoking
[11:17] <ph8> sendmail: fatal: Recipient addresses must be specified on the command line or via the -t option <-- fun errors like that - anyone come across similar?
[11:17] <lullabud> macaco:  you might try leaving that running while you do pump.
[11:17] <epsilon_> adie: pardon, exchange these for what? :S
[11:17] <avagant> But dualbooting is fun.
[11:17] <TGPO> livingdaylight, try right clicking in the screen View | Layout | Tabs
[11:17] <epsilon_> PuRu_: so go! :)
[11:17] <avagant> Especially since I don't "need" my winxp drive, but just in case.
[11:18] <lullabud> macaco:  probably a better troubleshooting tool for this situation is arpwatch
[11:18] <nolimitsoya> ph8, looks as if you just need tospecify an adress :)
[11:18] <adie> epsilon_: yeah, apparently I'm meant to support it. I've not touched a windows box since about '96
[11:18] <avagant> DrNick_: I'm teaching myself how to break and repair things. LOL
[11:18] <DrNick_> avagant, yep.  well, with a new CD-ROM being all of about 5 quid though.....
[11:18] <lullabud> macaco:  arpwatch will give you info about DHCP requests, ack's and nak's and stuff.
[11:18] <ph8> but there's one in the logwatch conf and i've tried it with --mailto on the command line
[11:18] <TGPO> livingdaylight, xchat only, I dont have a systray for it to sit in
[11:18] <ph8> so i'm assuming it's a compatibility thing?
[11:18] <avagant> DrNick_: Well right now even that's too much.
[11:18] <DrNick_> avagant, ah ok - student 'eh?  :p
[11:18] <avagant> Hmm I wonder if I could pull the one out of the old tower that's laying around in the garage and put it in this.
[11:18] <livingdaylight> TGPO, screenview?
[11:19] <avagant> DrNick_: Student to the world of computers, yes. LOL
[11:19] <livingdaylight> TGPO, i might uninstall and reinstall, something doesn't feel right here
[11:19] <lk11mn> psusi: INFO: Activating GROUP RAID set "isw_hebacbgjj"

[11:19] <avagant> I never paid attention to how one is run until about a year ago.
[11:19] <TGPO> livingdaylight, right click in the text screen then View | Layout | Tabs
[11:19] <mlehrer_work> why does evolution use 550M of ram
[11:19] <DrNick_> avagant, cool.  well yeah you should be able to use the other CD-ROM drive fine
[11:20] <avagant> I don't know how to install it though.
[11:20] <avagant> That's my problem.
[11:20] <cedd> i received that cannot created /target in /dev/md0 directory already exist ... and ... cannot find /dev/md0/target in /etc/fstab
[11:20] <avagant> In most cases I imagine you just slide it in.
[11:20] <macaco> lullabud: yep...  i'll try installing it...
[11:20] <epsilon_> adie: thats cool :) i think that if i get a laptop from my parent next year i will install ubuntu on it :) honestly, i got hooked up on community. i installed it on last monday and afer one day i was helping out others on IRC.
[11:20] <landexem> I just ran "apt-get dist-upgrade" on a Dapper install and now that all the packages are upgraded to Edgy versions, X11 won't start up
[11:20] <psusi> lk11mn: add --verbose and paste the results to pastebin
[11:20] <lullabud> macaco:  oh shit, i forgot about the net thing.  gah, that's frustrating!
[11:20] <avagant> But I bought this computer off of Craigslist, so I don't know if there will be any other complications.
[11:20] <livingdaylight> TGPO, text screen? where i am writing this? when i right click here i don't get view|layout
[11:20] <landexem> It fails with errors, but I can't read them because the fonts are messed up too
[11:21] <landexem> The normal console is fine, but Ctrl+Alt+F7 is always messed up
[11:21] <Yoshi> anyone use Vim with the Project plugin?
=== Tom39Away_ is now known as Tom39Away
[11:21] <avagant> Funny, my cd rom drive worked fine with the windows install disc, but the minute I put the ubuntu one in, bam.
[11:21] <livingdaylight> Can Anyone Tell me whether USENET works for you in Evolution?
[11:21] <TGPO> livingdaylight, what do you see when you right click in the screen?
[11:21] <DrNick_> avagant, should just be able to plug it in replacing the old one.  check the jumper on the old drive though to see if its set as master, slave or cable select.  set the "new" drive to the same as the old one and you should be fine
[11:21] <lk11mn> sry what's pastebin?
[11:21] <avagant> I figured as such.
[11:21] <macaco> lullabud: what's that net thing?   I did a ifdown eth0 and it said: dhcprelease on 192.168.0.8 port 67
[11:21] <livingdaylight> TGPO, select all
[11:21] <nolimitsoya> avagant, some drives are picky when it comes to booting from cdrw, and even some cdr. try another disc
[11:21] <lk11mn> psusi:  sry what's pastebin?
[11:22] <DrNick_> avagant, I'm assuming you're using IDE/ATA drives, not SCSI
[11:22] <josh_> how do i make this freggin thing work...
[11:22] <lullabud> macaco:  i forgot that you can't install packages because you have no internet connectivity.
[11:22] <avagant> nolimitsoya: That's the proble, I've tried like 20 different discs. Haha
[11:22] <josh_> i have changed my user groups
[11:22] <avagant> "problem"
[11:22] <charle97> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[11:22] <DanSchnell> Is there a reason when i try to restart gdm it fails?
[11:22] <macaco> lullabud: that private ip address was the fixed gateway
[11:22] <lullabud> macaco:  is that your subnet?
[11:22] <avagant> DrNick_: You re correct.
[11:22] <TGPO> livingdaylight, move your mouse 2 towards the top and right click again
[11:22] <adie> epsilon_: exchange, windows or both? is it easy? - I hear win2k3 doesn't blue screen link win'95 did?
[11:22] <josh_> gksudo command wont work so i cant access it that way
[11:22] <livingdaylight> TGPO, Input methods|Insert unicodeblabla|insert attributeblabla
[11:22] <josh_> i dont want to do it as root though either
[11:22] <psusi> lk11mn: http://pastebin.com/ << paste long stuff there, then paste url it gives to channel to avoid flood
[11:22] <nolimitsoya> josh_, you are going to have to descripbe you problem more thuroughly :)
[11:22] <nolimitsoya> *o
[11:22] <TGPO> livingdaylight, move your mouse 2 towards the top and right click again
[11:22] <avagant> If you can't gksudo there's a problem. Haha
[11:22] <macaco> lullabud: it was the subnet when it was  fixed.   I can't set it off now   I dunno why
[11:22] <avagant> I had the same problem where I'd changed permissions in something.
[11:23] <lullabud> macaco:  is this edgy or dapper?
[11:23] <avagant> Edgy was a royal pain to get updated too, took almost 3 hours.
[11:23] <josh_> ok, problem = mounted windows drive wont allow anyone but root to access it. main user account (who i have added to just about every group[including root]  cant access the share even to read.
[11:23] <livingdaylight> TGPO, LOL, yea, found view there and YES works now!
[11:23] <lullabud> macaco:  ubuntu networking is frustrating.  it has always been a little buggy for me...
[11:23] <cedd> psusi: i received that, cannot created /target in /dev/md0 directory already exist ... and ... cannot find /dev/md0/target in /etc/fstab
[11:23] <avagant> Did you put it in fstab?
[11:23] <lk11mn> psusi: k, cool, just the command i'm using is sudo dmraid -ay -v
[11:23] <lk11mn>  ... anyway
[11:23] <josh_> yes
[11:23] <foo> This ubuntu system crashed.. just completely froze on good hardware. There is nothing in /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog ... what else can I check?
[11:23] <TGPO> livingdaylight, glad I could help
[11:24] <macaco> lullabud: dapper
[11:24] <khirr> can i use karamba under ubuntu?
[11:24] <livingdaylight> TGPO, not as glad as me - thank you :)
[11:24] <josh_> avagant: is that a problem?
[11:24] <epsilon_> adie: on a laptop, if hardware works, only linux. its good for email and writing (i only use OOo and my mother too [im 17] ). on my computer now there is linux and windows and only i use linux for fun mostly and everything except games :)
[11:24] <psusi> cedd: are you sure you typed it correctly?  this time just do mkdir /target
[11:24] <DrNick_> SCSI can be a real pain in the ass to set up sometimes.  newer hardware is generally fine, but go back past about 5 years ago and things can get complicated sometimes
[11:24] <avagant> josh_: Changing permissions on sudo, it can be a big pain the rear.
[11:24] <cedd> ok
[11:24] <livingdaylight> TGPO, still find it odd that i couldn't get it to work from the menu bar :s
[11:24] <lk11mn> psusi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30483/
[11:24] <macaco> lullabud: everything you said and everything I've done should work ... but there's something very tiny and so obvious that we aren't paying attention to it...
[11:24] <avagant> I don't remember what I had to do, I think I had to chown something.
[11:24] <Staz> Ho, is it ok to use DEBUNTU depositories in ubuntu?
[11:24] <nolimitsoya> josh_, but still, you havent given the exact error message, you didnt (as far as i could see) awnser my question as to  wether you where actualy listed as owner of the dir, or the exact readpermissions set
[11:24] <Staz> Hi*
[11:25] <josh_> the error message is that my account doesn't have sufficient privledges to read the mount
[11:25] <avagant> I had chown -R skt:skt i think /usr/bin and i couldn't sudo anymore.
[11:25] <foo> lullabud: AH
[11:25] <cedd> file exist
[11:25] <lullabud> foo: that's exactly the kind of thing i'd expect you to say.
[11:25] <josh_> dr-x------  1 root plugdev 16384 2006-11-04 20:14 hda1
[11:25] <psusi> lk11mn: hrm.... make that -vvvv
[11:25] <foo> lullabud: :D
[11:25] <josh_> and i cant manage to change those permissions
[11:26] <lullabud> foo:  hopefully your speech today was more eloquent.
[11:26] <psusi> cedd: ok... that's fine... then moun -t ext3 /target /dev/md0
[11:26] <lullabud> macaco:  you're right... something tiny...
[11:26] <nolimitsoya> josh_, chmod changes permissions, and chown changes owner. use them.
[11:26] <avagant> you tried chown root:username /hda1?
[11:26] <psusi> cedd: s/moun/mount
[11:26] <adie> epsilon_: ah, I thought you were saying you'd played with windows recently.. I didn't realise you wern't talking of exchange and stuff :-/
[11:26] <lullabud> macaco:  arpwatch would be very very useful, even if run from a different computer on the network.
[11:26] <livingdaylight> TGPO, you don't use Evolution do you?
[11:26] <TGPO> livingdaylight, nope
[11:26] <epsilon_> adie: ok sorry :D
[11:26] <livingdaylight> arrrr...
[11:26] <livingdaylight> Anybody here use Evolution?
[11:27] <nolimitsoya> !ask
[11:27] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:27] <mlehrer_work> unfortunately yes
[11:27] <josh_> nolimitsoya: im not a dumbass... im well aware of chown and chmod... they WONT work... even as root user : root@Linux:/media# chown josh /media/hda1;chmod 777 /media/hda1
[11:27] <avagant> I use Evolution, but only for mail.
[11:27] <cedd> s: not found
[11:27] <josh_> chown: changing ownership of `/media/hda1': Read-only file system
[11:27] <SB|nblracer> Any reason why the packedge manger shows old version of apache
[11:27] <josh_> chmod: changing permissions of `/media/hda1': Read-only file system
[11:27] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: I do use evolution
[11:27] <foo> lullabud: OH
[11:27] <psusi> cedd: huh?
[11:27] <livingdaylight> mlehrer_work, i know what you mean. Could you tell me whether USEnet works for you? Never has for me
[11:27] <avagant> do you Sudo chown them?
[11:27] <`Christine> igh
[11:27] <lk11mn> psusi: k, that looks alot more interesting http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30484/ (maybe i'll try more v's for fun)
[11:27] <josh_> no... im the ROOT user... no sudo needed
[11:28] <`Christine> you need to change the ownership of the mount point
[11:28] <avagant> hmm
[11:28] <`Christine> not the device itself
[11:28] <avagant> PUNT
[11:28] <nolimitsoya> josh_, the correct way is 'sudo chown josh:josh /media/hda1 && sudo chmod 777 /media/hda1
[11:28] <josh_> hda1 is the mount point
[11:28] <mlehrer_work> livingdaylight: haven't tried it, i am just running into a 550M evolution process
[11:28] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, do you use usenet - its the one thing i've never got to work in Evolution. It just 'loads' perpetually
[11:28] <macaco> lullabud: when I did the ifdown eth0 it said also something like sending to LPF eth0 and a hex address
[11:28] <nolimitsoya> josh_, but that 777 is terribly dangerous! dont use it
[11:28] <TGPO> livingdaylight, try Pan for usenet, it works well for me
[11:28] <macaco> lullabud: what is that LPF stuff?
[11:28] <cedd> thats the replys i received afater typing s /moun/mount
[11:28] <epsilon_> adie: imho putting a "GET-HELP-NOW!" Ubuntu wiki link on the default desktop and putting an insta-nvidia-MP3codec link on the wiki frontpage would lower irc activity by 300% :P
[11:28] <mlehrer_work> josh_: use a+rwx, not 777
[11:28] <lullabud> macaco:  no clue.
[11:28] <avagant> nolimitsoya: Totally, like I said I've done that so many times.
[11:29] <avagant> And screwed up SO many times.
[11:29] <livingdaylight> TGPO, i like integration. The point is that usenet is supposed to work in Evolution, but just doesn't for me. I wonder whether i'm the exception
[11:29] <josh_> josh@Linux:/media$  sudo chown josh:josh /media/hda1 && sudo chmod 777 /media/hda1
[11:29] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: I just use it for mail, sorry :(
[11:29] <josh_> chown: changing ownership of `/media/hda1': Read-only file system
[11:29] <nolimitsoya> avagant, then dont, in the future :)
[11:29] <avagant> Oh no don't worry.
[11:29] <adie> epsilon_: IMHO including the nvidia drivers and ati drivers on the standard cd would be the most sensible option...
[11:29] <avagant> I make sure I know what I'm typing before I type it. Haha
[11:29] <PuRu_> Synaptic Package Manager is nowhere :(
[11:29] <DrNick_> josh_, is there an entry for the filesystem in /etc/fstab?
[11:29] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you couldn't test it for me real quick could ya? it takes a second to set up in accounts
[11:29] <`Christine> gnomefreak: you here?
[11:29] <nolimitsoya> josh_, any luck?
[11:29] <josh_> yes dr nick
[11:29] <gnomefreak> `Christine: sort of
[11:30] <josh_> ^^^^ nope nolimitsoya
[11:30] <PuRu_> pfff getting a bit pissed off...
[11:30] <`Christine> when i do nvidia-glx-config i get an error
[11:30] <PuRu_> every damn, metrhod i try something doesnt work
[11:30] <psusi> lk11mn: strange... it doesn't appear to bother scanning for partitions on the sil
[11:30] <`Christine> may i PM?
[11:30] <nolimitsoya> josh_, i dont se any error message when changing permissions.
[11:30] <Jural> question, anyone have gdesklets running on a 1440x900 resolution? the starter bar to be precise?
[11:30] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: gimme just 5 minutes while I finish downloading some packages and I'll try it for you ;)
[11:30] <epsilon_> adie: AFAIK thats not possible because of licensing reasons (nvidia driver is only free for home use and what if somebody installs in an office? LOL.). and there are many kernel types.
[11:30] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak, are you fading? :p
[11:30] <gnomefreak> `Christine: the error says it cant do it right?
[11:30] <denys> after upgrade to Edgy I lost my X server - it cannot find the driver for my r128 card, what to do?
[11:30] <psusi> lk11mn: try using -f sil so it only looks at the sil and not the other one
[11:30] <maryann> okay I'm new to ubuntu (but not linux) where do I find make?
[11:30] <bruenig> !xconfig | psusi
[11:30] <ubotu> psusi: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[11:30] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you're a pal :p
[11:30] <DrNick_> josh_, what does its entry say about mounting it - is it set to mount it read only (ro) or read/write (rw)?
[11:30] <`Christine> gnomefreak: yes
[11:30] <maryann> locate make isn't coming up with anything.
[11:31] <lk11mn> psusi: k, will try
[11:31] <PuRu_> where do i find Synaptic Package Manager?
[11:31] <bruenig> maryann, sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:31] <gnomefreak> `Christine: that command will only work if your driver is set to something other than nvidia
[11:31] <josh_> root@Linux:/media# grep hda1 /etc/fstab
[11:31] <josh_> /dev/hda1       /media/hda1     ntfs    user,auto,defaults,nls=utf8,gid=46 0       1
[11:31] <nolimitsoya> josh_, did you pass the command to a mounted drive, or just a mountpoint? have you tried the chmod with -r option?
[11:31] <psusi> bruenig: I didn't need to know that
[11:31] <maryann> thanks bruenig
[11:31] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: no probs ;)
[11:31] <`Christine> Gnomefreak:
[11:31] <`Christine> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[11:31] <`Christine> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[11:31] <gnomefreak> `Christine: check the xorg.conf to see what driver it is set to
[11:31] <pppoe_dude> maryann, /usr/bin/make
[11:31] <adie> epsilon_: the problem is it's politics... you can give the user a script and the files and get them to manually install after recent license revisions by nvidia... however it's not free software so they don't like it.
[11:31] <gnomefreak> `Christine: what does apt-cache policy nvidia-glx say?
[11:31] <gnomefreak> `Christine: what version
[11:31] <epsilon_> adie: and search the wiki, there are many-many ideas for that (making more CD flavours, a wizard - then it would have to check the users country for software restrictions etc. but thats private info then ask it but then what if the user lies......)
[11:31] <DrNick_> josh_, ah yes, it can't write to ntfs disks.  so you can't change ownership of files on it etc
[11:31] <adie> epsilon_: but if people want to run restricted hardware, they want restricted drivers.
[11:32] <bruenig> psusi, sorry, I intended that for the comment above yours
[11:32] <josh_> i dont want to write... i want to read
[11:32] <maryann> thanks pppoe_dude
[11:32] <lk11mn> psusi:  hey now, hold up, -f format?
[11:32] <DrNick_> josh_, changing ownership or permissions is writing ;)
[11:32] <epsilon_> adie: of course, since there is no open-souce hardware :)
[11:32] <`Christine> gnomefreak: nvidia-glx:
[11:32] <`Christine>   Installed: 1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1
[11:32] <`Christine>   Candidate: 1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1
[11:32] <psusi> lk11mn: yea... -f sil, so it only looks for sil arrays
[11:32] <josh_> but i didn't change the permissions since 2 days ago and i could read just fine
[11:32] <macaco> lullabud: I think there's something with the dhclient because it says that dhcprelease is still looking fo the old dhcp server
[11:32] <cedd> well iguess ill give up ive been trying all day lmao
[11:32] <TGPO> Christine I had the same problem, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and find where it says nv and change it to nvidia
[11:32] <gnomefreak> `Christine: w2hat version of linux-restricted-modules package is installed?
=== conny_ is now known as conny_laptop
[11:33] <adie> epsilon_: tried installing ubuntu on a box with intel integrated graphics and doing glxgears speed tests comparing it to the latest ati card?
[11:33] <DrNick_> josh_, oh sorry i thought the problem was with changing permissions -  you can't read from it at all then?
[11:33] <PuRu_> where do i find Synaptic Package Manager? anyone please?
[11:33] <epsilon_> adie: AFAIK and there are restrictions for example you cant use certain software in certain countries
[11:33] <josh_> no DrNick_ not unless im root
[11:33] <epsilon_> adie: no. :)
[11:33] <josh_> and since my gksudo wont work, thats a problem
[11:33] <Agrajag> josh_: you need to set a umask in your fstab line
[11:33] <bruenig> PuRu_, generally it is in the menus, at system>administration>Synaptic package manager
[11:33] <PuRu_> its so weird :s
[11:33] <PuRu_> also on 6.06?
[11:33] <DrNick_> josh_, that'd odd as the user option is specified in your fstab entry which means the mount point *should* be user mountable/unmountable
[11:33] <PuRu_> because i really dont find it :s
[11:33] <lk11mn> psusi:  sudo dmraid -f sil  and that's not gonna format my drive? sry, just i see the word format several times in the help, im a little warey
[11:34] <pumaxde> Hello everybody.
[11:34] <maryann> where are the kernel header files?
[11:34] <bruenig> PuRu_, if you cannot find it there, you may try opening it with the command gksudo synaptic in the terminal
[11:34] <`Christine> gnomefreak: linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386
[11:34] <josh_> yeah i know... thats why i have been banging my head against a wall for the last 2 days
[11:34] <PuRu_> i'll try thanx
[11:34] <Agrajag> josh_: here's what my fstab line for ntfs looks like: /dev/hda1       /mnt/windows    ntfs    users,ro,umask=0222,nls=utf8,exec      0 0
[11:34] <lullabud> macaco:  you might try deleting /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases
[11:34] <josh_> so i finally broke down and had to come in here
[11:34] <gnomefreak> `Christine: uname -r says what?
[11:34] <maryann> I just installed build-essential
[11:34] <adie> epsilon_: ah, intel graphics are far faster than ati or nvidia in the open source world imo... quite scary when you copair it to the CSS world. but sod country restrictions, it's primarly distributed out of the UK so it's fine.
[11:34] <psusi> lk11mn: no... read the man page carefully... format is used there in the sense of which format is the metadata in?  sil?  via?  nvidia?  isw?
[11:34] <josh_> ill try umask0222
[11:34] <TGPO> `Christine, you get my last message?
[11:34] <psusi> lk11mn: it directs it to only scan for the specified format, not all
[11:34] <Agrajag> that umask=0222 part means everyone on the system is allowed to read or execute, but not write, every file
[11:34] <tarzeau> someone has an idea where ubuntu produces their cds? i would like to do likewise with http://livecd.gnustep.org/
[11:35] <PuRu_> Thanx, bruenig. Got it now :-)
[11:35] <bruenig> PuRu_, np
[11:35] <`Christine> gnomefreak: 2.6.17.10-generic
[11:35] <gnomefreak> `Christine: install the l-r-m for generic kernel
[11:35] <josh_> nope still dont work
[11:35] <bimberi> maryann: they're not installed by default:  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[11:35] <Agrajag> josh_: you changed it and re-mounted?
[11:35] <`Christine> gnomefreak: and uninstall the other one, even though that's the package it put in?
[11:35] <josh_> yep
[11:35] <epsilon_> adie: so you say, an integrated intel is almost as fast as a new ati (afaik ati drivers are not good yet, but nvidia is in a good state)?
[11:36] <gnomefreak> `Christine: no dont uninstall the other one
[11:36] <josh_> got it
[11:36] <Bluhd> epsilon_: do you think compiling an ALSA driver against my current kernel might do anything? everything seems to work OK but every time I try testing audio I get this message:
[11:36] <josh_> umask0000
[11:36] <TGPO> gnomefreak, 5 bucks its in the xorg.conf
[11:36] <Agrajag> what does "mount|grep hda1" say now?
[11:36] <Agrajag> josh_: what, no
[11:36] <gnomefreak> `Christine: you need the l-r-m package for the kernel you are running
[11:36] <clemyeats> hi, do you recommend automatix or easyubuntu ?
[11:36] <Bluhd> epsilon_: the error message is "Could not open resource for writing."
[11:36] <gnomefreak> TGPO: what does xorg.conf have to do with the right l-r-m package?
[11:36] <adie> epsilon_: no, I'm saying that ati and nvidia are slow in comparison.
[11:36] <Agrajag> umask for ntfs should be 0222, no writing allowed
[11:36] <LjL> clemyeats: i recommend reading the documentation. i also don't recommend automatix.
[11:36] <`Christine> gnomefreak:  so yes, swap the packages
[11:36] <bruenig> clemyeats, I recommend neither, but automatix has more stuff if you are looking to use one of the two
[11:36] <josh_> dr-xr-xr-x  1 root plugdev 16384 2006-11-04 20:14 hda1
[11:36] <josh_> there isn't any writing allow
[11:37] <josh_> allowed*
[11:37] <Agrajag> hm
[11:37] <Agrajag> ok
[11:37] <GaiaX11> How to avoid sudo asking me the passwd?
[11:37] <josh_> gaia, if you dont know... u still need the password
[11:37] <macaco> lullabud: kewl... I read it and found the old stuff... I deleted it and now checking if it is finding ip.... I'll keep you updated
[11:37] <TGPO> gnomefreak, thats the same error I was getting, all I had to do was manually point it to the nvidia driver instead of the nv driver
[11:37] <nolimitsoya> GaiaX11, that should never even be contemplated :)
[11:37] <epsilon_> Bluhd: ooh. try searching ubuntu wiki and google for that. it might be a common problem. OR maybe the soundcard device node cant be written - but why?... ask others i dont know :(
[11:37] <josh_> it only asks every 5 minutes so your ok
[11:37] <gnomefreak> TGPO: she needs the linux-restricted-modules package for it to work at all first
[11:38] <lk11mn> psusi: k, i seem to be having difficulty with this one,    sudo dmraid -f sil
[11:38] <lk11mn> ERROR: option missing/invalid option combination with -f
[11:38] <clemyeats> I usually follow the wiki for restricted formats and all... but I'm installing Linux for a friend and I only have the computer for tonight... if automatix or easyubuntu are "safe enough" I'd be glad to use them... can I trust them not to mess up things too much ?
[11:38] <maryann> bimberi, okay I installed them now where are they? (btw thanks)
[11:38] <epsilon_> adie: really? so OSS drivers are better than CSS? hmm..... really, you might be true :D
[11:38] <Bluhd> epsilon_: search for what? the error I'm getting?
[11:38] <mentok> GalaX11: the only way not to have sudo ask for the password is if you are running as root, which by default in ubuntu the root user is disabled to prevent security issues
[11:38] <`Christine> gnomefreak: I changed the packages and I still get this error
[11:38] <`Christine> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[11:38] <`Christine> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[11:38] <patrick_king> how di install GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[11:38] <epsilon_> Bluhd: yes, simply the exact error message. maybe put "alsa" before or after it.
[11:38] <mentok> GalaX11: also running as root normally is not reccomended
[11:39] <kmaynard> patrick_king, make is executable, then run it
[11:39] <mnepton> clemyeats: please do not ever use any of those scripts
[11:39] <josh_> mentok: no its not
[11:39] <LjL> patrick_king: PLF has a .deb package for Google Earth also
[11:39] <macaco> lullabud: now it says no dhcpoffers received
[11:39] <gnomefreak> `Christine: paste the lspci output along with the xorg.conf file to pastebin please
[11:39] <adie> epsilon_: no I'm saying that the oss ati and nvidia drivers are very very slow, and the oss intel drivers are sooo much faster that they can driver 3d acceleration quicker than ati on nvidia oss drivers... the css drivers show how slow they all are :(
[11:39] <kmaynard> chmod u+x GoogleEarthLinux.bin && ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[11:39] <bimberi> GaiaX11: if you read 'man sudoers' it will discuss the NOPASSWD option
[11:39] <GaiaX11> ls
[11:39] <patrick_king> lji: where do i get it
[11:39] <josh_> when using su u need the password
[11:39] <gnomefreak> `Christine: im willing to bet your BusID is not right
[11:39] <psusi> lk11mn: sorry... -fsil I thin i tis... no space
[11:39] <mnepton> clemyeats: when they work, they tend to be OK. if they break in the slightest they can render a machine unusable.
[11:39] <kmaynard> patrick_king,  chmod u+x GoogleEarthLinux.bin && ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[11:39] <josh_> you can change whether you need a password or not for sudo
[11:39] <`Christine> it more than likely isnt, gnomefreak
[11:39] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell patrick_king about plf
[11:39] <GaiaX11> bimberi: ok
[11:39] <`Christine> i'll test
[11:39] <clemyeats> mnepton: ok. I'll do things manually so. Thanks.
[11:40] <mentok> josh_: no to what? root all the time? or running as root being the only way to not have sudo prompt?
[11:40] <Bluhd> epsilon_: searching for ALSA on ubuntu.com gives only two results and neither of them are _any_ help
[11:40] <nolimitsoya> GaiaX11, be aware that such a thing is_extremely_dangerous! (and should never be done, ever.)
[11:40] <epsilon_> adie: i see just my english is not good. okay. i thought that nvidia drivers are OK. (anyway, ever in my life i will play "mainstream" games on windows and not linux)
[11:40] <mentok> because I know there are other ways to remove the sudo prompting for a password
[11:40] <crimsun> Bluhd: what do you need?
[11:40] <lullabud> macaco:  if you can, install arpwatch on another system on the network and verify that.
[11:40] <epsilon_> Bluhd: try google and the error message.
[11:40] <josh_> i you are normal user, in order to do any "system " change s you have to sudo, but you dont "need" the password is you change some settings
[11:41] <Bluhd> crimsun: I'm trying to get ALSA working on my computer again. Every time I try it I cannot get any audio playback
[11:41] <bimberi> maryann: sec...
[11:41] <lk11mn> psusi: nope not that either, the same error
[11:41] <josh_> is=if
[11:41] <GaiaX11> nolimitsoya: I will watch
[11:41] <`Christine> gnomefreak: the busid is right
[11:41] <mentok> GalaX11: why do you not want sudo to ask for a password?
[11:41] <`Christine> but it had PCI: in front of it
[11:41] <abo> Bluhd, I had alsa working all the time... it's broke since yesterday
[11:41] <`Christine> so i took that out
[11:41] <crimsun> Bluhd: please see https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/42718/comments/11 and provide all the requested information on pastebin
[11:41] <abo> Bluhd, what soundcard you have?
[11:41] <ToHellWithGA> every time i reset my PC the network interface has no DNS servers.  i am using a static local IP.  how can i fix this problem?
[11:41] <epsilon_> Bluhd: in google use double quotes ("....") for exact matches
[11:41] <psusi> lk11mn: you do dmraid -ay -fsil and it wants more parameters?
[11:42] <gnomefreak> `Christine: ummmmm you cant just go removing things
[11:42] <patrick_king> cheers all its now installed
[11:42] <kmaynard> patrick_king, w00t
[11:42] <dirtbag> Any of you view the webpage gamespot?
[11:42] <gnomefreak> `Christine: PCI should have been fine it reads apg also and express
[11:42] <epsilon_> Bluht: i already found pages related to your problem&alsa&ubuntu :S:S
[11:42] <maryann> can anyone tell me where the kernel header files got installed (I installed from apt-get already)
[11:42] <clemyeats> ok thanks guys
[11:42] <bimberi> maryann: usr/src/linux-headers-YOURKERNELVERSION  (where YOURKERNELVERSION needs to be replaced)
[11:42] <`Christine> but it was an AGP card
[11:42] <`Christine> not PCI
[11:42] <maryann> thanks bimberi
[11:42] <Bluhd> abo: I have an onboard chip... the model is an Ali M5455 (it could be Uli though because my mobo chipset is a Uli that is ALWAYS mistaken as Ali *shrug*)
[11:42] <gnomefreak> `Christine: read what i just said
[11:42] <crimsun> agp _is_ on the pci bus, `Christine.
[11:43] <`Christine> so i should put it back?
[11:43] <josh_> hey bimberi, long long time no talk
[11:43] <gnomefreak> yes
[11:43] <lk11mn> psusi: sry i misunderstood... ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo dmraid -ay -fsil
[11:43] <lk11mn> RAID set "sil_afagdecefebg1" already active
[11:43] <lk11mn> RAID set "sil_afagdecefebg2" already active
=== josh_ is now known as j2daosh
[11:43] <bimberi> hey josh_ :)
[11:43] <psusi> lk11mn: ok.... nevermind the -f then... instead go back to the -vvvv and explicitly name the sil array... so dmraid -ay sil_afagdecefebg
[11:43] <mentok> does anyone know if the 2.6.18 kernel has made it into the repositories yet?
[11:43] <`Christine> ok I did that
[11:43] <crimsun> mentok: into what repositories?
[11:43] <psusi> lk11mn: ohh, ok, there we go
[11:43] <mcphail> lk11mn: please stop pasting in here
[11:43] <mentok> ubuntu main
[11:43] <psusi> lk11mn: also with the -vvvv part though ;)
[11:43] <crimsun> Bluhd: please pastebin what I requested, thanks.
[11:43] <stefg> ToHellWithGA: I had the problem in breezy times, and remember having it it fixed by settings /etc/network/interfaces readonly :-0
[11:43] <mentok> i've seen it in debian
[11:43] <crimsun> mentok: "ubuntu main"?
[11:43] <TGPO> mentok, only take a little while to compile it yourself
[11:43] <psusi> lk11mn: and yea, plz use pastebin
[11:44] <lk11mn> mcphail: come on guy, its only like 2 or 3 lines
[11:44] <lk11mn> lol k k
[11:44] <mcphail> lk11mn: yes, and it wasn't the first time
[11:44] <crimsun> mentok: if you mean into 6.06.1 or 6.10, no, it won't. Both of those releases are frozen.
[11:44] <epsilon_> Bluht, adie: sorry its a bit late almost midnight now, i go. Good night, good luck :)
[11:44] <mentok> TGPO: true,
[11:44] <crimsun> mentok: and for 7.04 we're using 2.6.19
[11:44] <ToHellWithGA> interfaces stays, but /etc/resolve.conf clears.  should i set resolve.conf readonly, stefg ?
[11:44] <mentok> crimsun: ok
[11:44] <`Christine> why does this not work?!
[11:44] <mentok> crimsun: oh, cool
[11:44] <adie> epsilon_: ta, it was nice chatting
[11:44] <stefg> ToHellWithGA: yes, resolv.conf, of course
[11:45] <epsilon_> adie: maybe next time we meet bye :)
[11:45] <Elko> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Edubuntu_Dapper_EN.png - what's the source img name for that wallpaper?
[11:45] <mentok> crimsun: if I want to compile my own is there a howto for adding the additional ubuntu modules?
[11:45] <lk11mn> psusi: result!!! i see the 3 things i expected to see in setup.... but i'll do that other thing anyway
[11:45] <TGPO> `Christine, does xorg.conf say you have nv or nvidia driver loading?
[11:45] <adie> epsilon_: :)
[11:45] <psusi> lk11mn: great!  weird... it looks like dmraid only looks for partitions on the first array it finds
[11:45] <crimsun> mentok: not that I know of. We spent months adding those patches. Good luck.
[11:45] <`Christine> TGPO: says nv
[11:45] <mentok> crimsun: hehe, thanks!
[11:46] <gnomefreak> `Christine: change nv to nvidia
[11:46] <TGPO> `Christine, make it say nvidia and restart xserver
[11:46] <mentok> crimsun: guess I'll just have to wait :)
[11:46] <`Christine> ok
[11:46] <`Christine> one sec
[11:47] <`Christine> done, restarting
[11:47] <abo> is it normal that in alsamixer i have the "tone" set to "off"??? I dont' have any sound and can't seem to turn this thing on
[11:47] <Bluhd> crimsun: http://pastebin.com/818709
[11:48] <maryann> bimberi okay I found /usr/src/linux-header-2.6.15-27-amd64-generic but no linux/include dir
[11:48] <crimsun> abo: depending on the codec, yes.
[11:48] <Bluhd> crimsun: anything regarding USB or K88 is my MIDI Controller Keyboard and can be disregarded (probably)
[11:48] <Jural> anyone in here fimilar with gdesklets at all?
[11:48] <abo> crimsun, can you help me with my audio problem?
[11:48] <TGPO> gnomefreak, I think she rebooted the computer :/
[11:49] <crimsun> abo: if you're patient, sure. You're fifth in line.
[11:49] <lk11mn> psusi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30485/ there's the result for that... is there anything you want me to try just to confirm your theory?
[11:49] <gnomefreak> TGPO: most likely. the reason it went back to nv was i had her remove nad reinstall nvidia-glx :)
[11:49] <bimberi> maryann: do a 'dpkg -L linux-headers-$(uname -r) | grep include' and see if it gives you any clues.  Sorry, I haven't done myself so I'm guessing
[11:49] <gnomefreak> TGPO: this is goin gon 3 weeks with her
[11:49] <gnomefreak> going on
[11:49] <TGPO> gnomefreak, oy
[11:49] <maryann> okay bimberi worth a try but sudo updatedb then locate linux/include didn't get me anything.
[11:50] <plesnivec> hey people is it possible to set 2 different ip adressess for 1 ethernet interface?
[11:50] <gnomefreak> TGPO: she was trying to install beta drivers by the guide than had the installer build the l-r-m and back and forth
[11:50] <TGPO> gnomefreak, shell be a master at it by the time she dome
[11:50] <gnomefreak> lol
[11:50] <nemish> does anyone know how to display WMA header information?
[11:50] <nemish> mplayer shows "Clip Info" but its only Title and Artist
[11:50] <abo> crimsun, ok then ;) ... I'll ask the question, you answer when you get the time: I have edgy since 5 days or so, yesterday I lost the sound, I was messing around the last hour trying to fix it with no luck.. can you help
[11:50] <crimsun> Bluhd: by "I cannot get any audio playback" do you mean that the audio apps appear to play, but sound is inaudible, or do you mean that the audio apps emit errors?
[11:50] <nemish> and Copyright
[11:50] <nemish> I need Album and anything else that's in the header
[11:51] <maryann> thanks bimberi that worked.
[11:51] <crimsun> abo: read https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/42718/comments/11 and pastebin all the requested info.
[11:51] <kringell> plesnivec: yes, dont know how though :)
[11:51] <Bluhd> crimsun: this is exactly what happens... if I go into System->Preferences->Audio and change the audio playback device from Automatic to ALSA, Rhythmbox does not do anything when pressing the Play button
[11:51] <bimberi> maryann: phew.  I was out of ideas ;)
[11:51] <Bluhd> crimsun: I mean System->Preferences->Sound
[11:51] <gnomefreak> TGPO: she may come back as `jessica FYI
[11:51] <abo> crimsun, what's the paste bin address plz?
[11:51] <gnomefreak> brb smoke
[11:52] <crimsun> abo: see the topic
[11:52] <BHSPitLappy> !i810
[11:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i810 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:52] <crimsun> Bluhd: forget gui apps; use ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''
[11:52] <Bluhd> crimsun: ok
[11:52] <abo>  crimsun, sorry ... how can I see the topic?

[11:53] <gpa> im having a ton of trouble installing things and I cant edit anything in my system file
[11:53] <Bluhd> crimsun: http://pastebin.com/818714
[11:53] <gpa> file system *
[11:54] <bimberi> gpa: any particular error messages?
[11:54] <crimsun> Bluhd: do you have /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc* ?
[11:54] <gpa> dont have permissions
[11:54] <Bluhd> crimsun: uh, the /etc/ one doesn't exist but there's a ~/.asoundrc* I think
[11:54] <bimberi> gpa: what command are you using?
[11:55] <Neo_Angelo> hi guys and girls
[11:55] <crimsun> Bluhd: did you create them yourself, or did you dist-upgrade from 6.06.1?
[11:55] <Bluhd> crimsun: nvmd neither exist
[11:55] <tez> hi guys - can anyone help me out, I'm a newbie to ubuntu with a few probs
[11:55] <Neo_Angelo> me to
[11:55] <Bluhd> crimsun: I did a dist-upgrade from 6.06 LTS
[11:55] <gpa> right now im trying to install .bin and .tar.gz
[11:55] <gpa> things like java
[11:55] <TGPO> tez, whats up?
[11:55] <tez> firstly
[11:55] <gpa> it tells me to go into console and type something like cd /usr/java/
[11:55] <crimsun> Bluhd: asoundconf list
[11:56] <bimberi> gpa: java can be installed via Applications -> Add/Remove... (search for Java)
[11:56] <tez> I'm trying to copy all the old data from my second hard drive
[11:56] <tez> I can't seem to find it to copy the data tho?
[11:56] <crimsun> Bluhd: sorry, I have it already
[11:56] <Bluhd> crimsun: lol, I was about to post it too :P
[11:56] <crimsun> Bluhd: rm -f ~/.asoundrc* && asoundconf set-default-card M5455
[11:56] <Neo_Angelo> i was wondering if any of you nice people could give me a hand with something....
[11:56] <bimberi> gpa: it's better to use the package manager to install where possible - rather than dowloading .bin and .tar.gz
[11:56] <TGPO> tez you have to mount it
[11:56] <Bluhd> crimsun: now what?
[11:56] <crimsun> Bluhd: after that, test the aplay command again
[11:56] <tez> how do I do that?
[11:57] <Bluhd> crimsun: thank you very much!
[11:57] <Bluhd> crimsun: it works

[11:57] <abo> crimsun, still pasting :)
[11:57] <tez> backed up all my files on there and installed ubuntu on a different drive
[11:58] <Bluhd> crimsun: I'm guessing it's mainly from the dist-upgrade?
=== CreativeEmbassy is now known as Cre[a] tiveEmb[a] 
[11:58] <crimsun> Bluhd: I fixed it in Edgy; I'll make sure the future dist-upgrades work properly for it
[11:58] <bimberi> gpa: as per gnomefreak :)

[11:58] <mcphail> gpa: get to know the package manager. It is what makes ubuntu so special. Just about every program you need is in there.

[11:58] <TGPO> tez cat /etc/fstab
[11:59] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, hey, did you manage?

[11:59] <TGPO> tez pastebin it the sire listed in the channel topic
[11:59] <TGPO> site
[11:59] <bimberi> gpa: are you using 'sudo' with your commands?
[12:00] <bimberi> !sudo | gpa
[12:00] <ubotu> gpa: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[12:00] <rosabonita> logitech quickcam, is there a driver for ubuntu?
[12:00] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: ten more minutes, I'm on 56K :p
[12:00] <abo> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30486/   a lot of output there
[12:00] <crimsun> rosabonita: depending on your device, yes.
[12:00] <odin> Nativow: do you want to copy the entire directory or just a file?
[12:00] <Nativow> odin, the entire directory
[12:00] <mcphail> gpa: the system is set up to prevent you from breaking it by accident
[12:00] <gpa> oh
