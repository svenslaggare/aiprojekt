[12:01] <Trenty> Alright
[12:01] <jaa6c6> TheGateKeeper: ty
[12:01] <Trenty> NFTS
[12:01] <Bizzy> how would this channel try and convince me to convert to ubuntu from xp, where, i dont wanna loose VC++, live messenger, games in general
[12:01] <morgue> When a program running under Wine says copying file to C:\Program Files... Where does that go usually?
[12:01] <Trenty> NTFS
[12:01] <LjL> Trenty: yes, NTFS what?
[12:01] <kuonSama> meheren: to have your ip, you must either communicate with your router or ask a remote server to return it to you, a number of method exists to do so
[12:01] <jaa6c6> Out of curiosity has anyone here got a RAID5 system to work on ubuntu?
[12:01] <LjL> Bizzy, this channel is not here to convince you of anything. please take non-support issues to #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:01] <brynk> so... still noone here with an epson aculaser c1100?
[12:01] <Agrajag> Bizzy: honestly, I wouldn't. You want to use windows programs, you use windows
[12:01] <VanessaE> morgue:  ls -lad ~/.wine/dosdevices
[12:02] <tarelerulz> I use my ntsf a lot and I found that NTFS-3g works great for it. It write to it great and reads it fine
[12:02] <Phlosten> morgue: "/home/username/.wine/drive_C..."
[12:02] <VanessaE> wherever the c: link points, that's where it goes.
[12:02] <beagleisevil> Bizzy, seems you have made up your mind, windoze it is
[12:02] <TheGateKeeper> jaa6c6: good luck, I think what you have is a common problem, I don't think you are the first to ask, google picks up quite a bit
[12:02] <tarelerulz> The wine site tell of the program they have working
[12:02] <luisbg> can .deb be opened to see the source package or are they just to install?
[12:02] <VanessaE> (for me, I point it to my local HD instead of my $HOME, which is on NFS)
[12:02] <sethk> luisbg, some .debs have source, others don't
[12:02] <LjL> luisbg: a binary .deb doesn't contain any source. you can get source packages by typing "apt-get source <packagename>"
[12:03] <sethk> luisbg, usually there is a binary package and a source package for eadch thing
[12:03] <Trenty> Can anyone help me read my Windoze files from Ubuntu?
[12:03] <luisbg> I know but I got this deb in a webpage where they don't have a source package
[12:03] <jaa6c6> thegatekeeper: i've tried, been looking for answers for part of a week now, haven't found nething on google or ubuntuforums, also came here a couple days ago
[12:03] <ClayG> if you could have a new Dell notebook or a new HP notebook which would you choose?
[12:03] <jaa6c6> gonna try grub people next
[12:03] <aaron_> can anyone help with my DVD Audio / Video syncing problem?
[12:03] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell trenty about windowsdrives
[12:03] <cpk1> is there a way to use apt-cache search but for packages you have installed only?
[12:04] <VanessaE> cpk1: apt-cache search xxxxxxxx installed
[12:04] <drivera90> How much time does the installation of ubuntu from the live CD take, approximately?
[12:04] <VanessaE> seems to work for me anyway
[12:04] <cpk1> VanessaE: thanks
[12:04] <beagleisevil> ubotu, please tell cpk1 about apt-cache
[12:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about apt-cache - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:04] <tarelerulz> trenty just do sudo  mount /dev/hda1 and it should mount fine
[12:04] <kikokos> drivera on which comp?
[12:04] <LjL> cpk1: to do what?
[12:04] <morgue> I can't find it
[12:04] <kuonSama> Trenty: to read, mount /dev/hda1 /mnt to write: ntfsmount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[12:04] <kuonSama> Trenty: of course each one in sudo
[12:04] <kikokos> driva on PIII 600 about 50 minutes
[12:04] <morgue> Phlosten, any other suggestion?
[12:05] <drivera90> Uh, a P4/ht 2.8GHz with 512MB RAM DDR2.
[12:05] <arennia> Hey all, quick ubuntu-server question. Is there some way to run a debian-installer curses type config program post-install? D-I doesn't seem to be installed on the system anymore.
[12:05] <kuonSama> drivera90: I'd say 15minutes
[12:05] <kikokos> half to one hour?
[12:05] <tarelerulz> I did not put anything on mount and it read my ntfs partition fine
[12:05] <drivera90> Including partitioning 60GB of a hdd.
[12:05] <cpk1> LjL: to find packages I think might be misbehaving that i installed recently =)
[12:05] <drivera90> Alright, I guess I'll do it later.
[12:05] <ago> does anybody know how to run f-spot over remote X (ssh tunnel)? I get a dbus error.
[12:05] <kuonSama> drivera90: not counting user time
[12:05] <tarelerulz> I did sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows and it worked
[12:05] <sethk> tarelerulz, that's because the information it needs is in /etc/fstab
[12:05] <Phlosten> morgue: nothing in your .wine/ directory?
[12:05] <cpk1> LjL: but cant remember the exact name
[12:06] <beagleisevil> tarelerulz, mount /dev/hda1 -t ntfs /mnt/
[12:06] <tarelerulz> Oh cool
[12:06] <morgue> Phlosten, I can't find my wine directory
[12:06] <sethk> Trenty, you probably need at least the -t
[12:06] <stants> ppl sorry about the question
[12:06] <stants> but anyone knows a good server for .net visualbasic questions?
[12:06] <kuonSama> don't be sorry, it's a support channel
[12:06] <Phlosten> morgue: having the dot in front of the wine word means it is hidden. if you have wine installed it will be there
[12:07] <helvio> oi tem algum brasileiro ai?
[12:07] <kuonSama> stants: you mean an irc channel?
[12:07] <stants> and server
[12:07] <beagleisevil> helvio, no
[12:07] <cpk1> LjL: I am getting javascript errors that I didnt use to have before and think it is because of some packages I might have installed
[12:07] <sethk> helvio, there is a br channel
[12:07] <stants> this server is a little bit to open source stuff
[12:07] <Phlosten> morgue: can you open a terminal and do 'cd .wine', then 'ls'
[12:07] <wolfbane_691> does any 1 know how to switch between windows and linux with out rebooting
[12:08] <Bizzy> wolfbane_691: yes, have 2 computers
[12:08] <VanessaE> wolf: there's no easy way (besides 2 computers :) )
[12:08] <wolfbane_691> besides that
[12:08] <kuonSama> stants: I have no idea, but I suggest http://searchirc.com/
[12:08] <beagleisevil> stants, ? its a linux / oss channel
[12:08] <LjL> cpk1: apt-cache search <keywords> | grep "$(dpkg --get-selections | awk ' { print $1 } ')"
[12:08] <Bizzy> wolfbane_691: no
[12:08] <VanessaE> otherwise, usevmware
[12:08] <morgue> Phlosten, yeah
[12:08] <VanessaE> eh, vmware.
[12:08] <wolfbane_691> what about vmware
[12:08] <LjL> cpk1: try something on those lines
[12:08] <Bizzy> thats not switching between 2 hardware installs
[12:08] <beagleisevil> wolfbane_691, you can try Parallels too
[12:08] <Bizzy> you can use install one within the other
[12:08] <beagleisevil> virtual machines
[12:09] <LjL> !br | helvio
[12:09] <ubotu> helvio: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[12:09] <wolfbane_691> what does vm  ware do
[12:09] <tarelerulz> I read my fstab file and I says nothing about the windows partition . I looke /etc/fstab
[12:09] <kuonSama> wolfbane_691: it's allow you to run an os inside an other os
[12:09] <wolfbane_691> so will that do the trick
[12:09] <morgue> what's the command to delete a whole directory?
[12:09] <kuonSama> wolfbane_691: and there is a datacenter version which allows you to run multiple os's on top of a hardware communication layer
[12:10] <kuonSama> morgue: rm -fr thedir
[12:10] <Spawn> Can soneone help me.  How can I fix my OpenGL.. instead of saying ATI Technology it says Mesa Project?
[12:10] <beagleisevil> moreon, rmdir -rf
[12:10] <cpk1> LjL: nope, but the apt-cache search keyword installed seemed to work, unfortunately what I thought might be the culprit doesnt seem like it was =\
[12:10] <morgue> ty
[12:10] <LjL> beagleisevil, no
[12:10] <wolfbane_691> is any of this free
[12:10] <beagleisevil> LjL, ?
[12:10] <LjL> cpk1: hm? i haven't understood what worked
[12:10] <beagleisevil> moreon, rmdir -rf <directory name>
[12:10] <LjL> beagleisevil: "rmdir -rf" isn't a valid command
[12:11] <idan> is the wireless card should be eth1 ? btw i activated the driver using ndiswrapper but have no internet , or maybe disconnects straight after connecting to the nic
[12:11] <LjL> no, no. read the man page.
[12:11] <Phlosten> wolfbane_691: vmware server is now free
[12:11] <arennia> Anyone know of a way to run debian-installer after installation?
[12:11] <wolfbane_691> k thanx
[12:11] <idan> LjL hi man
[12:11] <cpk1> LjL: "apt-cache search keyword installed" searches installed packages
[12:11] <TehUni> how can i install ubuntu on a machine with more than 4gigs ram? I'd like to use edgy and not 64bit.
[12:11] <Phlosten> morgue: 'rm -rf direcotry'
[12:11] <LjL> cpk1: i didn't know that, thanks
[12:11] <tarelerulz> started ubuntu and gnome would not load and the kde  was having big problems like program just messing up on not doing anyting
[12:11] <beagleisevil> moreon, rm -rf <directory name> .....apologies
[12:11] <sethk> TehUni, same way you install it with less than 4 gigs
[12:12] <sethk> TehUni, you probably mean how do you tell it to use more than 4 gig, but that's after installation
[12:12] <kuonSama> beagleisevil: you are one minute late:P
[12:12] <rmd> is there a way to get synaptic to erase unused library packages?
[12:12] <LjL> moreon: and be careful when you use that command
[12:12] <TehUni> sethk: when 4 gigs, the installer freezes. when i pull a stick out, it loads fine.
[12:12] <sethk> TehUni, there is a kernel large memory option.
[12:12] <LjL> rmd: "apt-get autoremove", if you're on edgy
[12:12] <sethk> TehUni, that's odd.  use the text mode installer on the alternate cd, it works.
[12:12] <TehUni> sethk: ok. pretty self-explanatory?
[12:12] <c_lisp> how can I change the splash screen on ubuntu booting up from grub when the drivers and doing system checks?
[12:12] <rmd> LjL:I am, thanks.
[12:12] <tarelerulz> I see everytime gnome can't start my mouse does not work so I have to plug it back in . the mouse is usb
[12:12] <sethk> TehUni, yes, its all menus, not difficult
[12:13] <Phlosten> beagleisevil: directed that at wrong user
[12:13] <TehUni> ok cool, will give that a shot. thanks.
[12:13] <sethk> TehUni, doesn't try to run the X server, which usually helps in this type of situation
[12:13] <beagleisevil> Phlosten, paradise .... uh I must have delay
[12:13] <sethk> TehUni, otherwise, take out the stick, install, put the stick back in, and rebuild the kernel with large memory support
[12:13] <c_lisp> anybody?
[12:14] <Phlosten> c_lisp: you want to change it, or remove it?
[12:14] <beagleisevil> Phlosten, spash quiet in grub ?
[12:14] <beagleisevil> splash
[12:14] <demo45> problem  th0
[12:14] <Ropechoborra> Im using kubuntu... and when i try to launch easycam2 with ( lauchcam2 ) it says: Traceback (most recent call last):
[12:14] <Ropechoborra>   File "/usr/share/EasyCam2/easycam.py", line 25, in ?     import gnome.ui
[12:15] <beagleisevil> Ropechoborra, missing dependancy file gnome ui support package ?
[12:15] <Ropechoborra> beagleisevil im using kubuntu
[12:15] <kuonSama> that's funny to help people, I like it:)
[12:15] <Spawn> Can someone Help me with my ATI Driver?  I can't get it to load on the OpenGL.. It keeps using Mesa Project......
[12:16] <beagleisevil> Ropechoborra, its using a gnome package somehow ?
[12:16] <duckdown> Hey all.. I did a nmap scan of 1-65535 and I see some odd HIGH ports open!!!
[12:16] <duckdown> what can I do to find out what these are?
[12:16] <kuonSama> Spawn: mesa is an opengl implementation under linux
[12:16] <idan> is the wireless card should be eth1 ? btw i activated the driver using ndiswrapper but have no internet , or maybe disconnects straight after connecting to the nic
[12:16] <Ropechoborra> beagleisevil dont know... i just installed easycam2 for my webcam
[12:16] <sethk> duckdown, netstat -nap
[12:16] <kuonSama> Spawn: that's not a driver
[12:16] <sethk> duckdown, as root
[12:16] <c_lisp> change it phlosten
[12:16] <beagleisevil> Ropechoborra, find the developer and find out what dependancies it has
[12:17] <Spawn> KuonSama: I was reading the Help file on installing the ati drivers.. and on fglrxinfo its says mesa project
[12:17] <eseong> would like to ask , does linux support .rar ?
[12:17] <arennia> Anyone know of a way to run debian-installer after installation?
[12:17] <beagleisevil> eseong, yip
[12:17] <mabus> eseong: yes
[12:17] <kuonSama> eseong: yes
[12:17] <Spawn> KuonSama: Its supposed to say ATI Technology
[12:17] <Phlosten> eseong: yes, you need to install it
[12:17] <duckdown> sethk> Thanks!  One says xinetd on 55000, is that ok?
[12:17] <eseong> how do i install/work it ?
[12:17] <mabus> How can you install all updates from the command line, without gnome installed?
[12:17] <eseong> sorry im abit new on linux
[12:17] <Phlosten> eseong: look for rar in Synaptic
[12:17] <c_lisp> yea I was having trouble with ati on my friend pc
[12:17] <diesel> Where/how do I report a bug?
[12:17] <sethk> duckdown, might be.  do this:   grep 55000 /etc/xinetd.d/*
[12:17] <DanSchnell> I have a question:  I've just tried to install Ubuntu with Alternate CD theough OEM and when I got to the partition part, it said that I needed to use a minimum of 76.8 (66%) of my harddrive for partition.  Can I make it less than that (say 25GiB?)
[12:17] <c_lisp> says mesa to on his
[12:17] <duckdown> Python on 41227, and hpiod on 60720
[12:18] <spincycle> is there is newbie channel?
[12:18] <duckdown> what are all of these!
[12:18] <sethk> duckdown, you'll find what program xinetd launches if a connection occurs to that port
[12:18] <duckdown> im nervous\
[12:18] <ianmacgregor> spincycle: You're soaking in it :)
[12:18] <spincycle> ha ha
[12:18] <beagleisevil> spincycle, this is it! Welcome
[12:18] <sethk> duckdown, hpiod I think is an snmp daemon
[12:18] <spincycle> OK then, here's the question:
[12:18] <duckdown> sethk> that command gave no output, i didnt find anything
[12:18] <zorba64> dishwashingliquid!?
[12:18] <eseong> Phlosten, i don't have any rar inside my synaptic
[12:19] <sethk> duckdown, what did you mean about python and hpiod?
[12:19] <Phlosten> eseong: you need to have universe/multiverse enabled
[12:19] <Phlosten> eseong: one sec
[12:19] <duckdown> sethk> nmap -nap |grep 60720 says hpiod is running on it
[12:19] <eseong> Phlosten, okii
[12:19] <sethk> duckdown, oh, ok
[12:19] <duckdown> sethk> and netstat -nap |grep 41227 shows python
[12:19] <sethk> duckdown, I thought you were still talking about xinetd
[12:19] <duckdown> sethk> Yes, I can't find what is running from xinetd
[12:19] <sethk> duckdown, python is a language interpreter, so you need the full command line, not just python
[12:19] <duckdown> that grep command yielded nothing
[12:19] <spincycle> I use Open Office, but the Icon for Draw is not in the pulldown menu.  I can get to a Draw diagram by opening Writer, but I'd like to just open Draw.  I did find the Draw shell script which starts the program, but not the same as having the icon on my menu bar.
[12:20] <Spawn> But my Tv-out works.. I can see my desktop on the tv. BUt when I run a video it just comes out black screen
[12:20] <morgue> Samus_Aran, u left?
[12:20] <sethk> duckdown, yes, then it has symbols rather than numbers in the config files.
[12:20] <drivera90> Is there a place where I can download OpenOffice's equivalent of Microsoft Word, standalone, for WinXP?
[12:20] <morgue> yeah
[12:20] <morgue> hmm
[12:20] <sethk> duckdown, let me check where the symbol to number file is
[12:20] <duckdown> thanks
[12:20] <|thunder> Does anyone know if edgy has an updated version of ndiswrapper, as opposed to dapper?
[12:20] <duckdown> tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:41227         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     4402/python         is what 'netstat -nap |grep 41227' shows me
[12:20] <duckdown> is this a security risk?
[12:20] <chad> What is the location of the directory of C header files that match my running kernel?
[12:20] <zorba64> drivera90: nup...it's a job lot...you get the whole openoffice
[12:20] <duckdown> when i telnet to it, it says
[12:20] <crimsun> |thunder: yes.
[12:20] <beagleisevil> |thunder, I upgraded from dapper to edgy and had to reinstall ndiswrapper
[12:21] <duckdown> msg=messageerror
[12:21] <duckdown> result-code=5
[12:21] <beagleisevil> so yes
[12:21] <morgue> I'm trying to setup a game with wine, it has 2 cds, I mounted cd1 and the installation it's at 50% and asking me for disk 2, I mounted disk 2 but when I click OK it asks me again for it
[12:21] <harisund> duckdown: it's probably some HP printer driver running.
[12:21] <Ropechoborra> beagleisevil i dont know =( its the howto from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam
[12:21] <mabus> How can you install all updates from the command line, without gnome installed?
[12:21] <|thunder> crimsun; beagleisevil thanks. That ancient dapper version didnt support my card.
[12:21] <duckdown> I sure hope so
[12:21] <zorba64> mabus: yep...sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:21] <duckdown> I am nervous
[12:21] <DanSchnell> I have a question: I've just tried to install Ubuntu with Alternate CD theough OEM and when I got to the partition part, it said that I needed to use a minimum of 76.8 (66%) of my harddrive for partition. Can I make it less than that (say 25GiB?)
[12:21] <drivera90> Damn, I need to get a working equivalent of Word ASAP.
[12:21] <crimsun> |thunder: the proper package is ndiswrapper-utils-1.8
[12:22] <chad> What is the location of the directory of C header files that match my running kernel?
[12:22] <mabus> zorba64: won't that upgrade my system to edgy? :/
[12:22] <spincycle> drivera90 use Google Documents & Spreadsheets online
[12:22] <eseong> Phlosten, u there ?
[12:22] <arennia> Anyone know of a way to run debian-installer after installation?

[12:24] <DanSchnell> Savvas, It says I need a minimum of 76.8 GB partition
[12:24] <Phlosten> eseong: what version did you install?
[12:24] <beagleisevil> DanSchnell, you may have selected to install too many packages ? so it says you need that amount of space ?
[12:24] <shiv> will ubuntu read mac os x format disc?
[12:24] <zorba64> DanSchnell: maybe back out of oem install..not very flexible and do a normal install...or you may be sorry...?
[12:25] <morgue> I'm trying to setup a game with wine, it has 2 cds, I mounted cd1, run setup.exe and the installation got to 50% now it's asking me for disk 2, I mount disk 2 but when I click OK on the installation it promts me again for disk 2, what should I do?
[12:25] <arennia> Anyone know of a way to run debian-installer after installation?

[12:25] <admin123> mkCDrec makes a bootable (El Torito) disaster recovery image (CDrec.iso), including backups of the linux system to the same CD-ROM (or CD-RW) if space permits, or to a multi-volume CD-ROM set. Otherwise, the backups can be stored on another local disk, NFS disk or (remote) tape. HOWEVER mkcdrec doesn't work what options do I have left?
[12:25] <morgue> |thunder, I check the folder where I'm mounting it and the files are there

[12:26] <duckdown> geeez
[12:26] <eseong> Phlosten, its 5.0.1
[12:26] <eseong> :(
[12:26] <zorba64> DanSchnell: i would think so...oem sounds rather unintelligent going by your problem
[12:26] <morgue> |thunder, yeah I can
[12:26] <Phlosten> o_O
[12:27] <celebrant> hi all
[12:27] <eseong> Phlosten, can guide me pls ?
[12:27] <eseong> Phlosten, im abit newb :(, can't seem work on the unrar.
[12:27] <|thunder> morgue;  I meant can you browse to it from the installer. like, point the installer to the disc
[12:27] <Phlosten> eseong: follow that guide for enabling universe/multiverse and then look for and install rar by using Synaptic
[12:27] <bruenig> !hi | celebrant
[12:27] <ubotu> celebrant: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[12:28] <morgue> |thunder, no
[12:28] <chad> What is the location of the directory of C header files that match my running kernel?  vmware install keeps asking for it..
[12:28] <morgue> |thunder, it just prompts for disk 2 with OK and Cancel button
[12:28] <eseong> i just insert this url ?
[12:28] <eseong> http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/utils/rar
[12:28] <Phlosten> eseong: no, follow the guide with the first link
[12:28] <eseong> i followed
[12:28] <sgorilla80> what package group do you need for compiling kernel modules?
[12:28] <|thunder> morgue; try copying all the files from both discs to a single folder and installing. Just make sure they dont share file names
[12:29] <mepaYancho> anyone by any chance installed a cod2 server ?
[12:29] <sgorilla80> also in gaim it seems to try doing smooth transistions
[12:29] <Phlosten> eseong: then do a search in Synaptic for 'rar'
[12:29] <eseong> after i follow, i need to insert link..
[12:29] <sgorilla80> which really slows down my computer
[12:29] <morgue> |thunder, would the installation work if I burn the images? can I get wine to load an .exe from a cd?
[12:29] <sgorilla80> i did build-essential
[12:29] <Phlosten> eseong: that second link I gave you is just a listing of what packages you can find in the repositories. handy way of finding certain packages and what they are about
[12:29] <SEJeff> For those who haven't seen this ubuntu joke, its pretty good: http://xkcd.com/
[12:30] <beagleisevil> chad, /usr/src
[12:30] <SEJeff> No, that is not advertising spam!
[12:30] <sgorilla80> ok i took off smooth scrolling
[12:30] <sgorilla80> works better now
[12:30] <|thunder> morgue; surely. wine can run an exe from anywhere. just has issues when that exe's configs tell it to write files to read-only.
[12:30] <Phlosten> SEJeff: lol
[12:30] <beagleisevil> SEJeff, the pokemon joke
[12:30] <eseong> Phlosten, sorry.. forgot :(
[12:30] <SEJeff> :)
[12:30] <eseong> Phlosten, currently loading
[12:31] <sgorilla80> which package should you install for kernel source?
[12:31] <beagleisevil> SEJeff, I think alot of people felt like that after udpating to Edgy
[12:31] <Phlosten> eseong: i dont use rar, so cant help you much more than install it :)
[12:31] <SEJeff> beagleisevil: thats what happens when you install unsupported software and expect it to not break
[12:31] <chad> beagleisevil ive tried that among others
[12:32] <SEJeff> beagleisevil: You know that the latest beagle-dev uses WAY WAY less memory and has some pretty good optimizations, right?
[12:32] <eseong> Phlosten, aww okie
[12:32] <scamboy> good morning 2 peoples frm ASIA...heheheeh
[12:32] <|thunder> sgorilla80; try, 'apt-cache search kernel source'
[12:32] <beagleisevil> eseong, use the package unrar-free
[12:32] <ailean> beagleisevil, felt like what about edgy?
[12:33] <hellomoto2007> hello
[12:33] <eseong> beagleisevil, i download the rar >.<
[12:33] <zorba64> eseong: unrar e filename.rar to extract
[12:33] <sgorilla80> thunder:  thanks
[12:33] <beagleisevil> ailean, see the joke SEJeff posted
[12:33] <Maniqui> hi. I have finished a clean install Ubuntu 6.10.
[12:33] <eseong> zorba64, got error with that command
[12:33] <Maniqui> and I feel that it is running very slow!
[12:33] <beagleisevil> Maniqui, congrats!
[12:33] <zorba64> eseong: which was..?
[12:33] <hellomoto2007> im just about to try load ubuntu on my laptop- for the first time
[12:33] <hellomoto2007> wish me luck
[12:33] <ailean> beagleisevil, yeah i saw it, but u mean people weren't very excited by it?
[12:33] <chad> beagleisevil  is there a command that can locate the header files?
[12:33] <Maniqui> I feel 6.06 used to run faster
[12:33] <Maniqui> thanks beagleisevil
[12:33] <beagleisevil> ailean, most definitely
[12:34] <eseong> zorba64, i'll show u the error
[12:34] <scamboy> hello: yup god luck..
[12:34] <sethk> Maniqui, don't feel, measure.
[12:34] <SEJeff> Maniqui: it was a feel... gnome 2.16 is much faster
[12:34] <bruenig> Maniqui, I believe so also, but xubuntu certainly doesn't run slower
[12:34] <hellomoto2007> ok im going from windows xp to ubuntu
[12:34] <beagleisevil> Maniqui, you may want to check for beagle hogging the CPU
[12:34] <ailean> beagleisevil, yeah, but it was only a 4 month development cycle
[12:34] <eseong> zorba64, unrar: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[12:34] <beagleisevil> ailean, precisely
[12:34] <SEJeff> ailean: but gnome and the stuff it uses is still on a 6 month cycle
[12:34] <hellomoto2007> im hoping ubuntu will run better on my slow laptop?
[12:34] <zorba64> eseong: sudo apt-get install libstdc++6 maybe?
[12:34] <beagleisevil> hellomoto2007, stick with dapper then
[12:34] <ailean> beagleisevil, i've actually got some pretty serious bugs here and i don't have a clue how to fix them. OpenOffice won't load
[12:35] <hellomoto2007> why do people use ubuntu? -- is it better than windows?
[12:35] <nils_> hey... anyone here who knows a lot about theme settings (as in which files are used to store settings)
[12:35] <beagleisevil> ailean, hmmm thats not good
[12:35] <bluefox83> anyone know the perl regex for removing the spaces in filenames and replacing them with an underscore?
[12:35] <Maniqui> I have measured in time... It takes like 5 seconds to start things like "Preferences" -> "About me" or similar
[12:35] <eseong> zorba64, unable to unlock <- error
[12:35] <beagleisevil> hellomoto2007, they are communists
[12:35] <scamboy> hellomoto: dont make ubuntu a default os for you......
[12:35] <doccy> sorry im a real beginner at this - how do i run shares-admin as root?
[12:35] <zorba64> hellomoto2007: in a free sort of way
[12:35] <Elohimus> I was trying to install a newer version of glib and I tried to remove the older version through synaptic manager... well, it pretty much just killed gnome... anyway to get it back?
[12:35] <SEJeff> hellomoto2007: It is linux. Linux is infinitely more flexible than windows and as a result you can do really cool things with it.
[12:35] <ailean> beagleisevil, and i've been trying to get SOMEONE to answer me in the OOo channel and no one will...
[12:35] <hellomoto2007> scamboy
[12:35] <hellomoto2007> y not?
[12:35] <Maniqui> it tooked 10 seconds to run a simple thing like "gedit /etc/network/interfaces"
=== lore_ is now known as Berto
[12:35] <ailean> SEJeff, so another GNOME will be available for the release of feisty yeah?
[12:35] <beagleisevil> ailean, does it post errors
[12:35] <zorba64> eseong: search for it in synaptic which is locking the database
[12:35] <SEJeff> hellomoto2007: It runs from watches, to calculators, to military supercomputers
[12:36] <cello_rasp> bluefox83 s/\w/_/g   i think
[12:36] <ailean> beagleisevil, yeah:
[12:36] <ailean> [Java framework]  Error in function createUserSettingsDocument (elements.cxx).javaldx failed!
[12:36] <ailean> [Java framework]  Error in function createUserSettingsDocument (elements.cxx).InsertFromHorizontalBitmap - empty image!
[12:36] <hellomoto2007> o
[12:36] <scamboy> hellomot: learn ubuntu first..coz its still 50- 60% technical
[12:36] <eseong> zorba64, search wad inside synatic ?
[12:36] <SEJeff> ailean: Ubuntu's *main* selling features is that it is a great release of the latest gnome. Early on, thats what got powerusers like myself running it
[12:36] <bluefox83> celebrant, perl s/\w/_/g *mp3 ?
[12:36] <Maniqui> I certainly can remember that in 6.06 or even in 6.10 LiveCD things like "gedit /etc/network/interfaces" ran instantly
[12:36] <beagleisevil> ailean, you may have a JRE issue
[12:36] <zorba64> eseong: for libstdc++6
[12:36] <Elohimus> I was trying to install a newer version of glib and I tried to remove the older version through synaptic manager... well, it pretty much just killed gnome... anyway to get it back?
[12:36] <Maniqui> but here, everything takes a few seconds to open...
[12:36] <ailean> beagleisevil, what do you suggest I do?
[12:36] <DShepherd> what's a good app for desktop recording?
[12:36] <SEJeff> ailean: Also, the edgy --> feisty shuffle was so keep ubuntu inline with the gnome development cycle
[12:36] <ailean> SEJeff, I'm considering installing kubuntu instead...
[12:37] <sethk> Maniqui, run top, sounds like something is running and chewing up resources
[12:37] <DanSchnell> Is it possible to delete a ubuntu partition while your in windows?
[12:37] <hellomoto2007> how technical are we talking?
[12:37] <SEJeff> ailean: To each his own. Personally, I despise kde, but some people like it. Linux is linux is linux
[12:37] <sethk> DanSchnell, sure, any o/s can delete any partition
[12:37] <beagleisevil> ailean, pplse hold
[12:37] <ailean> SEJeff, what shuffle?  It's back to a normal 6 months between those is it not?
[12:37] <hellomoto2007> what are the advantages of ubuntu
[12:37] <doccy> sorry im a real beginner at this - how do i run shares-admin as root?
[12:37] <Maniqui> sethk, how can i messure?
[12:37] <sethk> DanSchnell, probably not a great idea, but certainly possible  :)
[12:37] <eseong> zorba64, when i use synaptic... he automatic install ?
[12:37] <ailean> cheers beagleisevil
[12:37] <sethk> Maniqui, top.  run it in a console.
[12:37] <SEJeff> doccy: put gksudo in front of it.
[12:37] <sethk> Maniqui, it lists processes, with the one taking the most cpu first
[12:37] <DanSchnell> sethk, and then I can resize my windows partition to make it take up the whole hd again?
[12:37] <doccy> SEJeff, it says cannot open display
[12:38] <SEJeff> Well just use sudo
[12:38] <doccy> says the same thing
[12:38] <ailean> I have to say that I've found Edgy much faster to initially load. I'm very impressed
[12:38] <Elohimus> I was trying to install a newer version of glib and I tried to remove the older version through synaptic manager... well, it pretty much just killed gnome... Most of the applications just got removed and the icons, and it's a mess. Anyway to get it all back?
[12:38] <sethk> DanSchnell, that's a windows question, I think partition magic can, but I'm not a windows expert by any means
[12:38] <doccy> how do i find out which display im on?
[12:38] <Maniqui> thanks sethk
[12:38] <beagleisevil> ailean, ok may be this
[12:38] <sgorilla80> which kernel source package should i install?
[12:38] <concept10> How do I enable hyper threading in the 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP kernel?
[12:38] <hellomoto2007> i wish i knew what the hell i was doing.... i wonder if i should keep XP
[12:38] <hellomoto2007> lol
[12:38] <eseong> zorba64,  thanks very much !
[12:39] <beagleisevil> ailean, you need to remove and recreate you openoffice2 preferences dir
[12:39] <Maniqui> it tooks five seconds to open a Terminal!
[12:39] <jordan_> Elohimus, Try, installing ubuntu-desktop
[12:39] <sgorilla80> all i want to do is just compile modules
[12:39] <Maniqui> I cant think what went wrong
[12:39] <beagleisevil> ailean, run this command at the commandline
[12:39] <sgorilla80> i dont need to patch against the kernel
[12:39] <DanSchnell> Sethk, i'm just really worried about installing ubuntu through alternateCD because I couldn't even get LiveCD to work because of my monitor/graphics card/gfx driver
[12:39] <beagleisevil> ailean, sudo rm -rf ~/.openoffice.org2/
[12:39] <ailean> hellomoto2007, do keep XP. research "dual-boot systems" while  you're learning
[12:39] <Maniqui> this is a clean install...
[12:39] <zorba64> eseong: s'ok...all works now?
[12:39] <Elohimus> jordan_: via the CD or using apt-get ?
[12:39] <hellomoto2007> okies
[12:39] <ailean> whoa, what am i removing there beagleisevil?
[12:39] <beagleisevil> ailean, be careful to run exactly that command
[12:39] <jordan_> Elohimus, either should work.
[12:39] <eseong> zorba64, how do i unrar something ? sorry
[12:39] <beagleisevil> ailean, you need to remove and recreate you openoffice2 preferences dir
[12:39] <osacix> hi
[12:39] <eseong> zorba64, when i type " unrar " it work now
[12:39] <ailean> k
[12:39] <hellomoto2007> well i wont losse any data on the laptop,,, its only just had a fresh install anyway
[12:40] <zorba64> eseong: unrar e filename.rar
[12:40] <osacix> i have problems with wifi card
[12:40] <sethk> DanSchnell, there is much more support for graphics hardware than can possibly be crammed into one installer
[12:40] <Maniqui> could there be a chance that something went "silently wrong" in an Ubuntu install?
[12:40] <SEJeff> hellomoto2007: what kind of laptop?
[12:40] <sethk> Maniqui, sure, there's always a chance
[12:40] <beagleisevil> ailean, then try opening openoffice again
[12:40] <Elohimus> jordan_: the dependencies look good, hopefully that'll do the trick.
=== foolswisdom is now known as fool|yoga
[12:40] <SEJeff> Maniqui: Did you install fresh, or update?
[12:40] <osacix> i make the instalation the packages for interplatation my inf windows driver
[12:40] <eseong> zorba64, thanks alot ..
[12:40] <sethk> DanSchnell, which hardware?  You just said by my short term retention isn't what it used to be  :)
[12:40] <osacix> with ndiswrapper
[12:40] <zorba64> eseong: np :)
[12:40] <doccy> grr, how do i find out which display im using?
[12:40] <Maniqui> SEJeff: a fresh installl
[12:40] <jordan_> Elohimus, My guress is that somehow apt decided to apt-get autoremove, and without the ubuntu-desktop meta-package that left a lot of "no longer needed" packages.
[12:40] <DanSchnell> Sethk, I'm also waiting for jordan to show up, he said he would help me with installing the nVidia drivers
[12:41] <ailean> beagleisevil, you're a genius
[12:41] <SEJeff> Maniqui: That is very odd. What kind of machine?
[12:41] <hellomoto2007> SEjeff--- old skool
[12:41] <osacix> ndiswrapper-tools and ndisgtk
[12:41] <eseong> another question here..
[12:41] <sethk> DanSchnell, ok.  I have three machines with nvidia, and they don't have any video problems at all.
[12:41] <sgorilla80> does ubuntu not have selinux by default?
[12:41] <DanSchnell> Sethk: my problem can be found here, with screen shots: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1701094#post1701094
[12:41] <Maniqui> I have a good computer: AMD Semprom 2600 / 512 RAM
[12:41] <beagleisevil> ailean, I wish, glad I could help
[12:41] <ailean> hellomoto2007, I've still got XP and I've been using Ubuntu for years
[12:41] <sethk> DanSchnell, doesn't prove anything, of course, but it's suggestive.
[12:41] <sethk> DanSchnell, ok
[12:41] <eseong> i must reinstall my ubuntu with a newer version ? or upgrade it ?
[12:41] <hellomoto2007> pentium III 128mb ram
[12:41] <osacix> after i make the configuration for ready my inf card
[12:41] <compengi> !nvidia > DanSchnell
[12:41] <hellomoto2007> yeh i mean i wanted to try something diffrent
[12:41] <beagleisevil> eseong, upgrade !
[12:41] <ailean> beagleisevil, have you come across that before? cos the official guys in OOo room didn't have a clue
[12:41] <compengi> !nvidia
[12:41] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:42] <sethk> DanSchnell, I told you how to fix that yesterday
[12:42] <eseong> when i open synaptic, it show some error
[12:42] <osacix> in finish when i make the modprobe ndiswrapper, the system say me invalid argument
[12:42] <osacix> why?
[12:42] <DanSchnell> sethk, did you really?
[12:42] <Maniqui> SEJeff, i will try restarting the system and see if anything changes
[12:42] <sethk> DanSchnell, yes
[12:42] <osacix> helppppppppp, because i try a 8 hours this, :(
[12:42] <osacix> buaaaa
[12:42] <Maniqui> if not, I will try a reinstallation
[12:42] <compengi> sethk, what's his problem?
[12:42] <hellomoto2007> it seams that everyone using ubuntu is a programer?!
[12:42] <sgorilla80> osacix: for what type of card?
[12:42] <ailean> hellomoto2007, i'm not
[12:42] <SEJeff> beagleisevil: Can I ask why you had ailean use sudo to remove ~/.openoffice.org2 ?
[12:42] <DanSchnell> Sethk, but don't I have to have ubuntu installed?
[12:42] <VanessaE> not me, I haven't programmed in years :)
[12:42] <hellomoto2007> is there any GUI on this thing?
[12:42] <sgorilla80> osacix: i just got a broadcom wifi working without using ndiswrapper
[12:42] <zorba64> hellomoto2007: not this little black duck
[12:42] <sethk> compengi, his default resolution has a higher vert freq than his monitor can handle.
[12:43] <jordan_> hellomoto2007, Yes.
[12:43] <VanessaE> last piece of code I touched was written in 6510 assembly :)
[12:43] <sgorilla80> using a cutter for firmware
[12:43] <sethk> DanSchnell, depends on what you want to do.
[12:43] <ailean> hellomoto2007, on what thing?
[12:43] <hellomoto2007> phew-- il be ok
[12:43] <osacix> sgorilla80: wifi card
[12:43] <hellomoto2007> as lng as theres a few prity pictures on it
[12:43] <hellomoto2007> lol
[12:43] <sgorilla80> osacix: what type of wifi card?
[12:43] <jordan_> ailean, I think he is talking about Ubuntu as a whole.
[12:43] <hellomoto2007> yes
[12:43] <hellomoto2007> :)
[12:43] <DanSchnell> Sethk, I just want to be able to SEE the ubuntu desktop.  i just get all that garbled trash

[12:44] <sethk> DanSchnell, yes, I know.  did you try doing control-alt-- (that's control-alt-minus)
[12:44] <ailean> hellomoto2007, careful to back up what u need
[12:44] <hellomoto2007> horay!
[12:44] <SEJeff> hellomoto2007: Take a look at this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[12:44] <hellomoto2007> i have  :)
[12:44] <ailean> hellomoto2007, well good luck ;)
[12:44] <ailean> see you soon
[12:44] <DanSchnell> sethk, is that like ctrl-alt-f1?
[12:44] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Are you the guy that was trying to install nvidea drivers from the liveCD yesterday?
[12:44] <SEJeff> hellomoto2007: It is also best to run 2 commands in windows *before* using ubuntu to resize your partitions. scandisk, and chkdisk /F C:
[12:44] <sgorilla80> osacix: what is the wifi card name of it?
[12:45] <sethk> DanSchnell, not really, except that both user control-alt   :)
[12:45] <sgorilla80> osacix: pastebin your lspci
[12:45] <hellomoto2007> ty SEjeff
[12:45] <sethk> DanSchnell, it will step through the available video resolutions.   use the minus sign on the keypad

[12:46] <nils_> I need help with gnome-theme-manager
[12:46] <beagleisevil> ailean, yeah a mate of mine had the issue
[12:46] <ailean> I'm installing Ubuntu on my girlfriend's computer and she is NOT a programmer at all.  They want it because they don't want to pay for Windows...
[12:46] <SEJeff> hellomoto2007: No problem man. You will really notice that the best thing about Ubuntu is the massive community.
[12:46] <sethk> ailean, for most things, it will be fine
[12:46] <jordan_> DanSchnell, I am the guy, sorry about the confusion on how to get me yesterday, I hadn't had much sleep ;)
[12:46] <beagleisevil> ailean, brilliant
[12:46] <sethk> ailean, you don't need to be a hacker to use the most popular stuff
[12:47] <doccy> how do i find out which display im using?
[12:47] <rambo3> tty
[12:47] <DanSchnell> Jordan_: no problem
[12:47] <sgorilla80> osacix:  download the windows driver on the Acer website (referenced "Acer IPN2220 Wireless LAN Card NDIS Miniport Driver 2.10.03.2004").

[12:47] <Maniqui> could that be possible? I just have GAIM and a terminal open...

[12:47] <sgorilla80> osacix: sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
[12:47] <osacix> i make this too
[12:48] <ailean> sethk, i think it is a great advert for ubuntu, but still it can cause problems
[12:48] <sethk> ailean, stay with a default installation.  don't add complications until there is some need.
[12:48] <rmd> for some reason, i can access the network for this hotel from windows.  however, i cannot access it when i boot ubuntu. this network is curious in that under windows i am taken to a login web page... under ubuntu i just can't do anything at all... anyone have an idea on what to do?
[12:48] <kronoman> Maniqui: disk cache usually uses ram, then it gets released when you need it for apps
[12:48] <beagleisevil> doccy, at the commandline type echo $DISPLAY
[12:48] <doccy> thanks
[12:48] <osacix> in this step dont have sucess
[12:48] <sethk> ailean, yes, it can, anything can.
[12:48] <sgorilla80> osacix: then add ndiswrapper to /etc/modules
[12:48] <compengi> is now edgy more stable?
[12:48] <rambo3> azureal, if there is make uninstall
[12:48] <sgorilla80> osacix: which setp?
[12:48] <sethk> ailean, so you play the odds and stay with the most tested configurations and apps
[12:48] <Maniqui> kronoman: thanks.
[12:48] <ailean> sethk, what about graphics card drivers etc?
[12:48] <doccy> beagleisevil, that just shows an empty line
[12:48] <rambo3> and most of them are configure make  make install
[12:48] <osacix> because
[12:48] <sgorilla80> i think i found a problem with ubuntu network configurator in edgy
[12:49] <Maniqui> okay, I will reboot and see if anything changes.... Ubuntu is running very slow :(
[12:49] <DanSchnell> jordan_, did you get my private message?
[12:49] <hellomoto2007> well -- lets give it a whirl-- i dont care if i trash this laptop-- im trying ubuntu out on it, coz i want a new desktop... with a diff OS
[12:49] <beagleisevil> doccy, should see :0.0
[12:49] <doccy> :/
[12:49] <plugwash> azureal there is nothing to stop you installing kernels manually, it just means you have to clean up manually too ;)
[12:49] <hellomoto2007> ooo -- looking good so far!
[12:49] <osacix> sgorilla80, when i make the modprobe ndiswrapper the system talk: invalid argumment
[12:49] <azureal> rambo3, so far i've done  make menuconfig (the configuring), and make... there does not seem to be an "uninstall"
[12:49] <plugwash> and configure the bootloader manually
[12:49] <jorgp> wow, if I had 1 dollar for every bug filed on edgy, wow I would be rich
[12:49] <sgorilla80> osacix: you need to install the info
[12:49] <sgorilla80> osacix: ndiswrapper -l
[12:50] <sgorilla80> tell me what comes up
[12:50] <hellomoto2007> oooo im well impressed im booting it from CD atm
[12:50] <beagleisevil> jorgp, :P
[12:50] <hellomoto2007> on the laptop
[12:50] <ephesius> after i changed my theme gnome stopped working and it will now not go past the login splash screen
[12:50] <azureal> plugwash, oh, so should i have used the make-kpkg method?
[12:50] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Yes, and I responded.

[12:50] <bruenig> !offtopic | hellomoto2007
[12:50] <ubotu> hellomoto2007: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[12:50] <hellomoto2007> yeh
[12:50] <tarelerulz> Good reason to have more then one . I have gnome , KDE and XFCe
[12:51] <hellomoto2007> i got the latest version-- it looks well good!
[12:51] <osacix> sgorilla80,
[12:51] <sgorilla80> what is the deveoplement version of ubuntu?
[12:51] <crimsun> sgorilla80: feisty.
[12:51] <jorgp> ubuntu+1 is not up yet
[12:51] <hellomoto2007> im not sure what the hells going on -- but im loving it!
[12:51] <plugwash> hmm #ubuntu+1 forwards here
[12:51] <rmd> hm
[12:51] <sgorilla80> osacix: ?
[12:52] <osacix> sgorilla80, you know what is this problem?
[12:52] <jorgp> feisty is getting the toolchain straight before package updates can begin
[12:52] <hellomoto2007> huh? offtopic?
[12:52] <sgorilla80> osacix: did your run ndiswrapper -l ?
[12:52] <ephesius> nils_: i have the same thing
[12:52] <sgorilla80> do that and paste the output, should be one line
[12:52] <hellomoto2007> ooo wrong channel-- sorry
[12:52] <ailean> hellomoto2007, officially, you are supposed to use this channel for problems only. don't worry
[12:52] <osacix> show me the driver instaled
[12:52] <ephesius> did you try to change the theme and now it wont get past login screen?
=== ProNoob is now known as ProN00b
[12:52] <jordan_> plugwash, That is because Edgy is released, but there is no Fiesty developement version yet, there currently is no Ubuntu+1.
[12:52] <jorgp> feisty is sporting a new glibc and new binutils
[12:52] <osacix> sgorilla80, neti2220
[12:53] <nils_> ephesius: exactly
[12:53] <sgorilla80> osacix: that is the only output?
[12:53] <shiv> firefox won't open windows media player links in mplayer. Any clues what do I need to do?
[12:53] <hellomoto2007> well im prob in the rite place-- il get a problem in a minute - i promise
[12:53] <osacix> sgorilla80: driver present, hardware present
[12:53] <sgorilla80> osacix: ok that is good
[12:53] <osacix> sgorilla80: its now...?
[12:53] <sgorilla80> osacix: is the firmware present?
[12:53] <bruenig> hellomoto2007, It is fine you know to talk a while but to just give impressions is a bit off topic. But yeah I would probably say to stay in here to make sure you have quick access to help
[12:53] <nils_> ephesius: you know of a work-around?
[12:53] <sgorilla80> osacix: check in /etc/ndiswrapper
[12:53] <azureal> plugwash, they recommend "make menuconfig", "make-kpkg clean" (not sure if i need this), "make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=custom1 kernel_image kernel_headers", and then afterwards install the headers and image .deb files w/ dkpg
[12:53] <osacix> ok
[12:53] <plugwash> jordan_ feisty has existed and been getting upgrades on a few key packages for several days now
[12:54] <sgorilla80> what is the source package for  2.6.17-10-server
[12:54] <jorgp> plugwash, only toolchain stuff
[12:54] <hellomoto2007> ty @ bruenig
[12:54] <DanSchnell> jordan_, I didn't seem to get it...
[12:54] <osacix> sgorilla80: have one directory with the name neti2220
[12:54] <rambo3> azureal, cant you copy oldconfig first
[12:54] <osacix> sgorilla80: i think this is ok... no?
[12:54] <sgorilla80> osacix: there needs to be some config files in there
[12:54] <plugwash> jorgp indeed[
[12:54] <azureal> rambo3, i'm trying to avoid my current config..
[12:54] <sgorilla80> osacix: there needs to be more stuff in /etc/ndiswrapper
[12:54] <ephesius> nils_: what exactly is happening with your computer?\
[12:54] <Maniqui> Definitily, there is something wrong with my Ubuntu installation
[12:54] <shiv> Is there a firefox 2 mplayer plugin?
[12:54] <rambo3> so you dont have to go thru all  y/n
[12:54] <osacix> sgorilla80: how i make this?
[12:55] <sgorilla80> osacix: like config files, inf, firmware
[12:55] <Maniqui> it tooked 20 seconds to open GAIM
[12:55] <azureal> rambo3, make menuconfig is not y/n
[12:55] <bruenig> shiv, sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer, assuming you have the extra repos enabled
[12:55] <Maniqui> other 10 seconds to open a Terminal
[12:55] <nils_> ephesius:my panels died when I was looking at icons in gnome-theme-manager (EdgyEft)...
[12:55] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Basically, you need to follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia but with a few slight deiiferences since you don't have any GUI currently.
[12:55] <nils_> ephesius: I Ctrl-Alt-Backspace and tried to log in again, but my computer freezes as the splash shows
[12:55] <shiv> bruenig: I have that installed but I guess it works only with firefox 1.5
[12:55] <jorgp> and another exploit was found today in firefox2
[12:55] <jordan_> * agrees with jorgp
[12:56] <Maniqui> and my first think about reinstalling: anything is going to change...
[12:56] <bruenig> shiv, it should work with both. I have firefox 2 and mozilla-mplayer going on it
[12:56] <beagleisevil> nils_, use ctrl-alt F1
[12:56] <osacix> sgorilla80: why?
[12:56] <beagleisevil> nils_, then restart gdm
[12:56] <nils_> ephesius:bug filed at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291635
[12:56] <Keigo-kun> Is it possible to burn the Live CD to a DVD insted and boot from it? Or are DVDs not bootable?
[12:56] <ephesius> i get an error unable to start gnome-settings-manager how do I fix this
[12:56] <hellomoto2007> :D :D :D
[12:56] <nils_> beagleisevil: how will that help my theme settings?
[12:56] <jorgp> Keigo-kun, I thought there was a live dvd
[12:57] <osacix> sgorilla80: i stay connected with other machine because the wifi conection dont stay allrigth
[12:57] <ailean> Keigo-kun, the image is for a CD - I think you'd need to create the DVD image yourself
[12:57] <Keigo-kun> oh man :(
[12:57] <ailean> Keigo-kun, are you on ubuntu now?
[12:57] <jorgp> ephesius, please be way more descriptive about your problem
[12:57] <jordan_> Keigo-kun, There are bootable DVD images however
[12:57] <bruenig> I just put the cd .iso on a dvd, it still works
[12:57] <Keigo-kun> ailean: no, i'm on OS X 10.4.8

[12:58] <ailean> listen to the other people who know about the DVD images :)
[12:58] <Keigo-kun> jordan_ where? i searched in the ubuntu wiki, couldn't find :(
[12:58] <bruenig> Keigo-kun, just burn the cd .iso to the dvd. That is what I do
[12:58] <Keigo-kun> bruenig, you sure that works? I heard somewhere that normal DVDs won't boot
[12:58] <jordan_> Keigo-kun, I am looking, the CD image might work on DVD though.
[12:58] <bruenig> Keigo-kun, worked for breezy, dapper, and edgy for me
[12:58] <Keigo-kun> I guess there's no harm in trying
[12:59] <DShepherd> what is a good desktop recording program?
[12:59] <jorgp> jordan_, I dont think it will
[12:59] <jorgp> I mean you can burn it, not sure if it would be bootable though

[01:00] <sun_> how do you swap caps and ctrl in console mode?
[01:00] <SBanks> When I lunch LiveCD Ubuntu 6.10, I cannot see my desktop. I see like "S\stripes"
[01:00] <osacix>  you swap caps and ctrl in console mode?
[01:00] <osacix> <ailean> listen to
[01:00] <SBanks> *"stripes
[01:00] <osacix> look, where you  you swap caps and ctrl in console mode?
[01:00] <osacix> <ailean> listen to
[01:00] <bruenig> SBanks, did you check the md5sum of the iso you downloaded?
[01:01] <nils_> no one knows where gnome-theme-manager stores its settings?
[01:01] <SBanks> no. I got it from www.ubuntu.com
[01:01] <osacix> sgolilla80: you stay in here?
[01:01] <SBanks> so I though that it's correct one

[01:02] <TimGrin> having some issues with apt-get
[01:02] <SBanks> Here is what happened...When I was running XP I had no problem loading previous version, but when I got to Vista...I started to get problems like this
[01:02] <SBanks> ok
[01:02] <SBanks> thanx
[01:02] <TimGrin> Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy-security/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  MD5Sum mismatch
[01:02] <TimGrin> anyone have any ideas?
[01:02] <VanessaE> wait a while and try again, tim
[01:03] <TimGrin> grr
[01:03] <rj45> hi
[01:03] <rj45> is any freenode staff in here?
[01:03] <VanessaE> you can also try removing the file from /var/cache/apt/archives and then re-fetch it
[01:03] <TimGrin> how about apt-get install wine in AMD64 - does this exist
[01:03] <progek> my ipod is mounted to /dev/sda1   how can I reformat the ipod? Can someone help?
[01:04] <VanessaE> dunno, but I understand wine + AMD64 = not good.
[01:04] <tony> Hello. is firewall installed on ubuntu by default ???
[01:04] <VanessaE> (for the same reason as win32codecs/xine doesn't work right)
[01:04] <TimGrin> what I actually want to do is install ie4linux
[01:04] <TimGrin> or is this not a hope in the preverbial
[01:04] <VanessaE> tony: I believe so, but you'll need to fetch the user tools - package name "iptables"
[01:04] <fluvvell> Ie4linux is easy
[01:04] <VanessaE> no clue, I don't routinely touch windows crap :)
[01:05] <tony> ohh. how can i disable firewall ??
[01:05] <SBanks> bruenig, even my older version of Ubuntu is not loading now since I upgraded my GF Card. When I had ATI I had no problem loading Live CD, but when I got this NVIDIA...I get this "stripes" problem thing. Any idea how to fix it?
[01:05] <osacix> help help
[01:05] <bruenig> Sbanks, not sure
[01:05] <TimGrin> fluvvell: but obviously not to amd64 as it requires wine and cabextract
[01:05] <VanessaE> tony: if you don't have the iptables package, the firewall is not "turned on" yet.
[01:05] <chad> i cant install vmware...it complains that it cant find my kernel headers... ive tried everything.. how can i troubleshoot this?
[01:05] <Keigo-kun> heh, i found a DVD image for Edgy
[01:05] <Keigo-kun> it's huge
[01:05] <VanessaE> (you "turn it on" by adding fitering rules, like block this IP or that port number, etc)
[01:05] <bruenig> tony, a sudo iptables --flush ought to do it
[01:05] <osacix> i need config my wifi, but after make all steps the system say for me: invalid argument
[01:05] <tony> im new to linux, how do i go about IPtables ??
[01:06] <bruenig> Keigo-kun, did the cd not work?
[01:06] <Keigo-kun> bruenig, i didn't try
[01:06] <johncc_> How can I find out if both the cores of my X2 are being used?
[01:06] <Keigo-kun> it seemed scetchy
[01:06] <fluvvell> you dont even have to sort out wine first, it is a script that does everything'
[01:06] <VanessaE> tony: sudo apt-get install iptables
[01:06] <bruenig> Keigo-kun, it works for me
[01:06] <jordan_> SBanks, try installing nvidea-glx , and untill then you can get basic graphics working with Vesa.
[01:06] <VanessaE> then go read this page:  http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howto/iptables-HOWTO.html
[01:07] <tony> it seems it was installed
[01:07] <VanessaE> (or google for "iptables howto" to find more information)
[01:07] <Keigo-kun> Thanks for the help anyway guys.
[01:07] <VanessaE> ok.  Have you ever used the program before?
[01:07] <tony> how do i disable firewall  :)
[01:07] <fluvvell> TimGrin: ah the old 64bit issue again
[01:07] <bruenig> tony, a sudo iptables --flush ought to do it
[01:07] <tony> it seem  firewall maks my appache work slow
[01:08] <bruenig> as that deletes all chains and such

[01:08] <pazemlsqdfmoj> hi, what exactly i the difference between a desktop user and an unpriviliged user? (when creating a new user)
[01:08] <bruenig>   --flush   -F [chain]           Delete all rules in  chain or all chains
[01:08] <pazemlsqdfmoj> is*
[01:08] <Maniqui> if nothing changes, I will try installing 6.06 again, to see if it runs better than 6.10
[01:08] <Chippy> hey, I have a few media keys on my keyboard and need to bind a symbol to them.  Can anyone tell me how/where to do this?

[01:09] <Maniqui> yes, I have a SATA HD
[01:09] <SBanks> jordan_, I am on my Vista right now. I cannot use Ubuntu :(

[01:09] <SBanks> I will come back...let me see if Basic thing can work
[01:10] <jorgp> nils_, have you tried to rename your .gnome dir to something else and log in as that user again
[01:10] <nils_> jorgp: no...
[01:10] <Maniqui> kuonSama, I will check that. I would bet it is in SATA. WinXP runs very smoothly (I have dual/boot)

[01:10] <danboid> Is it not possible to turn the hibernation password off on Ubuntu Edgy? It would be a shame coz it finally works!!!

[01:10] <jorgp> nils_, sure thing
[01:11] <Maniqui> jorgep: there is something with my fresh HDD installation that is making Ubuntu run slow...
[01:11] <kuonSama> nils_: you could also try in /var/tmp sometimes gnome store files there
[01:11] <kuonSama> Maniqui: are you sure it is your hd?
[01:11] <chad> i cant install vmware...it complains that it cant find my kernel headers... ive tried everything.. how can i troubleshoot this?
[01:12] <kuonSama> Maniqui: do a basic test, time mkfile 10m
[01:12] <johncc_> I just installed 6.10 and its as slow as hell
[01:12] <jorgp> Maniqui, slow is a relative term, got benchmarks?

[01:12] <Maniqui> no, there isnt any problem with my HDD. I mean, the Ubuntu installation that is sitting in my HDD
[01:12] <jordan_> danboid, I am pretty sure it can be turned off, though I have never tried.

[01:18] <Legendre> VanessaE - well, what I'm looking for *can't* be in /etc/
[01:18] <SBanks> jordan_, even if I select safe mode it will show me white-yellish colourd stripes. I am not sure what's going on. It must be the NVIDIA card cuz I never had a problem with ATI!
[01:18] <Legendre> VanessaE kind of a long story..
[01:18] <DanSchnell> I'm not running linux right now though...isn't gparted a linux program?
[01:18] <walter> test
[01:18] <bruenig> DanSchnell, yes it is
[01:18] <VanessaE> indeed it is...tried partition magic then?
[01:18] <kuonSama> DanSchnell: boot ubuntu live disk, and start linux from there
[01:18] <Legendre> Partition Tragic =/
[01:18] <bruenig> DanSchnell, you can get a gparted live cd. google it. Just boot to it and you can partition in the live cd
[01:18] <jordan_> SBanks, You really need to use the proprietary drivers with an nvidea card to get anything decent.
[01:19] <SEJeff> Legendre: per user sessions, or systemwide?
[01:19] <jorgp> Legendre, or .gnome2
[01:19] <DanSchnell> Kuonsama, I can't get boot the liveCD cause of graphics driver problems (nvidia)
[01:19] <Legendre> SEJeff - per user
[01:19] <jordan_> DanSchnell, If you want to use the gui installer I can get your graphics working very quickly, honestly
[01:19] <Legendre> as when you make a selection from the gdm options dialog
[01:19] <kuonSama> DanSchnell: I suggest you download knoppix and start it in failsafe
[01:20] <phI||Ip> I have an Intel 945gm and Ive got my resolution working, but glxgears reports that my driver doesnt support something... how do I enable 3d?
[01:20] <SBanks> jordan_, I would love to get new drivers installed, but I cannot see anything. I cannot see my mouse movement. I am on Windows right now.
[01:20] <DanSchnell> jordan_, ok, but I don't have another computer (at this moment) that I can talk to you on and install linux via gui
[01:20] <walter> salve qualcuno parla italiano ?
[01:20] <Legendre> Here's why I ask.. I migrated the main box at work from Slackware 10 -> xubuntu. We used Fluxbox on the old system. When ever a user logs in, they get a popup asking to confirm fluxbox-desktop as the default session
[01:20] <VanessaE> Dan: you can sign into here from the live CD also
[01:20] <pazemlsqdfmoj> can samba work with ACL?
[01:20] <Legendre> since there is no fluxbox, this is a bad thing.
[01:20] <VanessaE> (using Konversation)
[01:20] <bruenig> DanSchnell, the live cd has gaim, which you can use for IRC once you get into it
[01:21] <PuRu> does anyone know how to get my tv-out working? i find lots of completely different stuff about it :-S (a nvidia card)
[01:21] <jorgp> LOL, gotta love that bug descript 'list of known applications in run dialog reacts really weird'
[01:21] <Legendre> and I'm trying to find where the settng is kept, so I can use a script to just sweep it out of all the homedirs
[01:21] <VanessaE> wait..was it Konversation I used?
[01:21] <DanSchnell> everyone: I can't get the liveCD to worK! The desktop manager FAILS to load
[01:21] <johncc_> should xorg be using 6-8% CPU when the system is basically idle?
=== in_a_trance is now known as pppoe_dude
[01:21] <VanessaE> yeah, it was.
[01:21] <wastrel> !it | walter
[01:21] <ubotu> walter: Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[01:22] <Legendre> DanSchnell - the liveCD uses vesafb, afaik. Doesn't your card support VESA2 ?
=== r2d2_here__ is now known as r2d2_here
[01:22] <bruenig> johncc_, depends on your processor of course. Mine uses nowhere near that much, generally below 0 %
[01:22] <rag> please which program for look my internet connection? current transfers
[01:22] <VanessaE> rag: do what?
[01:22] <VanessaE> current file transfers  depends on what program you're using (opera?  firefox?  gaim?  xchat?...)
[01:22] <johncc_> bruenig: its a X2 4400+
[01:23] <jordan_> DanSchnell, When you boot the liveCD, choose safe graphics mode at the beginning.
[01:23] <DanSchnell> legendre, I've tried it, and it doesn't work. (It should.  I'm running 2 eVGA 6800GS CO cards in SLI)
[01:23] <rag> VanessaE: look for my connections, it's very slowly 1,32K/s
[01:23] <eimajenthat> hallo, just started trying to use Evolution, since it comes with Ubuntu.  I'm used to Thunderbird, so this is a little different.  I have an e-mail account I access using POP3 and webmail.  In Thunderbird, I select "Leave messages on server" and then under that there's an option that will delete the message on the server if I delete it in the client.  I don't see such an option in Evolution.  Is there one?
[01:23] <bruenig> johncc_, then no it shouldn't
[01:23] <Kernel> Hey there
[01:23] <Kernel> I need help please
[01:23] <rag> VanessaE: i need download something for tomorrow install for a children
[01:23] <jimmy_> with what kernal
[01:23] <johncc_> bruenig: I'm suspicious... if I drag a window, it takes like a second or so to repaint
[01:23] <Legendre> DanSchnell - hm, that is a bit odd.. I wonder if the SLI is causing issues for VESAFB
[01:23] <sethk> eimajenthat, usually you can only do that with IMAP.  Are you sure you did it using POP?
[01:23] <johncc_> Feels like I got no video acceleration
[01:23] <VanessaE> rag: eh, not really sure what would do that ...
[01:23] <DanSchnell> jordan_, I'll be back in 10 min or less.
[01:24] <eimajenthat> sethk: absolutely sure
[01:24] <chad> E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.   but if i run that, the install fails..and im back to start again.. what do i do?
[01:24] <Legendre> @all - am I right that the livecd (and ubuntu in general) uses the vesafb driver for X?
[01:24] <jimmy_> whats the best program to hook up on ubuntu
[01:24] <sethk> eimajenthat, ok.
[01:24] <wastrel> it's not uncommon for POP clients to do that
[01:24] <LjL> sethk, actually, most POP clients i've used do have that feature
[01:24] <wastrel> i dunno about evo, i don't use it for email
[01:24] <jordan_> Legendre, The liveCD tries to use real drivers and only VESA if you choose safe graphics mode at boot AFIK.
[01:24] <sethk> wastrel, ok.  I'll have to look at the protocol again :)
[01:25] <Legendre> jordan_ - ah, ok
[01:25] <Manderson> Hey all. I have a question. Ever since I downloaded the newest version of firefox, loading it seems to take forever and a day....much longer than any previous release. Any idea why this might be?
[01:25] <rag> VanessaE: i want look for connections with my internet?
[01:25] <sethk> wastrel, do you mean after looking at the header, or actually looking at the entire message?  I know you can download headers without deleting.
[01:25] <nthpro> ok.  I am having a problem with with my bcm43xx wireless card
[01:25] <rag> VanessaE: current connections

[01:26] <kuonSama> For those with mkfile = file not found, just use "dd if=/dev/zero of=thefile bs=1024 count=65536"
[01:26] <VanessaE> rag: from a terminal, "netstat: might tell you something
[01:26] <nthpro> I don't believe so
[01:26] <VanessaE> er, netstat
[01:26] <wastrel> sethk:  after downloading the whole message, leaving it on the server, the client can selectively delete it later if it's deleted in the client.
[01:26] <nthpro> what is the command to get the full specs of it in terminal?
[01:26] <kuonSama> had to leave for a sec
[01:26] <Legendre> jordan_  - I'm curious, because the graphics are a bit sluggish after I installed ubuntu.. I assumed this was due to VESA being used instead of native i810/i815
[01:27] <jordan_> nthpro, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1071920&mode=linear
[01:27] <wastrel> sethk:  you have to specify a DELE smtp command to remove messages from the server, simply downloading a message will not delete it from the pop server
[01:27] <VanessaE> rag: in that command, you're only interested in the IP addresses at the top of the output
[01:27] <rag> VanessaE: i need something like netstat -an but on gui
[01:27] <jordan_> Legendre, It may have used vesa because it didn't think other drivers would work ?
=== Shadow_mil2 is now known as Shadow_mil
[01:28] <VanessaE> no clue what GUi prog would do it.
[01:28] <Legendre> jordan_ - I'll have to take a look at it tomorrow, when I'm back at work. But that creates another question..
[01:28] <kuonSama> rag http://www.freshsoftware.com/xns/pro/
[01:28] <Legendre> jordan_ - do I just edit xorg.conf, or does ubuntu have some special magic for this?
[01:28] <kuonSama> rag: not free, only one decent I know
[01:29] <Kernel> I need help in general, I'm new to Ubuntu, and Linux in general
[01:29] <VanessaE> ok time to run...Jeopardy is on. :)
[01:29] <kuonSama> rag: but google a bit, you might find something OS
[01:29] <rag> kuonSama: thx but i need free
[01:29] <kuonSama> Kernel: you should ask a question
[01:29] <wastrel> Kernel:  general help with what specifically :] 
[01:29] <jordan_> Legendre, You can do either, you can run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and it will simply ask you what driver to use and at what resolutions.
[01:29] <Kernel> Well
[01:29] <Kernel> first of all, I can't set up my graphic card
[01:29] <rbil> rag: then go and write oen
[01:30] <rbil> *one
[01:30] <Kernel> it's intergrated, it's a Geforce 6150LE
[01:30] <jordan_> Legendre, I meant "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh"
[01:30] <Legendre> jordan_ - ok, I'd rather just edit xorg.conf
[01:30] <rag> rbil: with you?
=== rocky is now known as rocky|Zzz
[01:30] <rbil> rag: no, I don't mind cli based ones
[01:31] <Kernel> and I was wondering, what is them simplest way to install the driver for my graphic card
[01:31] <dcraven> rag, netstat is pretty nice. Check it out.
[01:31] <Yancho> how to read mail in my shell ?
[01:31] <Legendre> jordan_ - I'm a slackware guy, so I'm used to editing files. Just shy of doing something to break ubuntu.. it;s all so automagic, compared to old slack
[01:31] <pazemlsqdfmoj> dammit, why in gods name cant samba recognize my users??
[01:31] <wastrel> Yancho:  mutt is a good command line mail program   or mailx is a barebones mail reader
[01:31] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: did you configure smb passwords?
[01:32] <rbil> pazemlsqdfmoj:  have you created smb users for them?
[01:32] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: smb use a special repository for passwords , you must clone unix use to smb
[01:32] <pazemlsqdfmoj> rbil: how?
[01:32] <pazemlsqdfmoj> kuonSama: ah, where?
[01:32] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: or you can use pam with smb
[01:32] <pazemlsqdfmoj> pam?
[01:32] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: pluggable access module
[01:32] <pazemlsqdfmoj> is this adviseable? :)
[01:32] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: pam is what linux use to authenticate.
[01:32] <pazemlsqdfmoj> i want to share 1 folder wiv myf amily and make 1 accessible from my laptop
[01:32] <pazemlsqdfmoj> ah :|
[01:33] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: if you use pam, you must store the password in clear text
[01:33] <Legendre> Pluggable *Authentication Modules
[01:33] <wastrel> Legendre:  dpkg-reconfigure will automatically save a backup of your existing xorg.conf   but you can feel free to manually edit the file.
[01:33] <chad> omg... been trying for 3 hours now,,, but i cant find the header files for my running kernel
[01:33] <pazemlsqdfmoj> kuonSama: that doesnt seem like a good idea right? :P
[01:33] <rag> dcraven, i know it, but not is possible with a graphical program?
[01:33] <kuonSama> Legendre: yea you are right, I'm getting tired
[01:33] <pazemlsqdfmoj> kuonSama: so wots the other way again? ;)
[01:33] <kitche> kuonSama: umm linux doesn't use pam but ubuntu does
[01:33] <Kernel> Can someone join IM with me?
[01:33] <Legendre> kuonSama - aye. Just making it right, for the asker ;-)
[01:33] <dcraven> rag, netstat works in a graphical terminal.
[01:33] <sethk> chad, if you try for 5 minutes, and don't find them, the other 2 hours and 55 minutes are wasted
[01:33] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: you can simply sync the /etc/shadow based password with smb pass
[01:34] <sethk> chad, you mean you can't find the header file package name?
[01:34] <pazemlsqdfmoj> kuonSama: could u give me an example of a command? im not exactly pro :P
[01:34] <kuonSama> kitche: yea, I was making a bit a generalisation maybe
[01:34] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: mmh, I suggest you use a tool to do it, will be simpler
[01:34] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: you could give webmin a try
[01:34] <nthpro> rag: You know what the command is to learn exactly what card I have?
[01:34] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: www.webmin.com
[01:34] <sethk> kitche, any linux distro, and in fact any unix distro, can use pam

[01:34] <rag> nthpro: lspci
[01:34] <azureal> could compiling a new kernel possibly save my sound? =)
[01:35] <nthpro> thanks
[01:35] <Kernel> I still can't install the driver for my graphic card :-/
[01:35] <pazemlsqdfmoj> kuonSama: so i cant simply copy the file?
[01:35] <kitche> sethk: yes it can but linux is just a kernel, and a lot of the distros don't use pam unless the user tells it to
[01:35] <azureal> save as in 'make it come back
[01:35] <azureal> '
[01:35] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: no you can't
[01:35] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: smb use a different encryption
[01:35] <plugwash> Toma- not really, there is deborphan but that only finds libs
[01:35] <ekimus> hello, i'm trying do bootstrap edgy as a domU in xen but debootstrap breaks on creating devices "E: no /root/work/debootstrap-0.3.3.0ubuntu5/devices.tar.gz. cannot create devices" i downloaded the archive from: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/d/debootstrap/ is there any special place to get the ubuntu /dev part?
[01:35] <sethk> azureal, it might.  if the reason is that you don't have the proper kernel module, then yes.

[01:35] <azureal> sethk, what if "aplay -l" returns no soundcards
[01:36] <Legendre> Speaking of kernels, is the ubuntu kernel patched, or fairly vanilla?
[01:36] <sethk> ekimus, did you google for that?  there is a known bug with debootstrap that might be relevant.
[01:36] <pazemlsqdfmoj> rbil: ah, that seems easy :)
[01:36] <rag> nthpro: last week i configure a laptop with a broadcom card and i use ndiswrapper, do you know it?
[01:36] <plugwash> Toma- also do apt-get clean if you haven't already done so
[01:36] <nthpro> yes
[01:36] <sethk> azureal, you may merely need to load a module, rather than do a kernel build.
[01:36] <nthpro> rag: I've played with it
[01:36] <wastrel> Legendre:  patched up pretty good i believe tho i'm not super familiar with the kernel process
[01:36] <sethk> azureal, but probably you do need the build
[01:36] <sethk> azureal, what hardware?  which sound chipset?
[01:36] <rag> nthpro: use it
[01:36] <nthpro> Rag: It beat me up and took all my money =-(
[01:36] <Toma-> plugwash: yeh.. not enough!ive got a fairly minimal install thats taking up 5 gigs
[01:37] <plugwash> Toma- if you are really desperate and have time then start going through the output of dpkg -l trying to remove stuff you don't recognise and seeing what depends on it
[01:37] <nthpro> rag: aka I've had problems
[01:37] <Kernel> Hopeless:(
[01:37] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmoj: you could also use http://samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/SWAT.html

[01:37] <DanSchnell> jordan_, I'm back
[01:37] <plugwash> Toma- 5 gigs OUCH
[01:37] <Toma-> plugwash: so far, im in synaptic with the size list and removing junk that way
[01:37] <nthpro> rag: seems those are easier than the bcm4306's
[01:37] <dcraven> nthpro, you'll need version 1.8 of ndis in the repos for that chip. It will not work with the older versions.
[01:37] <azureal> sethk, ich6 family (intel).... basically i tried a method for getting multiple streams of sound, and lost oss, then i followed the comprehensive sound guide on ubuntu forums and lost it all
[01:37] <sethk> Toma-, you can fit a system into 2 gig.  there should be lots of stuff you can remove.
[01:37] <Toma-> plugwash: actually, make that 3.5gigs
[01:37] <plugwash> Toma- change to the root directory and run du -sh *
[01:38] <rag> nthpro, use ndisw
[01:38] <sethk> azureal, oss isn't really used any more.  alsa provides an oss compatibility layer

[01:38] <rag> dcraven, for look only internet current connections
[01:39] <kuonSama> rag: only internet?
[01:39] <Toma-> i see theres a specification for a cleanup-wizard on launchpad... lets hope that gets implimented soon
[01:39] <sethk> azureal, if you had sound, before, with this kernel, then a kernel rebuild won't get it back.
[01:39] <kuonSama> rag: netstat -f inet
[01:39] <jordan_> DanSchnell, You will be able to see if you boot into safe graphics mode
[01:39] <morgue> sethk, can I bypass this? umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
[01:39] <sethk> azureal, only if you've never had sound with this kernel, does that make sense
[01:39] <sethk> morgue, you have to umount before you can eject
[01:39] <sethk> morgue, you can easily do that, say:      umount /dev/hdc;eject /dev/hdc
[01:39] <Yancho> i am trying to edit crontab -e .. but i cannot save - anyone can help me pls ?
[01:39] <azureal> sethk, so...i need to...what .. reinstall?

[01:40] <rag> kuonSama: thx!!!!!
[01:40] <sethk> azureal, just reconfigure sound.  there's a command to do that, dpkg-reconfigure something

[01:40] <Toma-> plugwash: 440mb for /var sound right? i dont think so. Also, 2.4gig for /usr! :/
[01:40] <sethk> Toma-, /usr is typically big
[01:40] <kuonSama> rag: sorry, typing to fast
[01:40] <morgue> like umount /dev/hdc

[01:40] <Toma-> sethk: yeh i know.
[01:40] <Legendre> toma - I use 5G for /var, personally
[01:41] <morgue> sethk, I get umount: /dev/hdc0 is not mounted (according to mtab)
[01:41] <morgue> 
[01:41] <sethk> morgue, I didn't say hdc0, I said hdc.  of course, hdc is my cd, but it isn't necessarily yours'
[01:41] <sethk> morgue, if hdc is a cd, there is no hcd0
[01:41] <sethk> hdc0 that is
[01:41] <morgue> oops
[01:41] <sethk> morgue, you umount and eject a device, not a partition.
[01:41] <azureal> sethk, yea, dpkg-reconfigure alsa-source... i must've done it 5 times already... to no avail
[01:41] <rag> kuonSama: thx, but it is good, but my connections is 1,4 KB
[01:42] <sethk> azureal, hmm, that's odd.  the reconfigure finds the hardware?
[01:42] <kitche> morgue: make sure your not in the folder that your cdrom is mounted to also
[01:42] <azureal> sethk, if there was only some program that would autodetect my soundcard...
[01:42] <kuonSama> 500mb for /, 5gig for /usr 5 gig for /var 5 gig for /opt should do it (+swap of course)
[01:42] <rag> kuonSama: i don't know what is matter, and i have dowload edgy for a children , he gladed ubuntu...
[01:42] <sethk> kitche, morgue right, although he won't be able to umount if the mount is busy
[01:42] <sethk> azureal, there is, but you said it doesn't autodetect.  what sound hardware does lspci show?
[01:42] <morgue> sethk, kitche I'm trying to install a game with wine and setup is asking me for cd2 but I can't eject the cd
[01:43] <Toma-> kuonSama: i lumped everything onto a 5gig /, and 75gig /home
[01:43] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Then you will have to do it via command line, is there any way I can talk to you while you are using the LiveCD?
[01:43] <plugwash> Toma- btw if you are trying to trim don't be afraid to remove metapackages like ubuntu-desktop
[01:43] <Toma-> plugwash: oh, i know :D
[01:43] <LjL> Toma-: 5gig / is kind of small
[01:43] <|thunder> morgue; you cant eject it? right click it on the desktop and hit eject
[01:43] <sethk> morgue, oh, that's because wine has the drive locked up.
[01:43] <azureal> sethk, well during original install, it autodetected, and after tinkering, it pretends i don't have a soundcard
[01:43] <sethk> morgue, so you can't do anything with it at the o/s level.
[01:43] <kuonSama> Toma-: you can fo it that way, but it's a bit harder to check the root partition if something goes wrong
[01:43] <rag> kuonSama: is possible for a lot of people to download edgy version?
[01:43] <Toma-> LjL: in hindsight, id maake a 8gig /
[01:43] <DanSchnell> Jordan_, possibly, but it will take some time (Run between upstairs and downstairs)
[01:43] <sethk> azureal, and lspci?  shows what sound hardware?
[01:44] <kuonSama> Toma-: but 5gig is a bit not that much, if you install some stuff
[01:44] <morgue> |thunder, I get umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy trying to eject it from desktop
[01:44] <kuonSama> rag: what do you mean?
[01:44] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Ok, do you mind?
[01:44] <morgue> sethk, so what can I do?
[01:44] <azureal> sethk, oh, i mentioned it before, intel (ICH6 family)
[01:44] <sethk> morgue, the program that you are using on wine has to release the drive.
[01:44] <PuRu> does anyone know how to get my tv-out working? i find lots of completely different stuff about it :-S (a nvidia card)
[01:44] <DanSchnell> jordan_ not too much...let me go upstairs and boot the other computer (and install irc...)
[01:44] <sethk> morgue, you can kill the wine program, but of course that doesn't help.  :)
[01:44] <sethk> azureal, yes, sorry, you did say that and I forgot
[01:44] <Toma-> Ive removed all the printing system, raid, and floppy apps. need to trim more fat!
[01:44] <morgue> how can I kill it?
[01:44] <azureal> sethk, also more on that line is AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03), but i'm supposed to need hda-intel driver...and....blah
[01:45] <sethk> azureal, right, AC'97 is basically just a spec, not really specific hardware
[01:45] <rag> kuonSama: is possible than a lot of people , people download edgy and it is my slowly connection?
[01:45] <plugwash> Toma- which version of ubuntu is this?
[01:45] <Toma-> plugwash: edgy
[01:45] <sethk> azureal, it has to be a kernel module that needs to be loaded.  let me see if I can find the module name.

[01:45] <kuonSama> rag: I don't really get what you are trying to explain.
[01:45] <azureal> sethk, snd-hda-intel
[01:45] <kuonSama> Toma-: if you use only cli, you can have a working system for a couple of mb.
[01:46] <kuonSama> Toma-: no fat :)
[01:46] <rag> kuonSama: my edgy download is very slowly
[01:46] <wastrel> Toma-:  did you already clear out the apt cache?
[01:46] <Toma-> kuonSama: no thx. im testing e17 and running a tvcard and im really not keen on using frambuffer :D
[01:46] <kuonSama> rag: yes, I got that part.
[01:46] <ekimus> sethk:  do you think it's ok to take the devices.tar.gz from an equivalent version out of a deb file? I couldn't locate exactly that bug but I found a couple of hints that the devices are indeed missing
[01:46] <Toma-> yep
[01:46] <kuonSama> Toma-: hh:)
[01:46] <rag> kuonSama:  i think than it is because a lot of people download it now
[01:46] <plugwash> Toma- look in your xorg.conf to find out what video driver is in use then do apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-*- xserver-xorg-video-<your driver>
[01:46] <eseong> hello
[01:46] <eseong> i would like to ask..
[01:46] <rag> kuonSama: is possible?
[01:47] <eseong> what is this problem is about ?
[01:47] <kuonSama> rag: ha, no idea, I downloaded it in 10 minutes or so yesterday
[01:47] <Toma-> plugwash: its the nvidia one... should i be rid of all the optional extras?
[01:47] <eseong> ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libZThread-2.3.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[01:47] <dcraven> rag, you could try using the torrent. It might be faster.
[01:47] <morgue> sethk,  how can I kill it?
[01:47] <kuonSama> rag: or maybe it was this morning, but did you try a mirror?
[01:47] <rag> kuonSama: what is your speed?
[01:47] <sethk> ekimus, probably.  you can always remove the device again.  If no such device currently exists, it's safe to create it.  I would not delete, nor would I change the characteristics of, any existing /dev node
[01:47] <Yancho> i am trying to edit crontab -e .. but i cannot save - anyone can help me pls ?
[01:47] <kuonSama> rag: a lot, I'm connected with a fiber optic, because I work from a datacenter.
[01:47] <sethk> ekimus, almost all are the same in debian and ubuntu, but there are a few that might be different.
[01:48] <rag> kuonSama: :)
[01:48] <sethk> ekimus, back up your /dev directory using tar before you do it, then you can always revert
[01:48] <kuonSama> rag: physicaly, 240gb/s, but logicaly I'd say 100mb with the US
[01:48] <sethk> ekimus, probably back up /etc and /lib/modules also, to be safe (or paranoid)
[01:48] <eseong> i would like to ask..
[01:48] <DanSchnell_> Jordan_ Ok, I'm on my other computer right now
[01:48] <eseong> what is this problem is about ?
[01:48] <azureal> sethk, i'm pretty sure it's hopeless...

[01:48] <kuonSama> Yancho: I suggest you change the editor
[01:48] <jordan_> Danshnell: Ok, boot the liveCD and when it is done booting ( when you see garbled graphics ) press alt+F2 it should take you to a purely text console that you should be able to see
[01:48] <rag> kuonSama: ok bye , thx for your help
[01:48] <DanSchnell_> ok
[01:48] <sethk> azureal, no, not hopeless.  If you boot the live cd, does the sound work?
[01:48] <Yancho> kuonSama how to do so? im at root
[01:49] <peacho> Hi. I'm running Ubuntu Edgy in VirtualPC 2004 and it looks absolutely horrible. The graphics are really bad. Do you have any ideas on how to fix it.
[01:49] <azureal> sethk, no
[01:49] <sethk> azureal, if so, you can list the currently installed modules
[01:49] <DanSchnell_> jordan_ brb (gimme 5min
[01:49] <peacho> I can sort of read the text.
[01:49] <rag> dcraven, ok thanks , how to use azareus, i newbie on torrent
[01:49] <sethk> azureal, did you try other live CDs?
[01:49] <ekimus> sethk:  problem is i have to work with a gentoo host so i can't just copy the devices. and atm I don't have access to neither debian nor ubuntu boxes. well the worst thing that can happen is that the virtual machine won't boot....
[01:49] <Toma-> kuonSama: cant wait for the day that a hdd can take 240gig/s
[01:49] <kuonSama> export EDITOR=vi
[01:49] <azureal> sethk, i tried a gentoo cd last night and got a failing of alsa
[01:49] <kuonSama> export EDITOR=emacs ...
[01:49] <azureal> on bootup
[01:49] <kuonSama> anything you want
[01:49] <rag> dcraven: how to use azareus
[01:49] <sethk> azureal, intel sound is not uncommon.  but I had to fix another ich driver in the kernel a few weeks ago
[01:49] <kronoman> 10 gb should be enough to have a full blown ubuntu ? I mean, all the desktop, plus java sdk, c and c++ sdk, openoffice and some other shit
[01:49] <kuonSama> Toma-: lol, yea, but I have 1200 rack unit full of servers connected to it
[01:49] <sethk> ekimus, tar up the /dev, and you can always boot a live cd and revert
[01:49] <dcraven> rag, it's in the repos I think.
[01:50] <kuonSama> kronoman: yea I think it is.

[01:50] <dcraven> rag, then you're golden.
[01:50] <rag> dcraven, tomorrow you explain me? torrent use
[01:50] <eseong> anyone here free to help me ?
[01:51] <xen> ok...something's driving me up a wall: how do I get rid of my fat32 and ntfs partitions on the desktop?  I need to keep the partitions, I just want to remove the icons.
[01:51] <rag> dcraven: time to sleep :)
[01:51] <azureal> sethk, but i think i've taken it too far, if even aplay -l shows nothing
[01:51] <dcraven> rag, good night.
[01:51] <kronoman> and a program to show the disk usage per directory ? like a graph were I can see what dirs are taking more space and such ?
[01:51] <kuonSama> wastrel: yea but this will be system wide
[01:51] <rag> dcraven: my gentoo and ubuntu machines not start for me tomorrow jajjajaa
[01:51] <kuonSama> kronoman: du
[01:51] <sethk> azureal, no, that's not correct thinking.  aplay -l won't show it if the kernel module isn't loaded
[01:51] <kronoman> I know du, I want a graphical tool
[01:51] <kronoman> like a pie chart, or something
[01:51] <sethk> azureal, it doesn't prove anything.  it doesn't even suggest anything.
[01:51] <kuonSama> kronoman: and rddtools, with a script
[01:51] <pudland> how can i recover my forgotten password?
[01:51] <sethk> kronoman, there are several
[01:51] <rag> dcraven: i need sleep here 2 am and i cant think a bit more...
[01:51] <azureal> sethk, i know, lsmod | snd doesnt even show snd_pcm
[01:51] <sethk> pudland, you can't, but you can change it
[01:52] <sethk> pudland, as root, do     passwd username
[01:52] <bw__> I just upgraded to edgy, and when I rebooted, X doesn't start.  It gives me the error message "Failed to start the X server (your geographical interface)."
[01:52] <morgue> sethk, do you think there's something I can do to eject and get to insert disk 2?
[01:52] <rag> dcraven: please tomorrow you explain me torrent use
=== DanSchnell_ is now known as DanSchnell
[01:52] <sethk> pudland, as root, you don't need t know the old password, and you can change anyone's
[01:52] <sethk> morgue, I'm thinking.
[01:52] <LjL> sethk, well, "you can't" is probably excessive though ;)
[01:52] <kronoman> kuonSama: wow, RRDtool is great, will be useful for other projects that I have, thanks
[01:52] <pudland> sethk: do i need to use the "rescue" mode?
[01:52] <foureight84> has anyone been able to update their filterset.g for adblock firefox extension?
[01:53] <rag> dcraven, kuonSama: bye good night , bye frindes

[01:53] <LjL> pudland: if you don't have any user who's an admin, yes
[01:53] <kuonSama> pudland: you can't log in into your system anymore?
[01:53] <kuonSama> rag: night
[01:53] <sethk> LjL, no, it's not.  you _can't_ recover a lost password, because the hash is not reversible

[01:53] <sethk> LjL, that doesn't reverse password hashes, that just does an attack on your own machine  :)
[01:53] <peacho> anyone?
[01:53] <sethk> azureal, no
[01:53] <mzli> I met a problem that setup Ubuntu from harddisk, I use Ubuntu 6.06 alternate, help!!!
[01:53] <morgue> kitche, I can give it a shot I guess
[01:53] <LjL> sethk: and recovers passwords.
[01:53] <azureal> sethk, just image?
[01:54] <kuonSama> LjL if the password hash are configured for sha2, good luck:P
[01:54] <sethk> LjL, no, guessing a password isn't recovering it.
[01:54] <sethk> mzli, more specific question, please
[01:54] <LjL> kuonSama: what does the kind of hash have to do with it?
[01:54] <pudland> kuonsama: i changed it and now its not working
[01:54] <kuonSama> pudland: so you can't log into the machine anymore?

[01:55] <karl> what's the trick with getting flash to work in ff2.0 and edgy?
[01:55] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Is it?
[01:55] <LjL> sethk, alright then, it outputs a set of strings among which there is your password
[01:55] <kuonSama> bw__: read the log file
[01:55] <DanSchnell> jordan_, yes
[01:55] <karl> I apt-get dist-upgraded from dapper, and now every flash site kills firefox.
[01:55] <sethk> LjL, doesn't reverse the hash is what I meant to say.
[01:55] <azureal> sethk, ok, i'm going to go into a new kernel... i think i've messed up /lib/modules on this one lol
[01:55] <pudland> kuonsama: right
[01:55] <jordan_> DanSchnell: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:55] <jordan_> Which should open a text editor that will have a line like "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy-security restricted" with a # at the beginning of the line, delete that # sign then exit ( ctrl+x ) and save changes
[01:55] <kitche> bw__: can you paste the error should be in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[01:55] <bazz> sethk: no, pecl, php stuff
[01:55] <leofender_> game for download from console repositors.. ? ?

[01:55] <sethk> LjL, and it won't find my passwords.  :)
[01:55] <sethk> bazz, ok.
[01:55] <LjL> sethk: care to give me your /etc/shadow? :P
[01:56] <kuonSama> pudland: so boot on the live cd, and mount your hd, and open the /yourhdmountpoint/etc/shadow file
[01:56] <sethk> LjL, sure, I'll give you one from an unimportant machine.
[01:56] <kuonSama> pudland: and put an encrypted password in it
[01:56] <DanSchnell> jordan_ do you want me to do that and then come back? or can you give me a few steps?
[01:56] <sethk> LjL, but then, how do you know I won't lie about what the password really is?  :)
[01:56] <tgelter> hey guys, is it possible to have an wallpaper under gnome that is an image with hyperlinks built into it?
[01:56] <n00mz> called a webpage?
[01:56] <grndslm> karl, you've installed flashplugin-nonfree, right??
[01:57] <sethk> tgelter, that's the default behavior
[01:57] <mzli> and my cd-driver has some problem, it's too slow and problematic.
[01:57] <jordan_> DanSchnell, After that, run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[01:57] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Forget what I just said :)
[01:57] <DanSchnell> jordan_ ok...
[01:57] <nomasteryoda|w> tgelter, try gdesklets
[01:57] <tgelter> sethk: what I want to do is create an image that contains multiple pieces that can be clicked...like a desk that you click on the pen to load oOo writer
[01:57] <tgelter> that make sense?
[01:57] <LjL> sethk: i wouldn't. seriously, we're just arguing semantics - something like john gives you a set of strings among which there is your original password. it can't tell you *which* of the strings is the password, and it may certainly have to run for a long time. and no, it doesn't reverse the hash function directly, for sure. whether that can be called "recovering passwords", i'll leave to you or to a dictionary to decide
[01:58] <jordan_> DanSchnell, After that, run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[01:58] <bw__> kitche: what am I looking for in the log file?
[01:58] <kitche> bw__: errors but i would start doing a search for erros dealing with EE
[01:58] <DanSchnell> jordan_, thats 2 separate commands? ( 3 all together?)
[01:58] <karl> grndslm: yes, I have flashplugin-nonfree, and I know that uninstalling it makes firefox not crash.
[01:58] <karl> it also however makes firefox nonfunctional.
[01:59] <sethk> LjL, the effective hashes don't have that behavior.  that is, there is only one password that creates a hash, not a set of passwords.
[01:59] <eseong> can anyone pls tell me
[01:59] <eseong> how do i log in to my root account ?
[01:59] <LjL> sethk: hm, sure?
[01:59] <eseong> my folder need root privileges !
[01:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell eseong about root
[01:59] <grndslm> karl, try adding this line to the end of /usr/bin/firefox:  export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1
[01:59] <sethk> LjL, if some other password produces the same hash, that's not terribly good security.
[01:59] <kuonSama> LjL: of course, that's the definition of secure hash
[01:59] <jordan_> DanSchnell, If you enter exactly "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx" on one line, it will run the two commands one after the other
[02:00] <kuonSama> LjL: a secure hash must be 1 clear = 1 hash and unable to reverse the hash to the clear text
[02:00] <pudland> kuonsama: booting into rescue now
[02:00] <kuonSama> pudland: do you know how to crypt your pass?
[02:00] <karl> grndslm: does this actually work for some people? what is wrong with my system that I need an xlib param?

[02:01] <LjL> kuonSama, sethk: ok, i'll take your word on that. though you'll grant me that while that'll be valid for passwords, it won't be valid in general for an MD5 or SHA2 or whatever hash of an arbitrary-length text...
[02:01] <eseong> how do go to my folder.......
[02:01] <eseong> damn
[02:01] <kerwonz> what's the group for be admin?
[02:02] <grndslm> karl, flash doesn't make firefox crash on my computer...i read before i even upgraded to edgy that the xlib line fixed the crashing...so i did it automatically, and don't even know if that's the solution...but it couldn't hurt for you to try it
[02:02] <jrib> kerwonz: admin
[02:02] <eseong> :((((
[02:02] <kerwonz> jrib: only admin?

[02:02] <DanSchnell> jordan_ I'm in sources.list.  Can I type that command anywhere?
[02:02] <jrib> kerwonz: yes, assuming you have not changed the default /etc/sudoers, being in the "admin" group will give you sudo privileges
[02:02] <morphish> tgelter: http://insenvim.sourceforge.net/
[02:02] <bw__> kitche: the only errors with EE that I see are related to touchpads.
[02:03] <grndslm> karl, also...you might want to try downloading the flashblock extension for firefox....if you've got a buncha tabs open with flash movies, or ads, or whatever...it stops all of them until you grant each one permission to play with the click of a button

[02:03] <Frogduster> is it ok to upgrade to edgy now?  I heard there were some nasty problems with that..
[02:03] <jordan_> DanSchnell, The line should already be there ( I think ) just commented out with a # in front of it
[02:03] <eseong> jrib : i want create an folder inside there.
[02:03] <karl> grndslm: well, the xlib line works.
[02:03] <jrib> eseong: where is "there"?
[02:03] <dcraven> eseong, if you need a root shell, you can do sudo -s
[02:03] <tgelter> morphish: thanks. can vim w/ intellisense be used alongside eclipse?

[02:04] <Frogduster> leofender, I think it automatically (or wizard-like) goes through that process with you.
[02:04] <kerwonz> jrib, i'm trying to install new packages
[02:04] <tgelter> morphish: thanks for the info
[02:04] <jrib> kerwonz: which package?
[02:05] <defbyte> hi, is ubuntu hard to install first time ? (if i have allready installed debian/fedora/suse) ?
[02:05] <Frogduster> leofender, not all exe's work with wine.
[02:05] <kerwonz> jrib, personal packages
[02:05] <azureal> kerwonz, are you trying to give a user privileges to sudo all commands w/o password?
[02:05] <pazemlsqdfmo1> how can i turn off auto-grouping of tabs in the bottom panel? i hate it enormously :|
[02:05] <_Dante_> hey
[02:05] <grndslm> karl, overall, i'm happy with the improvements in edgy...seems like all the packages i need are up to date and pretty damn stable...and i definitely enjoy shaving 25~30 sec off every boot
[02:05] <Frogduster> defbyte, no, it's mad simple.
[02:05] <jrib> kerwonz: ok, how are you trying to install them?
[02:05] <kuonSama> defbyte: no it's very simple to install
[02:05] <defbyte> also no problems with nvidia driver ?
[02:05] <dcraven> defbyte, I doubt you'll have trouble.
[02:05] <leofender_> not all ??
[02:05] <bw__> kitche: it gives me this ncurses error screen that displays the message and asks if I want to view the X server output, but the screen exits and I see a login on top of it.  it's strange.
[02:05] <leofender_> so whats exe. ?
[02:05] <kerwonz> sudo dpkg -i lala.deb
[02:05] <kuonSama> defbyte: I had no trouble at all

[02:05] <kerwonz> admin:x:112:kerwonz
[02:05] <morphish> defbyte: it is dead simple, only thing i hit on edgy installer from gui cd, is it wouldn't want to install on a / that was a logical partition, the text alternate CD did it fine though
[02:05] <Frogduster> leofender, You know how windows programs end in ".exe"?
[02:06] <kitche> bw__: yeah you should pastebin your log
[02:06] <Frogduster> like, I play cards sometimes..
[02:06] <karl> grndslm: I wish it had been so nice for me.
[02:06] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Sorry again, I gave you the wrong line ( I am kind of flying blind here and that line won't hurt anything but it won't get you the drivers either )
[02:06] <leofender_> how ? im new on that. tell me
[02:06] <defbyte> i also want to use it for c/opengl programming and web devel stuff (like perl javascript)
[02:06] <DanSchnell> jordan_, those are now typed in on sources.list

[02:06] <DanSchnell> jordan_, oh...k...
[02:06] <grndslm> karl, i prolly would have stuck with dapper, but i wanted mythtv 0.20...and it was in the edgy repository for, so it was a no-brainer....and i've definitely never dist-upgraded and prolly never will

[02:06] <Frogduster> ah.

[02:07] <grndslm> karl...you should just keep /home on a separate partition so that you can reinstall / from scratch with your /home still in tact

[02:07] <karl> Toma-: 1537 for me.

[02:10] <jordan_> DanSchnell, That line should be "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy main restricted" I am very sorry for making you run down again.
[02:10] <Frogduster> leofender, mzli can't see you there.
[02:10] <grndslm> karl, if you want default desktop settings...you can just delete all your the ".*" (or hidden) files in your /home dir
[02:10] <rbil> Rblong2us: Bill Gates's software is too busy sendind spam and picking up malware to flicker :-)
[02:10] <grndslm> i do that as well
[02:10] <DanSchnell> jordan_, for clarification, which line?
[02:10] <karl> yeah, but then what's the point of having /home on a different partition :)
[02:10] <karl> you have to manually delete all sorts of things :)
[02:11] <Frogduster> leofender, mzli: Ok, when you download a file, it will generally be a .exe or a .zip (if it's for windows).
[02:11] <jordan_> DanSchnell, The one you need to add.
[02:11] <Roger_The_Bum> karl: for pony-related purposes
[02:11] <karl> when "my settings" are in a different place to "default settings" I'd be a lot happier
[02:11] <grndslm> so i don't need to move my songs, movies, documents, etc....the only thing in the .* files that i want to save are my firefox bookmarks and extensions, so i keep .mozilla, but remove the rest
[02:11] <DanSchnell> jordan_, The sudo apt-get update line was never there actually.  I added that line and never deleted any original ones...(lemme go check make sure it there)
[02:11] <_Dante_> ok -- I got another question.  Rhythmbox's ipod support, on edgy, does not seem to delete off my ipod.  is this just not working yet or am I being an idiot
[02:11] <Rblong2us> rbil: c'mons seriulsy now, what's this horrible flickering?
[02:11] <LjL> Rblong2us: low refresh rate?
[02:12] <rbil> Rblong2us: probably
[02:12] <Rblong2us> LjL: it's a 60
[02:12] <Frogduster> leofender, mzli: ..if it's a zip file, unzip it (you should be able to right-click and unzip).  You may want to put it in its own temporary directory.
[02:12] <Rblong2us> and this an LCD screen
[02:12] <Rblong2us> what kinda resolutions should I put this?
[02:12] <LjL> Rblong2us: then it's not the refresh rate.

[02:24] <kuonSama> sudo -i is sudo su - but I might be wrong
[02:24] <LjL> muffinresearch: no. but the two options concerned are "quiet" and "splash" - they're both kernel parameters
[02:24] <muffinresearch> Ok LjL thanks. One other thing, anyone found a solution to the screwed up progress bars in the default Human theme?
[02:24] <LjL> kuonSama: it effectively does the same thing, basically, but by using "sudo su" you're chaining *two* commands that can do the same thing. it'd be a bit like typing "cat blah.txt | cat | grep blah". works, but it's awkward
[02:25] <LjL> muffinresearch: dunno, use KDE
[02:25] <jordan_> DanSchnell, This is just the liveCD so just delete everything in that file and replace it with the line ( this is a new one, not one I have given you before ) "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy-updates main restricted"
[02:25] <morgue> sethk, so do you think there's a way to unmount the cdrom?
[02:25] <muffinresearch> This is the bug: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubuntulooks/+bug/67443
[02:25] <Baycipx> buenas
[02:25] <muffinresearch> Just wondered if there's a workaround, other than to use the legacy human controls.
[02:25] <kuonSama> LjL: I mean sudo -i is "sudo su -" not "sudo su"
[02:26] <sethk> morgue, if you have lsof installed, run it, and see what processes have an open file descriptor on the cd
[02:26] <jvai> saad thing i discovered, i'm sitting above an apple store in a mall, w/ tcpdump opened, & their backend is a win server
[02:26] <LjL> kuonSama: true, but the argument stands
[02:26] <kuonSama> LjL: yea I know
[02:26] <sethk> jvai, blackmail them, tell them you'll tell the world if they don't give you a free laptop
[02:26] <azureal> sethk, so as i was saying before, i'm very happy my sound is back
[02:26] <jvai> lmao..
[02:27] <DanSchnell> jordan_, so delete everything? (Do i need # in front?)
[02:27] <sethk> azureal, good.  I was out with the dog, didn't see it.
[02:27] <azureal> I was going _crazy_ lol
[02:27] <sethk> azureal, what did you do?
[02:27] <ape> can someone give me a hand installing ntfsprogs beta driver?
[02:27] <azureal> sethk, oh, that custom kernel i was compiling ended up working
[02:27] <jordan_> DanSchnell, I will pastebin exactly what the file should look like.
[02:27] <crazdiam> this dual monitor thing is neat but
[02:27] <azureal> sethk, earlier when i aptitude installed some kernel it would not work
[02:27] <crazdiam> i cant find a good use for it
[02:27] <morgue> sethk, beyond a million lines rofl, any way I can make it a shorter list?
[02:28] <overridex> crazdiam: playing wow on one while watching a dvd on the other ;)
[02:28] <sethk> azureal, good
[02:28] <crazdiam> i feel important though
[02:28] <coastermaster> what's the best way to install handbrake on 6.10?  i'm finding a lot of conflicting info
[02:28] <crazdiam> yeah good point
[02:28] <doccy> is it possible to install kismet using apt?
[02:28] <sethk> morgue, sure, grep for cdrom, and also for the actual device name
[02:28] <crazdiam> movies
[02:28] <sethk> morgue, as in,    lsof | grep cdrom
[02:28] <rbil> crazdiam: having a desktop twice as wide is reason enuf for me to use dual monitor
[02:28] <azureal> sethk, i guess it would reuse my old (broken) config... and then i tried compiling that kernel from source and didnt realize it would not make because it was kernel-headers rofl
[02:29] <jvai> this is what i dont like about the new dapper bootup, i didnt get a warning of the "root file sytem has been mounted 30 tymes, will now check" thing.. on hoary i knew bforehand
[02:29] <overridex> crazdiam: gimp's another great dual monitor app...
[02:29] <sethk> azureal, ok, well, now you won't make that mistake again.  :)
[02:29] <mzli> Please gave me some links to teach install dapper alternate from hd. thanks
[02:29] <azureal> sethk, i had followed the comprehensive sound guide until everything broke... then i even installed xubuntu-desktop
[02:29] <flasher> when i create a new user account, is it possible to be concurrently logged on to both the new account and the present account ?
[02:29] <azureal> lol
[02:29] <jordan_> DanSchnell, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29945/
[02:29] <sethk> jvai, that's not distro specific or version specific.  you can change that using tune2fs
[02:29] <azureal> it was pretty fun
[02:29] <crazdiam> if my third vid card wasnt also agp i could have triple
[02:29] <sethk> jvai, you can set it to any number, or set it to 0 which means never force the check
[02:29] <DanSchnell> jordan_ ok...brb
[02:29] <jvai> tune2fs
[02:29] <azureal> but now i just uninstalled xubuntu-desktop.... just me and fluxbox, as it should be
[02:29] <|thunder> flasher; su 2nduser
[02:29] <overridex> flasher: multiple X servers or xnest
[02:29] <azureal> it's so....beautiful
[02:29] <morgue> sethk, I get bash      6214     morgue  cwd       DIR        3,0      2048      3904 /media/cdrom0 and wineserve 6382     morgue   37r      REG        3,0 666107212      3926 /media/cdrom0/compressed.zip
[02:29] <sethk> jvai, what's different is just that you see the message now, and before it didn't show up on the screen.
[02:29] <jvai> ooo! i never knew!
[02:30] <dxdt> doccy, Yes
[02:30] <azureal> lol, i really am close to tears rofl
[02:30] <flasher> overridex: huh?
[02:30] <dxdt> doccy, it is in the repos.  sudo apt-get install kismet
[02:30] <doccy> dxdt, it says the kismet package doesnt exist?
[02:30] <sethk> morgue, ah, you have it as the current directory of that bash instance
[02:30] <jvai> is tune2fs on here by default?
[02:30] <DanSchnell> jordan_ wait.. http://us.archive or just http://archive .... ?
[02:30] <flasher> |thunder: that is the solution?
[02:30] <sethk> morgue, somebody asked you earlier about it being the current directory of anything, I think
[02:30] <sethk> morgue, kill that bash process
[02:30] <morgue> sethk, how?
[02:30] <tehbrandon> !hijackthis
[02:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hijackthis - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:30] <tehbrandon> !bash
[02:30] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via applications -> accessories -> terminal (gnome) or kmenu -> system -> konsole (kde). Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[02:31] <sethk> morgue       kill 6214      if that doesn't do it, then          kill -9 6214
[02:31] <dxdt> doccy, you must not have all the right repos enabled.  Different ones carry different programs.  You probably need the world repos enabled
[02:31] <sethk> morgue, hopefully wine isn't running under that same shell
[02:31] <rBelong2us> hu
[02:31] <rBelong2us> hi
[02:31] <doccy> dxdt, how do i enable the world repos?
[02:31] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Shouldn't make a difference but go without the us.
[02:31] <doccy> dxdt, is it in the sources.list?
[02:31] <DanSchnell> k
[02:31] <rBelong2us> I still this horrible flickering issue
[02:31] <dxdt> doccy, yeah, not "world" but universe is what I meant
[02:31] <rBelong2us> it happened also with the latest 6.10
[02:31] <sethk> morgue, shouldn't be, the PIDs are not near each other.
[02:31] <doccy> dxdt, okie thanks
[02:31] <rBelong2us> I don't know what the version I've got now
[02:31] <dxdt> doccy, in fact, I think they are in there already, but commented out
[02:32] <sethk> rBelong2us, flickering as in 60hz flicker?
[02:32] <rBelong2us> some edgy stuff
[02:32] <morgue> ok -9 killed it
[02:32] <sethk> rBelong2us, try changing the vertical frequency.
[02:32] <morgue> sethk, -9 killed it, but I still can't eject
[02:32] <sethk> morgue, ok, now see if it ejects when you press the button on the drive
[02:32] <rBelong2us> sethk: yeah my screen is flickering horribly and I've tried different settings on this C
[02:32] <sethk> morgue, not with the program, because wine still has it open.
[02:32] <sethk> rBelong2us, you've tried vertical refresh >= 70hz?
[02:32] <crazdiam> does twinview have anything over xinerama ?
[02:32] <computera> hey does ubuntu have support for Extended Firmware Interface
[02:32] <morgue> sethk, i tried pressing the button
[02:32] <rBelong2us> sethk: let me see
[02:32] <morgue> sethk, nothing happens
[02:33] <DanSchnell> jordan_ ok, now what?
[02:33] <sethk> morgue, too bad.  if the wine server is the only program that has the drive locked, there isn't much you can do.
[02:33] <nuked_omen> i'm having trouble finding the download link of joomla demo cd for linux
[02:33] <sethk> morgue, I suspect that the program tried to eject, and didn't
[02:33] <nuked_omen> any help would be appreciated
[02:33] <sethk> morgue, try clicking on ok, saying you changed it.  hopefully it will say "wrong disk, dummy" and let you change it again.
[02:33] <morgue> sethk, I still get umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
[02:33] <frajagon> hola mundo
[02:33] <sethk> morgue, yes, I just explained that
[02:33] <rBelong2us> sethk: it's set to 40-70
[02:33] <computera> does anyone know if Extended Firmware Interface is supported in linux?
[02:34] <sethk> rBelong2us, that's a range, in your configuration.  you want the actual vertical frequency in use.
[02:34] <rBelong2us> sethk: horizontal is set to 31.5-55
[02:34] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Now run: "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx"
[02:34] <doccy> dxdt, that did it thanks :) sorry im absolute linux noob
[02:34] <flasher> |thunder: Unknown id: 2nduser
[02:34] <sethk> rBelong2us, what you need to do is dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    when you get to the monitor section, choose the "medium" difficulty level, and specify the resolution/freq that you want.
[02:34] <frajagon> hello my people
[02:34] <picasso> Is the window manager in ubuntu 6.10 changed, or just updated?
[02:34] <nuked_omen> i suggest pclinuxos for noobs
[02:34] <picasso> (gnome)
[02:34] <sethk> rBelong2us, you'll choose it from a list.  don't chose anything @60hz, only AxB@C where C >= 70
[02:35] <oranged> anyone having gpg issues?
[02:35] <frajagon> o yes
[02:35] <frajagon> I do nat
[02:35] <rBelong2us> sethk: ok thanks
[02:35] <|thunder> flasher; the name of the 2nd user
[02:35] <sethk> picasso, the default desktop is still gnome, if that's what you mean.
[02:35] <DanSchnell> jordan_ but I'm still in the sources.list
[02:35] <jvai> why when i put a usb flash in, the cd mounts also? there's a cd icon above the usb icon? i'm on dapper
[02:35] <morgue> sethk, I killed wineserv and I was able to eject it
[02:35] <morgue> brb
[02:35] <picasso> sethk: i just upgraded to 6.10. everything seems to work fine, but i've lost the ability to move windows between workspaces easily
[02:35] <variant> eh, have i just entered the twilight zone? http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/nov06/11-02MSNovellPR.mspx
[02:36] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Ok, press ctrl+x to exit, it will ask you if you want to save the file, say yes
[02:36] <picasso> sethk: before, i could click+drag on a title bar, and then press my key combination (ctrl+alt+1-6) to switch desktop
[02:36] <jrib> variant: wow, but for #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:36] <DanSchnell> ok
[02:36] <variant> jrib: yeah, sos
[02:36] <sethk> picasso, perhaps it overwrote your shortcuts, and now it's a different key combination.  check the shortcut definitions.
[02:36] <picasso> shortcuts still work. they just don't work while dragging a window
[02:36] <sethk> picasso, I didn't say it changed _all_ your shortcuts
[02:36] <flasher> |thunder: there's currently only one user on my comp
[02:37] <flasher> if i do what you say, can i be logged in to 2 accounts at the same time?
[02:37] <sethk> picasso, I said maybe it changed that particular one.  or there is a configuration parameter that changed that is blocking it.
[02:37] <picasso> ctrl+alt+1 works normally, but not when i'm holding a window
[02:37] <picasso> hrm
[02:37] <picasso> ok, would that be in gnome config stuffs?
[02:37] <rBelong2us> hi
[02:37] <sethk> picasso, yes, in the .gnome-whatever in your home directory.  I'm sure there isn't a code change that caused it, so it really has to be config.
[02:37] <rBelong2us> sethk: what was the package name again?
[02:38] <sethk> rBelong2us, for dpkg-reconfigure?   xserver-xorg
[02:38] <picasso> sethk, ok, i will take a look.
[02:38] <DanSchnell> jordan_ ok.  I did the command and my cdrom proceed to start whirring and something is happening probably but I don't see anything
[02:38] <Kenotic> Does anyone know if it is safe to run Compiz with twinview?
[02:39] <doccy> dxdt, now i cant find package tuxracer :(
[02:39] <variant> Kenotic: no, most of your family will die
[02:39] <Kenotic> LOL
[02:39] <jordan_> DanSchnell, No output at all?
[02:39] <Lars_G> I'll try here too
[02:39] <jvai> lol
[02:39] <rabbit1> where do you setup virtual desktop ?
[02:39] <DanSchnell> jordan_ not at this moment (Still displaying sources.list and my sudo commands)
[02:39] <Lars_G> My dvd has some broken files it seems (debs), is there any way I can make apt pull ONLY the broken or missing files from the repos and not all?
[02:40] <Lars_G> this is for a dist-upgrade with both online repos and a edgy DVD available (with some few damaged debs it seems)
[02:40] <jordan_> DanSchnell, OK, I thought you were out of your sources.list
[02:40] <muffinresearch> LjL: having tried those kernel parameters in /boot/grub/menu.lst it looks like the splash is not there for me. just having splash shows some start-up messages before the screen goes black and with neither quiet nor splash I get the full start-up messages.
[02:40] <nuked_omen> why do ubuntu updates break the system?
[02:40] <picasso> sethk: struggling to find the proper file. maybe it's in the defaults somewhere? ~/.gnome2 seems to be the only directory with recent changes
[02:41] <DanSchnell> jordan_ it had the command prompt at the bottom of the screen (ubuntu@ubuntu) with the sources.list on top
[02:41] <sun_> what package installs xorg on breezy?  i tried xserver-xorg but i didnt get startx
[02:42] <sethk> sun_, ubuntu-desktop installs X, gnome, etc.  there is also one for kde.
[02:42] <sethk> sun_, if you install the desktop, then all of X will get pulled in as dependency
[02:43] <oranged> anyone remember the name of that newish bittorrent client for gtk
[02:43] <Lars_G> still afaik xserver-xorg should be enough for startx, altough startx is just a symlink to Xorg afaik
[02:43] <sethk> sun_, if you don't want the desktop, you can install X packages.  I can check which package startx lives in.
[02:43] <sun_> sethk im trying to avoid gnome/kde, i need a minimal x with ion3 for this compu so i just need to know where startx is?  how to check packages for startx?
[02:43] <sethk> Lars_G, depends on the config, sometimes it has a few lines of script in it.
[02:43] <Lars_G> Nod, thanks sethk
[02:43] <sethk> sun_, I'll check, hold on
[02:43] <Lars_G> sethk: Do you have an answer to my predicament sir?
[02:43] <jordan_> DanSchnell, What happens when you type: echo "test" and hit return?
[02:44] <nuked_omen> azureus is tha best
[02:44] <DanSchnell> jordan_ lemme check
[02:44] <oranged> nuked_omen, ah nm, its called deluge
[02:44] <sethk> Lars_G, let me scroll up and read ...
[02:44] <Lars_G> nuked_omen: I preffer native (ktorrent on linux, BitRocket on mac)
[02:44] <Lars_G> sethk: I can re-tell condensed
[02:44] <sethk> sun_, package name is xinit.  I used apt-file to find out
[02:44] <crass> azureus is a resource hog
[02:44] <oranged> Lars_G, check out deluge http://code.google.com/p/deluge-torrent/
[02:45] <sethk> picasso, could be in the defaults, yes.  I have kde on this box so I can't really give you specifics.
[02:45] <picasso> ah, poop
[02:45] <picasso> i wonder if it's in a GUI tool or only commandline
[02:45] <scamboy> helo everybody..
[02:45] <Lars_G> sethk: I am doing dist-upgrade, I have both edgy DVD and online repos in my sources since DVD has one or two debs with wrong md5, but when I have online repos apt tries to pull EVERYTHING from the net (slow) is there any way I can do a dist-upgrade and have apt pull ONLY the damaged or missing debs from repos?
[02:46] <sethk> Lars_G, if the cd is in the packages list (dvd in this case) before the 'net repositories, it should use the dvd ones first.  If they can't be read, it should go to the network.  If the broken packages actuallly look ok to the package manager, I'm not sure how you might force it not to use them
[02:46] <|thunder> Lars_G; I use wine + uTorrnet
[02:46] <picasso> sethk, thanks for the help, i wonder if you could tell me which directories to check for settings?
[02:46] <sun_> sethk thanks a lot!
[02:46] <sethk> Lars_G, if the md5 check fails on the dvd, then it won't use that one.
[02:46] <picasso> /usr/share/gnome-* ?
[02:46] <picasso> i dont see metacity anywhere
[02:46] <sethk> picasso, start in /etc/X11, and subdirectories of /etc/X11
[02:47] <Lars_G> sethk: thing is, DVD is prior to net repos. neh, I'll check.
[02:47] <Lars_G> sethk: thanks a lot
[02:47] <scamboy> edgy?? too bad..a disappointment...!!
[02:47] <rBelong2us> hi
[02:47] <DanSchnell> jordan_ I just reenter console and type the sudo line and it read "nvidia package is not available but is referred to by another package"
[02:47] <picasso> k, thanks. looking
[02:47] <rBelong2us> sethk: sitll this horrible problem
[02:47] <sethk> Lars_G, let me see if there is a config for saying "use the first you find" instead of "use the latest"
[02:47] <rabbit1> hi, I have 2 monitors, and when I log in..  everything's fine..  I move off the right side and the mouse goes to monitor 2...   but when I log in, moving the mouse off the right side just goes to the 2nd virtual desktop..  any ideas??
[02:47] <rBelong2us> the flickering is just berserk
[02:47] <sethk> Lars_G, one thing you can do is to unplug the network cable.  then plug it in when it can't get a repo.  :)
[02:47] <sethk> rBelong2us, did changing the settings change the behavior?
[02:47] <rBelong2us> do you think might have to do with the BIOS?
[02:47] <Lars_G> sethk: HAHAHA, right. not so bad an idea
[02:48] <Lars_G> I cna try that
[02:48] <jordan_> DanSchnell, Ok, that is actually good, that means your sources.list is correct
[02:48] <sethk> rBelong2us, it could.  not likely, but not impossible.
[02:48] <scamboy> Warning: If ur system is old DO NOT upgrade to edgy...i would not detect ur old harware...
[02:48] <rBelong2us> sethk: actually is a little worse that before with @60
[02:48] <sethk> rBelong2us, this happens with the live cd?  with an installed linux?  both?
[02:48] <Lars_G> sethk: Also I do think I have security and backports and multiverse repos on, if I limit to universe it might work better for a dist-upgrade
[02:48] <sethk> rBelong2us, well, I said to avoid 60hz.  use only 70hz or greater
[02:48] <DanSchnell> jordan_ now what?
[02:48] <sethk> rBelong2us, non-interlaced
[02:48] <sethk> Lars_G, true
=== Linuturk_ is now known as Linuturk
[02:49] <sethk> Lars_G, although I think that only matters during the apt-get update part.
[02:49] <rBelong2us> sethk: yeah it happened with the latest liveCD as well
[02:49] <jordan_> DanSchnell, sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules nvidea-glx
[02:49] <sethk> rBelong2us, did you choose a resolution with vertical freq 70 hz or higher?
[02:49] <Lars_G> sethk: Might, might not. apt-get seems to consider stuff like "bzflag" and "ooffice" to be vital for dist-upgrade
[02:49] <rBelong2us> at first I thought it might be just the LiveCD but now it's installed
[02:49] <DanSchnell> nvidia or nvidea ?
[02:49] <sethk> Lars_G, ok.
[02:49] <sethk> nvidia
[02:50] <jordan_> DanSchnell, nvidia
[02:50] <rabbit1> hi, I have 2 monitors, and when I log in..  everything's fine..  I move off the right side and the mouse goes to monitor 2...   but when I log in, moving the mouse off the right side just goes to the 2nd virtual desktop..  any ideas??
[02:50] <DanSchnell> jordan_ brb
[02:51] <scamboy> rabbit: magic..hehehehe
[02:51] <Lars_G> sethk: for your mental library. Removing all but universe did the trick
[02:51] <mzli> Which one is the best desktop in *nix?
[02:51] <Lars_G> mzli: It depends on your taste
[02:51] <sethk> Lars_G, good to know.
[02:52] <scamboy> mzli: kde i guesss
[02:52] <sethk> mzli, no real answer to that.  partly what you need, partly what you like.
[02:52] <rBelong2us> sethk: where do I pick that non interlaced stuff?
[02:52] <sethk> mzli, I like kde, some people don't.
[02:52] <Lars_G> mzli: For eye candy and LOTS of features go KDE, for smaller featureset and cleaner, go Gnome, for small, eficient, and cute, use XFCE 4, if you're a unix hard-geek you might like FluxBox or BlackBox
[02:52] <scamboy> sethk: kde is best for deskstop..
[02:52] <sethk> rBelong2us, unless it says interlaced, it will be non, so don't worry about that.  also, interlaced will have a vertical freq in the range of 30-40, not 60-80
[02:52] <oranged> i used to love kde..
[02:52] <Lars_G> scamboy: It's a matter of taste as much as need
[02:52] <oranged> now its too bloated..
[02:53] <oranged> just feature bloat..
[02:53] <sethk> scamboy, I prefer kde, but you can't really say it's better, or not better.  it depends on the requirements.
[02:53] <scamboy> lars: hahahaha
[02:53] <Lars_G> sethk: And taste
[02:53] <sethk> Lars_G, sure, definitely.
[02:53] <scamboy> sethk: how about mandiva??
[02:53] <sethk> Lars_G, of course everyone who has good taste agrees with me  :)
[02:53] <Lars_G> HAHAHA
[02:53] <Lars_G> sethk: I agree with you, but I'm pretty pragmatic
[02:54] <sethk> scamboy, mandiva isn't a desktop, it's a distro, or at least it was the last time I looked.
[02:54] <grndslm> oranged, i agree...kde is feature bloated, with stuff i'll NEVER use
[02:54] <morgue> can I get to ~./wine from the GUI?
[02:54] <scamboy> sethk: thanks man...
[02:54] <grndslm> and i just don't like the colors and organization of kde
[02:54] <sethk> scamboy, I've had problems with some of their newer releases, I thin their quality has decreased
[02:54] <jordan_> morgue, Yes
[02:54] <coastermaster> morgue: you can type it in manually
[02:54] <oranged> grndslm, it started to get really crazy after 3.2
[02:54] <scamboy> setjk: yup, so wat problem ur facing..??
[02:54] <picasso> sethk: apparently other people have my problem (and i posted there as well) : http://gnomesupport.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=54207
[02:55] <picasso> sethk, you really take irc support seriously ;) thanks
[02:55] <morgue> I think I know what you mean
[02:55] <Lars_G> sethk is a hard worker in the trenches of the endles cry for help
[02:55] <morgue> No I don't
[02:55] <morgue> lol
[02:55] <DanSchnell> jordan_ it said " reading state etc....DONE..." Couldn't find package linux-restricted-modules"
[02:55] <grndslm> oranged, admitedly, i've never used it for longer than a coupla days
[02:56] <morgue> got it
[02:56] <jordan_> DanSchnell, sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules nvidea-glx
[02:56] <Lars_G> And yes, I know that sounded bottish, but I am no bot. or at least I can pass turing's test, I think
[02:56] <sethk> grndslm, kde is actually quite nicely layered and modularized.  you can install a much lighter weight kde if you want to.  The distros tend to throw in everything, but that's not the only way to set it up.
[02:56] <Khaaaan> hwy guys... my mic won't work on my T40 laptop... anybody know what's up?
[02:56] <Lars_G> Khaaaan: The rest of your sound works?
[02:56] <oranged> grndslm, i used to run mandrake and loved kde.. ;)
[02:56] <sun_> whats the standard keypress during booting to get into toshiba bios?
[02:56] <Khaaaan> lars_g: yea...
[02:56] <DanSchnell> jordan_ nvidia though?
[02:56] <scamboy> khaaan: sound card how??
[02:56] <jordan_> DanSchnell, I meant " sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx"
[02:56] <Khaaaan> weird eh?
[02:57] <Lars_G> Khaaaan: Might be a mixer problem. Make sure your mic is selected as rec input and volume is up
[02:57] <sun_> how to get into the bios during bootup?
[02:57] <DanSchnell> jordan_ alright
[02:57] <rBelong2us> hi
[02:57] <Khaaaan> hmmm...
[02:57] <Khaaaan> ok
[02:57] <|thunder> so, whats the deal with ndiswrapper? I keep seeing references to it being broken, and the devs have no intentions on fixing it. is ndis 1.8 broken or no ?
[02:57] <Lars_G> sun_: f2 ? ctrl-shift-r ? del ?
[02:57] <rBelong2us> sethk: what's that I have to fix again?
[02:57] <pazemlsqdfmo1> hmm
[02:57] <mzli> <sun_> it depends your mainboard, [del]  or F2
[02:57] <WindDragon> my toshiba is F2
[02:57] <pazemlsqdfmo1> how do you make it so that anything added inside a folder takes on the parents permissions?
[02:58] <rBelong2us> sethk: is this fixable?
[02:58] <Lars_G> ctrl-shift-r is fron old phoenix bioses btw
[02:58] <rBelong2us> what are the possible things that I have to look for in order to fix this horrible flickering/?

[03:00] <WindDragon> server=dapper
[03:00] <mzli> <Zambezi>no
[03:00] <WindDragon> 5 yrs support
[03:00] <scamboy> zam: dapper more stable..
[03:00] <mzli> debian is better
[03:00] <dabaR> mzli: true...
[03:00] <Khaaaan> weird....

[03:02] <WindDragon> picasso: yes it is..
[03:02] <fignew> picasso: I've been using it, no problems
[03:02] <Zambezi> WindDragon, I thought about that. Dapper is LTS. And that's good, but I'm think about security issuse. I would like good security.
[03:02] <sethk> Marcus, which modem?
[03:02] <mzli> <fignew>but debian is still better.hoho
[03:02] <picasso> cool
[03:02] <Lars_G> sethk: Thanks man but I give up for today. See you another day and be well

[03:02] <mzli> <fignew> :)
[03:02] <eseong> scamboy, thanks alot
[03:03] <WindDragon> Zambezi: but they have fixed securit issues in dapper. and security will always be an issue no matter what version us use...
[03:03] <biZt> Marcus: any further information?
[03:03] <DanSchnell_> Jordan_, it says linux restricted modules generic in already newist version, and nvidia-glx has no installation candidate
[03:03] <dabaR> Marcus: what do you need help with that for? that is a cable modem, right?
[03:03] <WindDragon> their correction of security in edgy did come from dapper for all we know..
[03:03] <Zambezi> WindDragon, Then I use Dapper. I'm already behind a firewall so it should be fine.
[03:03] <WindDragon> yes i suggest dapper...
[03:04] <rBelong2us> sorry I wan'
[03:04] <WindDragon> maximize the 5yrs support for a server...
[03:04] <Marcus> its by network, and i have a nvidia nforce network adapter
[03:04] <WindDragon> alll things you got in edgy...
[03:04] <rBelong2us> I wasn't able to see absolutely nothing
[03:04] <WindDragon> u'lll get it in dapper too...
[03:04] <WindDragon> via updates..
[03:04] <variant> WindDragon: no you wont
[03:04] <scamboy> wind: edgy looot of problem..
[03:04] <sethk> Marcus, either I missed something, or what you said didn't make sense.  :)
[03:04] <dabaR> Marcus: and? it is not working? post your /etc/network/interfaces file to paste.ubuntu-nl.org along with the output of ifconfig
[03:04] <Khaaaan> Nice... it was the capture...
[03:04] <DanSchnell_> jordan_ ?
[03:04] <WindDragon> except kernel....
[03:04] <Khaaaan> Lars_G: Thanks dawg!
[03:05] <variant> WindDragon: thats not how it works
[03:05] <Marcus> i cant connect to internet
[03:05] <rBelong2us> oddly enough the screen is somewhat stablized at 800x600@56
[03:05] <variant> WindDragon: unless you enable the unsupported backports repository
[03:05] <WindDragon> variant: so help us understand how?
[03:05] <sethk> rBelong2us, where are you?  I was assuming you have 60hz house current but that's not true everywhere
[03:05] <variant> WindDragon: you dont get hoary features in warty
[03:05] <Marcus> but the conection to the device its active
[03:06] <dabaR> Marcus: open a terminal
[03:06] <karl> hi, I've just dist-upgraded from dapper to edgy, and my webcam doesn't work anymore.  it still _pretends_ to work, in that vlc, and motion can capture video from it, but it just captures plain grey video now.
[03:06] <WindDragon> for a server, i dont think there's much difference bet edgy and dapper..
[03:06] <bruenig> !webcam | karl
[03:06] <ubotu> karl: webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[03:06] <sun_> can you upgrade from breezy to eft without passing through drake?
[03:06] <WindDragon> for desktop.. you may see it, yes
[03:06] <mzli> <karl>edgy is not so stable.
[03:06] <dabaR> WindDragon: except for the kernel...
[03:06] <scamboy> karl: so prblem in edgy??
[03:06] <bruenig> edgy = great
[03:06] <karl> so problem in edgy, yeah, worked just fine before.
[03:06] <scamboy> sun: NO..
[03:06] <rBelong2us> WindDragon: this is my sickly card Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  315PRO PCI/AGP VGA
[03:07] <rBelong2us> sethk: do you think has to do with the current?
[03:07] <karl> bruenig: that's not real elpful, this particular cam was working just fine already in dapper,
[03:07] <scamboy> bruenig: wat is ur computer spec?
[03:07] <coastermaster> is there any way to have GNOME automatically change the desktop background every 5 minutes or so?
[03:07] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: i believe ALSA supports that card...
[03:07] <noxxle> how come i cannot change my power performance profile by clicking on the clock freq app in the taskbar? most distros let you
[03:07] <Marcus> what command must i type dabaR ?
[03:07] <defbyte> what's the linux command for getting all external functions from an .so file ??
[03:07] <variant> coastermaster: yeah install this: http://www.webilder.org/
[03:07] <defbyte> i mean .o
[03:08] <variant> coastermaster: although you can do it without that, that program is cool :)
[03:08] <dabaR> ifconfig;cat /etc/network/interfaces , and paste the output to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[03:08] <rBelong2us> WindDragon: what the hell, my problem aint alsa, is the LCD flickering
[03:08] <bruenig> my computer specs are very unimpressive, amd athlon 64 3400+ on board graphics card that I really am not to sure about, 512 RAM
[03:08] <noxxle> how come i cannot change my power performance profile by clicking on the clock freq app in the taskbar? most distros let you
[03:08] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: oh sorry man... wrong reply..
[03:08] <WindDragon> :)
[03:09] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: flickering is normaly cause by incorrect frequency setting
[03:09] <WindDragon> what are your available frequency?
=== jordan_away is now known as jordan_
[03:09] <Marcus> i search in some forums and said that one possibility is that the nnetwork device is not properly installed

[03:21] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell david__ about root
[03:21] <bruenig> !root | david__
[03:21] <ubotu> david__: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.

[03:21] <pazemlsqdfmo1> dabaR: i guess :P although strangely, when i touch in that directory, it still does not accept the parents permissions
[03:21] <_Luks> hi

[03:22] <dabaR> Elohimus: add a custom launched with gksudo <app> and then add an icon to it.
[03:23] <LjL> scamboy, you can do that too. just don't abuse it
[03:23] <azureal> Elohimus, you could probably tell it to have a path that includes sudo or gksudo, as appropriate
[03:23] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: not sure what you mean
[03:23] <dabaR> pazemlsqdfmo1: I am not sure, it is a setting in nautilus...

[03:23] <_Luks> how to run vnc of my own desktop ?
[03:23] <Elohimus> but then I would have to type in the root password, no?
[03:23] <timhudson> I need some help, when I start up the live cd, I get a box that says "you are required to change your password immediatly (root enforced)
[03:23] <_Luks> how to run vnc of my own desktop ?
[03:23] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: when you create a file or folder, the permission it has is called an umask
[03:23] <Elohimus> nevermind, you're right. :)
[03:23] <kuonSama> !umask | pazemlsqdfmo1
[03:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about umask - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:23] <tony> is there program to administra APache ????
[03:23] <bruenig> !vnc | _Luks
[03:23] <rBelong2us> can it be the connection? The back connection isn't VGA is something weird
[03:23] <ubotu> _Luks: vnc is a way of doing remote desktop.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !freenx.
[03:23] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: but i thought the whole idea of sticky was to overwrite that?
[03:24] <jordan_>  cLoreTz: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e06 Although I don't know if it will work with Edgy
[03:24] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: sticky bit has nothing to do with the permission it get when you create a file
[03:24] <kuonSama> LjL: sorry I tried to use the bot.:P
[03:24] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: http://www.zzee.com/solutions/unix-permissions.shtml
[03:25] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: ah, then what does? i kno it IS possible somehow, i vaguely remember learning it at some point in a past life :)
[03:25] <coastermaster> webilder didn't do what I wanted to do :(
[03:25] <_Luks> bruenig, i know it, when i type: $vncviewer ubuntu:0, it give me an error
[03:25] <jordan_> kuonSama, You can use #ubuntu-bots to test things .
[03:25] <LjL> kuonSama: you can use "search <keyword>" (in a query with the bot) to find a factoid
[03:25] <rBelong2us> hi I have a madd flicckerignnggngnn isssuuuee
[03:25] <bruenig> _Luks, I have no idea how to vnc, I was just passing along the link
[03:25] <kuonSama> ok thanks much, I will do so.
[03:25] <_Luks> join #ubuntu-bots
[03:25] <bruenig> rBelong2us, is that why you held down the keys too long?
[03:25] <_Luks> brueing: oh, thx
[03:26] <scamboy> !bluetooth|_scamboy
[03:26] <ubotu> _scamboy: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[03:26] <Chippy> _Luks: are you typing the dollar sign before the command by chance?
[03:26] <maxflax> So nobody know anything about making something to load during boot here? This is a terrifying though that I know more than ppl about linux here and I don't know much!
[03:26] <coastermaster> is there an easy way to change GNOME's background every 5 minutes or so?
[03:26] <_Luks> Chippy of course not :P
[03:26] <Delkster> Hey... I wonder if something has been changed (between Dapper and Edgy) about how the stuff in the Admininstration menu in Ubuntu us handled? It doesn't seem to use gksu[do]  for gaining the needed privileges anymore.
[03:26] <bruenig> maxflax, what are you trying to load?
[03:26] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell maxflax about boot
[03:26] <kuonSama> maxflax: use an init script.
[03:26] <Chippy> _Luks: just checking :)
[03:26] <Delkster> eh... is handled, and various other typo fixed.
[03:26] <scamboy> maxflax: there is..!!!
[03:26] <WindDragon> maxflax: what do u wnat to execute at startup?
[03:26] <maxflax> bruenig, LDCproc
[03:27] <tony> is there program to administra APache ????
[03:27] <maxflax> WindDragon, LCDproc
[03:27] <kuonSama> tony: you mean edit configuration files?
[03:27] <tony> yes
[03:27] <kuonSama> tony: www.webmin.com
[03:27] <grndslm> am i supposed to install lvm2 or lvm10??
[03:27] <dabaR> Delkster: what does it seem to use?
[03:27] <tony> thanks
[03:27] <LjL> !webmin | kuonSama, tony
[03:27] <ubotu> kuonSama, tony: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[03:27] <WindDragon> maxflax: if these are modules u want to load at start-up, u can include that in /etc/modules
[03:28] <w01> Ok  i did it! i installed java and the web browser crashes (firefox) now how do i undo it? i changed repositries to the PLA can i edit it and where or is there an easier way?
[03:28] <kuonSama> LjL: dang, I'm getting old...
[03:28] <WindDragon> maxflax: if that is an application and ur using ubuntu, goto sessions, then add to startup
[03:28] <Delkster> dabaR, the menu items just have the tool launch commands directly, e.g. just "users-admin"
[03:28] <tony> what other suggestion is there ?
[03:28] <Delkster> And if I execute users-admin (just like that) in the terminal, it also works, and I can't figure out how it gains the privileges to actually do something.
[03:28] <dabaR> Delkster: and it works as if it was sudo? Never asks for the password?
[03:28] <grndslm> w01, try editing the file /usr/bin/firefox, and add this line at the very end:  export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1
[03:28] <Delkster> dabaR, correct
[03:28] <Delkster> Never asks
[03:28] <LjL> kuonSama: don't ask me. i just know it's deprecated and out of the repos...
[03:28] <dabaR> Delkster: so do you get to change things or not?
[03:29] <Delkster> I do
[03:29] <grndslm> w01, i also assume you mean flash makes firefox crash, right?
[03:29] <prophet> where can i find gparted?
[03:29] <dabaR> Delkster: well, that is a security problem then, hey?
[03:29] <scamboy> pro:synaptics..
[03:29] <kuonSama> tony: I know http://netloony.sourceforge.net/ also
[03:29] <bruenig> prophet, sudo apt-get install gparted
[03:29] <kuonSama> tony: but I never tried it
[03:29] <tony> webmin page, it supports ubuntu linux
[03:29] <grndslm> anybody know which lvm package i need to get it working??  lvm2 or lvm10?
[03:30] <Delkster> Would look that way. I also added a new user (with a previously unexistent home dir, so no per-user settings), and it also had the same menu items (no gksu[do] ), but it couldn't do anything
[03:30] <scamboy> anyone chatting frm windows here??
[03:30] <kuonSama> tony: yea webmin will run fine under ubuntu, LjL just meant it was not in the repository anymore, and not recommended
[03:30] <bruenig> prophet, it should then show up in system>administration>GNOME Partition Editor
[03:30] <maxflax> Winddragon, well.. LCDproc is a app that I think loads the modules.. not sure on that since I havent booted since I got the damn thing to start showing stuff on the VFD display..but I do now that I have to get it to start during boot. In the install they showed how to do it in debian.. not sure if that applies to ubuntu.. thou ubuntu is a debian brat! :)
[03:30] <Delkster> even if I added it to the admin group (by giving it admin privileges through users-admin)
[03:30] <kuonSama> tony: what I understand as webmin is a dangerous app, it does everything in root
[03:30] <Delkster> I'm a little puzzled.
[03:30] <kuonSama> coool, a new 5000 pieces puzzle
[03:30] <kuonSama> sorry, just j/k
[03:30] <tony> well, i just need to try stuff on test server. thats all
[03:31] <lando> whats a good audio converter for flac to mp3 ?
[03:31] <Delkster> So, I'm just wondering if it's supposed to be so that there's no gksu[do]  in the menu items and they use some other kind of magic to do their job
[03:31] <WindDragon> maxflax: yeah, u can go to system->preference->sessions
[03:31] <w01> i don't think so
[03:31] <Delkster> They're also that way on the live cd, although of course that might have some strange special tweaks.
[03:31] <dabaR> Delkster: you know, same thing hapenned to me. Do you think you may have typed in your password in the last few minutes? It remembers you for 15 minutes...Or does it even work after a while?
[03:31] <w01> i went to a chat room to test the java plugin and it just whoosh
[03:31] <Delkster> dabaR, I said "sudo -k" and even _rebooted_ in betweem
[03:32] <pazemlsqdfmo1> FFS how can i set permission inheritance??
[03:32] <pazemlsqdfmo1> this is driving me crazy
[03:32] <jordan_> DanSchnell, What is happening?
[03:32] <bruenig> lando, a quick apt-cache search appears to be putting up soundconverter
[03:32] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1, honestly i don't think you can get it
[03:32] <dabaR> Delkster: wow...mine also still works, weird...I think it is a bug.
[03:32] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1, perhaps with ACLs, but not with the standard Unix permission system i'm afraid
[03:32] <Delkster> dabaR, I was wondering if it were somehow intentinal because it definitely isn't a per-user setting that I could have goofed up
[03:33] <w01> i'll try that edit
[03:33] <lando> bruenig, i noticed that. i guess ill check that out. i was just hoping someone had some experience with it
[03:33] <Delkster> And there almost definitely is a bug somewhere (because creating a new user and giving it admin privileges doesn't allow it to use the admin menu items)
[03:33] <Delkster> but I don't know where because I don't know what's intentional and what's not
[03:33] <grndslm> nobody hear uses lvm?
[03:33] <texas915> can someone help me
[03:33] <undercover> i cant hear lvm
[03:33] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: heres my situation: i have a folder shared over the network, for security reasons i created a new user which only has access to that folder, to log on remotely, but both the user i log in wiv on this computer, as the user i can log in with on another computer, need rwx on that folder
[03:33] <bruenig> !ask | texas915
[03:33] <ubotu> texas915: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:33] <dabaR> Delkster: right...and you did nothing weird, same as me. I use openbox as a wm, and load the panel differently, do you just use gnome?
[03:33] <Delkster> fwiw, sudo of course works with that new user after giving it admin privileges, just not the menu items
[03:34] <Delkster> I use Gnome, yes
[03:34] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: i am 99% sure that there was a way to do it, but i cant remember, which is driving me crazy
[03:34] <texas915> how can i get admin rights
[03:34] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: this is called a group
[03:34] <bruenig> !sudo | texas915
[03:34] <ubotu> texas915: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:34] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: do a group with the users that need rwx to it, and do chmod g+rwx
[03:34] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: i know.... but the bloody group permissions wont propagate
[03:34] <rBelong2us> hey I at loss witha flickering issue of my LCD screen
[03:34] <scamboy> !admin|texas915
[03:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about admin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:34] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: i did that
[03:35] <Delkster> brb, I'm gonna check how things look on the Dapper live cd just for the kicks
[03:35] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: the umask of the process that create the files and folder need to be 007
[03:35] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: how do you share your folder?
[03:35] <texas915> what is the comand to install software
[03:35] <Marcus> hi again
[03:35] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: and how do i set that for that specific folder?
[03:35] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama: samba
[03:35] <dob1> hi
[03:35] <bruenig> texas915, sudo apt-get install whatever
[03:35] <bruenig> texas915, or sudo aptitude install whatever, if you prefer that
[03:35] <texas915> cool
[03:35] <oc12> hello
[03:35] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: then you must set samba umask to 007, but I don't think samba can handle multiple umask
[03:36] <coastermaster> how do I install perl modules?
[03:36] <oc12> i am unable to see the video in kaffeine
[03:36] <texas915> can i use kismet with ubuntu
[03:36] <kuonSama> coastermaster: cpan
[03:36] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1, you can make files in a directory inherit the group of the directory, by setting suid group on the directory
[03:36] <coastermaster> thank
[03:36] <coastermaster> s
[03:36] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: i set chmod ug+rwx on it
[03:36] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1, still, if the default umask doesn't have g+rwx, that won't gain you much
[03:36] <bruenig> !info kismet
[03:36] <ubotu> kismet: Wireless 802.11b monitoring tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 2006.04.R1-1.1 (edgy), package size 964 kB, installed size 2448 kB
[03:36] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1, http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/help/faq/permissions.html - search for "inherit"
[03:37] <bruenig> texas915, yes, it is in the universe repository if you enable that you can just do sudo apt-get install kismet
[03:37] <dob1> i have a partition  hda6 where i want to install ubuntu, on installation at step 5 i skip the partition procedure ( hda6 just exist is an reiserfs partition not empty) i go to the next screen where i haver to select the mount point , i select   / for it but it tells me that he need a root filesystem, why ?
[03:37] <jordan_> rBelong2us, You already tried installing the proprietary drivers / dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
[03:37] <swilliamson> anyone know of a good html wysiwyg editor for ubuntu?
[03:37] <dob1> the format flag is selected for this partition
[03:37] <Rav|strangler> anyone know of a program I can use to record audio that plays out of my speaker?
[03:38] <dxdt> swilliamson, I think there is one called bluefish and I think there is another one calleed nvu(at least that exists on windows)
[03:38] <dabaR> Delkster: sup man, you're still alive?
[03:38] <scamboy> dob: / is needed for the root..
[03:38] <oc12> i am unable to see the video in kaffeine, the sound works?
[03:38] <maxflax> If I have a init script for debian.. will it work for ubuntu?
[03:38] <bruenig> texas915, have you enabled the extra repos or do you know how?
[03:38] <Rav|strangler> swilliamson, I use NVU
[03:38] <dob1> scamboy:  i know , what it is the problem?
[03:38] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: I read it somewhere a way to do it, it was a script which was reading smb log file and was changing perm on the fly, it was a very strange hack, but it worked
[03:38] <oc12> NVU is great
[03:38] <Rav|strangler> ^^
[03:38] <firebird619> When I try to run Reload in Synaptic, it says malformed line 21 which is deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy. What should it be?
[03:38] <swilliamson> thanks I have used nvu in the past, just could not remember the name
[03:38] <bun-bun> !java
[03:38] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[03:38] <rBelong2us> jordan_: propiertary? What's the difference?
[03:39] <Rav|strangler> anyone know of a program I can use to record audio that plays out of my speakers?
[03:39] <texas915> repo??
[03:39] <jordan_> rBelong2us, What kind of card do you have?
[03:39] <dob1> scamboy: i want it as my / partition  and format it
[03:39] <bruenig> firebird619, generally it looks something like http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main or http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe or whatever
[03:39] <bruenig> texas915, repository
[03:39] <pazemlsqdfmo1> kuonSama, LjL: samba has a create mask, i just set that (havent tested it though), but my main problem is, when i create a file with this user, it still doesnt have the right permissions, and since group is set to ---, my other group members cant do much with it
[03:39] <texas915> how do i do that
[03:40] <scamboy> dob: ask bruenig....
[03:40] <snook353> is there a way to by-pass the "network manager"?
[03:40] <dob1> bruenig: can you help me?
[03:40] <bruenig> texas915, to enable the extra repositories and install kismet just copy and paste the following command: sudo vim -c '%s/# deb/deb/g' -c 'wq' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kismet
[03:40] <Rav|strangler> i wish my network manager worked
[03:40] <Delkster> dabaR, I'm still alive, just booted the Dapper live cd (it's not the fastest thing on earth)
[03:40] <kuonSama> pazemlsqdfmo1: umask 007 touch test
[03:40] <bruenig> dob1, what is the question
[03:40] <snook353> heh
[03:40] <dabaR> Delkster: it seems it is a bug still, I am looking into it...:)
[03:40] <Rav|strangler> anyone know of a program I can use to record audio that plays out of my speakers?
[03:40] <snook353> my wireless only works when i leave my eth0 "disabled"
[03:40] <kuonSama> snook353: what do you want to do?
[03:41] <roycebarber> I so with I could speak in super technical linux terms and look smart like you guys. :(
[03:41] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1: well as i said, if you set SUID group to the directory, the group should become that of the directory (give it a group that the needed user(s) belong to, and you'll be fine, no?)
[03:41] <firebird619> bruenig: That's what I thought but thought I better ask. I just reinstalled Edgy today and went to the sources.list and uncommented the commented lines and then went into Synaptic and thats when the trouble started.
[03:41] <Rav|strangler> you you shouldnt use both snook353
[03:41] <snook353> my wireless gets bad when i change my n-m settings
[03:41] <snook353> strangler, what do you mean?
[03:41] <Delkster> dabaR, like I said, there's a bug somewhere, but not having any mention of any intentional changes made in Edgy with regard to these things, it's hard to say where
[03:41] <dob1> bruenig: i have a partition hda6 where i want to install ubuntu, on installation procedure i skip the partition part (hda6 just exist it's an reiserfs partition, not empty) i go to the next screen i set this partition as format and mount point /,  but it tells me that there is not root filesystem, why?
[03:41] <lib8264q> hello channel can someone help me with an xorg problem
[03:41] <jordan_> rBelong2us, If you have an ATI or nvidea card, the closed source drivers can sometimes be better than the proprietary ones, ( especially with nvidia )
[03:41] <snook353> both what, strangler?
[03:41] <Marcus> dabaR
[03:41] <Marcus> 3
[03:41] <Marcus> * lib8264q has joined #ubuntu
[03:41] <roycebarber> Question... is there an easy way to make ubuntu see my windows partition.
[03:42] <Rav|strangler> Like when I was setting up my broadcom 34.x etho and eth1
[03:42] <rBelong2us> jordan_: it's a SIS pro
[03:42] <Marcus> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29949/plain/
[03:42] <snook353> ok, i get your point, strangler
[03:42] <kuonSama> roycebarber: it should by default
[03:42] <bruenig> dob1, why not go to the partition part, reformat hda6 and then move on and assign the mount points
[03:42] <lib8264q> cant paet as  on other pc ...
[03:42] <roycebarber> KuonSama I cant find my windows directory :(
[03:42] <Rav|strangler> it didnt cause issues forme until I enable the WES
[03:42] <lib8264q> past*
[03:42] <kuonSama> roycebarber: otherwise sudo mount /dev/yourwindowspartition /mountpoint
[03:42] <jordan_> !ntfs
[03:42] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:42] <kuonSama> roycebarber: type mount
[03:42] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: it inherits the group, but the group has no rights over the file, so i need to modify my own umask
[03:42] <kuonSama> roycebarber: to see if it is mounted
[03:42] <dabaR> Marcus: try running sudo dhclient3 eth0 in a terminal
[03:42] <bruenig> texas915, did that work?
[03:42] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: not sure where and to what though :|
[03:43] <texas915> i don't know
[03:43] <Delkster> dabaR, in dapper, even on the live cd, the menu items seem to have gksu[do] 
[03:43] <Vich> I have an interesting problem
[03:43] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: in synaptic, there is  i believe an included thingy for SiS. maybe u can try to install that for ur video problem and see if that will help u with ur probelm
[03:43] <Marcus> i type "sudo dhclient3 eth0" didnt i?
[03:43] <lib8264q> have an i810 problem with xorg
[03:43] <Vich> my webcam lights up when ubuntu (edgy) starts up
[03:43] <dabaR> Delkster: you mean if you create a new user, or with the default live cd user?
[03:43] <Vich> and won't go off
[03:43] <Vich> even when I shutdown
[03:43] <bruenig> texas915, well did it install kismet when you copied and pasted that into the terminal?
[03:43] <Vich> can I stop it initialising or whatever?
[03:43] <rBelong2us> jordan_: this is the one
[03:43] <dob1> bruenig: i didn't find a part to reformat it ,  just delete and create a new one
[03:43] <rBelong2us> [SiS]  315PRO
[03:43] <texas915> yes
[03:44] <bruenig> dob1, yeah essentially
[03:44] <lib8264q> have tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:44] <rBelong2us> WindDragon: thanks I'll check that out
[03:44] <Rav|strangler> anyone know how I can record the audio that comes out my speakers?
[03:44] <Delkster> dabaR, with the default one. I'm trying to add a new one now.
[03:44] <texas915> where do i find kismet
[03:44] <rBelong2us> I've tried every single thing on earth
[03:44] <bruenig> texas915, just enter kismet into the terminal
[03:44] <dabaR> Delkster: I did not get a final answer yet, but it seems to me that it is a bug. Stay tuned, I guess...I will look out for it on the Net in the next few days.

[03:45] <roycebarber> KuonSama... My windows partition is C:\ in windows, but im still not sure how to mount it. typing "mount" brings some kinda technical jibberish on terminal.
[03:45] <Delkster> dabaR, I may also look into it. I'll be hanging around here on freenode if you need something.
[03:45] <texas915> ok i was denied
[03:45] <bruenig> dob1, it should. It doesn't apply changes immediately so you can try it and see what it names it before you hit next and apply the changes
[03:45] <kuonSama> roycebarber: c:\ has nothing to do with linux filesystem
[03:45] <Rav|strangler> lol
[03:45] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: if that is already installed, u can try to follow the links from the description, to get soem further information
[03:45] <dabaR> Delkster: K, :) I hope it is an exciting bug...
[03:45] <scamboy> rocy: you could only read ntfs..
[03:45] <Marcus> em... iam sorry, but i must reboot the computer because it has 3 operative systems
[03:45] <Marcus> :$
[03:45] <Delkster> btw, also on the dapper live cd I can just run users-admin in the terminal without sudo with the default user, and change stuff
[03:45] <roycebarber> I'm using NTFS
[03:45] <kuonSama> roycebarber: mount will tell you if the partition is mounted, like /dev/hda2 on /media...
[03:45] <Marcus> it takes a few minutes
[03:46] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: i think i fixed it, in ACL, i set the mask to what it needed to be, seems ok now
[03:46] <dabaR> Marcus: well, you can try that, It could work if everything is fine. Do this:
[03:46] <dob1> bruenig: ok it apply the changes after the mount point part, right?
[03:46] <bruenig> dob1, yes
[03:46] <dob1> bruenig: ok thanks
[03:46] <bruenig> dob1, it will say some stuff like it is creating it but not until you hit install does it actually do all the formatting.
[03:46] <firebird619> Is there a way to bring sources.list back to default as if I had just installed Edgy? Something isn't right with it so I want to bring it back to default with the commented out lines, etc.
[03:46] <roycebarber> KuonSama: I'm not sure how to use terminal, im sorry i dont know how to use those commands. Perhaps i'll read up on Mounting drives...
[03:46] <Delkster> dabaR, it sure excites me already if it allows admin stuff to be run without giving a password (although obviously only with some obscure conditions in place)
[03:46] <dabaR> Marcus: turn off the modem, and then turn off the computer. Wait for 5 minutes, then turn on the modem, then boot the computer into ubuntu and run that sudo dhclient3 eth0, it may work.
[03:46] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: argh, i spoke too soon
[03:46] <Rav|strangler> roycebarber, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Windows go here
[03:46] <bruenig> firebird619, did you back it up?
[03:46] <nixternal> !upgrade
[03:46] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[03:47] <dob1> bruenig: ok so i know when it format and change the partition table ?
[03:47] <scamboy> !downgrade
[03:47] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[03:47] <texas915> hey bruening i get permission denied
[03:47] <dabaR> Delkster: but it may be a feature, that is what I am saying:) I did not get a definitive answer from the devel channel...
[03:47] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1: well with ACLs you should be able to do that, anyway. but i'm not familiar with that at all
[03:47] <bruenig> texas915, what does it say when you do "kismet"?
[03:47] <kuonSama> roycebarber: yea I suggest you read the doc, to have ubuntu automaticaly mount your windows fs
[03:47] <Marcus> thanks, i will try
[03:47] <dabaR> Delkster: ask someone else to try it on dapper, I guess is a way to find out.
[03:47] <Rav|strangler> roycebarber,  I agree with kuonSama
[03:47] <Marcus> ill be back
[03:47] <dabaR> Marcus: good luck
[03:47] <cmcra1> I reciently installed Ubuntu linux... When the system booted up the sound card is not working... I have both an intagrated and an installed sound card. The Asla mixer was installed and running however the only way to get any sound was to select the ICE958 2 box and then I get a staticy sound.... What do I need to do to get sound working properly..
[03:47] <Rav|strangler> anyone know how I can record the audio that comes out my speakers?
[03:47] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: i still had permissions on 0777 for testing, i set them to 2770 again, and it dont work anymore (with ACL)
[03:48] <firebird619> bruenig: No, all I had done was uncommented the commented lines and then went into synaptic and now I get malformed lines when I try to update it.
[03:48] <texas915> couldn't open for writing permission denied
[03:48] <Delkster> dabaR, I suspect that some parts of it are intentional (perhaps the "getting stuff run without the password" part but I'm not sure) but then there's a bug somewhere else
[03:48] <scamboy> asla again.....hehehehe
[03:48] <CAsurfer> I'm trying to install beryl on a system that I upgraded from dapper to edgy.  I followed the guide here: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu, but it doesn't work.  Does anyone know how to check if AIGLX is installed and working properly?
[03:48] <lib8264q> anyone care to tell me how to fix cannot find default font "fixed" error in xorg ?
[03:48] <bruenig> firebird619, I can send you my backup of the original
[03:48] <Delkster> Anyway, I'm gone for now ->
[03:49] <scamboy> !alsa| cmcra
[03:49] <ubotu> cmcra: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[03:49] <GigaClon> is the a tutorial for using SCIM, I can't seem to get it to do anything
[03:49] <bruenig> texas915, have you tried looking in the menus for it. It might be in system>administration
[03:49] <cmcra1> the asla mxer is selected
[03:49] <dxdt> firebird619, or just replace the whole thing with the nicely configured one from http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_add_extra_repositories
[03:50] <pazemlsqdfmo1> LjL: you know how i can set my own umask?
[03:50] <kuonSama> Rav|strangler: vrec
[03:50] <cmcra1> when I select the IEC958 2 check box I get staticy sound
[03:50] <WindDragon> CAsurfer: what's ur card?
[03:50] <cmcra1> without is selected I get no sound
[03:50] <Delkster> GigaClon, what are you trying to do with it?
[03:50] <GigaClon> type in japanese
[03:50] <CAsurfer> WindDragon, ati
[03:50] <firebird619> dxdt: Ok, I will give that a try. Thanks.
[03:51] <WindDragon> CAsurfer: forget AIGLX in ATI, atm...
[03:51] <GigaClon> I can't seem to make it do anything, I set the up the hot keys
[03:51] <scamboy> cmcra: see the help link
[03:51] <WindDragon> CAsurfer: it wont make u happy.. :)
[03:51] <cmcra1> I am looking now.
[03:51] <Rav|strangler> kuonSama, thanks bro
[03:51] <WindDragon> btw, what specifix ATI?
[03:51] <GigaClon> I also don't the the toolbar, even when it is always shown
[03:51] <WindDragon> xseries?
[03:51] <sithrazer> I was wondering if someone could answer a question regarding mounting hard drives in ubuntu 6.10
[03:51] <CAsurfer> WindDragon, does that mean that I can't use beryl, or can I use xgl instead?
[03:51] <WindDragon> or radeon?
[03:51] <bruenig> texas915, did you find it?
[03:51] <dv_> anyone here running aiglx with nvidia beta drivers? I want to know the glxinfo output with this setup
[03:52] <kuonSama> sithrazer: go on, ask
[03:52] <Rav|strangler> sithrazer, whatkind of harddirve
[03:52] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo1: "umask blah" in your shell.
[03:52] <WindDragon> for ATI, still xgl, as of now..
[03:52] <kuonSama> sithrazer: man mount should give you a start
[03:52] <Rav|strangler> what he said
[03:52] <Darxus> I feel it is reasonable for ubuntu to break when I ask it to use a window manager that is not correctly installed (beryl), but I feel very strongly that if I delete all the config files in my home directory that mention it (according to a grep -r) that it should start working again, and I am very grumpy that that isn't working out
[03:52] <WindDragon> ATI video cards are quite problematic..
[03:52] <dv_> so, could anyone running the beta drivers and aiglx paste me the glxinfo output while running compiz/beryl?
[03:52] <Delkster> GigaClon, right-click on the text area where you're trying to type and select "Input Methods", then "SCIM"
[03:52] <Rav|strangler> sithrazer, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Windows
[03:52] <Delkster> Have you tried this?
[03:52] <texas915> this is fun
[03:52] <bruenig> !xgl

[03:52] <sithrazer> I believe it's a western digital. But the problem is, it's not visible. at all.
[03:52] <Rav|strangler> hm..
[03:52] <CAsurfer> WindDragon, X300. Is beryl fully featured under xgl? And do you have any idea how quickly development is coming along for ATI AIGLX?

[03:53] <texas915> ok
[03:53] <texas915> hey
[03:53] <XVampireX> They joined forces with the devil
[03:53] <sithrazer> using the hal device manager I noticed a key listing of volume.ignore = true
[03:53] <texas915> hey bruenig
[03:53] <sithrazer> I think that's the problem
[03:53] <Delkster> GigaClon, I also installed the scim-anthy package for typing Japanese, but I'm not sure if anthy is strictly required for that
[03:53] <bruenig> texas915, ...

[03:53] <texas915> i don't have permission
[03:54] <XVampireX> You can use AIGLX too, and beryl

[03:54] <texas915> i didn't see that
[03:54] <jordan_> CAsurfer, Beryl is fully featured under XGL ( just slower ) and ATI hasn't said anything about texture-from-pixmap
[03:54] <Rav|strangler> but the workspace switcher and pager is kool
[03:54] <Delkster> GigaClon, basically, I have configured SCIM so that Ctrl+Space works as a toggle, have chosen SCIM as the input method, have scim-anthy installed
[03:54] <rBelong2us> how on earth I find a sis package with dept Installer?
[03:54] <texas915> no i didn't look in the menu
[03:55] <Delkster> GigaClon, and can then select Anthy for input in the SCIM toolbar that appears when I switch to that typing mode by pressing Ctrl+Space (or whatever is set as the toggle key) after choosing the SCIM input method
[03:55] <CAsurfer> jordan_, thanks
[03:55] <sithrazer> is there any way to change the volume.ignore listing on a hard drive, either through the device manager or any other way?
[03:55] <bruenig> texas915, well look see if you can find it. It might be in system>administration, look in all of them.
[03:55] <overridex> is the black and white usplash on amd64 fixed yet?
[03:55] <bruenig> Is anyone else familiar with kismet, I have never run it before. Is it a graphical app. Is it a command line app. Does it require root privileges to run?

[03:58] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: can u try that one i just said
[03:58] <texas915> ok
[03:58] <Delkster> rBelong2us, I think a basic SiS driver (without 3D acceleration) comes with the base packages. Which SiS chip do you have?
[03:58] <roycebarber> *Gleeeeeeee* Windows successfully mounted. I'm not sure if it'll be there when i reboot, but right now it is! Woohoo! I can now try to run my programs under WINE.
[03:58] <rBelong2us> I've got this one
[03:58] <bruenig> roycebarber, you don't need windows mounted to run your windows apps with wine
[03:58] <rBelong2us> Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  315PRO
[03:58] <Delkster> SiS isn't generally great about supporting Linux...
[03:59] <roycebarber> Bruenig I just now realized my windows programs arnt contained in my Windows directory... So im now not sure how to access them. :(
[03:59] <rBelong2us> so that's it now is sis fault
[03:59] <Delkster> The 315PRO _should_ be supported, afaik
[03:59] <WindDragon> but ubuntu has it for SiS -> xserver-xorg-video-sis
[04:00] <rBelong2us> now could it be that it's not using the VGA cable? Instead a weird one?
[04:00] <grndslm> anybody get their treo 650 to sync with ubuntu??
[04:00] <roycebarber> Oh wait yes i am, in mounting my windows partition it shows all the files i wanted! yay!
[04:00] <bruenig> roycebarber, what windows directory? the .wine directory or a directory on your mounted drive?
[04:00] <bruenig> roycebarber, ok well nevermind then
[04:00] <Delkster> rBelong2us, check out http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsisvga.shtml
[04:00] <rBelong2us> WindDragon: how would that be sudo apt-get xserver-xorg-video-sis
[04:00] <Delkster> rBelong2us, there might be some weird issues and possible workarounds mentioned there
[04:00] <maxflax> WindDragon, ok.. it didn't work.. I guess It has to do with that the modules didn't load.. how do I get them to load during boot?
[04:00] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: u may want to try to boot with option vga=791, just to troubleshoot further
[04:00] <bruenig> texas915, any progress?
[04:00] <WindDragon> "install"
[04:00] <roycebarber> Bruenig, i duel boot windowsXP and Ubuntu. i have a ton of programs installed on windows. i want to run those programs in ubuntu. so im gonna attempt that in WINE.
[04:00] <rBelong2us> WindDragon: ok thanks
[04:01] <WindDragon> sudo apt-get install.....

[04:01] <texas915> no :( bruening
[04:01] <bruenig> texas915, what is it saying now?
[04:01] <maxflax> WindDragon, Did u say .. sudo apt-get install to me?
[04:01] <roycebarber> Haha I'm only wanting WINE to run programs i've always used in windows that i cant install in linux :)

[04:03] <rBelong2us> WindDragon: I did that
[04:03] <bruenig> texas915, looks like a problem with kismet not installation or anything like that. I have never used kismet so I probably can't be of much help
[04:03] <texas915> ok
[04:04] <scamboy> can use kismet on dapper??
[04:04] <WindDragon> rBelong2us: did it ask for a CD?
[04:04] <rBelong2us> E: Couldn't find package xserver-xorg-video-sis
[04:04] <maxflax> I would guess that was a faitly easy question for you. answers please!!
[04:04] <rBelong2us> nope is that I can't find that driver
[04:04] <texas915> so what can i do
[04:05] <texas915> play with it

[04:12] <tritium> scamboy: good
[04:13] <Honk> scamboy: what's your model?
[04:13] <slvmchn> for my box, all i really had to do to get it up to snuff was install nvidia drivers... everything else worked fine
[04:13] <kitche> Jural: are you using the official install?
[04:13] <scamboy> Honk: old centrino satellite a50
[04:13] <Jural> Yeah I was
[04:13] <Jural> Is there another version I should be trying?
[04:13] <Honk> What are you running on, slvmchn?
[04:13] <kitche> Jural: check the setup.sh since I bet I can narrow it down for you :)

[04:20] <ubuntugrrrr> I'm just trying to find more visulizations for totem
[04:21] <ubuntugrrrr> i just got a pc to tv converter so i'd like some better visualizations
[04:21] <WindDragon> the easiest graphic card to configure
[04:21] <Honk> What driver controls those, anyway?
[04:21] <ubuntugrrrr> or should i just get a new media player

[04:21] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, what are you talking about better visualizations?
[04:21] <ubuntugrrrr> you know, when you play music.. there's a visualization
[04:22] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, oh
[04:22] <ubuntugrrrr> theres only one vis in totem
[04:22] <ubuntugrrrr> should i just download a better player?
[04:22] <ubuntugrrrr> if only i could use winamp on linux :p
[04:22] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, I really pay little attention to visualizations. I generally turn them off.
[04:22] <jsjc> hello
[04:22] <scamboy> me too..
[04:22] <jsjc> i am looking for some help in configuring wifi on my new dell XPS m1210 laptop
[04:22] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, always seemed odd to watch music. Put it in rhythmbox and minimize it to the tray
[04:22] <WindDragon> amarok
[04:23] <WindDragon> is also good...
[04:23] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, I like listen although very beta at this point
[04:23] <jsjc> also anyone knows why is telling me that is connected to the AC when it is not? I think i am running battery unless there is wifi battery recharger xDDDD
[04:23] <ubuntugrrrr> WindDragon: Does that include a better selection of visualizations?
[04:23] <scamboy> !networkmanager|jsjc
[04:23] <ubotu> jsjc: networkmanager is an application to make (wireless) networking Just Work. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[04:24] <ubuntugrrrr> i'll look it up...
[04:24] <WindDragon> ubuntugrrrr: yes] 
[04:24] <Honk> Intel PRO/Wireless?
[04:24] <meheren> the hd on my box died and i don't have the money to buy a new one... but i do however have a 500meg usb flash and 4gigs of ram and 1 gig of video ram is there anyway i could install ubuntu on that...?
[04:24] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, it doesn't have visualizations but it is very amarok like in that it has lyrics and wikipedia and automatically downloads album art. The whole layout is very pleasing
[04:24] <ubuntugrrrr> hmm.
[04:25] <meheren> i remember the old macs used to be able to mount ram as disks... can the new ones do that... without a os?
[04:25] <wastrel> ramdisk
[04:25] <ubuntugrrrr> can i get that through synaptic package manager?
[04:25] <scamboy> meheren:NO!!
[04:25] <meheren> scamboy... :(
[04:25] <meheren> scamboy, they can not mount or i can not install?
[04:25] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, here are some screenshots, depends on what you like I guess but it looks pretty good to my eyes at least.http://listengnome.free.fr/
[04:25] <scamboy> meheren: mount? i am not sure..
[04:25] <WindDragon> meheren: use live CD, then save those stuff in ur USB, add a "persistent" word at the boot ooption
[04:25] <max_> anyone know if PhotoShop 7 or CS works on KDE (edgy) with Wine?
[04:26] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, the 0.4 version is in the repos I believe. The 0.5 beta on the website is much better but they both have some shortcomings especially in the lyric fetching arena.
[04:26] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, in the edgy repos I should probably add
[04:26] <meheren> WindDragon... im using the cd right now... so what do i do?
[04:26] <ubuntugrrrr> ehh wll i'm looking for amarok
[04:26] <ubuntugrrrr> i dont have edgy, and i don't know what it is..
[04:27] <coz_> ubuntugrrrr, edgy is the new ubuntu version
[04:27] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, amarok is in the repos too. Just sudo apt-get install amarok
[04:27] <ubuntugrrrr> i just did...
[04:27] <ubuntugrrrr> it didnt work
[04:27] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, do you have the extra repos enabled?
[04:27] <WindDragon> meheren: reboot 1st... then from the menu, in the boot option, add the word persistent at the end, then continue booting

[04:28] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, it doesn't matter, it will install still.
[04:28] <cherubiel> ubuntugrrrr: are you using synaptic too, maybe its olding the lock?
[04:28] <Vich> I need to stop my webcam from initialising at startup :/
[04:28] <ubuntugrrrr> oh... yes. that is it..
[04:28] <max_> anyone know if PhotoShop 7 or CS works on KDE (edgy) with Wine?

[04:31] <ubuntugrrrr> hmm.. why is edgy better?

[04:33] <cynical> moshe: beta is 9xxx series
[04:33] <WindDragon> noxxle: what are u doing?
[04:34] <moshe> why hasn't the driver been updated to 8776 in edgy, given the security advisory regarding 8774?
[04:34] <indref> Does anyone recommend a good veiwer for a 500KB text file?
[04:34] <noxxle> im not doing anything
[04:34] <noxxle> its idling
[04:34] <noxxle> clicks a couple times a minute
[04:34] <indref> gedit is no good and Firefox messes it up.
[04:34] <indref> Any ideas?
[04:35] <WindDragon> noxxle: maybe swapping files, if u have so many open or ur hd is heavily fragmented
[04:35] <gleesond> any one know of a good peice of software for finance?
[04:35] <moshe> I don't want to update the driver so much as I want to know why the fonts are rendered so large in Firefox now

[04:36] <cynical> no idea
[04:36] <dabaR> scamboy: sf.net is shorter to type
[04:36] <blastermaster> if ur hdd is clicking maybe is going bye bye better backup
[04:36] <WindDragon> it does,.... if u notice in ubuntu, after 30 startup, it automatically checks ur hdd..

[04:52] <kronoman> question:: any ASUS mobo will be ok for ubuntu? tryin to build a new PC
[04:52] <ubuntugrrrr> hmm
[04:52] <grndslm> nobody can help me with syncing a treo??
[04:52] <ubuntugrrrr> i'm having a problem with flash...
[04:52] <meheren> yeh, i have a mac so it might se things slitely different
[04:52] <jordan> ubuntugrrrr, I recommend flash9
[04:52] <jordan> !flash9
[04:52] <ubotu> Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[04:53] <WindDragon> meheren: u can try... but never done that :)
[04:53] <ubuntugrrrr> i think i have it
[04:53] <WindDragon> brbr
[04:53] <ubuntugrrrr> i just put flash on here a few days ago
[04:53] <meheren> does linux support hda+ to run off of?
[04:53] <ubuntugrrrr> i can watch flash videos and stuff online but there is no audio...
[04:53] <meheren> or rather ubunut
[04:53] <meheren> *ubuntu
[04:53] <grndslm> ubuntugrrr...you might want to try editing /usr/bin/firefox, and add this line to the very end of the file:  export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1
[04:53] <david__> i have multiverse, and i was told mplayer was in multiverse, but i still dont see it
[04:53] <grndslm> ubuntugrrr, oops...wrong firefox problem
[04:53] <ubuntugrrrr> lol
[04:54] <tritium> david__: did you update your package lsit?
[04:54] <kitche> meheren: no it' can't use hfs+ that is an apple technology which linux doesn't support really
[04:54] <tritium> list even
[04:54] <david__> how?
[04:54] <grndslm> ubuntugrrr, edit /etc/firefox/firefoxrc
[04:54] <david__> i clicked reload
[04:54] <meheren> kitche, heh ok :p
[04:54] <jordan> ubuntugrrrr, Try going to a site that requires flash 8, flash9 is still beta so even if you installed recently you may not have it.
[04:54] <grndslm> and add change "none" to "aoss"
[04:54] <meheren> so i guess ill format it then...
[04:54] <FluxD> hello is it possible to change you user name in ubuntu once its installed?
[04:54] <meheren> how long should it take?
[04:54] <ubuntugrrrr> well i'm referring to sites like youtube.com
[04:54] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, have you installed the flash 9 beta
[04:54] <texas915> hello
[04:54] <grndslm> ubuntugrr, look at my 2 posts above
[04:54] <ubuntugrrrr> i dont know which flash i have
[04:54] <meheren> WindDragon, how long should it take?
[04:55] <ubuntugrrrr> i know... theres more than one person talking to me i'm kinda confused here
[04:55] <VoX> ubuntugrrrr: install alsa-oss
[04:55] <ubuntugrrrr> >.<
[04:55] <bruenig> ubuntugrrrr, itis probably best that you install the beta. It is better than flash 7 and there are no audio problems
[04:55] <texas915> hey bruenig
[04:55] <ubuntugrrrr> i'm only on 640x480 res
[04:55] <david__> is mplayer and movie player the same thing?
[04:55] <grndslm> ubuntugrrr, try editing the firefoxrc file like i suggested and changing "none" to "aoss"
[04:55] <grndslm> tell me i'm wrong
[04:55] <ubuntugrrrr> ok.. brb
[04:55] <meheren> david, i believe so, yes
[04:55] <FluxD> hello is it possible to change you user name in ubuntu once its installed?
[04:56] <cynical> david__: no, movie player is actually called totem
[04:56] <timbobsteve> anyone running MoL (mac on linux) ?
[04:56] <david__> right
[04:56] <ubuntugrrrr> uhhh
[04:56] <ubuntugrrrr> it wont let me edit it
[04:56] <david__> ok, then i do have mplayer installed i believe, but i dont see it listed in the add/emove programs list
[04:56] <meheren> david_,cynical, hehe my bad
[04:56] <cynical> ha no worries :)
[04:56] <ubuntugrrrr> i typed "edit /etc/firefox/firefoxrc" into terminal...
[04:56] <jordan> timbobsteve, I tried to get that working a while ago, IMHO it isn't worth it ( and only works if you are on a PPC machine )
[04:57] <ubuntugrrrr> and got some error
[04:57] <ubuntugrrrr> oh brb i think i know the prob
[04:57] <meheren> WindDragon, it's done... it's ext 3 now
[04:57] <timbobsteve> jordan: yeh I am on my ibook G3 right now.... I tried compiling the Tiger compatible version.... didn't work for me :(
[04:57] <cynical> david__: easiest way to find out is to try and launch it
[04:57] <david__> i cant launch it
[04:57] <david__> how would i?
[04:57] <cynical> david__: commandline
[04:58] <cynical> david__: type mplayer into a terminal
[04:58] <david__> ok
[04:58] <timbobsteve> david__: open a terminal and type mplayer
[04:58] <WindDragon> meheren: ok then, what it will do is it will save your journal into ur usb so that u dont get always get a fresh thing when u boot from cd
[04:58] <FluxD> can someone tell me if it is possible to change you user name in ubuntu once its installed?
[04:58] <WindDragon> meheren: the next step
[04:58] <atarinox> hey can someone help me out...i'm trying to play some literati on games.yahoo.com, and i need the java plugin...will the java plugin in the repository work?
[04:58] <texas915> how can i get streaming radio  on my ubuntu that uses windows mebia player
[04:58] <cynical> FluxD: yes
[04:58] <jordan> FluxD, I know it's possible but I don't know how.
[04:58] <cynical> FluxD: administration > users and groups > your username
[04:58] <timbobsteve> FluxD: ypi could create a new user and then move the files and chown them
[04:59] <timbobsteve> you*
[04:59] <david__> ok yes i have mplayer installed, but nothing on the synaptic
[04:59] <cynical> FluxD: right click and go to properties
[04:59] <grndslm> ubuntugrrr, you need to type in "sudo nano /etc/firefox/firefoxrc" or replace nano with your fav. editor, gedit....doesn't matter
[04:59] <ubuntugrrrr> it worked!!!
[04:59] <meheren> WindDragon, ok go ahead... thx alot for helping me btw :)
[04:59] <grndslm> what'd i say?
[04:59] <MugginsM> ahhh, enough stability. time to start syncing with feisty
[04:59] <cynical> david__: then most likely it was installed from source or some other non standard way
[04:59] <cynical> david__: it shouldnt be a problem though, you could just create a launcher or add it to your video menu
[05:00] <FluxD> cynical my login name not the real name username is blanked out for me
[05:00] <meheren> MugginsM, wowa a bit early here aren't we?
[05:00] <WindDragon> meheren: with ur USB plug in, reboot ur mac (pressing C i believe to bood from cd) then from the menu....
[05:00] <MugginsM> meheren: I like living on the edge :)
[05:00] <cynical> FluxD: which one is blanked out?
[05:01] <meheren> WindDragon, it boot from cd automatically because thire is no other source to boot from...
[05:01] <FluxD> cynical username
[05:01] <defbyte> is there a linux data manager for reading offline ebooks that are packed ?
[05:01] <WindDragon> meheren: add the space and the word persistent at the end of the boot parameters.. (i think that would be F6 option)
[05:01] <grimthingcom> how are the ebooks packed
[05:01] <defbyte> where i can sort them into categories ?
[05:01] <Chadza> Can someone point me to why X isn't updating when I move up to edgy?
[05:01] <meheren> WindDragon, ok... is that all?  before i reboot
[05:02] <cynical> FluxD: hmm strange, its not for me. Not sure what you could do
[05:02] <defbyte> .zip or .tar.gz , the points is that i want one interface where i can select the type of book (programming, admin, ..)
[05:02] <prophet> Cynical i got this error http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=282545
[05:02] <WindDragon> meheren: yes. u may not see a difference, but to validate, try browsing a site, then reboot and see if the sire u browsed was saved in ur browser
[05:02] <jordan> Chadza, Did you "update-manager -c" or edit your sources.list and dist-upgrade?
[05:03] <FluxD> cynical anyway to sudo it and change it?
[05:03] <meheren> WindDragon, under my history?... ok then im rebooting
[05:03] <Chadza> jordan: I did the source edit.
[05:03] <grimthingcom> defbyte: Are the ebooks themselves in any particular format? or are they just html files/txt files tarred up?
[05:03] <cynical> FluxD: I tried to find the command to launch it from terminal, but I dont know what it is yet
[05:03] <cynical> prophet: did you try the suggestion in the thread?
[05:03] <Borat> hey guys, does anyone know the command for running the window boarder manager? like the emerald? this should go in my sessions.
[05:03] <WindDragon> meheen: yes. or u can just click on the address bar and u should see a dropdown list of the site
[05:03] <grndslm> does anybody here sync their TREO 650 with ubuntu?!?
[05:04] <wastrel> grndslm:  dapper or edgy
[05:04] <WindDragon> meheren: or just try changing the desktop image. it should save it and see it hte next tiem u boot
[05:04] <grndslm> wastrel, edgy...but any advice will help
[05:04] <wastrel> grndslm:  gnome or kde?  what's not working?
[05:04] <grndslm> i've read howtos out the rear, and nothing gets ttyUSB0 or 1 to show up
[05:04] <grndslm> gnome
[05:05] <Chadza> jordan: Should I do the update-manager -c instead?
[05:05] <cynical> FluxD: are you logged in as the user that you created during install?
[05:05] <grndslm> wastrel, what do you use for syncing?
[05:05] <tritium> grndslm: are these howtos specifically for Treos?  That model?
[05:05] <cynical> Chadza: that method worked for me
[05:05] <wastrel> sec
[05:05] <Chadza> jordan: Did you have a problem before with the sources.list?
[05:06] <jordan> Chadza, I have heard that that is the "official" way and editing and dist-upgrading is dangerous
[05:06] <Chadza> Well, lemme see if that works.
[05:06] <prophet> cynical
[05:06] <FluxD> cynical yes
[05:06] <cynical> prophet: yes?
[05:06] <grndslm> tritium, i've tried the tip on ubuntuguide.org and one that was for the visor module....
[05:06] <grndslm> but no, not specifically the 650
[05:06] <prophet> i fixed that error but not the hal.dll says its corrupt how can i reloaded it from the ubuntu envioremnt
[05:06] <prophet> or should i reinstall xp
[05:07] <wastrel> visor is for all palm os
[05:07] <jordan> Chadza, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades "Upgrading using apt-get -- NOT RECOMMENDED
[05:07] <jordan> Please note - this method is much less reliable. If you use this method, you MUST be prepared to fix problems manually, such as packages being unexpectedly removed. Using Update Manager (see above) is likely to be much less problematic. "
[05:07] <grndslm> wastrel...alright, the visor module should be loaded, tho...right?
[05:08] <FluxD> cynical will this work make a new username login using that then try to change the other username?
[05:08] <texas915> is there a admin user account
[05:08] <tritium> texas915: no, admin is a group for sudo priveleges
[05:08] <texas915> ok
[05:08] <texas915> so how can i do that
[05:08] <jordan> Chadza, Have you actually performed the dist-upgrade yet, or were you just looking at what packages got updated?
[05:08] <cynical> FluxD: I dont think so, you can try but I think the account you created during install is too priveledged for that
[05:09] <tritium> texas915: if you want a user to have sudo privelegs, add that user to the admin group
[05:09] <cynical> FluxD: you could try logging in as root and recreating it
[05:09] <grndslm>     * Insert the following line into the new file
[05:09] <grndslm> BUS="usb", SYSFS{product}="Palm Handheld*", KERNEL="ttyUSB*", NAME{ignore_remove}="pilot", MODE="666"
[05:09] <defbyte> can i open .chm files with linux ?
[05:09] <cynical> FluxD: like removing it and then adding another
[05:09] <dob1> defbyte: xchm
[05:09] <Chadza> jordan: I did it once, but it really messed everything up and a fix I tried killed the install.
[05:09] <cynical> prophet: follow the advice in the thread
[05:09] <WindDragon> defbyte: yes install gchm
[05:09] <Chadza> I rebuilt it and I'm trying the upgrade.
[05:09] <Chadza> The files apt-get missed were downloaded by this utility.
[05:09] <Chadza> It does appear to be working.
[05:09] <FluxD> cynical I dont want to delete it It has few settings and stuff I dont want to loose
[05:09] <meheren> WindDragon, ok test is passed
[05:10] <meheren> :)
[05:10] <WindDragon> meheren: did it worked?
[05:10] <Borat> someone solve this thread please, cookie will be awarded. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291783
[05:10] <Chadza> jordan: Well, I'm gonna exit this for the install.
[05:10] <meheren> yep :)
[05:10] <prophet> i did but then i got an error that hal.dll is missing or corupt
[05:10] <WindDragon> meheren: ok then
[05:10] <jordan> Chadza, Good luck
[05:10] <meheren> thx sooo much
[05:10] <WindDragon> meheren: np
[05:10] <meheren> you saved me like $200
[05:10] <grimthingcom> part
[05:10] <WindDragon> lol

[05:11] <meheren> arrg... well i used to be able to do that... hehe
[05:11] <rredd4> can i use apt-spy with dapper?
[05:11] <wastrel> grndslm:  do you see the treo being detected when you plug it in?  in /var/log/messages  ?
[05:12] <WindDragon> defbye: it shouldbe gnochm
[05:12] <grndslm> wastrel:  i could get it to mention usb-serial.c & visor.c, but it never assigned it a device node
[05:12] <audimage> I need help mounting a drive
[05:13] <grndslm> wastrel, and now it doesn't even say that when i try to hotsync
[05:13] <grndslm> too shoddy
[05:13] <WindDragon> audimage: what drive u need to mount?
[05:13] <audimage> it is a second partition on my harddrive
[05:14] <audimage> it is formatted, and partitioned, but i need to mount it
[05:14] <cynical> FluxD: ha I found it
[05:14] <WindDragon> what do u get with df -h?
[05:15] <cynical> FluxD: the command is usermod -l newlogin
=== Linuturk_ is now known as Linuturk
[05:15] <WindDragon> audimage: is ur unmounted drive present?
[05:15] <kronoman> question : I'm trying to build a new PC, tomorrow I'm going to buy the motherboard... I'm planning on buying ASUS, any ASUS will do it OK for ubuntu ?
[05:15] <LineOf7s> Pardon me for reducing the signal to noise ratio, but this is my first time here, and I just wanted to make comment that this has to be the most educational stream of information I've encountered all week.  :o)  Thankyou to all.
[05:16] <audimage> wind, yes it is, it is a partition
[05:16] <cynical> FluxD: you cant be logged in when renaming, you also have to rename the home directory by hand, it wont do it for you
[05:16] <grndslm> wastrel, actually...i think i'm going to try to reboot
[05:16] <cynical> kronoman: yes
[05:16] <wastrel> ok
[05:16] <WindDragon> audimage: what dev? /dev/????
[05:16] <audimage> kronoman: ubuntu has great drivers support
[05:16] <wastrel> sry on phone...
[05:16] <audimage> hd7
[05:17] <phpuser> alg sabe me informar como instala icones sem ser pelo teme
[05:17] <WindDragon> audimage: u can do sudo mount /dev/hd7 /media/yourowndirectory
[05:17] <kronoman> audimage: cynical : and any video card, or other stuff that usually comes onboard will work OK (network, sound) ?
[05:17] <wastrel> !pt | phpuser
[05:17] <ubotu> phpuser: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[05:17] <audimage> krono, nvidia is best
[05:17] <cynical> kronoman: yeah it should all work. Just in case, send me a link to the model you are considering
[05:17] <audimage> sound will be ok
[05:18] <cynical> well it depends
[05:18] <audimage> network will probably be alright
[05:18] <audimage> if it is integrated
[05:18] <ssJaken> hey what is the command for the autoupdate function, the one that goes onto the internet and looks for what programs you can install
[05:18] <audimage> wind, will taht add it so that it will auto mount on each boot?
[05:18] <phpuser> valeu
[05:18] <jordan> audimage, I would say intel is better driver wise, although the hardware is another thing entirely :)
[05:19] <kronoman> cynical: I was thinking about the ASUS K8N : http://www.asus.com/products4.aspx?modelmenu=1&model=233&l1=3&l2=14&l3=66
[05:19] <cynical> I'm using intel's p965 chipset, and its doing great so far
[05:19] <snoops> I picked up an asus, and beyond perfect support kronoman
[05:19] <WindDragon> audimage: if u want it mounted in ur boot-up. edit fstab and add a line to  mount it. /etc/fstab
[05:19] <audimage> i meant nvidia gpu
[05:19] <snoops> a a8n-sli premium to be exact
[05:19] <ssJaken> can anyone help me with that?
[05:19] <joeljkp> is there a switch to make command-line mplayer start paused?
[05:19] <cynical> kronoman: yeah an nvidia chipset will be fine, and realtek audio is very well supported
[05:20] <LineOf7s> ssJaken:  gksu "update-manager -c"
[05:20] <audimage> wind, this is what terminal said: mount: special device /dev/hd7 does not exist
[05:20] <ssJaken> thanks buddy
[05:20] <jordan> LineOf7s, Not sure he wants to update to edgy.
[05:20] <audimage> wind, in gparted it shows up as hd7
[05:20] <LineOf7s> No, perhaps not.
[05:20] <LineOf7s> Perhaps he meant aptitude or Synaptic...
[05:20] <ssJaken> i currently only have breezy badger cds
[05:21] <WindDragon> audimage: what do u have with sudo fdisk -l?
[05:21] <kronoman> cynical: snoops: many thanks for the info, I got offered a Asus with Via chipset model for less money, should work ?
[05:21] <audimage> wind, nevermind...it is hda7 not hd7
[05:21] <WindDragon> ok
[05:21] <jordan> ssJaken, Then you should NOT run "update-manager -c"
[05:21] <kronoman> which should I choose from this model list : http://www.asus.com/products2.aspx?l1=3&l2=14 ?
[05:21] <ssJaken> ok then what should i run?
[05:22] <WindDragon> kronoman: choose the onw without an ATI/Radeon graphics card. :)
[05:22] <cynical> kronoman: K8V-XE looks nice :)
[05:22] <kronoman> I was going to choose one without video card and use a Nvidia video card
[05:22] <romulo> hi, i have built some modules and they are sitting on my /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/, but i cant modprobe 'em, kernel say it cant find it, what should i do?
[05:22] <kronoman> this computer is not for me really, is for my gf's dad
[05:22] <audimage> wind, what should the line look like that i will add to fstab
[05:22] <slvmchn> how do i set a program to autorun at startdup?
[05:22] <jordan> ssJaken, Are you trying to get new software for breezy, or upgrade to Edgy?
[05:22] <kronoman> so must be perfect, or I will die a horrible death
[05:23] <WindDragon> audimage: wait a while
[05:23] <ssJaken> upgrade to edgy
[05:23] <MugginsM> I see the kernel devs being as user friendly as always :)
[05:23] <MugginsM> "this is not a software problem, contact your hardware vendor"
[05:23] <jordan> ssJaken, To upgrade to Edgy you should probably got to Dapper then Edgy.
[05:23] <WindDragon> btw, what's the file format?
[05:23] <audimage> ext3
[05:24] <jordan> ssJaken, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[05:24] <ssJaken> jordan: thanks buddy
[05:24] <jordan> ssJaken, np
[05:24] <kronoman> and, this question is for my computer, I have a old gamepad, one of those that goes plugged into the sound card thingy... there is something in the GUI to activate it ? so I can use it with ZSNES ? I know how to activate it using the console, but a GUI switch would be cool
[05:24] <ssJaken> so i cant use automatix to upgrade to edgy?
[05:24] <slvmchn> how does one autorun programs at startup?
[05:24] <jordan> ssJaken, No.
[05:25] <joeljkp> is there a way to make mplayer just show a specific frame?
[05:25] <ssJaken> jordan: ok thanks ill check that site
[05:25] <wastrel> !automatix
[05:25] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:25] <romulo> ssJaken, just use update-manager -c -d
[05:25] <wastrel> i wonder what percentage of the broken edgy upgrades are a result of automatix
[05:25] <jordan> romulo, No he is on breezy
[05:25] <WindDragon> audimage: /dev/hda7        /media/yourowndirectory     ext3    defaults        0       2
[05:25] <romulo> oooooh
[05:25] <slvmchn> !autorun
[05:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about autorun - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:26] <slvmchn> !startup
[05:26] <ubotu> To add programs to start up when you log into your Gnome session https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup
[05:26] <ssJaken> i just found my lappy with ubuntu on it and its breezy
[05:26] <audimage> wind, so ext3 should be under type?
[05:26] <audimage> and options will be default
[05:26] <romulo> jordan, what happens if he replace /etc/apt/sources.list "breezy" by "edgy", apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade?
[05:26] <WindDragon> yes
[05:26] <audimage> thanks, i'll give it a shot real quick
[05:26] <audimage> *rebooting*
[05:26] <jordan> romulo, Plus, if feisty where in alpha that command would have updated him to that, the -d switch looks for alpha / beta releases also
[05:27] <jordan> romulo, Probably very bad things
[05:27] <pip> hello
[05:27] <hoarycripple> when using gnu screen with Eterm, I am getting garbled characters especially line drawing characters.  any ideas on how to fix this?
[05:27] <Arrick> someone with some brains want to help me install make on breezy, and also perl?
[05:27] <pip> is there any steam fans ?
[05:27] <jordan> romulo, That is known to break things even if you are just upgrading from Dapper.
[05:27] <romulo> yeh i know
[05:27] <kronoman> Arrick: you can use synaptic to search for make and perl, and install them, and thats all
[05:28] <wastrel> hoarycripple:  export LANG=C   mebby
[05:28] <jordan> Arrick, For make, apt-get install build-essentials
[05:28] <Arrick> kronoman, its a console server
[05:28] <tritium> jordan: no "s" at the end
[05:28] <ssJaken> thanks all
[05:28] <audimage> Thanks wind, worked perfectly
[05:28] <WindDragon> kk
[05:28] <WindDragon> np
[05:28] <kronoman> Arrick: well, then apt-get make I think
[05:29] <hoarycripple> wastrel, thanks alot...that works great.  now why does that work?
[05:29] <jordan> tritium, Sorry.
[05:29] <Phlosten> Arrick: apt-get install build-essential should get you make
[05:29] <Phlosten> Arrick: apt-cache search perl
[05:29] <tritium> jordan: don't be sorry, buddy, just letting you know :)
[05:29] <Arrick> cool thanks
[05:29] <Arrick> y
[05:29] <wastrel> hoarycripple:  the terminal prog wasn't setting a terminal type so screen didn't know how to handle non-ascii character codes
[05:29] <kronoman> Arrick: check the dselect utility
[05:29] <wastrel> or something like that
[05:30] <kronoman> Arrick: with dselect you can do almost the same as synaptic, but from text mode
[05:30] <wastrel> hoarycripple:  make sure eterm is opening login shells
[05:30] <jujujuju> 
[05:30] <retrtrt>

[05:32] <crimsun> RageMax: because from dapper, we learned that it can be fairly useless on many chipsets.
[05:32] <retrtrt> :-)
[05:32] <prophet> cynical
[05:32] <retrtrt> @pip
[05:33] <cynical> prophet: yes?

[05:33] <RageMax> crimsun: so make everything else hard to configure because of that? heh
[05:33] <cynical> prophet: wait you did what?
[05:33] <hoarycripple> wastrel, will do.  thanks alot.  now one more problem to solve and I can continue to use ubuntu :)
[05:33] <RageMax> it's the only way I was able to get WPA to actually work
[05:33] <pingveno> I'm having some difficulties upgrading to Edgy. Dpkg returns 1, but without an error message. The whole process then stops.
[05:33] <cynical> prophet: "rebuilt the bootfg" what do you mean by that?
[05:33] <prophet> i fallowed this http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_haldll_missing.htm

[05:34] <prophet> is there a way to replace the hal.dll from ubuntu since the HD is hooked up tot he PC?
[05:34] <cynical> prophet: not a good idea
[05:34] <retrtrt> wine does also not work
[05:34] <cynical> prophet: ubuntu doesnt have a hal.dll
[05:34] <prophet> i can get it from another computer
[05:34] <retrtrt> because it also says glx is missing
[05:34] <cynical> prophet: the answer to fixing your problem was in that thread you linked
[05:34] <prophet> what aprt
[05:34] <prophet> part
[05:34] <pip> retrtrt, so you can not install wine though you wish to use it ?
[05:35] <cynical> prophet: there was a section pertaining to grub.conf
[05:35] <kronoman> question : does ubuntu includes some support for the gamepad ? or the console is the only way to get it working ?
[05:35] <retrtrt> i can install it, but i cant use it pip ;)
[05:35] <kronoman> I mean, a old school gamepad , one of those that goes plugged into the sound card, no usb
[05:35] <cynical> prophet: if you send me the link again I can tell you exactly what needs to be done
[05:35] <hoarycripple> how can i get identd working properly?  i installed midentd, enabled it in xinetd and still irrsi tells me that i don't have any ident response
[05:35] <pip> retrtrt, why ? just wine program.exe
[05:35] <prophet> http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_haldll_missing.htm
[05:35] <pip> retrtrt, easy to use ,and check if your installation of it is OK
[05:35] <retrtrt> pip, it keeps telling me "no glx blabla"
[05:36] <pip> retrtrt, how did you installed it ?
[05:36] <cynical> retrtrt: do you drivers for your graphics card installed?

[05:37] <prophet> but whe i select the windows xp and it starts to load it says that a hal.dll is missing or corpt
[05:37] <pip> retrtrt, did you install wine with source package ?

[05:43] <retrtrt> i did, jordan
[05:43] <cynical> retrtrt: well if you run out of ideas, I would try getting the driver from nvidia's website and compiling it

[05:59] <iter> could easily be automated

[06:15] <morgue> how can I unmount an iso?
[06:15] <dnite> umount /mnt/point
[06:15] <dnite> ?
[06:16] <morgue> i used sudo mount -t iso9660 -o ro,user,loop to mount it
[06:16] <dnite> morgue, just use sudo umount /wherever/its/mounted
[06:16] <mseve> View?
[06:17] <dnite> mseve, that's a kernel option, i believe..
[06:17] <mseve> K.
[06:17] <bimberi> Arrick: sorry, i've had a bit of a look around, but i'm not a perl user.  It looks like a bunch of perl libraries are required but idk exactly which packages
[06:17] <dnite> i've never tried it in ubuntu, but i know usually u have to set a video setting in your grub file
[06:17] <rahmiel> mseve, sorry, misread your question.
[06:17] <Arrick> bimberi, yeah, they arent in there, but I know they used to be, because I used to have them all installed
[06:17] <mseve> I remember about 18 years ago when VGA cards first came out, I could run my DOS at 132x60 tesxt mode
[06:18] <dnite> mseve, google for it.. there's a video= setting that goes at the end of your kernel line in grub.conf .. i'm just not sure how it goes exactly
[06:18] <mseve> I would image being 18 years later, an OS as sophisticated as Linux should be able to the same thing.
[06:18] <morgue> dnite, I get "the device is busy", it's wine asking me to insert disk 2
[06:18] <bense> anyone else having problems w/ not being able to move beep-media-player all the way to the top of their desktop?
[06:18] <BSCH> hello, everyone
[06:18] <bense> there's a 1 pixel wide area where it will not let me ove i
[06:19] <dnite> morgue, ah.. um.. i'm not sure how to get around that then... i know there's gotta be a way.. cedega gets around that somehow..
[06:19] <mseve> I've spent the last hour Googling for it.  No luck, all lings point to changing Xorg desktop rez.
[06:19] <morgue> cedega?
[06:19] <dnite> mseve, hold on
[06:19] <mseve> K.  Thanks.
[06:19] <mseve> I did finally get dual monitor to work.
[06:19] <mseve> \o/
[06:20] <kronoman> I have noticed a problem with serial mouse  in previous versions of ubuntu , what about 6.06 & 6.10 ?
[06:20] <dnite> morgue, cedega is a commercial port of wine that's made more for gaming.. they have an installation helper that helps u install your games and it gets around that mounting problem...
[06:20] <mseve> I'm using USB, sorry.
[06:20] <dnite> morgue, costs $5 a month though
[06:20] <rahmiel> mseve, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
[06:20] <BSCH> how to play online video in totem?
[06:20] <overlord> does ubuntu have a default firewall or something that blocks out port??
[06:20] <mseve> I'll be using Cedega here in a minute, will be able to help if you need.
[06:21] <morgue> dnite, there has to be a way :(
[06:21] <BSCH> which path is the mplayer
[06:21] <BSCH> codecs
[06:21] <dnite> morgue, i know there has to be a way. i'm just unsure of it. i don't do a lot of gaming in linux.. so i rarely have to install things from multiple cd's
[06:22] <mseve> dnite: still holding, anything interesting yet? =)
[06:22] <jercos> BSCH, /usr/local/lib/codecs?
[06:22] <bimberi> overlord: no
[06:22] <rahmiel> sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup will allow you to alter your console font.
[06:22] <rahmiel> mseve ^
[06:22] <BSCH> local? the offical src?
[06:22] <dnite> /usr/lib/codecs
[06:22] <kronoman> overlord: try firestarter for firewall gui is pretty nice

[06:23] <bretzel> Hi there, I try to change a gnome ( gtk2 theme ) but widgets such buttons, and others does not changes as the theme is supposed to be... what is missing ?

[06:23] <dnite> try there..
[06:23] <kronoman> question : ubuntu 6.06 uses ALSA as default sound system ?
[06:24] <dnite> i come from gentoo .. so i'm not positive the information will work from there, but it should. it's still grub.
[06:24] <crimsun> kronoman: we've used alsa by default ever since warty (4.10)
[06:24] <waseem> hi when i try to forcefully mount a cd on my computer the terminal doesnt return anything and the cd is never mounted
[06:25] <bretzel> Hi there, I try to change a gnome ( gtk2 theme ) but widgets such buttons, and others does not changes as the theme is supposed to be... what is missing ? ( my sys: gnome 2.16, ubuntu edgy )
[06:25] <dnite> just copy your current kernel entry in your grub.conf to a new entry and change the kernel line.. so if it doesn't work you can just boot your current kernel again
[06:25] <kronoman> crimsun: any idea why the joystick port is not active ? my joystick don't works
[06:25] <kronoman> I think that ubuntu should provide a way to use joysticks easy to use
[06:25] <mseve> rahmiel: Thanks.  Tried it, doesn't allow to alter physical text resolution.
[06:25] <kronoman> (fill a bug?)
[06:25] <waseem> hi is there any reason why my cdrom cant be mounted?
[06:26] <iter> ok another samba/AD question:
[06:26] <crimsun> kronoman: which card do you have?
[06:26] <iter> why would samba not accept password
[06:26] <crimsun> sound card, that is, kronoman
[06:26] <rahmiel> mseve, Allows text type and size, somewhat, but that's the only thing I could find right off... might want to search the forums again.

[06:26] <mike__> how come none of the beryl links work for amd64?
[06:26] <waseem> what should i type to mount a cd?
[06:26] <mike__> for the packages
[06:26] <mike__> deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy main-amd64 is dead for me
[06:26] <kronoman> crimsun: a CMPCI 8738, I know how to activate it manually to use the gamepad, but would be cool if new versions would detect it
[06:26] <mseve> dnite: so Ubuntu uses Grud?  I assume this as I cannot find lilo.
[06:26] <morgue> anyone knows how to install a game that has multiple cds?
[06:27] <kronoman> I must add the line options snd-cmipci joystick_port=1 to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
[06:27] <waseem> better yet, how do you even mount the cds in the first place
[06:27] <mike__> hmmm link works, but doesnt work in apt for some reason
[06:27] <rahmiel> morgue, what are you using?
[06:27] <crimsun> kronoman: that's not detectable currently, hence why you have to pass a parameter.
[06:27] <david__> how can i get a compiler?
[06:27] <morgue> rahmiel, what do you mean?
[06:27] <dnite> mseve, yes.. ubuntu uses grub...
[06:27] <rahmiel> morgue, wine, cedega?
[06:27] <mseve> rahmiel: Thanks.  Every bit helps, and I appreciate your enthusiastic assistance. =)
[06:27] <morgue> rahmiel, wine
[06:27] <czedlitz> anyone have a Toshiba M115 laptop by chance?
[06:28] <dnite> mseve, your looking for /boot/grub/grub.conf
[06:28] <waseem> so im guessing everyone here has never used a cdrom drive
[06:28] <waseem> alright thats fine.
[06:28] <rahmiel> david__, for what language exactly? gcc is for c and cpp.
[06:28] <mike__> Failed to fetch http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/dists/edgy/main-amd64/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  404 Not Found
[06:28] <david__> im trying to compile wince source
[06:28] <mike__> wtf is the link given on the main wiki wrong or something?
[06:28] <david__> *wine
[06:28] <mseve> dnite: Thanks.  at this point I was leaning in that direction. =)
[06:29] <rahmiel> morgue, I'd honestly suggest cedega, but that's just me. What problems is it giving you when changing cds?
[06:29] <morgue> rahmiel, it says that it can't be unmounted
[06:29] <Necrogami> Cedega is god if you want to play games on Linux
[06:29] <Sloggerkhan> oh yes, I've never used a cd... what are they?
[06:29] <mike__> can anyone link me to some working nvidia nad beryl packages for amd64?
[06:29] <mike__> or repos rather
[06:29] <u221e> Can I use the 6.06 CD to do a network install of 6.10?
[06:29] <waseem> wow, can someone please tell me why i cant mount a damn cd
[06:29] <waseem> i mean, seriously.
[06:29] <kronoman> crimsun: maybe the joystick package should be installed by default too
[06:29] <morgue> rahmiel, I mounted cd1, run setup.exe and the installation got to 50% now it's asking me for disk 2, I mount disk 2 but when I click OK on the installation it promts me again for disk 2
[06:30] <xen> Ok....stupid question, but I can't find a bloody answer on the net....how do I get my userlist showing in xchat?
[06:30] <crimsun> kronoman: request they be added, then.
[06:30] <Lilandra> hi! what program does one use to take screencaps?
[06:30] <kronoman> crimsun: also I have a script for init.d to start/stop the joystick
[06:30] <morgue> rahmiel, I check on the folder where it's supposed to be mounting the iso and the files are there, I can browse and I know it's disk 2..
[06:30] <Lilandra> screenshots i should say
[06:30] <mike__> already had to install the nvidia drivers from nvidia's installer because none of the links seem to be working for the repos in /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:30] <david__> so where are the compilers? i dont see any available in synaptic and that seems weird for a lynux distro
[06:30] <WindDragon> mike_: search for posting of pricechild in the forum regarding ur probelm
[06:30] <ndowens> waseem: does it tell u the error
[06:30] <waseem> nope
[06:30] <kronoman> crimsun: ok, I will try to see first how to get in touch with developers, and maybe help with the old-school joystick stuff
[06:30] <xen> david__: apt-get install build-essential
[06:30] <crimsun> kronoman: you're talking with one.
[06:30] <VoX> Hi, I can browse a windows network share with nautilus, i can mount the share from cli, but when i try to access the share, i get "permisision denied" no matter what i try to do at the mount point (ls, ls -la, du -h, etc etc)  any ideas?
[06:30] <ndowens> waseem: check ur /etc/fstab and see if it is correct
[06:30] <kronoman> crimsun: any idea if USB joysticks are OK ? I didn't had the opportunity to test one
[06:30] <waseem> what happens is it skips a line, the cursor blinks, and i cant ctrl c the thing
[06:30] <mseve> dnite: where might I find grub?
[06:31] <crimsun> kronoman: I don't know; no one has slipped me test hardware.

[06:33] <ty> nothing
[06:33] <danielw> I installed and compiled the nvidia beta driver but i have to rmmod nvidia before i can start X

[06:33] <Josh43> Does anyone know how to run a different GUI on each of 2 monitors?
[06:33] <Gumby> fwcutter used to work here then it stopped for some reason.  I have no problems getting ndiswrapper working
[06:33] <danielw> any ideas on what i could do to fix that??
[06:33] <ty> Lilandra:  What guide do you use for ndiswrapper?
[06:33] <dnite> morgue, do u have your cdroms set to auto mount ?? is there an 'auto' option in your /etc/fstab for your cdroms ?
[06:33] <Lilandra> ty: i have bcm4306 on my powerbook and got it working
[06:33] <ndowens> waseem: what kind of cd is it
[06:33] <Gumby> IIRC I had to compile ndiswrapper from source to get it working once
[06:33] <ty> Lilandra:  With what?
[06:33] <waseem> its a quakeIII cd
[06:33] <Lilandra> ty: i didn't use ndiswrapper, i extracted from an apple file on osx
[06:34] <waseem> its for linux though
[06:34] <waseem> so it should work
[06:34] <dnite> morgue, or wait.. you were using an iso image...
[06:34] <ty> lilandra:  How did you install it?
[06:34] <morgue> dnite, I tried isos and cds
[06:34] <rahmiel> morgue, sorry. Did you try doing a unmount /media/cdrom while installing to allow it to eject?
[06:34] <morgue> dnite, they do auto mount themselvs
[06:34] <ty> Lilandra:  My wireless light isn't even turning on
[06:34] <morgue> rahmiel, yeah, it says device is busy
[06:34] <Sloggerkhan> trying to keep up with all this is dizzying... such volume of messages.
[06:34] <Maurox> Hello, Does someone get 5.1 sound with SIS SI7012 chip C-MEDIA CMI9761 ??
[06:34] <Lilandra> ty: well there's a file on OSX, AppleAirport2 which has the firmware and i used fwcutter to extract the firmware and store it in /lib/firmware and then did a modprobe
[06:35] <Gumby> rahmiel: umount (not unmount)
[06:35] <ndowens> waseem: did u try doin like this : mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /media/cdrom
[06:35] <dnite> morgue, try removing the auto option from your fstab.. it's been reported that this helps when you need to remove a cd durring install
[06:35] <ty> Lilandra:  Do you have a guide to that at all?
[06:35] <xen> anyone know how to make the xchat userlist appear?
[06:35] <morgue> dnite, how do I do that?
[06:35] <rahmiel> grumby, thanks, typo. :)
[06:35] <Lilandra> ty: it's kinda sketchy...hold on
[06:35] <Gumby> grumby?
[06:35] <Lilandra> ty: but i had the firmware in a file...not sure abot in windows
[06:35] <waseem> ndowens: no i havent, but i just tried it and that wont work either
[06:35] <ty> Lilandra:  I'm pretty sure I know where to find driver in windows
[06:36] <rahmiel> gumby, see what I mean? Needing some sleep.
[06:36] <dnite> morgue, gksudo gedit /etc/fstab  ... check the line where your cdrom drive is, if there is 'auto' anywhere in that line, remove it.

[06:39] <morgue> dnite, ok I'm there, which one should I unckeck?

[06:39] <morgue> removable media or drive?

[06:39] <morgue> dnite, drives or removable media?
[06:40] <dnite> morgue, i'm not really sure.. maybe all of them on that first tab?? try that and if it doesn't work, your problem lies elsewhere and you can just turn them all back on
[06:40] <ndowens> waseem: that is weird. is iso9660 compiled in the kernel

[06:40] <morgue> dnite, kk, should I try with ISOs or CDs?
[06:40] <waseem> ndowens: i dont even know what that is, how can i find out
[06:40] <dnite> morgue, i'd try the cd's
[06:41] <aj_> anyone get an error with kdm about loading default ubuntu theme?
[06:41] <mseve> dnite: grub.conf can't be found.
[06:41] <morgue> dnite, kk
[06:41] <aj_> *gdm
[06:42] <morgue> dnite, the solution I've been seeing around the web says to run setup.exe from outside the directory it is, but when I try that it won't even start up
[06:42] <dnite> mseve, hm .. i'm sorry. i just noticed that. i'm not exactly sure what file ubuntu uses to configure grub, then...
[06:43] <drivera90> I put Live CD in. I reboot. I start installation. Step 1, check. Step 2, check. Step 3, the keyboard thing... fail. Gets stuck forever and a day.
[06:43] <firebird619> Could someone tell me where I can find a list of the default entries of sources.list. Something happened to mine and packages like opera, certain MythTV packages, aren't there and they always used to be with the default entries and multiverse and universe added.
[06:43] <dnite> morgue, you definately need to start the installer from outside of the mounted drive.. because mount never lets u umount when your still in that directory
[06:43] <mseve> Woohoo!!  I stumped the expert!  \o/   =) =P
[06:44] <mseve> What do I win?
[06:44] <Arrick> Is there a way to bridge two NICs in ubuntu breezy?
[06:44] <ejm> !kernel
[06:44] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[06:44] <morgue> dnite, but it won't even start the setup if I don't run it from the directory it is...
[06:44] <dnite> mseve, lol .. i wouldn't call myself an expert.. i've only been using ubuntu about a week x=)
[06:44] <mseve> !text
[06:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about text - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:44] <mseve> !console
[06:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about console - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:44] <ckx> soo... if I'm using integrated graphics on a motherboard that doesn't come with linux drives by default... am I pretty much screwed >.>;?
[06:44] <mseve> !charter mode
[06:45] <Arrick> mseve, what are you tryign to figure out?
[06:45] <VoX> Hi, I can browse a windows network share with nautilus, i can mount the share from cli, but when i try to access the share, i get "permisision denied" no matter what i try to do at the mount point (ls, ls -la, du -h, etc etc)  any ideas?
[06:45] <wastrel> !msgthebot
[06:45] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[06:45] <mseve> I'm just having fun with ya dnite.  =)
[06:45] <dnite> morgue, you can't do a wine d:\setup.exe or something like that?
[06:45] <dnite> mseve, i know.. i'm lookin for where the grub.conf is.. not finding anything though
[06:45] <morgue> dnite, this starts setup    :/cdrom$ wine setup.exe    this doesn't       :/$ wine /cdrom/setup.exe
[06:46] <morgue> dnite, see the difference?
[06:46] <dnite> morgue, try using the windows drive letter..
[06:46] <lightfoot> http://www.getdeb.net/home.php?release=Dapper just came across this unofficial dapper repository
[06:46] <dnite> wine d:\setup.exe
[06:46] <morgue> dnite, how do I know the drive letter?
[06:46] <ty> doesn't seem to be working lilandra
[06:46] <Lilandra> ty: what happens? :-(
[06:47] <dnite> morgue, *shrug* not sure.. again.. i don't game very much in linux so i don't install many of them via cd.. but i'm pretty sure wine defaults to using drive d: as the cdrom ...
[06:47] <drivera90> I put Live CD in. I reboot. I start installation. Step 1, check. Step 2, check. Step 3, the keyboard thing... fail. Gets stuck forever and a day. Thoughts? Also, during the loading of the Live CD, the hardware driver something something always is "failed".
[06:47] <ty> lilandra: don't know where to get those drivers
[06:47] <ty> Tried copying them from my windows files to no avail
[06:47] <Lilandra> ty: when i installed edgy and reinstalled osx, i couldn't use the driver anymore and had to use the old version i saved
[06:47] <morgue> dnite, wine: cannot find 'd:setup.exe'
[06:47] <Lilandra> ty: would my driver work? from apple?
[06:47] <ty> Lilandra; you have a copy?
[06:47] <mseve> Arrick:  About 18 years ago when I bought my first Trident 1Meg VGA card, it supported a DOS(console) text or character resolution of 132x60 characters, Would it possible to set Ubuntu up to do the same thing?
[06:47] <ty> Maybe?
[06:47] <grigora> does anyone know how to check to see whether -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-* has certain glyphs?
[06:47] <ty> Worth a shot
[06:47] <Lilandra> hold on
[06:47] <morgue> dnite, I tried h: which I think it is, didn't do a thing
[06:48] <Arrick> mseve, not sure on that one
[06:48] <ty> lilandra: sudo bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware ~/Desktop/BCMWL5.INF
[06:48] <Asc_> Anybody got the Ion3 fonts working in Edgy?
[06:48] <ty> Extracting firmware from this file is IMPOSSIBLE. (e.g. too old/new)
[06:48] <morgue> dnite, at least with h: it didn't tell me cannot find 'h:...
[06:48] <ty> there is the error
[06:48] <dnite> morgue, try h:\setup.exe .. the back slash might be needed..
[06:49] <drivera90> Any help? I've been trying to install Ubuntu for a while now.
[06:49] <eseong> hies all
[06:49] <ty> blake6489:  How is ak these days?
[06:49] <eseong> sorry for the noob question.
[06:49] <mseve> Arrick: If I resize the terminal in X, a little box shows up in the middle, telling what character res the window supports, so I would image that I'm not the only one aware of this task.
[06:49] <eseong> i would like to ask, my ubuntu 5.0.1 lib folder is at ?
[06:49] <morgue> dnite, I was trying with it
[06:49] <Lilandra> ty: i got that alot too. and in fact the file i have gets some that is too old but some that is good
[06:49] <Lilandra> did u get my pm?
[06:49] <dnite> morgue, i just found this.. type ls ~/.wine/dosdevices
[06:49] <mnepton> drivera90: have you tried the alternate CD?
[06:49] <CientificoLoco> How do I install sunbird? I have edgy
[06:49] <dnite> morgue,  it lists all the 'drives' that windows uses
[06:50] <micahcowan> This chan was highlighted when I got back from a phonecall... someone ping me?
[06:50] <mseve> ...and I can only hope that this would settable for bash.
[06:50] <ty> lilandra:  so which one do I use and where do I get it?
[06:50] <drivera90> Nope. I just ordered the ShipIt thing.
[06:50] <eseong> i would like to paste some .lib file into my common/share folder !
[06:50] <eseong> can anyone help ?
[06:50] <morgue> dnite, c:  d:  d::  e:  e::  h:  hlm-mvp5a  z:
[06:50] <Lilandra> ty: i used this: http://lilandra.com/wireless/AppleAirPort2
[06:50] <blake6489> ty: well, we got first snow bout a week ago- so everyone is learning how to drive again
[06:50] <eseong> currently i get this error , ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libZThread-2.3.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[06:50] <morgue> mvp is what I'm trying
[06:50] <mseve> ...or whatever generates the text in the console.
[06:50] <jordan> drivera90, have you tried the alternate install CD?
[06:50] <CientificoLoco> How do I install sunbird? I have edgy
[06:50] <Arrick> mseve, I would think not, I just dont normally use any linux, just happen to be here tonight to get some info
[06:51] <drivera90> No sir. How do I get my hands on that?
[06:51] <mseve> Ahh.
[06:51] <Arrick> I wasn just gonna let you know that they dont like the bot being played with
[06:51] <lightfoot> http://www.getdeb.net/home.php?release=Dapper just came across this unofficial dapper repository
[06:51] <dnite> morgue, i'm really not sure.. try each of those drives.. just make sure your not cd'd to your cdrom directory when you run setup or i'm pretty sure it won't let you umount..
[06:51] <micahcowan> mseve, you're talking about the system console?
[06:51] <FluxD> hello where can I find the logs that outputs from the crash reports?
[06:51] <jordan> drivera90, Do you have a fast enough connection to download it ( I'll find the link ) ?
[06:51] <mseve> But if I could do it 18 years ago in MS-DOS, one would think such a simple thing could be done in an OS 18 years newer.
[06:51] <dnite> morgue, if that doesn't work, i'd hit up google some more.. cause i'm outta ideas.. sorry bud.
[06:52] <chx> hi. i would like to rebuild an initrd, not to be used on the same machine
[06:52] <mseve> But then as with everything, cool features are lost in exchange for mediovcrity.
[06:52] <chx> where can i find a tutorial?
[06:52] <eseong> hies....
[06:52] <mseve> Yes, the system console.
[06:52] <eseong> currently i get this error , ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libZThread-2.3.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory , is there any solution ?
[06:52] <VoX> Hi, I can browse a windows network share with nautilus, i can mount the share from cli, but when i try to access the share, i get "permisision denied" no matter what i try to do at the mount point (ls, ls -la, du -h, etc etc)  any ideas?
[06:52] <Lilandra> ty: does it work?
[06:52] <ty> doesnt look like it
[06:52] <drivera90> If it's small enough to fit a CD, I can get it like, overnight.
[06:52] <micahcowan> mseve, you can. Edit the file /boot/grub/menu.lst (as root), and add the option "vga=ask" to the commented line that starts "kopt=" (leave it commented).
[06:52] <Lilandra> ty: does it not extract anything?
[06:52] <morgue> dnite, I've been looking in google, my problem is provably that I'm not able to load the setup.exe from outside the directory (which I find weird), but I haven't been lucky
[06:53] <eseong> currently i get this error , ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libZThread-2.3.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory , is there any solution ?
[06:53] <Lilandra> ty: rebooting
[06:53] <nmYoDUH> so when can we expect Ubuntu to collaborate with Microsoft?
[06:53] <nmYoDUH> =D
[06:53] <jordan> drivera90, It's 600 meg
[06:53] <Arrick> never
[06:53] <DBO> !ubotu grub > prophet
[06:53] <mseve> K. on it. thanks...
[06:53] <Arrick> hey DBO how goes it
[06:53] <micahcowan> mseve, then run update-grub, and when you restart, you will be presented with a menu of choices. When you find one you like, change the "vga=ask" bit to "vga=3" (or whatever menu choice number you want), run update-grub again, and reboot.
[06:54] <DBO> hi Arrick
[06:54] <dnite> morgue, the only other thing i can think of.. is forget the console.. just go to your cd drive in gnome/nautilus and double click the setup.exe .. ubuntu should use wine to open it.. and then you should be able to just close the cd window..
[06:54] <Arrick> hey, you seen Idle0ne in the last year?
[06:54] <Keyseir> How do I determine if I can hook up a USB 2.0 device to my computer?
[06:54] <jordan> drivera90, http://ftp.wwc.edu/pub/mirrors/ubuntu-releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
[06:54] <Arrick> hei site is down now
[06:54] <Arrick> his
[06:54] <DBO> Arrick, nope
[06:54] <Arrick> man I would like to get ahold of him, he sets up the best proftpd I have ever seen lol
[06:54] <eseong> anyone could help me on this error ?
[06:55] <eseong> currently i get this error , ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libZThread-2.3.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory , is there any solution ?
[06:55] <Keyseir> How do I determine if I can hook up a USB 2.0 device to my computer?
[06:55] <rahmiel> morgue, or have wine ready in the console and drag the setup.exe into the terminal to pull the path.
=== kerwonz_ is now known as kerwonz
[06:55] <jordan> Keyseir, I am not sure what you mean, could you refrase the question?
[06:55] <morgue> rahmiel, didn't work :(
[06:56] <morgue> rahmiel,  wine '/media/cdrom0/setup.exe' was the path I got from draggin
[06:56] <Keyseir> I'm trying to determine if I can use an external hard drive that lists its interface as "USB 2.0". My computer is a couple years old, and I'm not sure if it's USB 2.0 compatible. Is there an easy way to check through ubuntu?
[06:56] <Keyseir> Or, what should I do?
[06:56] <studiophi> (Request) Can anybody explain to a ubuntu newbie how to install gaim 1.5.x on Edgy?
[06:57] <jordan> Keyseir, Plug it in. See how fast you can copy a file to it.
[06:57] <dnite> studiophi, gaim 2.0 should be installed, why do u need 1.5.x ?
[06:57] <micahcowan> Keyseir, I may be wrong, but I think most USB 2.0 interfaces can downgrade to 1.0.
=== j_ack_ is now known as j_ack
[06:57] <rahmiel> morgue, I don't know what to tell you either. : / ... Honestly, I suck it up and pay for cedega for the most part.
[06:57] <iter> wrong
[06:57] <iter> ALL usb 2.0 can work at 1.0 speeds
[06:57] <morgue> rahmiel, 1 minute brb
[06:57] <studiophi> dnite, because a plugin I need to install is not available yet for gaim 2.0
[06:58] <Keyseir> So it's unanimous, USB 2.0 devices will work with a USB 1.0 computer?
[06:58] <WindDragon> yes
[06:58] <micahcowan> iter, heh: all includes most ^_^
[06:58] <Keyseir> Thanks guys
[06:58] <iter> ;)
[06:58] <mseve> Thanks all!   See ya all later.  Thanks dnite, Arrick, micahcowan   o/
[06:58] <studiophi> Keysir, that is not my experience. All of my usb 2.0 external drives work fine on my 1.0 pc
[06:58] <micahcowan> bye mseve
[06:58] <dnite> studiophi, ah.. i haven't figure out how to apt-get install an older version either.. so if you figure it out, let me know.. you might have to just compile it yourself and use dpkg or something to install .. hold on.. lemme try and find something
[06:58] <dnite> mseve, did u figure it out?
[06:59] <CientificoLoco> How do I install sunbird? I have edgy
[06:59] <jordan> drivera90, Just so you know, the Alternate install CD is not as user friendly because it is a text mode installer, but it isn't all that hard either
[06:59] <Keyseir> studiophi: So you're agreeing with everyone? Everyone has told me that USB 2 devices will Indeed work on USB 1 computer.
[06:59] <studiophi> dnite, I've tried the hand-compile, but gaim 1.5 requires gtk+ and gtk+'s dependencies, which have been a royal PITA to install
[06:59] <mseve> Not sure, but don't want to reboot right now.  Got some work to finish, will reboot tomorrow, and let ya know.
[06:59] <mseve> You on most nights?
[06:59] <drivera90> Do I have to know fancy linux commands or something?
[07:00] <dnite> mseve, ok.. lemme know what you find out.. i'm curious where the grub configuration is now..
[07:00] <Lilandra> ty?
[07:00] <rahmiel> CientificoLoco, try http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=278206&highlight=sunbird
[07:00] <mseve> K, will do.
[07:00] <mseve> o/
[07:00] <dnite> studiophi, ah.. that makes sense.. i'm not sure then..
[07:00] <studiophi> Keyseir, yes. I have 2 generic HDs, 250 gb and 160 gb, and a 20gb 4th gen ipod. all work fine on my ubuntu machine
[07:00] <zipzo> im new to installing from source, on thise page, which filkes are the source? (wine) http://source.winehq.org/source/?v=wine-0.9.16
[07:00] <jordan> drivera90, No, it's all menus
[07:01] <drivera90> I'll live.
[07:01] <waseem> Hi how do i look up the graphics card i have in my system
[07:01] <rahmiel> zipzo, You don't have to install wine from source, but should you need to wine should have the most recent to download in the downloads section.
[07:01] <zipzo> no i need to patch wine, so i do need to compile it
[07:01] <studiophi> (Request 2)  Okay, in that case, can anybody enlighten me on how to install GTK+?
[07:02] <micahcowan> waseem, inspect the output from "lspci" (run that command in terminal)
[07:02] <morgue> rahmiel, when I run setup.exe from inside '/media/cdrom0/' I was able to open the CD-ROM when setup asked me to insert cd 2
[07:02] <zipzo> soo...im new to installing from source, on thise page, which filkes are the source? (wine) http://source.winehq.org/source/?v=wine-0.9.16
[07:02] <waseem> micahcowan: thanks
[07:02] <rahmiel> morgue, awesome.
[07:02] <morgue> rahmiel, now I inserted the CD but when I click OK on the msgbox, it promts again me to insert it
[07:02] <rahmiel> morgue, not awesome.. lol..
[07:03] <morgue> rahmiel, what should I do? :@
[07:03] <dnite> morgue, go to your console and remount /media/cdrom0
[07:03] <morgue> dnite, how?
[07:03] <rahmiel> beat me to it.
[07:03] <dnite> morgue, mount /media/cdrom0
[07:03] <anilomkar> Can any one tell me how to install WebLogic Server in Ubuntu?

[07:04] <dnite> hehehe
[07:04] <sgorilla80> is there a wiki/tutorial that tells you how to build a module using the kernel headers?
[07:04] <morgue> no! just 2

[07:05] <shoobs> Anyone here willing to help me out with a minor install problem?
[07:05] <zipzo> yeah speaking of which, i need to compile wine to run a game
[07:05] <morgue> at least it will be there right? :D
[07:05] <jordan> !anyone
[07:05] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[07:05] <zipzo> but exactly which files of the ftp are the suorce is beyond me
[07:05] <rahmiel> zipzo, Download the most recent source tar from winehq's downloads.
[07:06] <zipzo> i need an older source, 0.9.16
[07:06] <dnite> zipzo, why can't you install it from the repo?
[07:06] <zipzo> works for eve online
[07:06] <dnite> ah
[07:06] <shoobs> How can I start the install with only a USB keyboard attached?
[07:06] <rahmiel> zipzo, you'll need all the files listed under the needed version.
[07:06] <shoobs> Of Dapper server.
[07:06] <zipzo> ahh ok. and uninstall the version i have?
[07:07] <zipzo> thnx again, you guys are awesome
[07:07] <rahmiel> zipzo, You should be able to configure; make; make install and it'll overwrite anything needed, but I can't be 100% positive with older versions.
[07:07] <Lilandra> when i installed ubuntu i said my hardware clock was set to local time and not UTC but i think it is set to UTC so how do i make ubuntu know that it is set to UTC now?
[07:07] <morgue> If this game runs I'm getting drunk
[07:07] <ryan_> alright!!  Woo who!
[07:07] <gaminggeek> What game?
[07:08] <morgue> mvp 2005
[07:08] <CientificoLoco> if I install sunbird in /opt/ can I use it with firefox??
[07:08] <gaminggeek> are you using wine?
[07:08] <anilomkar> ubotu, is there Weblogic server for Ubuntu??
[07:08] <morgue> yeah
[07:08] <jordan> rahmiel, checkinstall will compile it to a .deb which makes managing it easier.
[07:08] <ryan_> hey guys, I'm havin some troubles
[07:08] <CientificoLoco> if I install sunbird in /opt/ can I use it with firefox??
[07:09] <morgue> how do i get to ./wine?
[07:09] <manchicken> Anybody know how to set up ruby on rails in ubuntu?
[07:09] <gnupl_> How do I enable 3D Acceleration for my graphic card ?
[07:09] <rahmiel> jordan, true, but if he uses the deb to install an older version it'll reject him, I think.
[07:09] <rahmiel> morgue cd ~/.wine
[07:10] <manchicken> rubygems seems to be missing from adept.
[07:10] <ndowens> waseem: it is in the kernel
[07:10] <rahmiel> morgue, It's a hidden folder in your home directory.
[07:10] <morgue> ty
[07:10] <morgue> can I make it visible?
[07:10] <studiophi> manchicken - you should be able to do it with apt-get
[07:10] <rahmiel> morgue, ctrl+H in nautilus, or view > show hidden files
[07:10] <ryan_> IS there an easy way to get gcc working?
[07:10] <CppIsWeird> what port does openssl listen on?
[07:11] <ryan_> When I try to apt-get libc, I get a strange message
[07:11] <manchicken> studiophi: rubygems package is not found.
[07:11] <jordan> rahmiel, Not if he removes the other one first using dpkg / apt
[07:11] <CientificoLoco> if I install sunbird in /opt/ can I use it with firefox??
[07:11] <concept10> does anyone remember the name of the linux site that offered help over instant messenger?
[07:11] <ty> lilandra:  You still here?
[07:11] <Lilandra> yes
[07:11] <ryan_> Package libc is not available, but is referred to by another package.

[07:12] <concept10> jordan, thanks very much
[07:12] <pip> CppIsWeird, command ?
[07:12] <jordan> concept10, np
[07:12] <Lilandra> ty: i don't think you get my pm's or i don't get yours...not sure how that works on freenode
[07:13] <ty> Lilandra:  I get yours
[07:13] <Lilandra> ty: i'm not getting yours bu tok
[07:13] <dnite> manchicken, there are also sections on wiki.rubyonrails.com for installing everything on ubuntu ...
[07:13] <rahmiel> CpplsWeird, or if you want directory listings.. where filename
[07:13] <CppIsWeird> i want to search for a file.
[07:13] <Lilandra> ty: got it?
[07:14] <pip> CppIsWeird, methods list:#use search engine #locate file.youwant #find file.youwant #lookfor yourself with ls and cd
[07:14] <rahmiel> There is also 'Search for Files' under the places menu..
[07:14] <ty> Lilandra: Weird how should I run this?
[07:14] <Lilandra> ty: oooo...do you have bzip2 and tar?
[07:14] <morgue> yeah the cracked exe crashes my computer
[07:14] <morgue> rofl
[07:15] <morgue> and the original exe does nothing
[07:15] <pip> CppIsWeird, for example you want to look for a file named <cpuinfo>,so you can type like this :locate cpuinfo
[07:15] <ty> Lilandra: Yes these all extracted with when I ran those airports
[07:15] <shoobs> Is it possible to get GRUB (installed of a damn small linux live cd) to boot directly into the install?
[07:15] <gnupl_> How do I enable 3D Acceleration for my graphic card ?
[07:15] <shoobs> My BIOS won't recognise the USB keyboard at boot.
[07:15] <ty> lilandra: when I run sudo iwlist eth0 (My wireless) scan it does nothing
[07:15] <shoobs> I have no way of selecting "install" from the menu.
[07:15] <Lilandra> ty: did u do the modprobe?
[07:15] <pip> CppIsWeird, if you still have problems with how to use locate and find commands, please use :man locate and man find

[07:16] <Lilandra> ty: yes i think so
[07:16] <gnupl_> jordan,  I just want to enable 3d acceleration on my video card, so, I can install compiz , xgl/beryl.
[07:16] <ty> Lilandra:  No error messages and I did run modprobe
[07:16] <Lilandra> ty: dmesg?
[07:17] <jordan> gnupl_, Have you tried https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto ?

[07:17] <gnupl_> jordan,  Im looking at it , as we speak, thank you.
[07:17] <Lilandra> yikes
[07:18] <Lilandra> ty: now i think i'm lost :-(
[07:18] <ty> haha ya
[07:18] <pip> CppIsWeird, if you want to search the location of a command, you can use :whereis and which commands
[07:18] <Lilandra> ty: is this edgy?
[07:18] <ty> lilandra:  My least favorite thing about linux
[07:18] <ty> yes
[07:18] <Lilandra> ty: i remember struggling a bit more with edgy but i cant remember why
[07:18] <omkar86> i have seen a screenshot where resources like RAM, hdd, network traffic were displayed on desktop. how do we do tht in kubuntu?
[07:18] <Lilandra> hmm...
[07:19] <ty> lilandra: you use ndiswrapper to any luck?
[07:19] <morgue> Hmmm I'm getting this error err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L"C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\SECDRV.SYS" failed, status c0000135
[07:19] <Lilandra> ty: i didn't use ndiswrapper...not sure what to do with it
[07:19] <Lilandra> ty: i'm beginning to think i was lucky
[07:19] <jordan> gnupl_, Although, if you happen to be running Edgy, and you have an nvidia card, there is a better ( much easier / faster ) tutorial for getting Beryl working
[07:20] <Lilandra> ty: but the modprobe worked, so what does that mean
[07:20] <ty> Lilandra:  Sometimes it does just seem to be luck that gets these working:  Got skype working first time installed linux on my 64 bit processer...never got it to work again...
[07:20] <Lilandra> yikes!
[07:20] <jessie> hello people.
[07:20] <gnupl_> jordan, ATI Radeon 9200 here!
[07:20] <CppIsWeird> i wanna ssh to a box, but its behind a router, what port do i need to foward?
[07:21] <iter> CppIsWeird: 22
[07:21] <CppIsWeird> can i change that port?
[07:21] <jessie> anybody know how to get a thinkpad 600x hibernate/suspend to work right? im running edgy
[07:21] <omkar86>  i have seen a screenshot where resources like RAM, hdd, network traffic were displayed on desktop. how do we do tht in kubuntu?
[07:21] <ty> Lilandra:  any other suggestions?  I'm sick of trolling the forums...might be time to hook back up the usb dongle wireless
[07:21] <ty> Lilandra:  Just had high hopes that I wouldn't have to use it...its kinda inconvient
[07:21] <tonyyarusso> jessie: Might check to see whether anyone has hints for that line on the ThinkWiki.
[07:22] <Lilandra> ty: right now no, i can...err...boot into a live cd and work from scratch and see if i forgot anything...tomorrow...:-(
[07:22] <ty> that is fine
[07:22] <thirdalbum> omakar86, have a look at Conky. It's in the repos
[07:22] <jessie> tonyyarusso: i looked, now it mostly works but it gets stuck at a black screen and won't do anything else
[07:22] <ty> Lilandra:  I should go to be as well
[07:22] <ty> bed
[07:22] <Lilandra> ty: ok...my email is on my site. i will come back on tomorrow
[07:22] <Lilandra> 'night
[07:23] <ty> lilandra:  thanks for the help!
[07:23] <Lilandra> bye all
[07:23] <Lilandra> ty: i wish it worked! :-(
[07:23] <omkar86> thnx thirdalbum
[07:23] <jordan> LineOf7s, I was refering to the fact that nvidia has beta drivers that let you use beryl withought XGL ( AIGLX instead ) and the Beta ness of the drivers is made up for by the added stability of not running XGL.
[07:23] <thirdalbum> omakar86, if you do "man conky" it tells you how to set it up with the included sample file, which gives you all those displays
[07:23] <omkar86> ok
[07:24] <gnupl_> jordan,  The site, youve given me, said -> The model number for your Radeon card is a 9700 pro or above .. But I do have a radeon, which is < 9700 model, still proceed?
[07:24] <CppIsWeird> how come im getting connection refused?
[07:24] <jessie> cpplsweird: you got me
[07:25] <CppIsWeird> what would be some causes? its an out of the box ubuntu install
[07:25] <tonyyarusso> jessie: Dang
[07:25] <iter> CppIsWeird: apt-get install ssh
[07:25] <jordan> gnupl_, I think your card might be to old for XGL, but I may be wrong, you may get better support in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:25] <omkar86> leaving
[07:25] <morgue> Why do you think I'm getting this error if the file IS there? err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L"C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\SECDRV.SYS" failed, status c0000135
[07:26] <gnupl_> jordan,  Ive installed XGL in this graphic card, and it worked out great BUT it slow, and some people said that my 3D acceleration could be turned off... That why i wanted to know, how to turn on 3D Acceleration, thats all!
[07:26] <LineOf7s> jordan:  I was referring to your comment "there is a better ( much easier / faster ) tutorial for getting Beryl working", and was kinda hoping you'd provide a link to it or something.  Granted, I came in halfway through, so I may have missed something.
[07:27] <iter> LineOf7s: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu
[07:27] <jordan> gnupl_, If you are running XGL, you have 3D acceleration, it won't even start without it.
[07:27] <iter> that's the preferred one atm
[07:27] <rahmiel> morgue, Unknown, and I wouldn't realize have a clue unless I picked the exe apart.
[07:27] <LineOf7s> ty iter - I'll check it out right now.
[07:28] <jordan> LineOf7s, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA
[07:28] <rahmiel> morgue, Viewing cedega's forum and game db, it seems very few if none have been successful with mvp 2005 with wine or cedega. : /
[07:28] <LineOf7s> ty jordan.  :o)  I'll check that out too.
[07:29] <jordan> LineOf7s, ( if you have an nvidia card )
[07:29] <morgue> rahmiel, really?
[07:29] <morgue> rahmiel, the cedega team couldn't make it run? lol
[07:29] <morgue> rahmiel, I guess I should stop trying then
[07:30] <Ademan> is smb reliable? ie does it do error checking? and will it let me know if something screws up? I want to back up my home folder onto a network drive then re-install ubuntu, any possibility of the home folder backup failing?
[07:30] <rahmiel> morgue, From what I'm finding. Doesn't mean they'll get it working in the future.. but.. it looks bleak currently. Only thing I can suggest is dualbooting or building a ms box just for gaming. : /
[07:30] <jessie> hey, how do i edit my grub
[07:30] <Ademan> jessie: /boot/grub/menu.lst iirc
[07:30] <Ademan> so something like sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:30] <morgue> rahmiel, ooooor, get ea sports to release a patch for linux :o
[07:30] <LineOf7s> jordan:  I have an nvidia card - hence the pricking of the ears originally.
[07:31] <Ademan> replace gedit with kate if you're on kde, or nano or vim if you're a h4x0r
[07:31] <rahmiel> morgue, even better. ;)
[07:31] <tarzeau> who knows about the cd mastering (glass) and production of ubuntu?
[07:31] <jessie> thake ademan!!
[07:31] <Ademan> np jessie
[07:31] <mzli> I wanna Install ubuntu 6.06.1 alternate not 6.06 from harddisk.who can help me?
[07:31] <jordan> LineOf7s, Whell then, I envy you and your ability to run AIGLX :)
[07:31] <Ademan> mzli: what do you mean from harddisk?
[07:31] <morgue> rahmiel,  just deleting the game folder will do or i have to uninstall it like if i were on windows?
[07:32] <mzli> from iso
[07:32] <mzli> which exist in my fat patition
[07:32] <gnupl_> How can I make FF2.0 use a special player (rather than it default, totem) ?
[07:32] <Ademan> you have to burn the iso to a cd
[07:32] <Ademan> for both the alternate and the desktop install
[07:32] <Ademan> (any install actually)
[07:32] <mzli> have to ? but I want from harddisk image.
[07:32] <mzli> is that possible?
[07:32] <rahmiel> morgue, you can just rm the game folder really.
[07:33] <Ademan> you want to just install from an image on your hard disk? no, because if you installed, you'd overwrite where the iso is
[07:33] <mzli> I've tried edgy,it's good.
[07:33] <Ademan> but even if you wouldnt overwrite it (since i guess its on a different partition) i don't know of any bootloaders that boot a random ISO on disk
[07:33] <morgue> rahmiel, what's the unmount command again?
[07:33] <Ademan> grub MIGHT do it, but i doubt it
[07:33] <CppIsWeird> ok, i've managed to get an ssh session going. But i want to run a gtk application on the remote server. It says "Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display" how do i fix this?
[07:34] <jordan> gnupl_, First install another player, like mozilla-mplayer, then 'touch' the corrosponding so's like for mplayer you would run : sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*
[07:34] <LKRaider> mzli: it is possible to boot from a ISO and install ubuntu. I have done it before
[07:34] <mzli> I'v tried from 6.10,and succeed,but 6.06 seems doesnt work well.
[07:34] <jessie> morgue, unmount maybe? i don't know
[07:34] <LineOf7s> jordan:  Envy me more once I get it working.  "In theory there's no difference between theory and practice, but in practice, there is."
[07:34] <Arrick> CppIsWeird, logon localy
[07:34] <rahmiel> morgue umount
[07:34] <morgue> yeah thanks
[07:35] <morgue> :(
[07:35] <morgue> I wanted to play baseball
[07:35] <jessie> so, hows everybody liking edgy?
[07:35] <mzli> <LKRaider>yes, I knew,but I want some example for Ubuntu 6.06.1
[07:35] <pou52> hi anyone knows if any drivers available for Hard Drive Enclosure  SATA & USB 2.0 Interface
[07:35] <LKRaider> mzli: oh. I did it back on Breezy tho...
[07:35] <CppIsWeird> arrick: that defeats the entire purpose of "Remote Access"
[07:35] <jordan> LKRaider, If I understand you correctly, no,
[07:35] <mzli> My cd-drive is broken,
[07:36] <jessie> also my percentage bar under human theme isn't showing up (the one that shows how far along your download, etc is).
[07:36] <mzli> LKRaider, it's not breezy, is dapper,6.06
[07:36] <jessie> mzli, how is your cd broke?
[07:36] <jordan> LKRaider, LKRaider How did you do it before?
[07:36] <rahmiel> morgue, well, you can still get drunk
[07:36] <morgue> rahmiel, TRUE
[07:36] <morgue> brb
[07:36] <morgue> rofl
[07:37] <mzli> exactly it's too slow ,and alway read wrong.
[07:37] <LKRaider> jordan: you can see how on my website.... I did a report on it :P http://lkraider.eipper.com.br
[07:37] <gnupl_> jordan,  iirc, Il create a file to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer* , right?
[07:37] <mzli> many times installation goes wrong.
[07:37] <mzli> So ,I have to try the hd method.
[07:37] <LKRaider> mzli: http://lkraider.eipper.com.br is how I did on Breezy to install from ISO on my HD (since I did not have a CD drive on that PC)
[07:38] <jordan> gnupl_, No, there should be files there already if you have installed the package mozilla-mplayer
[07:38] <morgue> cheers #ubuntu
[07:38] <gnupl_> jordan,  Ive apt-get install mozilla-mplayer , that all, right?
[07:38] <mzli> <LKRaider>thank you very much. But ubuntu 6.06 is dapper ,not breezy.
[07:38] <gnupl_> 5 == breezy
[07:39] <gnupl_> 6.06 == dapper
[07:39] <LKRaider> mzli: I know :P
[07:39] <jordan> gnupl_, Yup, so now just run: sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*
[07:39] <jessie> so my percentage bar isn't working. it doesnt show up, ie. the dowloading bar, in human theme
[07:39] <mzli> thanks the same.
[07:39] <mzli> :>
[07:39] <jordan> gnupl_, Then just restart firefox and it should work.
[07:39] <gnupl_> I did
[07:39] <LKRaider> mzli: the instructions should be similar tho
[07:40] <gnupl_> and it works,
[07:40] <gnupl_> thanks jordan
[07:40] <jessie> any help?
[07:40] <mzli> <LKRaider> I've tried install edgy from hd, and succeed. but 6.06 is different.
[07:41] <LKRaider> mzli: okay
[07:41] <jessie> hello, i need some help here
[07:41] <what_if> hi
[07:41] <mzli> Edgy is not so stable.
[07:41] <mzli> jessie,what?
[07:41] <jordan> LKRaider, Ah, I have never used Ntldr, that sounds pretty impressive to me though.
[07:41] <what_if> i edgy a full release or a beta ?
[07:41] <Flannel> what_if: full release
[07:41] <WindDragon> full
[07:42] <what_if> :)
[07:42] <morgue> why does firefox is not giving me the "set as wallpaper" option :@
[07:42] <morgue> let me rephrase that
[07:42] <WindDragon> it should
[07:42] <admin123> mkCDrec makes a bootable (El Torito) disaster recovery image (CDrec.iso), including backups of the linux system to the same CD-ROM (or CD-RW) if space permits, or to a multi-volume CD-ROM set. Otherwise, the backups can be stored on another local disk, NFS disk or (remote) tape. HOWEVER mkcdrec doesn't work what options do I have left?
[07:42] <morgue> why is firefox not giving me the "set as wallpaper" option
[07:42] <LKRaider> jordan: I was impressed how well it worked. all glory goes to Grub tho, for being the best bootloader around :)
[07:42] <ProN00b> http://localhost/xfer.pl?url=http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/index.xml&sql=select%20*%20from%20foo
[07:42] <ProN00b> sql on rss
[07:42] <jordan> LKRaider, Another option, if you have a thumb drive / usb port , I can link you to a howto on making a bootable liveThumbDrive.
[07:42] <ProN00b> that rawks
[07:43] <jessie> mzli, my progress bar doen't work with the human theme. it's just being invisable until it gets to the % then messes up the percentage. i have a thinkpad 600x and edgy.
[07:44] <rahmiel> morgue, Use opera! Uhm.. tested and I can use the option.. are you looking at the raw image or the image on a page?
[07:44] <morgue> rahmiel, do you have ff 2.0 installed?
[07:45] <morgue> rahmiel, I think I found the problem
[07:45] <LKRaider> jordan: on that particular PC I didn't have usb boot option. But I would be interested on this livethumbdrive yes :)
[07:45] <rahmiel> morgue, yeah, but I have to 'view background image' before I can set to desktop.
[07:46] <mzli> <jessie>sorry , I use dapper. there are not exist this problem.
[07:46] <eseong> hies all
[07:46] <eseong> may i know how to solve this ?
[07:46] <eseong> ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[07:46] <jordan> LKRaider, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[07:46] <morgue> rahmiel, what's under your /etc/firefox/profile/chrom
[07:46] <LKRaider> jordan: thanks :D
[07:47] <eseong> hies people
[07:47] <eseong> ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[07:47] <eseong> any solution ?
[07:47] <rahmiel> morgue, userChrome-example.css  userContent-example.css
[07:47] <LineOf7s> There's one thing keeping me from being able to use Ubuntu (or Linux generally) at work every day, and that's some sort of FOSS terminal emulator that can emulate "PF keys" on a VT320 (they're the top four keys of the PC numeric keypad).  There's PowerTerm InterConnect (commercial) that works, but does anyone else have any suggestions?  I've spent the last week banging my head against Google without luck.  :o\   (here endeth my first proper #ubu
[07:47] <jordan> LKRaider, But the persistence part doesn't work with Edgy, with those instructions, but you can still get a thumb drive equivelent of a liveCD
[07:47] <morgue> rahmiel, hehe ok I didn't find the problem :P
[07:47] <rahmiel> morgue, but did you try the 'view background image' then the 'set as desktop image'?
[07:48] <rahmiel> morgue, I'm not a fan of ff, thus opera, so I really don't use it that often.
[07:48] <LKRaider> jordan: oh, ok. I prefer dapper anyways :P
[07:49] <morgue> rahmiel, I don't get 'view background image'
[07:49] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[07:49] <morgue> I go to http://asdfasfd.jpg
[07:49] <Majic> Er....I installed a driver for my wireless card and when i try to use it it doesn't connect.  I was wondering if someone could help me...
[07:49] <morgue> and I don't get the set as wallpaper option
[07:49] <LKRaider> well, it's late here. bye all
[07:50] <jessie> i'm heading in too
[07:50] <jordan> LKRaider, One really interesting thing to try would be to use gksu "update-manager -c" to upgrade the thumb drive to Edgy.
[07:50] <WindDragon> Majic: ur wireless card?
[07:50] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[07:50] <Majic> The driver is correct and it goes with the card, but the connection always says "Disconnected"
[07:50] <Majic> Yes...
[07:50] <towsonu2003> how do you get a list of serial devices you have? I'm looking for something like lspci -vv? thanks :)
[07:50] <rahmiel> morgue, Odd, the option pulls up for me... hrm...
[07:50] <WindDragon> can it detect ur ssid?
[07:50] <rahmiel> morgue, Can't say really, not a ff user. : (
[07:50] <surimi> Hi
[07:50] <surimi> I try to install Kino but I have this message error "Depend: libraw1394-8  but it is not installable". On Dapper. In fact the paquet's name is : 0.90.2.3vIubuntu (dapper). Is it a bad backport from Edgy?
[07:50] <surimi> How can I repear the dependancies and install it on Dapper?
[07:51] <morgue> rahmiel, what does the option say exactly? I'm going to ask in the ff forum
[07:51] <Majic> No, it just won't connect.  Like, I put in the SSID and the WEP key in the Properties menu...but the darn card won't connect.  When I go to the device manager it says the interface isn't up....but I don't know how to get it "up".
[07:51] <rahmiel> morgue, I got the 'Set As Desktop Background' on an image
[07:52] <morgue> rahmiel, kk thx
[07:52] <mzli> <surimi>apt is not work?
[07:52] <Majic> It doesn't do anything.  I put in the preferences for my network, but it won't even scan.  The lights on the card don't even light up.
[07:53] <surimi> mzli, I tried via Synaptic, I test with a apt-get
[07:53] <shoobs> Can someone please help with my install problem?
[07:53] <what_if> how do I make apt install a program from the internet instead of from the cdrom ??
[07:53] <Majic> I used "ndiswrapper" to install the driver and it says the driver is correct and the hardware is present, I did the "modprobe ndiswrapper" thing and it's stupposed to work but it doesn't.
[07:53] <what_if> Majic: what does it say when you type "dmesg"
[07:53] <jordan> what_if, Egect the cdrom ;)
[07:53] <royce> Anyone know why SecondLife crashes my whole computer when I run it??????
[07:53] <what_if> jordan: did that
[07:54] <surimi> mzli, "Les paquets suivants contiennent des dpendances non satisfaites:  kino: Dpend: libraw1394-8 mais il n'est pas installable
[07:54] <surimi> E: Paquets dfectueux"
[07:54] <what_if> jordan: the cd is in another PC at the moment
[07:54] <Majic> What am I looking for when I type "dmesg"?
[07:54] <Majic> It prints out a lot of stuff.
[07:54] <jordan> what_if, Honesstly thought, you could just temporarily comment it out in your sources.list

[07:54] <mzli> <surimi>sorry, I dont know that mean.
[07:54] <what_if> Majic: should give you some error relating to ndiswrapper
[07:55] <what_if> jordan: i'll try that
[07:55] <surimi> mzli, the dependancies are not satisfied on Dapper, I can't install Kino
[07:55] <Majic> Well, it prints a big list...but I don't see any errors.
[07:55] <royce> Has anyone got SecondLife (you know, the super popular virual life program) to run???
[07:56] <surimi> someone can remember me the name of the motu's channel?
[07:56] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[07:56] <what_if> Majic: are you just doing# "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper" ??
[07:57] <Majic> no, I logged in under root then just did modprobe ndiswrapper
[07:57] <Majic> Basically, same thing....did I do something wrong?
[07:57] <xyzone> I remember doing it once but I forgot how. 32bit color? just putting 32 in xorg.conf isn't working. how do I get 32bit color?
[07:58] <what_if> jordan: uncommenting worked
[07:58] <what_if> :)
[07:58] <mrkris> anyone here ever play simcity under ubuntu? :D
[07:58] <what_if> Majic: no errors whatsoever ??
[07:58] <manchicken> Anybody know how to set up apache with RoR on ubuntu?
[07:58] <Majic> Nope...
[07:59] <Majic> No errors...
[07:59] <mrkris> Majic: easy
[07:59] <Majic> ?
[07:59] <mrkris> err, i meant manchicken
[07:59] <mrkris> manchicken: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ubuntu+ruby+on+rails&btnG=Google+Search
[08:00] <what_if> Majic: very hard to diagnose with no error messages
[08:00] <Majic> Anyways, I was looking in the device manager and under net.interface_up it says bool false
[08:00] <what_if> Majic: do a "lsmod" and see if it is listed there
[08:00] <Majic> I was thinking that should be true...
[08:00] <Majic> Okay...
[08:00] <manchicken> mrkris: Yeah, I've got rails and ruby installed, it's specifically the apache config I'm having trouble with.
[08:00] <mrkris> using mod_ruby?
[08:01] <mrkris> mod_ruby = bad idea for RoR
[08:01] <mrkris> or fastcgi
[08:01] <mzli> <surimi>I just install kino from synaptic, it's no errors.
[08:01] <Majic> Nope, no errors either.
[08:01] <Majic> It's so weird...
[08:01] <pressureman> has anybody got dual-head working in edgy for an ATI X600?
[08:01] <mzli> <surimi> and I run it success.
[08:02] <Majic> When I go to the network utility it tries to use the connection like normal, but it just never connects.
[08:02] <mzli> <surimi>I just install kino from synaptic, it's no errors.
[08:02] <mzli> <surimi>I just install kino from synaptic, it's no errors.
[08:02] <mzli> <surimi>I just install kino from synaptic, it's no errors.
[08:02] <Majic> I'm not even sure how to get it to Connect.  I'm sort of new to Linux...
[08:02] <Majic> It just says "Disconnected".
[08:03] <what_if> Majic: what hardware are you using with Ndiswrapper ?
[08:03] <surimi> mzli, the kino 0.90.2.3vIubuntu should come from a incomplet repository
[08:03] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:03] <Majic> Belkin 54G Wireless G Notebook Network Card.  Part # F5D7011
[08:04] <mzli> <surimi> My version is 0.8.0
[08:04] <what_if> Majic: i know my wireless card stopped working after a certian version of the drivers, you could try older drivers
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[08:04] <Majic> I used the install CD that came for Windows....just pulled the .inf file off of that.
[08:04] <Majic> It's always worked on Windows....
[08:04] <Majic> It's not the same under Linux, is it?
[08:04] <what_if> Majic: no
[08:05] <Majic> Hmm...
[08:05] <what_if> Majic: go to Belkin's website and get their drivers
[08:05] <Majic> But when I do ndiswrapper -l it says the driver is present and the hardware is present....shouldn't it work?
[08:05] <surimi> mzli, I have notice it. So the best I can do is to comment the non official deposit. I suppose.
[08:05] <Majic> Okay.
[08:06] <what_if> Majic: should yes... but dosen't
[08:06] <mzli> <surimi>ok
[08:07] <what_if> Majic: was the ndiswrapper driver listed in lsmod ??
[08:07] <xyzone> I remember doing it once but I forgot how. 32bit color? just putting 32 in xorg.conf isn't working. how do I get 32bit color?
[08:07] <Majic> I don't know where to look, I'm afraid...
[08:07] <Majic> What part of the list?  I'm sorry I'm so bad at this..
[08:08] <Majic> I can tell you the name of the driver if you'd like...
[08:08] <what_if> Majic: in the console do "lsmod"
[08:08] <waddletron2k> Anyone else have an ATI 200M in their laptops? I'd be interested to know what your FPS for glxgears is
[08:08] <what_if> Majic: it lists all the loaded modules
[08:08] <Majic> Where will it be?
[08:08] <Majic> I see ndiswrapper next to usbcore...
[08:09] <ABCD> when setting up Ubuntu, I accidentally overwrote the boot sector (or whatever it's called) of my Windows partition with GRUB - is there any way to recover it (without reinstalling Windows)?
[08:09] <waddletron2k> Well you could set up GRUB to boot windows actually
[08:10] <waddletron2k> This would mean booting GRUB every time though and then choosing windows from the menu
[08:10] <Majic> There's nothing listed next to "ndiswrapper"...
[08:10] <what_if> Majic: if it is listed there then it is loaded ... try "rmmod ndiswrapper"
[08:10] <waddletron2k> ABCD: I can give you a link to this method
[08:10] <ndowens> so what is up all
[08:10] <waddletron2k> ndowens: well Gentoo dropped XMMS
[08:10] <what_if> Majic: that removes the module, then "modprobe ndiswrapper"
[08:10] <Majic> Okay, it's all removed...
[08:11] <Majic> done
[08:11] <ABCD> waddletron2k, I accidentally put GRUB in the boot sector of the *partion* with Windows, not the MBR of the drive
[08:11] <what_if> Majic: ok... working now ?
[08:11] <Dan_E> Hi, I don't have any have display problems once ubuntu has finished loading, but I get nothing but a black screen with a blinking cursor during bootup and shutdown.  Any ideas?
[08:11] <ABCD> (as in, /dev/sda2 (or (hd1,1)); not /dev/sda (or (hd1)))
[08:11] <Majic> I'm not sure, it used to under eth1....but now when I try to load that connection the Status is "error"
[08:11] <ndowens> waddletron2k: yea i heard about that i think
[08:12] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:12] <xyzone> come on dammit, how do you fool wine into thinking you're running windows "32 bit color"
[08:12] <fignew> should be automatic
[08:13] <Vich> I formatted a partition as ext3 and mounted it, but I cannot write to it as normal user
[08:13] <Majic> Nope, the connection is still "Disconnected".
[08:13] <Vich> how can I fix this?
[08:13] <Vich> do I need to use a umask thingy?
[08:13] <xyzone> some windows apps keep telling me I need to be running 16 or 32 bit to run it,
[08:13] <xyzone> it's not being automatic
[08:14] <what_if> Majic: have you tried searching for wireless networks with it ??
[08:14] <Majic> I don't know how to do that....
[08:14] <what_if> Majic: how did you configure the wireless card before  when it worked ?
[08:15] <Majic> I tried doing iwconfig...
[08:15] <Majic> After I used the network utility in Edgy...
[08:15] <what_if> Majic: ok, try "iwlist [interface]  scan
[08:16] <Majic> "Interface doesn't support scanning  :  No such device"
[08:16] <Majic> That's under eth1, which should be the wireless card.
[08:16] <Majic> eth0 is the wired connection...
[08:16] <mseve> I'm baaaack. =)
[08:16] <Vich> never mind
[08:16] <what_if> Majic: yeah, the drivers are not working... try an older or newer version of the drivers
[08:16] <Majic> Strange how it's usually wlan0 for most people.
[08:16] <Vich> once again I fixed it myself
[08:16] <mseve> I have a few OpenGL questions
[08:16] <what_if> Majic: could also try updating ndiswrapper
[08:17] <Vich> that's the 5th question I've asked in here, got no reply and sorted out myself ^_^
[08:17] <what_if> Majic: couldn't hurt
[08:17] <Majic> I used the newest stable version, and the beta of the newest version.
[08:17] <mseve> Go Vich!
[08:17] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:17] <jordan_> Majic: It was eth1 for me when I was using a broadcom card + bcm46xxx
[08:17] <mseve> Who's good with video issues?
[08:17] <Majic> Hmm....I see that bcm46xxx thing around a lot.
[08:18] <jordan_> Majic: It is the driver for broadcom cards
[08:18] <immrtl> my shutdown process seems to hang at the last "unloading" screen, anything i can try?
[08:18] <what_if> Majic: one more idea... try "cat /proc/net/dev"
[08:18] <Majic> What OS version of the driver for my card should I get?  They have it as far back as Win98SE
[08:18] <Majic> okay...
[08:19] <what_if> Majic: will list all the interfaces the system sees
[08:19] <mseve> glxgears runs fine, but fgl_glxgears dies.
[08:19] <Majic> lo, eth0, sit0, and eth1
[08:19] <Majic> The only one I'm getting packets from is lo.
[08:19] <xyzone> or can I at least change the color depth to 16 bit? is there a command to do this?
[08:19] <what_if> Majic: have you tried it as eth0 ?
[08:19] <immrtl> ? u have to be getting packets from either eth0 or eth1, how are u online
[08:20] <what_if> Majic: it is possible that the interface name changed
[08:20] <Majic> eth0 was the connection I used to connect with the ethernet cable
[08:20] <jordan_> xyzone: What are you trying to do?
[08:20] <what_if> immrtl: (another PC)
[08:20] <Majic> I'm not sure, I'm new to Linux...for the second part.
[08:20] <immrtl> =(
[08:20] <xyzone> jordan_, I'm trying to run some program in wine that needs to run in 16 or 32 bit color mode
[08:21] <mseve> I would like to get OpenGL running on the fglrx drivers....
[08:21] <Majic> how do you delete interfaces and remake them?
[08:21] <what_if> Majic: ok, well as far as the linux kernel knows everything is good. There is some problem with ndiswrapper I beleive
[08:21] <Majic> Okay, I downloaded the build from Debian...
[08:21] <what_if> Majic: by removing the modules for them
[08:21] <Majic> Hmm, doesn't sound like a good idea.
[08:21] <jordan_> mseve: 24bit color in Linux is equivelent to 32bit color in Windows AFIK.
[08:22] <what_if> Majic: installing the module automatically adds the interface
[08:22] <Majic> Oh...
[08:22] <eseong> is there anyone could help me ?
[08:22] <mseve> Jordon_ wrong person.
[08:22] <eseong> ahhhhh...
[08:22] <eseong> sad
[08:22] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:22] <xyzone> jordan_, I've looked around, I've heard the whole story, and I knew it already. But the fact remains that some windows programs refuse to run in 24 bit color
[08:22] <CppIsWeird> where is the ssh config file?
[08:22] <what_if> eseong: what program gave that error
[08:22] <Majic> Hmmm, well, eth0 worked when I was on a wired connection yesterday.  eth1 has never worked though.
[08:22] <eseong> what_if, is an emu actually..
[08:22] <xyzone> so how can I fool wine into thinking it's running in 32 bit color?
[08:22] <mseve> !opengl
[08:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about opengl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:23] <what_if> eseong: ok, what program
[08:23] <mseve> !fglrx
[08:23] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:23] <eseong> what_if, mangos
[08:23] <dnite> does anyone know a way to 'browse' a bluetooth phone? I have a bunch of pictures on my phone i want to get off, and i don't feel like sending each one individually from the phone to my computer.. i'd rather just grab em all and copy them all at once.
[08:23] <mseve> Hmm, been there, done that.
[08:23] <what_if> Majic: yeah, I use the win 98 drivers
[08:23] <bmgz> Has anybody here had any problems printing multiple copies of documents in evince with Edgy? Seems to be b0rked...
[08:23] <what_if> Majic: also try windows NT drivers
[08:23] <jordan_> xyzone: You could edit your xorg.conf
[08:23] <Majic> OKay, I could try downloading and installing those...
[08:23] <xyzone> jordan_, tried that already, it's invalid and X doesn't start
[08:23] <Majic> I pretty much think 98 and NT were the most stable versions of Windows anyways.  Tht might be the best bet.
[08:24] <what_if> Majic: remember to rmmod the module before changing drivers :) :)
[08:24] <xyzone> and yes, i'm sure the video card supports "32 bit color"
[08:24] <mseve> I like Windows2k for stability.
[08:24] <eseong> what_if, mangos
[08:24] <Majic> okay.... :p
[08:24] <Majic> Thakns for all your help.
[08:24] <mzli> mseve> I like Windows2k for stability.          Ubuntu is stable 2. and maybe even better.
[08:24] <Majic> Uh oh...
[08:24] <what_if> Majic:  ??
[08:25] <mseve> dnite, hi o/  Sorry, I know little to nothing about bluetooth, other then specs.
[08:25] <Majic> It's downloading the driver as an .exe...how do I get the .inf file out of that?
[08:25] <jordan_> xyzone: I meant setting it to be 16 bit, not 32 ( only when you run apps in wine of course )
[08:25] <Dan_E> Hi all, any thoughts on avenues to try if I can scan for wireless networks but not connect to them?
[08:25] <Dan_E> In particular it seems that DHCP isn't working.
[08:25] <Dan_E> Though I can't manage to set a static IP either.
[08:25] <eseong> hi all, is there anyone could help me ?
[08:25] <eseong> theres no solution for this ? ./bin/realmd: error while loading shared libraries: libmysqlclient_r.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:25] <Majic> It's that like....packet sniffign?
[08:25] <Majic> sniffing*
[08:25] <mseve> I agree. I like Ubuntu 6.1 so far, but disappointed in the haph-hazerd drivers.
[08:25] <micahcowan> Dan_E: iwlist
[08:25] <what_if> Majic: normally I run WINE and execute the exe
[08:25] <Majic> Oh.....
[08:25] <xyzone> jordan_, yeah, I was just hoping a better solution was possible
[08:26] <Majic> Hmm, I'll look up a tutorial on Google.  :p
[08:26] <what_if> Majic: it uncompresses itself into a directory, sometimes the temp dir
[08:26] <jordan_> eseong: What do you need help with?
[08:26] <Majic> Hmm, okay...
[08:26] <eseong> jordan_,  i want libmysqlclient_r.so.15... where i can get ?
[08:26] <Majic> I'll try the 98 driver and if that doesn't work I'll try the NT or 2000 version.
[08:26] <mseve> I'm not understanding why glxgears runs fine, but fgl_glxgears won't run at all.
[08:26] <what_if> Majic: sounds good
[08:27] <Majic> How come all the stuff that works is usually the old stuff that people keep on diskettes? :p
[08:27] <mseve> lol
[08:27] <mseve> Because it worked.
[08:27] <micahcowan> less complexity to muck it up?
[08:27] <eseong> jordan_,  i update to the latest one... only libmysqlclient_r.so.14
=== Alzi2 is now known as nix0r
[08:27] <micahcowan> not to mention, no complicated GUI code.
[08:27] <mseve> Never got ported to newer media.
[08:27] <Majic> Everything today is made in Taiwan and cheap plastic.
[08:27] <what_if> Majic: ndis drivers are reverse engineered and take time to get working
[08:27] <Dan_E> micahcowan: Yeah, iwlist scan lists all the access points, but dhclient times out
=== nix0r is now known as Alzi2
[08:28] <Majic> I like reverse engineering....hope to go into that in college...
[08:28] <mseve> I could still use a hand understanding OpenGL better.
[08:28] <Majic> By the way, I'm 16...
[08:28] <Dan_E> I guess I should make it clear that I'm trying to connect to my own wireless network, not someone else's.  I can access the router and fiddle with the settings but I'm not having any luck.
[08:28] <micahcowan> Dan_E, try iwconfig (there may be a cleaner, GUI way to do that, but I don't currently use wifi so I wouldn't know...)
[08:28] <Majic> Would probably explain a few things to why I know so little about all this....
[08:28] <mseve> OMG, run away...... (Majic)
[08:28] <Majic> lol
[08:28] <mseve> =)
[08:29] <Dan_E> micahcowan: Yeah iwconfig shows all the correct info for the access point I'm trying to connect to, but I can't get an IP address.
[08:29] <mseve> My wifi router PS died a month ago, so I'm wifi-less.
[08:29] <mseve> DHCP?
[08:29] <Dan_E> dhclient times out.
[08:29] <Majic> I've always like Mac over Windows and I downloaded Ubuntu a month ago...been trying to get it to work ever since.  I liked the Terminal in Mac OS X a lot and that's how I got a few open source apps to work.  Basically, open-source is like gold to me and would be kind of cool to play with.
[08:29] <jordan_> eseong: Are you running Edgy?
[08:29] <eseong> jordan_, nope :( its 5.0.1
[08:30] <Majic> So yeah, bye now!  Thanks...
[08:30] <mseve> Later M.
[08:30] <Majic> :p
[08:30] <Dan_E> I'm using ndiswrapper if I makes a difference, and the card+router work in windows.
[08:30] <micahcowan> Dan_E, do you get a MAC address with iwconfig?
[08:30] <mseve> Ok, my turn to blob the chat.  =)    Anyone running ATi under edgyu?
[08:30] <jordan_> eseong: Do you have the backports repository enabled?
[08:30] <eseong> jordan_, yeap.
=== Guest18 is now known as thevenin_
[08:31] <Dan_E> A MAC address for the the wifi card or for the router?  I do get what looks like a MAC address listed under "Access Point" in iwconfig.
[08:31] <netnull_> hello everyone im looking for a good program for music edit. could u help me please?
[08:31] <boink> netnull: audacity
[08:31] <jordan_> netnull_: Audacity
[08:31] <mseve> Audacity.  (not sure if thats speeded right.)
[08:31] <eseong> jordan_, what u mean about that backports ?
[08:31] <netnull_> is it the best one?
[08:32] <boink> hope so :)
[08:32] <mseve> Appearantly so.
[08:32] <boink> try it and see if it works well for you
[08:32] <mseve> ...if everyone suggested it. =)
[08:32] <Dan_E> micahcowan: Sorry, that last comment was directed at you.  I do have what appears to be a MAC address listed under "Access Point" in iwconfig, and of course the wifi card's MAC address is listed in ifconfig
[08:33] <netnull_> ok :-) i've another question. i need to use a program for lighting plot (called wysiwyg in windows) i'm quite sure there is nothing like that in linux. there is any way to use it from my linux box? i've tryied wine but it doesnt work
[08:33] <micahcowan> Dan_E, okay. Huh... I think I've reached the end of my expertise on this subject, then. :/
[08:33] <jordan_> eseong: I was hoping it might be available in backports
[08:33] <Dan_E> micahcowan: Oh well.  Thanks anyhow.
[08:33] <CppIsWeird> when i ssh into my server and try to run xcalc (for test) it says "cant open display"
[08:33] <eseong> jordan_, is there any toturial for backportS ?

[08:34] <eseong> i'll get back u later
[08:34] <dnite> anyone know how to 'browse' a bluetooth phone to pull off some pictures?? My phone connects and sends files to my pc just fine, but i'd much rather be able to pull them off all at once instead of one at a time..
[08:34] <jordan_> eseong: np, no guarente it will be there though.

[08:39] <CppIsWeird> how do i configure a ubuntu install to allow X over ssh as sshd?
[08:40] <CppIsWeird> in the config file it is 'yes'
[08:40] <CppIsWeird> and i can connect and do ssh sessions.
[08:40] <mseve> Also.....is there a way to force (in xorg.conf) a monitor setting.  Sit: primary monit is fine. Secondary monitor will support 1280x1030,  But can only get it working at 1280x768.
[08:40] <jordan_> mseve: It may be a problem with Cediga, as I said, I get a similar error and havn't had any problems ( I don't use wine / cediga though )
[08:40] <Sasuke> umm up in top right corner, where it has the time and all that, it has a speaker and a mute simbol on it, when i double click i get the following error
[08:40] <Sasuke> The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.
[08:40] <Sasuke> You can remove the volume control from the panel by right-clicking the speaker icon on the panel and selecting "Remove From Panel" from the menu.
[08:41] <mooky> is anyone using masqurade with iptables on ubuntu ?
[08:41] <Shaye> how do I get MPlayer to play .avi files? or is there any better video player?
[08:41] <mseve> Jordan_: Ok, then no worries.
[08:41] <mooky> Shaye look at restricted formats on the ubuntu wiki
[08:41] <jordan_> !video
[08:41] <ubotu> For multimedia codecs see: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html and for applications see this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaApplications
[08:41] <mzli> mplayer is the best.
[08:42] <mzli> in linux
[08:42] <mseve> jordan_: though I'd love to get the second monitor running at 1280x1030.
[08:42] <jordan_> Shaye: win32codecs helps a lot also
[08:43] <roycebarber> Uboto; the link you gave me about mounting my windows drive, was extremely complex and made my head hurt. :) I've had better success with the following link, with a few problems I've yet to figure out: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=142481

[08:45] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP.

[08:46] <netnull_> i've installed audacity...it seems to be not bad..but..GUI..my god, how awful it is!!!!! :)) any way to make it better?
[08:46] <mooky> netnull_ no way to change that
[08:46] <roycebarber> Does anyone know what this means... I'm trying to get Ubuntu to mount windows drive at bootup. Terminal gives me this error: "ntfsmount: error while loading shared libraries: libntfs.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory."

[08:47] <Sasuke> ok i've got all the codecs installed but yet i still get the same error
[08:47] <Shaye> Codec issues?
[08:47] <Shaye> Sasuke, what error?
[08:48] <Sasuke> [18:12]  <Sasuke> The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.

[08:48] <roycebarber> im not sure but i think this command in terminal will install all the windows codecs: sudo apt-get install w32codecs
[08:48] <Sasuke> why do i want windows codecs?
[08:49] <mooky> Sasuke read the restricted formats page in the wiki
[08:49] <Shaye> wget -c http://www.debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/w/w32codecs/w32codecs_20060611-0.0_i386.deb

[08:51] <roycebarber> WINE wont run some of my Windows programs because the programs need to write to my NTFS drive. Is there an easy way to do this... or am i asking for troubble...
[08:51] <jordan_> eseong: If "sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient15" doesn't work then you may be out of luck
[08:51] <KenSentMe> mikeymike-linux: you can use the connect to server option in Ubuntu for that
[08:51] <KenSentMe> mikeymike-linux: select ssh as protocol
[08:51] <mikeymike-linux> KenSentMe, its graphical? where is it located?
[08:51] <re-align> well, I just upgraded to Edgy and there were some errors. Which logfile should I look for to review and get help with these errors??
[08:51] <KenSentMe> mikeymike-linux: Locations - Connect to server
[08:51] <mikeymike-linux> ah okay
[08:51] <mikeymike-linux> thank yo u
[08:52] <mooky> re-align depends where you got the errors
[08:52] <mzli> line2 ,

[08:52] <Shaye> ?
[08:52] <mzli> vo_driver = "xv,sdl,x11"
[08:52] <jordan_> roycebarber: If you set up Ubuntu so you can write to NTFS drives, wine will be able to also

[08:57] <dooglus> I'm trying to get php5 and apache2 working together, but when I visit a .php file, the server sends the file to me unprocessed.  what might I have done wrong?
[08:57] <Xaphoo> hmm, I installed the msttfcorefonts package and now all my fonts in firefox are small... what are the default firefox fonts again?
[08:57] <Sasuke> dooglus, okay i had to get a few more packages
[08:57] <waddletron2k> dooglus: are you familiar with php5 and apache2
[08:58] <Sasuke> i'm using php4 i belive
[08:58] <dooglus> waddletron2k: nope.
=== Nicholas is now known as Acc3ss
=== Acc3ss is now known as Tru7h
[08:59] <Xaphoo> what are the default fonts that firefox uses?
[08:59] <xarq> anyone know somewhere I can check the status of new video cards becoming supported for Ubuntu?  I have an ATI 1900GT crossfire
[08:59] <waddletron2k> dooglus: that is probably the root of the problem
[08:59] <jordan_> ndowens: Awesome
[08:59] <waddletron2k> xarq: hey, ltns
[08:59] <xarq> waddletron2k: yeah, been really busy
[08:59] <Sasuke> dooglus, ok open up text editor and type in there
[08:59] <Sasuke> <? phpinfo(); ?>
[09:00] <Tru7h> My GRUB loader is corrupted - how can I remove it and boot up Windows?
[09:00] <Sasuke> save it as info.php then mv it to /var/www/
[09:00] <roycebarber> JORDAN: yea, i restarted, it still didnt mount my windows drive. terminal said this: ntfsmount: error while loading shared libraries: libntfs.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[09:00] <waddletron2k> xarq: yeah, best place to check is the Radeon XOrg errata page or the ATI proprietary drivers READMEs
[09:00] <Sasuke> then open up web browser and visit http://localhost/info.php
[09:00] <waddletron2k> xarq: same here
[09:00] <CppIsWeird> during an ssh sesstion, I attempted to run xcalc  and i get the error message: X connection to localhost: 10.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown.) Anyone know what the problem is?
[09:01] <mzli> <Sasuke> You nick name is instering.
[09:01] <Tru7h> I can not boot up an operating system on my laptop - any ideas?
[09:01] <dooglus> Sasuke: you have chosen to open info.php which is a PHP script.  what should firefox do?  open or save?
[09:02] <yahalom> hey guys can someone tell me what the repos for edgy are?
[09:02] <yahalom> or where i can find them?
[09:02] <Sasuke> dooglus, ok then PHP is not installed properlly so open up terminal and apt-get install php4

[09:03] <mooky> your asking every 30 seconds
=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[09:03] <Sasuke> no its a diffrent error :p
[09:03] <jordan_> roycebarber: Are you running Breezy?
[09:03] <mooky> I've seen you mention that error
[09:03] <waddletron2k> xarq: have you ever seen gnome-screensaver break after installing ATI proprietary drivers?
[09:03] <xarq> waddletron2k: hmm... xorg radeon errata, thanks  :)
[09:03] <xarq> waddletron2k: no, I've seen it run at a decent speed though
[09:03] <smoenux> lol
[09:04] <waddletron2k> xarq, the proprietary drivers aren't too bad right now... I don't think, cept for the fact that my card, Xpress 200M (RS480), is not supported ...
[09:05] <waddletron2k> and this is a c*nting laptop
[09:05] <Zambezi> When adding a IP-number in host.allow, is it just to write 123.123.123.123? In hosts.deny is it necassary to write sshd: ALL to block all IP-numbers to access.
[09:05] <eseong> jordan_,
[09:05] <waddletron2k> so I'm on a semi old driver
[09:05] <foureight84> anyone installed slab from automatix?
[09:05] <foureight84> how do i configure it?
[09:05] <jordan_> eseong: yes?
[09:05] <dooglus> Sasuke: the problem was that I needed to run 'sudo a2enmod php5' to enable the php5 module.
[09:05] <eseong> jordan_, i would like to ask, how to upgrade my ubuntu version ?
[09:05] <xarq> waddletron2k: yeah, I used to make sure I bought a "popular" graphics card but then I forgot and tried to buy a fast one.. sigh...
[09:05] <eseong> jordan_, i look on wiki and google, doenst show any toturial for that.
[09:06] <waddletron2k> this is a popular card, unfortunately
[09:06] <waddletron2k> It's in just about every AMD64 laptop made this year
[09:06] <roycebarber> Jordan; i dont know what breezy is. im running the latest ubuntu 6.10 edgy. im duel booting windowsXP on ntfs.
[09:06] <roycebarber> I dont know what im doing, if thats any help :)
[09:06] <waddletron2k> ATI are just unmotivated or unable I guess
[09:06] <jordan_> eseong: I'll get a link, do you want to upgrade to Dapper or Edgy ( Edgy is the newest ) ?
[09:07] <eseong> jordan_, edgy !
[09:07] <xarq> waddletron2k: that's lame, they were pretty motivated last year  :P
[09:07] <eseong> i386 version uh
[09:07] <waddletron2k> Maybe AMD will push them towards the light
[09:08] <roycebarber> Oh why is it so hard to mount windows. I've got it to mount in the past but it unmounts when i reboot. i've not got it to ever be write enabled tho.
[09:08] <CppIsWeird> during an ssh sesstion, I attempted to run xcalc  and i get the error message: X connection to localhost: 10.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown.) Anyone know what the problem is?\
[09:09] <jordan_> eseong: There is a chance the upgrade will break your system, you should back up anything important, seriously.
[09:09] <waddletron2k> roycebarber: maybe you need additional NTFS stuffs?
[09:09] <usamahashimi> hi all
[09:09] <roycebarber> waddeltron thats very possible. i've followed a few ntfs mounting guides so im not sure what i could be missing
[09:09] <eseong> jordan_, oh okie..
[09:09] <usamahashimi> Is there any dictionary which can be downloaded or installed into my system so i can see the meaning of any word offline?
[09:10] <waddletron2k> roycebarber: your kernel may lack support for write operations to ntfs, I can't be sure
[09:10] <waddletron2k> I would say definitel y tr y to use the latest kernel you possibly can
[09:10] <jordan_> roycebarber: sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs possibly?
[09:10] <mzli> <usamahashimi> stardict
[09:11] <usamahashimi> mzli: and how can i install it?
[09:11] <Xaphoo> ntfs can't be written to from linux, only read
[09:11] <Xaphoo> there are beta ntfs drivers called ntfs-3g I think, but they are risky to use
[09:11] <jordan_> eseong: I am looking for the tutorial now...
[09:12] <Ademan> i'm trying to transfer my home folder over samba but it keeps stopping at 107 files copied, no errors or anything, just stops
[09:12] <mzli> synaptic
[09:12] <mzli> search stardict
[09:12] <Ademan> Xaphoo: actually as i understand it the 3g driver is quite stable, just proprietary
[09:12] <roycebarber> Jordan, when i typed that into terminal it said "selecting previously unselected libntfs8". and libntfs8 was part of a error message i recieved in the past, so you may have just solved my problem.
[09:12] <Ademan> but i definitely woulnd't reccomend it for any sort of production machine
[09:12] <Xaphoo> I thought it was free but unstable... maybe I am wrong
[09:12] <Xaphoo> if it's proprietary but stable I'm gonna go install it
[09:12] <Ademan> Xaphoo: dunno, you're guess is as good as mine lol
[09:12] <mzli> system->admin->synaptic
[09:12] <usamahashimi> Xaphoo: there is a software "ntfs-3g" which can help you to write in ntfs file system
[09:13] <usamahashimi> mzli: thanks
[09:13] <ClayG> anyone here built or used a custom built notebook?

[09:14] <coastermaster> does anyone else have problem's with rainlendar's transparency?
[09:15] <jordan_> eseong: First, to test something, run: sudo apt-get update && gksudo "update-manager" and tell me what happens.
[09:15] <CppIsWeird> during an ssh sesstion, I attempted to run xcalc  and i get the error message: X connection to localhost: 10.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown.) Anyone know what the problem is?\
=== pitfall is now known as gourdin
[09:15] <Ademan> coastermaster: what seems to be the problem? and also whats wrong with the evolution calendar? it integrates directly with evolution which is very nice
[09:15] <xarq> CppIsWeird: you may need to turn on ssh forwarding for X
[09:15] <glatzor> jordan_: you can also click on "check" in update-manager
[09:15] <jordan_> !repeat | CppIsWeird
[09:15] <ubotu> CppIsWeird: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[09:15] <glatzor> so no need to do apt-get update
[09:16] <CppIsWeird> sorry jordan, i've just been at this... 6 or 7 hours now
[09:16] <CppIsWeird> getting a bit fustrated at this point
[09:16] <xarq> CppIsWeird: turning on ssh forwarding?
[09:16] <CppIsWeird> yep
[09:16] <CppIsWeird> everything says go... accept its not
[09:17] <Ademan> how do you start your session? ssh -X  foo@bar ?
[09:17] <CppIsWeird> i think my cygwin isnt doing something right in declareing what screen it wants
[09:17] <xarq> CppIsWeird: you just need to turn on one setting and restart ssh server if it's ubuntu to ubuntu
[09:17] <CppIsWeird> ssh 555.555.555.555 -l username -X
[09:17] <xarq> CppIsWeird: oh, it might be tricky with cygwin
[09:17] <Tru7h> How do I change my boot settings?
[09:17] <CppIsWeird> its supposed to be easy with cygwin
[09:18] <xarq> CppIsWeird: can you run any X apps in cygwin?
[09:18] <Epidemik> why can i only hear the login and logout sounds. Nothing else makes sounds
[09:18] <CppIsWeird> i can do a startX and yes, it will come up with a window
[09:18] <Ademan> Tru7h: /boot/grub/menu.lst  just do "man grub" on the command line
[09:18] <jordan_> eseong: What happened / what is happening?
[09:18] <Tru7h> Ademan: Do you know how I can completely remove grub?
[09:18] <Ademan> Tru7h: why would you want to remove grub?
[09:19] <jeffz> edgy eft, I have fglrx set as my device driver in xorg.conf but I type fglrxinfo and it shows Mesa, any ideas?
[09:19] <Epidemik> why can i only hear the login and logout sounds. Nothing else makes sounds
[09:19] <Ademan> you'd need to replace it, not just remove it, if you jsut removed it you'd have a completely unusable system (except for liveCDs)
[09:19] <ruxpin> is there a guide how to update glibc?
[09:19] <Ademan> jeffz: did you restart X?
[09:19] <jeffz> Ademan: yeah.
[09:19] <Tru7h> Ademan: Ubuntu doesn't work on my laptop. I'm past trying to fix it, and Windows works fine, so I want to restore my computer to use Windows as soon as I turn it on, without having to reformat and reinstall.
[09:19] <CppIsWeird> mother ******
[09:19] <yahalom> can someone tell me what this means? 0% [Waiting for headers] 
[09:19] <yahalom> it wont move
[09:20] <jeffz> Ademan: fglrx kernel module is loaded at boot.
[09:20] <Xaphoo> I wish gdesklets was better
[09:20] <Tru7h> yahalom: It's configured wrong, double-check your ports and everything.
[09:20] <jeffz> yahalom: you might need to set a proxy if you don't ahve direct internet access
[09:20] <CppIsWeird> i didnt think to do it in the startx prompt
[09:20] <CppIsWeird> and it works
[09:20] <Ademan> Tru7h: you need to reinstall the windows bootloader, i'd google for that
[09:20] <Xaphoo> is there a good gnome alternative to gdesklets?
[09:20] <CppIsWeird> *hangs head against desk*
[09:21] <yahalom> Tru7h, jeffz it worked while my repos were dapper now that they're edgy it wont work
[09:21] <eseong> jordan_,  what u mean ?
[09:21] <Xaphoo> gdesklets troublesome with beryl installed
[09:21] <dnite> I'm in need of some regex help here. I found the program obexftp which lets me connect to and 'browse' my bluetooth phone.. but when receiving files, it requires the actual filenames.. so if i paste the output it gives me when i list all the files, could anyone help me put together a |grep statement to grab all the filenames?
[09:21] <Ademan> Xaphoo: there's adesklets but i was rather unimpressed by them
[09:21] <Xaphoo> yeah I couldn't figure out how to get that one working, I figured it wasnt worth it
[09:21] <coastermaster> rainlendar is also a little weird with beryl
[09:21] <jordan_> eseong: Did you run: gksudo "update-manager"
[09:21] <jordan_> ?
[09:21] <yahalom> and when i do update it connects
[09:21] <jeffz> Ademan: any other ideas?
[09:21] <Tru7h> Ademan: Could I just make a floppy and use that to boot?
[09:21] <eseong> jordan_, yep
[09:22] <coastermaster> is there anyway to make beryl not affect certain processes?
[09:22] <jordan_> eseong: Now press the check button
[09:22] <ruxpin> dist-upgrade wants to pull 386 kernel sources .. why?
[09:22] <dnite> or, it apears that the output from obexftp is just xml.. any way i could parse this in a small and simple script? I want to just make a console script that retrieves all the pictures from my phone...
[09:22] <Ademan> jeffz: honestly i don't have an ati card so i couldnt tell you lol
[09:22] <eseong> jordan_, check ? or relord ?
[09:22] <jeffz> Ademan: should just work :/
[09:22] <Ademan> Tru7h: i dunno, google for restore windows bootloader
[09:22] <jordan_> ruxpin, Are you trying to upgrade to Edgy?
[09:23] <eseong> jordan_, Your distribution is no longer supported
[09:23] <eseong> Please upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu Linux. The version you are running will no longer get security fixes or other critical updates. Please see http://www.ubuntulinux.org for upgrade information.
[09:23] <Ademan> jeffz: yeah, well i lied, my "server" computer has an ati card, and originally i installed the drivers, and it worked fine, so i dunno
[09:23] <eseong> jordan_, i get from them
[09:23] <CppIsWeird> any reason why its so freaking slow?
[09:23] <CppIsWeird> VNC works faster, and thats the entire screen, not just one application
[09:23] <Tru7h> Ademan: It still loads GRUB, and gives me an error since I uninstalled Ubuntu already.
[09:23] <mzli> <CppIsWeird>use top to watch
[09:23] <Ademan> CppIsWeird: why what is slow? ssh? its always been slow for me
[09:24] <xarq> CppIsWeird: are you using vmware?
[09:24] <CppIsWeird>  top to watch?
[09:24] <CppIsWeird> xarq: no.
[09:24] <blaaat> how can I change the resolution of the liveCD? It only supports up to 640*480 but I know I can run 1024*768
[09:24] <Ademan> Tru7h: well if you wanted you could create a grub boot disk, and from there install the necessary grub files (that were on your ubuntu partition) onto your windows partition
[09:25] <CppIsWeird> mzli what is top to watch?
[09:25] <jordan_> eseong: Ok, that means the upgrade is that much more likely to break, go here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades and follow the "Upgrading by changing sources and the command line" instructions
[09:25] <Ksilebo> Hello, anyone know why I can't see all 8 GB of RAM installed in my server?
[09:25] <eseong> jordan_, i just see :)
[09:25] <eseong> jordan_, it din't work well...
[09:26] <eseong> jordan_, i just search inside ubuntu forum.. dats what i found all there..
[09:26] <Ademan> is there any way to make the tar command ignore files it doesn't have access to?
[09:27] <jordan_> eseong: It is risky, that is why you should back up first.
[09:27] <Ademan> i'm trying to backup my home directory into a tar.gz but it hangs on the xserverauth which is owned by root i believe it is
[09:27] <Ademan> hangs is the wrong word, it errors on it
[09:27] <xarq> Ksilebo: some motherboards won't accept two different kinds of RAM
[09:27] <eseong> jordan_, i hope ubuntu will send me a copy of the cd
[09:27] <eseong> jordan_, i just request from them.
[09:28] <Ksilebo> xarq: This server was running all 8 GB with CentOS.
[09:28] <glick> hiu
[09:28] <glick> hi
[09:28] <Ksilebo> Do I need to enable PAE or hugemem or something?
=== Hit3k_ is now known as Ht3k
[09:28] <glick> is eft worth upgrading to from dapper?
[09:29] <jordan_> eseong: Unless you have a lot of setting that you can't loose, you might want to do a fresh install of Edgy instead of upgrading from breezy
[09:29] <zorba64> glick: weelllll....an upgrade could be fun for you???
[09:29] <glick> fun for me?
[09:29] <glick> fun for me how?
[09:30] <xarq> yeah, loose your settings... just pipe them to /dev/null
[09:30] <zorba64> glick: missed the heavy sarcasm huh :)
[09:30] <Ksilebo> This is really pissing me off because there's $2k worth of RAM in that server not fully being used.
[09:30] <dnite> if i want to install something from source.. how do i create a .deb and then install from that??
[09:30] <xarq> Ksilebo: I would ask on ubuntu forums or search for someone who's had the problem
[09:30] <jordan_> glick: Doesn't really answer your question, but a lot of the people having problems upgrading are doing it wrong, don't edit your sources.list if you do upgrade use: gksu "update-manager -c"
[09:30] <Ksilebo> There's no straight answers anywhere.
[09:31] <roycebarber> Woohoo I'm slowly going insane! I've followed at least four NTFS mounting guides, perfectly, and Ubuntu still wont mount my ntfs on boot.
[09:31] <re-align> Ksilebo, make sure you've installed the right kernel for your processor architecture. If it's a fresh install it will likely have a generic kernel (i386 or somesuch).
[09:31] <Ksilebo> Its i686 SMP
[09:31] <xarq> what is the command to tell xorg to reconfigure?
[09:31] <jordan_> dnite: Instead of running make install, run checkinstall
[09:31] <Ksilebo> Its a dual Xeon, so that was among the first things I did.
[09:32] <dnite> jordan_, thanks
[09:32] <re-align> Aren't Xeon's 64 bit?
[09:32] <glick> jordan_, well by upgrading i mean switching, by any means, to edgy
[09:32] <jordan_> xarq: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[09:32] <Ksilebo> re-align Not these.
[09:32] <re-align> Ah...that sucks...
[09:32] <Ksilebo> Itanium was Intel's 64bit
[09:33] <zorba64> Ksilebo: what about linux-image-server-bigiron & linux-image-server
[09:33] <Ksilebo> But hey the mobo, proc, and RAM were relatively free.
[09:33] <jordan_> glick: It depends on what you use your computer for.
[09:33] <re-align> Yeah, and the IA64 architecture sucked...
[09:33] <glick> jordan_, just personal stuff
[09:34] <jordan_> glick: If you like Beryl and have an nvidia or intel card, I would say it is definately worth it
[09:34] <Xaphoo> kiba dock is too much
[09:34] <Xaphoo> I'm not sure if I like it
[09:34] <glick> whats beryl?
[09:34] <Xaphoo> but I'm glad it exists
[09:34] <jordan_> glick: A fork of compiz
[09:34] <Ksilebo> zorba64: Looking at linux-image-server
[09:34] <glick> oh i dont want to run that
[09:35] <re-align> I think I read somewhere about how there was a certain limit to the physical RAM that Ubuntu can handle without some addon package or configuration adjustment...
[09:35] <blitznl> I was just watching a xgl demo on youtube, but what caught my attention was an exact replica of the mac os x menu (with magnifying). Anyone who knows what this thing is called and if it is available for ubuntu?
[09:36] <Xaphoo> beryl makes my desktop run faster rather than slower
[09:36] <re-align> Unfortunately, I don't remember what the limit was or what to do to exceed it...I don't have enough RAM to pay attention to that particular section...
[09:36] <waddletron2k> Xaphoo: that's strange
[09:36] <re-align> I think it was somewhere in the Community Docs
[09:36] <Xaphoo> no, it's just because all the window rendering is running off of my graphics card instead of my cpu
[09:36] <Xaphoo> it's accelerated
[09:36] <jordan_> glick: If dapper does everything you want, why switch? It is kind of a hard question to answer, wheather it is worth it
[09:36] <waddletron2k> perhaps it is benefiting from the GPU helping out
[09:36] <waddletron2k> yeah
[09:37] <jordan_> glick: it was worth it to me.
[09:37] <Ademan> is there a gnome based backup utility?
[09:37] <MikeDK> yo jordan_ did u get a hold on amir yesterday??
[09:37] <jordan_> MikeDK: I dont' remember what you are talking about.
[09:38] <roycebarber> Someone help.... When i type the following command, terminal says Cant Install, No Such File or Directory: "sudo dpkg -i libfuse2_*.deb fuse-utils_*.deb ntfsprogs_*.deb libntfs8_*.deb"
[09:38] <progek> Hello everyone, anyone know how I can burn a .avi to a DVD rom? I have gnomebaker and k3b but don't I need to create an iso first?
[09:38] <vegiVamp> progek: the app will do that for you, on the fly
[09:38] <MikeDK> u asked me to tell him if came back that he should go look in #kubuntu
[09:39] <Fried^Chicken> Hai everyone!
[09:39] <jordan_> roycebarber: Are you currently in the folder that has those .debs in it?
[09:39] <re-align> erm...Ademan, ever thought of using sudo -i and from there taring up your folder? You should be able to set the ownership of the tar file after it's done.
[09:39] <glick> yeah i think ill just stick with dapper for a while
[09:39] <jordan_> roycebarber: You can check with: ls
[09:39] <waddletron2k> roycebarber: it's very simple, you have to find those files and make sure you are in the same directory and that you are typing the correct names
[09:39] <zorba64> roycebarber: that's for debs you have downloaded?
[09:39] <Ademan> re-align: yeah, only problem is when i do that it errors on the .serverauth file because i don't have access
[09:40] <re-align> Even as root you don't have access?
[09:40] <dope> hey so should i get ubuntu or xubuntu
[09:40] <waddletron2k> dope: depends on your prefrences
[09:40] <waddletron2k> preferences*
[09:40] <jordan_> dope: What kind of hardware will you be running it on?
[09:40] <dope> intel p4
[09:40] <progek> vegivamp: thanks, so say I use k3b, should I choose the burn DVD iso option?
[09:40] <Ademan> re-align: well i didnt do it as root
[09:40] <Healot> dope: I am telling you to get Ubuntu :)
[09:40] <zorba64> dope: ya...or kubuntu...or fluxbuntu...ad nauseum
[09:40] <dope> 1 gig
[09:41] <dope> jesus what's with all the buntus
[09:41] <Ademan> but i don't really want the xserverauth file in there...
[09:41] <dope> i've no idea which one to get
[09:41] <vegiVamp> progek: pretty much - you say you want a data dvd, drag the files onto it, and click burn
[09:41] <waddletron2k> Get Ubuntu dope.
[09:41] <Ademan> dope: get ubuntu if you've got semi-decent specs
[09:41] <dope> oh
[09:41] <dope> yea i do
[09:41] <dope> it goes vroom
[09:41] <jordan_> dope: Regular Ubuntu will fly on that, so it is really personal preference.
[09:41] <roycebarber> I installed files using this command in terminal, because a guide said so: "sudo apt-get install libfuse2 fuse-utils"    and they installed somewhere, im not sure where. so then the guide said simply type the following to install ntfs package:  "sudo dpkg -i libfuse2_*.deb fuse-utils_*.deb ntfsprogs_*.deb libntfs8_*.deb"     and thats when i got the No Such File or Directory.
[09:41] <waddletron2k> Then you can make a decision about what flavor is appropriate for you
[09:42] <progek> oh sorry, I should have been clearer, I downloaded a .avi which I would like to view on my dvd player. So it cannot be a data disc.
[09:42] <Ksilebo> admin@aku:~$ cat /proc/meminfo
[09:42] <Ksilebo> MemTotal: 8317288 kB
[09:42] <dope> and ubuntu can't use a NTFS file system?
[09:42] <Ksilebo> dope: Readonly by default
[09:42] <dope> dammit
[09:42] <Healot> read: yes; write no
[09:42] <Healot> linux kernel doesn't do that by default
[09:42] <re-align> Ademan, there is a graphical archiving utility built into Gnome, but it's not normally on the menu. However, one can put it on the menu using the menu editor.
[09:42] <dope> cause i got 2 harddrives
[09:43] <Fried^Chicken> Hai, everyone
[09:43] <dope> and they're ntfs
[09:43] <jordan_> roycebarber: That guide is out of date
[09:43] <dope> full of shit
[09:43] <Fried^Chicken> how is you
[09:43] <Healot> need 3rd party modules lke ntfs-3g
[09:43] <Ksilebo> zorba64: Thanks, you have saved me thousands of grey hairs.
[09:43] <binmkdir> dope: thanks to microsoft, ntfs is only supported readonly. because they do not release any specs.
[09:43] <dope> ah, well that's nice of them
[09:43] <zorba64> Ksilebo: np :)
[09:43] <dnite> if something i'm compiling relies on a certain module and when trying to run make, i get a file not found error for that modules header file.. does that mean i just have to install the kernel source to build off of? or the kernel headers?
[09:43] <dope> so how do i go about installing ubuntu
[09:43] <jordan_> !fuse | roycebarber
[09:43] <ubotu> roycebarber: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[09:44] <dope> can i just put the iso on a pen drive and install like that?
[09:44] <roycebarber> Jordan; the guide i mentioned just now says its a ubuntu 6.10 guide. i guess i need to do more searching then.. (sigh)
[09:44] <progek> dope: you can go to ubuntu.com and either download an iso or use shipit to get a dapper cd
[09:44] <Fried^Chicken> Where is everyone
[09:44] <dope> i'm d/ling the iso
[09:44] <Fried^Chicken> huh
[09:44] <what_if> is there a way to force a package to install using apt?
[09:44] <misieq> is ubuntu 6.10 dvd image available yet?
[09:44] <Fried^Chicken> stop typing so much
[09:44] <re-align> dope, only if you can boot from your pendrive...
[09:44] <Fried^Chicken> cant see nothin
[09:44] <dope> hmm
[09:44] <dope> i wonder if i can
[09:44] <danage> hello, is there someone who maintains EVOLUTION for UBUNTU
[09:44] <what_if> package ax25-utils fails with "no install target
[09:44] <dope> ok it finished
[09:45] <binmkdir> dope: you cannot boot a iso from a pen drive. you have to burn the iso to a cd.
[09:45] <dope> ok cool, will it make it a bootable disk?
[09:45] <jordan_> roycebarber: Mabe not, I just thought that those were old debs ( I skimmed the instructions ) and it is always better to use guides from the official wiki
[09:45] <binmkdir> dope: the is IS bootable, you don't have to make it bootable. just burn it to cd as iso.
[09:45] <roycebarber> jordan; the wiki i used is http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[09:46] <dope> ok sweet, thx brethren
[09:46] <roycebarber> Ubotu; i will see how far i get with the ntfs link you provieded :)
[09:46] <wilson_H> FliesLikeABrick: Can I ask you a question? I just install ubuntu edgy onto a machine, when installing it, I chose "chinese", and now when I use terminal to run "apt-get install", it show me information in chinese, but I really prefer English(desktop's menus  and terminal should display English)
[09:46] <wilson_H> FliesLikeABrick: Can you tell me how to do that?
[09:46] <jordan_> roycebarber: Ubotu is an IRC bot, I told it to give you that link
[09:47] <glick> haha
[09:47] <roycebarber> Haha, thanks Jordan, i wasnt sure how he knew so much, im not suprised youre the super brain behind it :D
[09:47] <jordan_> roycebarber: Not really, I didn't make the bot, I just typed !fuse :)
[09:48] <glick> heh freakshow is pretty funny lately, at first i hated it, now, i find it pretty funny
[09:48] <jordan_> I have to get some sleep, bye.
[09:49] <terrox> is there an easy console command to use gfxboot with ubuntu theme? and will it work on 6.10 ?
[09:49] <wilson_H> FliesLikeABrick, Are you there?
[09:50] <danage> is there an EVOLUTION maintainer for UBUNTU
[09:50] <O2> hello
[09:50] <thill2708> why is it that when I unplug my wired connection I lose my routing information, and my default device doesn't switch over to my wireless connection?
[09:50] <wilson_H> All,   Can I ask you a question? I just install ubuntu edgy onto a machine, when installing it, I chose "chinese", and now when I use terminal to run "apt-get install", it show me information in chinese, but I really prefer English(desktop's menus  and terminal should display English). Can you tell me how to do that?
[09:50] <O2> I wonder could my Pocket-PC connnect with ubuntu?
[09:50] <glick> wilson_H, select your language as english?
[09:50] <re-align> I had some errors upgrading to Edgy. Here's a paste from the main.log from the dist-upgrade folder. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29967/
[09:51] <glick> and make up your mind if you want chinese or english?
[09:51] <Fried^Chicken> You all needa gtfo
[09:51] <Fried^Chicken> gtfo my room brah
[09:51] <waddletron2k> no wai
[09:51] <wilson_H> glick,I did
[09:51] <terrox> i'll get out when you tell me how to use gfxboot themes
[09:52] <fishsponge_> hey people... can anyone point me to a small, concise guide to install ubuntu over the network using NFS ??
[09:52] <nisq> ls
[09:52] <nisq> woops
[09:52] <waddletron2k> Sorry, all I have are ones the length of Crime And Punishment in the Latin Vulgate
[09:53] <glick> its too bad, alot of people at my work have only used fedora linux, so they think that linux is gerally a crappy system
[09:53] <glick> most of them have never heard of ubuntu
[09:53] <nisq> things slow down in the evening
[09:53] <waddletron2k> glick: most of them are not worth your time :-)
[09:53] <glick> waddletron2k, why not?
[09:53] <nisq> hehe so true
[09:53] <waddletron2k> because they're obviously not adventurous
[09:53] <waddletron2k> else they would have heard of Ubuntu by now
[09:54] <glick> thats screwed up reasoning
[09:54] <Ademan> re-align: what's your question?
[09:54] <glick> ubuntu doesnt exactly have commercials on tv
[09:54] <waddletron2k> Not really, adventurous people pick up a lot of stuff. It's pretty hard to have a view of Linux on the internet without Ubuntu making up a part of the scenery
[09:55] <waddletron2k> Ubuntu doesn't exactly have to advertise either.
[09:55] <amichai_> how can i force apt-get to overwrite a file?
[09:55] <re-align> I'm trying to correct some errors noteed during my upgrade form Dapper to edgy. Paste of the main.log from the dist-upgrade log folder: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29967/
[09:55] <ifireball> wilson_H: you can try changing the default language from system-?administration->language support
[09:55] <amichai_> when i do upgrade it said cant overwrite a specific file
[09:55] <waddletron2k> Maybe they haven't been exploring linux very long.
[09:55] <re-align> The last line is what concerns me the most.
[09:55] <waddletron2k> That's certainly possible
[09:56] <roycebarber> Someone help with my NTFS Mounting:     In Using This Guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse      ,      When i told terminal "bash:~$ sudo ntfsmount /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 -o umask=0007", terminal gave the error   "Fuse_Mount Failed, Unmounting C."
[09:56] <dnite> does anyone know how to only 'get' certain things from the output of a program you run? The output goes <file name="DSC00400.JPG" size="241123"/> for each line, but I'd like to only capture the actual filename to a variable in a small script i want to create.. i'm really bad w/ regex and grep and whatever else i need to use...
[09:56] <O2> does anybody know whether ubuntu could sync with pocket-pc phone>
[09:56] <fishsponge_> hey people... can anyone point me to a small, concise guide to install ubuntu over the network using NFS ??
[09:56] <O2> does anybody know whether ubuntu could sync with pocket-pc phone?
[09:56] <Ademan> waddletron2k: i disagree, i think that ubuntu needs the advertisement as much as if not more than any commercial operating system
[09:56] <O2> help please
[09:56] <ifireball> anyone here tried doing Oracle10g (no XE) install on Ubuntu?
[09:56] <Fried^Chicken> YOUR MOM CAN SYNC WITH POCKET PHONES
[09:57] <WindDragon> o2: did u try to connect already?
[09:57] <glick> at my work we use XP on the desktop and redhat 9 and fedora in the labs
[09:57] <zorba64> O2: plug the f....r in and see what happens
[09:57] <waddletron2k> Ademan: fair enough, but Ubuntu is a prominent distribution without it
[09:57] <re-align> Fixing Firestarter ought to be easy, I just don't know what that last line means or what caused it.
[09:57] <O2> WindDragon: I tried just now, but failed
[09:57] <terrox> what is the actual theme file in GFXboot ubuntu?
[09:58] <WindDragon> did u get anything if do sudo fdisk -l?
[09:58] <Ademan> waddletron2k: prominent among linux distros, linux has a tiny share of the desktop market, so it has about 30% of a 1.6% market, i'd say the word needs to get out...
[09:58] <glick> i wonder if i should order like 60 CDs or so and pass them out at work
[09:58] <O2> my phone display " connecting", and then failed!
[09:59] <Dzany> hello!   Is there any way to install ubutu 6.10 in text mode?
[09:59] <waddletron2k> Ademan: I agree, but I was not disputing that
[09:59] <roycebarber> Anyone know why I get the error "fuse_mount failed. Unmounting C." when i try to mount my windows drive???
[09:59] <glick> but i feel guilty doing that cause ubuntu has limited runds
[09:59] <glick> funds
[09:59] <WindDragon> 02: definitely it will fail. but try sudo fdisk -l. see what u get
[09:59] <Ademan> glick: burn your own?
[09:59] <Fried^Chicken> gtfo african country
[09:59] <Fried^Chicken> burrrrrrrr
[10:00] <waddletron2k> Will Edgy have AIGLX?
[10:00] <glick> Ademan, yeah but people like "official" cds
[10:00] <glick> to give something a chance
[10:00] <WindDragon> yes waddle
[10:00] <waddletron2k> I would wait for Edgy to be stable. Everybody loves the candy.
[10:00] <O2> fdisk -l ?
[10:00] <Ademan> i was gonna do that, burn a bunch of ubuntu cds print up labels and cd cases and maybe even a begginer's manual and build a cardboard stand out of old boxes and set it up in front of comp usa with like "stronger better faster" written on it or something
[10:00] <Dzany> Is there any way to install ubutu 6.10 in text mode?
[10:00] <WindDragon> with sudo in front )2
[10:00] <Ademan> but then i realized i may be a nerd, but i don't have THAT much free time :-)
[10:00] <coastermaster> is there a good konfabulator replacement that plays nice with Beryl?
[10:00] <WindDragon> 02*
[10:00] <ifireball> waddletron2k: AFAIK its stabel but no AIGLX
[10:01] <waddletron2k> They can't resist the candy, infact. It seems like people just start using it to play with it like it was a toy, which some ppl might see as bad but I think it's terrific... because everyone loves to play.
[10:01] <O2> WindDragon: I did it just now. it list those dev/hda1~7
[10:01] <roycebarber> None of you can help me with my "Fuse_mount failed. UnMounting C Drive" Error..........
[10:01] <po0f> Edgy's Xorg has AIGLX...
[10:01] <zorba64> Dzany: ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
[10:01] <Ademan> beryl really IS just a toy...
[10:01] <Ademan> at this point anyways
[10:02] <waddletron2k> roycebarber: Someone on the forum perhaps?
[10:02] <re-align> !beryl
[10:02] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[10:02] <glick> compbiz isnt enabled by default is it?
[10:02] <Ademan> i mean, cmon, the "burn effect" looks great, impresses your friends... but man i that useless
[10:02] <WindDragon> O2: ur pocket pc is in USB? anything it says abot sdaXXX?
[10:02] <waddletron2k> Ademan: yeah, totally agree :)
[10:02] <O2> yes, it's in the usb now.
[10:02] <waddletron2k> But I think it's a novel toy
[10:02] <O2> WindDragon:  yes
[10:03] <Ademan> man, i've never used that, i've used metacity, beryl, compiz, kwm, and fluxbox, but never fvwm lol
[10:03] <O2> WindDragon: there isn't sda...
[10:03] <pazemlsqdfmo1> .
[10:03] <Ademan> kwm IS the KDE wm right?

[10:03] <WindDragon> 02:anything said about sdaxx? when u do fdisk -l?
[10:03] <waddletron2k> yes Ademan
[10:03] <pazemlsqdfmo1> anyone: how can i let linux inherit permissions from parent?
[10:03] <zorba64> roycebarber: u just want to mount windows ntfs partition?
[10:04] <waddletron2k> Ademan: you have to be a bit odd or know specifically the behavior you want
[10:04] <O2> WindDragon: no, it only list five hdaXX
[10:04] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: when you're creating a file i believe it applies a umask on top of the parent file's permissions
[10:04] <re-align> zorba64, I think he wants to have write access to it.
[10:04] <WindDragon> 02: so it was not detected at all....
[10:04] <waddletron2k> Ademan: FVWM is so agile that it's close to being a tool for building desktops instead being a desktop itself
[10:04] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: how can i change this?
[10:04] <zorba64> re-align: ah...playing with stuff that might go bang
[10:05] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: currently files that i create (in nautilus) have -rw------- and i need at least -rw-rw----
[10:05] <O2> WindDragon: In ms windows, my ppc can connect well.
[10:05] <glick> ubuntu desktops need more then 18 months support
[10:05] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: dunno, but you could do them by hand (or create all our files and then chmod -R the folder)
[10:05] <re-align> zorba64, yeah, well...that's M$ for  ya...
[10:05] <glick> it seems like its too short for me
[10:05] <WindDragon> 02: try doing Wine ans install MS synch
[10:06] <WindDragon> it should work... maybe..
[10:06] <dope> ok i got a bootable copy up
[10:06] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: this would be tiresome, it is meant a shared folder where all group members can read/write
[10:06] <O2> WindDragon:  but when I reconnect the usb wire, my ppc connects, but failed
[10:06] <dope> how do i see my other drives
[10:06] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: well if its a shared folder you're creating the files through samba?
[10:06] <Ademan> or wait
[10:06] <WindDragon> 02: yes it will try to connect. but since there will be compatibility issue, it failed..
[10:06] <waddletron2k> Although I admit it does not quite fit the tiling window managers like wmii or ratpoison, but with window placement policies you can get very similar effects with the exception of specific client-based placement (like you get with --geometry)
[10:06] <Ademan> sorry i was thinking network share, this is just shared between users on the computer?
[10:07] <zorba64> roycebarber: is it already mounted at all...like ro
[10:07] <O2> WindDragon: maybe. what pity
[10:07] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: not necessarily, cause one of the users is on this computer, the other is my laptop
[10:07] <O2> I would tried it in KDE
[10:07] <O2> see u
[10:07] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: well there's definitely a way, i'd look into umask
[10:08] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: ive done nothing but that for hours on end (spent a lot of time on it yesterday as well) i just cant find it, i also posted on ubuntuforums, got no answer (posted like 6 hours ago)
[10:08] <dope> cause i have 3 partions
[10:08] <CppIsWeird_> how do i see what process are currently running?
[10:08] <dope> and i can't see them
[10:08] <WindDragon> o2: try this -> http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index...gename=Xanadux
[10:08] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: hrm, hold on i'll do a quick google, but i sincerely doubt i'll have any more luck than you
[10:08] <ruxpin> CppIsWeird_: ps cfax
[10:08] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: k thx
[10:09] <WindDragon> 02: there is a thing called rapip. google it. it may help you connect ut pocket pc to linux
[10:09] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: btw, i cant find "inherit permissions" setting ni smb.conf, do i have to add this myself? if so, where?
[10:10] <dope> can i not change my resolution with a live cd of ubuntu
[10:10] <CppIsWeird_> if i ran "squid" from command line, and it goes back to command prompt almost immidately, is squid running? or will it hold it there while squid runs?
[10:10] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: maybe to circumvent my problem, i could access my local drives through the network, hence access at all times through samba?
[10:10] <WindDragon> 02: try this link too: http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/BlueAngel

[10:11] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: interesting idea, but just to clarify, are you on GNOME or KDE?
[10:11] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: gnome

[10:11] <WindDragon> oic
[10:11] <WindDragon> tnx
[10:11] <zorba64> s'ok
[10:11] <Chandu> How do I download udebs using debmirror command
[10:12] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: well by default when you're creating ANY file it SHOULD simply create the file with the permissions of the parent folder
[10:12] <SpaceFrog> hey guys
[10:12] <nisq> !pocket pc
[10:12] <SpaceFrog> i've got a serious problem. my sound has stopped working
[10:12] <Ademan> but usually a umask is applied
[10:12] <SpaceFrog> How can i reconfigure it?
[10:12] <Nickle0de0n> Hiya, all. I want to cut an encoded mpeg file into halves. to make 'em fit a 700MB vcd. SVCDs. Problem is, i cant do it with ffmpeg
[10:12] <overrider> what is a good way to deny access to users mounting their own media, such as usb keys and cd-roms ?
[10:13] <re-align> Anyone know where to find a driver for thee ALPS touchpad and trackpoint?
[10:13] <SpaceFrog> i need to reconfigure my sound to the way it was when i first installed, default settings.. it worked fine then
[10:13] <Ademan> so if you set the samba umask to "pass through" ie not make any changes, that should effectively be "inherrit from parent"
[10:13] <Nickle0de0n> any suggestions for a softwware that would do the job.
[10:13] <Healot> sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-sound-base > SpaceFrog
[10:13] <dope> how do i open command prompt
[10:13] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: as far as nautilus/gnome, i found a few mailing lists which seemed to have the same problem
[10:13] <Nickle0de0n> downloaded mjpegtools too. didnt know how to work 'em.
[10:13] <xyzone> Nickle0de0n: mencoder maybe
[10:13] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: one curious fact btw, when i "touch" a file, i get -rw-rw-rw, its only when i do through nautilus that i get -rw------
[10:14] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: but -rw-rw-rw is also not what i want ;)
[10:14] <Ademan> oh lol] 
[10:14] <progek> Hello all, I just installed transcode and would like to convert a AVI to VOB. Anyone know how I can do that? Or does anyone know of a gui frontend for transcode?

[10:14] <progek> awesome, thanks
[10:15] <nisq> dope try control-alt-f1
[10:15] <binmkdir> dope: alt-f2 should open a "run program..." box, there type: xterm
[10:15] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: wierd... maybe it only obeys the umask? i dunno, there's definitely a way to set the umask for bash though
[10:15] <nisq> oh shell prompt - sorry
[10:15] <dope> how do i get out of shell prompt
[10:16] <nisq> dope exit
[10:16] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: i would need the same umask for any program, so i dont have to check permissions every time i save with something new :P
[10:16] <nisq> type "exit"
[10:16] <dope> tried it

[10:16] <jarrad> Dope, are you downloading in the prompt?
[10:17] <Dzany> which is?
[10:17] <dope> i'm just in a prompt

[10:17] <nisq> dope you think your in windows?
[10:17] <binmkdir> dope: alt-f7
[10:18] <dope> hey that did it
[10:18] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: unfortunately its 1:00 in the morning here, i'm going to call it a night, i'm sorry i couldn't be any help to you
[10:18] <binmkdir> dope: you had switched to a text console
[10:18] <Dzany> where it can be downloaded? or made?Is there any how-to?
[10:18] <pazemlsqdfmo1> Ademan: k, thx anyway ;)
[10:18] <dope> what's text mode
[10:18] <nisq> dope that was a virtual console....   xterminal is a shell
[10:18] <dope> oh
[10:18] <Ademan> pazemlsqdfmo1: i don't know when the majority of users are on, but maybe sometime around 3:00 eastern time might be a good bet, again sorry i wasnt much help, and best of luck to you
[10:19] <nisq> Text is command line  --  correct me anyone if I am wrong
[10:19] <binmkdir> nisq: nope, not a shell. a shell runs in both.
[10:19] <zorba64> it's that mysterious white text in the black......
[10:19] <binmkdir> nisq: they are just different types of terminals
[10:19] <Trist_an> Is there aother task manager except top.My firefox is not responding and killall mozilla-firefox doesn't do a thing
[10:19] <Dzany> where it can be downloaded? or made?Is there any how-to?I mean about that alternate install
[10:19] <nisq> A virtual console is a shell then?
[10:19] <zorba64> Trist_an: ps x

[10:20] <WindDragon> Dzany-> dl it from the ubuntu site..
[10:20] <po0f> nisq: A shell runs in a console/terminal emulator.
[10:20] <binmkdir> nisq: a virtual console is a terminal. it can run a shell or other text based things.
[10:20] <nisq> thanks

[10:22] <xyzone> po0f: I mean in a terminal screen not in X
[10:22] <Trist_an> zorba64, and after I have the pid and the process launch, what can I do?
[10:22] <po0f> xyzone: vga=0x318 as a kernel parameter?
[10:22] <nisq> xyzone make it a full screen terminal
[10:22] <zorba64> kill pid

[10:24] <davef> hi
[10:24] <po0f> I noticed that too, I won't tell.  ;)
[10:24] <nisq>    xyzone nevermind   but I use gnome-terminal, you can customize the fonts.
[10:24] <tux_J_> hello
[10:24] <Nickle0de0n> hi, just a question, am trying to learn any programming language. but i don't have any idea how good what is. I kinda know about oop, compiled/interpreted language and all that jazz. but am wondering, whether a language like C# is better than C++
[10:24] <davef> hello
[10:24] <xorllu> zorba64, i have installed build-essential!!!

[10:24] <po0f> Nickle0de0n: Try Python.
[10:25] <xyzone> yeah, I guess I'll just stick with xchat
[10:25] <zorba64> xorllu: then maybe libstdc++6?
[10:25] <nisq> but then there is the learning process....   I was never able to comprehend windows stuff
[10:26] <xyzone> binmkdir: either way there's no way to get variable width fonts in a terminal right?
[10:26] <nisq> xyzone  which terminal?
[10:26] <xyzone> the bios terminal, or whatever it's called
[10:26] <po0f> xyzone: No, there isn't.

[10:26] <dope> can i use a resolution of 1680x1050
[10:27] <xyzone> binmkdir: yeah, I was pretty sure of that.
[10:27] <zorba64> Trist_an: kill 6879?
[10:27] <nisq> you can customize in the Xresources

[10:41] <Condorcet> hello overyone - do u know how to im using gnome (ubuntu) + kopete - but i cannot enable webcam in kopete - it works fine in kubuntu environment - any idea what i need to install to make it work?
[10:41] <progek> applications,  accessories
[10:41] <Bardamu> hello
[10:41] <KenSentMe> hellomoto2007: just download the alternate cd from the ubuntu website
[10:41] <Hawk||-> fahadz, i think in systemtools, or somewhere there
[10:41] <fahadz> found it
[10:41] <reazn> Condorcet - i belive kopete is a KDE application, not gnome.
[10:41] <hellomoto2007> i cant find the alternate cd link
[10:41] <Condorcet> i know, but works fine in gnome reazn
[10:42] <progek> fahadz, I think you can also do ALT+F2 then just type xterm. I'm using Fedora right now but miss ubuntu :(
[10:42] <ivx> hellomoto2007 they make a distro of ubuntu for not so new computers, you could try that
[10:42] <beammeup> Do you have an idea how an outgoing tcp connection can be blocked without anything in iptables?
[10:42] <reazn> Condorcet - so does gaim :P
[10:42] <dade`> ops it was a 2.6.18.1
[10:42] <Condorcet> reazn: but gaim has no webcam support
[10:42] <reazn> true
[10:42] <fahadz> got the terminal running, now what should I type to mount my hdd?
[10:42] <Condorcet> thats the point
[10:42] <zorba64> hellomoto2007: what country ar you in?
[10:42] <matason> Are the options auto-generated when you right-click something?
[10:42] <reazn> wern't gaim going to include it in the latest version?
[10:42] <Condorcet> i want some gnome app with webcam
[10:42] <rredd4> dope the ubuntu book has a lot of good info, commands.. etc  go to ubuntu.com to see some of whats inside it..!
[10:42] <KenSentMe> hellomoto2007: just scroll down when you clicked a download mirror
[10:42] <progek> fahasz: try sudo mount /dev/hda
[10:43] <hellomoto2007> europe mate
[10:43] <KenSentMe> hellomoto2007: but you could also try xubuntu, it's a lighter ubuntu version
[10:43] <fishsponge_> can anyone help? i need to dump the configuration of a newly built system so it can be cloned using the network install... does anyone know how to dump the configuration in the format of an auto-install script?
[10:43] <fahadz> ok thanks
[10:43] <compilerwriter> Anyone here update to edgy yet?
[10:43] <zorba64> hellomoto2007: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#currentrelease
[10:43] <hellomoto2007> ty
[10:43] <Sacker> beammeup: What port is getting blocked?
[10:43] <KenSentMe> compilerwriter: i did
[10:43] <reazn> compilerwriter - yep
[10:43] <ivx> compilerwriter, yeah
[10:43] <compilerwriter> How did it go?
[10:44] <matason> Does it take awhile for packages to become available?
[10:44] <KenSentMe> compilerwriter: pretty well
[10:44] <reazn> i had an issue with beryl..
[10:44] <beammeup> 443
[10:44] <KenSentMe> matason: how do you mean that?
[10:44] <reazn> apart from the beryl issue, it was fine.
[10:44] <ivx> compilerwriter, i just did a complete reinstall while i was at it, went good
[10:44] <Sacker> https is getting blocked?
[10:44] <zorba64> matason: such as?
[10:44] <beammeup> Right, everything else works fine and iptables is empty
[10:44] <matason> Well if you upgrade from 6.06 can you install the same packages for say MySQL etc?
[10:45] <fahadz> terminal doesnt finds any hda
[10:45] <hellomoto2007> ok im downloading the alternate now
[10:45] <smoenux> hi all... what is the command to shut down my x-server (running gnome)
[10:45] <reazn> anyone else have a pentium D & having issues with edgy & it detecting the dual core?
[10:45] <hellomoto2007> i dont think my laptop had enuff RAM for the liveCD
[10:45] <matason> Or do you have to wait for packages specifically for edgy?
[10:45] <Nickle0de0n> ANYONE used qemu here?
[10:45] <compilerwriter> What would happen in a reinstall.  Would the hard drive get reformatted etc.  Or would the files that have changed just get replaced?
[10:45] <Condorcet> hey what is the best gnome IM with webcam?
[10:45] <zorba64> /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[10:45] <binmkdir> Nickle0de0n: i do
[10:45] <hellomoto2007> it runs Xp profesional ok, i would of thought it cld run ubuntu installed?
[10:45] <rredd4> when is the next LTS version of ubuntu coming out?
[10:45] <KenSentMe> matason: well, it's better to use edgy packages, but for servers it's the best to keep using dapper i think
[10:45] <smoenux> thx zorba64
[10:46] <hellomoto2007> how much space does it take up?
[10:46] <ivx> compiler, if you do a complete reinstall it reformats, but the have a command to just upgrade and you keep your stuff
[10:46] <beammeup> I use a direct dialup internet connection and tried different providers, so there is no external firewall issue
[10:46] <matason> KenSentMe: Thanks
[10:46] <KenSentMe> hellomoto2007: you can try ubuntu, but if it works too slow, there's always xubuntu
[10:46] <nisq> !terminal
[10:46] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via applications -> accessories -> terminal (gnome) or kmenu -> system -> konsole (kde). Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[10:46] <hellomoto2007> okies
[10:46] <fishsponge_> can anyone help? i need to dump the configuration of a newly built system so it can be cloned using the network install... does anyone know how to dump the configuration in the format of an auto-install script?
[10:46] <n00mz> I've installed Anjuta and all the "required dependancies", but apparently I'm still missing libraries when I build?  Is there any way I can get a full list of what I need?
[10:46] <hellomoto2007> what is xubuntu
[10:46] <po0f> rredd4: I would assume when support for 6.06 expires.
[10:46] <binmkdir> hellomoto2007: ubuntu with xfce instead of gnome
[10:46] <compilerwriter> ivx But in any case I should back up my stuff in case I have to resort to a full install?
[10:46] <KenSentMe> !xubuntu > hellomoto2007
[10:47] <Sacker> beammeup Is it every https site? or just a certain few? or one?
[10:47] <WindDragon> hellomoto2007: xfce  desktop environment
[10:47] <hellomoto2007> ty kensentme
[10:47] <beammeup> every https site
[10:47] <ivx> compiler, backing up stuff is always a good idea incase of hardware failure or something of that sort
[10:47] <beammeup> I even tried telnet xyt 443
[10:47] <rredd4> po0f yeah  i guess so
[10:47] <Nickle0de0n> binmkdir: does it work well? I miss adobe illustrator/photoshop and need to run 'em.
[10:47] <Nickle0de0n> wondering if the memory requirements and installer would work on 'em.
[10:48] <ivx> compiler nothing should get lost though
[10:48] <ESPOiG> everytime i boot into edgy my dns servers are set bak to default /etc/resolv.conf do u think it is because of my network being dhcp
[10:48] <Hawk||-> jup
[10:48] <binmkdir> Nickle0de0n: qemu is slower than vmware, but it can run windows xp. i compiled qemu 0.8.1 from source and it works fine.
[10:48] <zorba64> Nickle0de0n: how much RAM have you got...vmware usually does fine
[10:48] <kalikiana> My CastleNet USB DSL modem is causing (strace) lsusb to freeze. Any suggestions?
[10:48] <m3m0r3xXx{}> Can i make local domains from my router to my inside network ?
[10:49] <ivx> compilerwriter gksu "update-manager -c"
[10:49] <Sacker> beammeup: You tried using a different broswer other then Firefox?
[10:49] <m3m0r3xXx{}> And howto
[10:49] <m3m0r3xXx{}> :))
[10:49] <compilerwriter> Have the issues people have been having been worked out?
[10:49] <beammeup> sacker: same problem with different apps. even telnet 443
[10:49] <mtymobile> hi all folks!!
[10:50] <timppa> hi
[10:50] <nisq> hi mtymobile
[10:50] <ivx> compilerwriter, what kind of computer is this going to be installed on, i have had no problems
[10:50] <rredd4> when i install nvidia-glx, it wants to install the 386 kernel.  why?  i use the 686 kernel (dapper) for ndiswrapper.
[10:50] <hellomoto2007> is there any people here that use xubuntu, is it as good?
[10:50] <compilerwriter> It is being installed on an old Dell.
[10:50] <nisq> I have used it since 5.04,   love it
[10:50] <mtymobile> hellomoto2007: i use it, really great if you have some time to set it up nicely
[10:51] <ivx> hellomoto2007 http://www.xubuntu.org/
[10:51] <m3m0r3xXx{}> Can i make local domains from my router to my inside network ?
[10:51] <Hawk||-> hellomoto2007, yes, i got an amd k6 500mhz with 384Mb ram, it works fine and faster than ubuntu
[10:51] <Nickle0de0n> well, zorba64, 512. I could up it- but the processor is quite on the low end. 2.4ghz. will try vmware then.
[10:51] <hellomoto2007> yeh im looking through the website
[10:51] <kalikiana> ellomoto2007: of course xubuntu is good, what do you wanna know?
[10:51] <mtymobile> hey does anybody have probs with the hibernate function?
[10:51] <kalikiana> ellomoto2007: and btw there is #xubuntu :)
[10:51] <ivx> hellomoto2007 apperently it just has the minimum stuff needed to run, then you just put what you need to run
[10:51] <hellomoto2007> i wondered how its diffrent to ubuntu, what doesnt it install that ubuntu does?
[10:52] <hellomoto2007> ooo kool
[10:52] <nisq> mtymobile have no use for it
[10:52] <Hawk||-> hellomoto2007, OO for example..
[10:52] <mtymobile> nisq: i do, since i'm using a laptop
[10:52] <Hawk||-> i think, but not sure
[10:52] <kalikiana> hellomoto2007: it installs xfce, of course, and apps with no gnome or kde dependencies
[10:52] <nisq> If I use it on my laptop it takes my battery down.
[10:53] <reazn> !ping
[10:53] <ubotu> ping: connection timeout
[10:53] <mtymobile> nisq: do you have suspend2 patch2A
[10:53] <fishsponge_> can anyone help at all? i need to dump the configuration of a newly built system so it can be cloned using the network install... does anyone know how to dump the configuration in the format of an auto-install script?
[10:53] <nisq> how do I adjust the hybernate to not use the battery
[10:53] <hellomoto2007> so is ubuntu with minimal, programs
[10:53] <nisq> isnt suspend different than hibernate
[10:53] <Hawk||-> fishsponge_, only solution i can think about is to make a image of ur disk..
[10:54] <hellomoto2007> i can load software myself- i was hoping tho the xubuntu wld have the same GUI
[10:54] <mtymobile> nisq: suspend2 is a kernel patch and it's equal to winshit hibernate
[10:54] <nisq> I just use the lock screen if I am using the laptop consistantly throughout the day
[10:54] <Hawk||-> hellomoto2007, it's not the same, but similar
[10:55] <hellomoto2007> ok
[10:55] <matason> Any ideas about my right-click question? How is the list of options generated?
[10:55] <kalikiana> hellomoto2007: the gui is a bit differing - as always you can use theems
[10:55] <nisq> oh sure, make me eat my words.    I just use a screen lockout,    I only use windows when someone needs me to service them
[10:55] <fishsponge_> Hawk||-: so there's no way of fully automating an ubuntu install over the network??
[10:55] <mtymobile> nisq: you can never live without hibernate, if you're using a laptop
[10:55] <hellomoto2007> ahh ok
[10:55] <nisq> Sure can mtymobile
[10:55] <c8bb5jw9xi> hehe
[10:55] <mixandgo> any ideea why cups won't start in edgy ?
[10:55] <Jaak_> can someone send/show me reference to and new stuff/apps in the new 6.10 distro?
[10:55] <nisq> My laptop is 64 bit,   takes no time to boot
[10:55] <jeffz> hm, after my upgrade to edgy fonts in firefox don't appear to be anti-aliased or something, they're pixelated
[10:55] <Hawk||-> fishsponge_, i really don't know, if there is one, i want to know about it either..
[10:56] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: do you get some error when you run dmesg or look at /var/log/syslog?
[10:56] <mtymobile> nisq: ah ok, but hibernate is still faster
[10:56] <Hawk||-> fishsponge_, maybe u should ask question later this day..
[10:56] <kalikiana> My CastleNet USB DSL modem is causing (strace) lsusb to freeze. Any suggestions?
[10:56] <nisq> mtymobile   not by much,,,
[10:56] <hellomoto2007> i have a qu, say i used the spreadsheet program, will the files created be editable/viewable on say excel, witch 90% of users have
[10:56] <fishsponge_> Hawk||-: thank you... i shall keep asking...
[10:56] <jeffz> kalikiana: don't strace lsusb.
[10:56] <nisq> takes time to hybernate too
[10:56] <nisq> let alone come out of it
[10:56] <kalikiana> hellomoto2007: i'll look just now...
[10:57] <jeffz> kalikiana: or unplug the device.
[10:57] <hellomoto2007> ty
[10:57] <KenSentMe> hellomoto2007: if you save them as ms excel file yes
[10:57] <nisq> dang,,,,,    am I trolling or what,    nevermind
[10:57] <hellomoto2007> oo u can do that?
[10:57] <mtymobile> so.... apart from nisq who uses hibernate???
[10:57] <nisq> hehe
[10:57] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, nope, no error
[10:57] <zorba64> Jaak_: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[10:57] <KenSentMe> Jaak_: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[10:57] <KenSentMe> zorba64: lol
[10:57] <kalikiana> jeffz: i noticed that after i plugged the modem in, lsusb will freeze -> so strace was the only way to get a reaction
[10:57] <fignew> nisq: hibernation always takes time
[10:57] <fignew> no matter what the OS is
[10:57] <fishsponge_> can anyone help? i need to dump the configuration of a newly built system so it can be cloned using the network install... does anyone know how to dump the configuration in the format of an auto-install script?
[10:57] <zorba64> KenSentMe: missed by that much 99 :)
[10:58] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: and what do you get when you run sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart?
[10:58] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: in terminal that is
[10:58] <hellomoto2007> also could someone tell me how hard it is to install ubuntu off the alternate cd? is it prity much walked thourough or do i have to alter lots of complicated settings
[10:58] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, I get OK
[10:58] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, also running cupsd doesn't do anything
[10:58] <KenSentMe> hellomoto2007: not so hard, mostly the same options, but then in text-mode installer
[10:58] <fignew> hellomoto2007: alternative CD is easy
[10:58] <boink> is the alternate cd just an install CD ?
[10:58] <zorba64> hellomoto2007: if you can read and use tab and enter u should be ok
[10:59] <kalikiana> hellomoto2007: it supports excel and openoffice for opening and saving, is that what you wnated to know?
[10:59] <boink> with no desktop?
[10:59] <nisq> fignew tell that to mtymobile
[10:59] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: if it's restarted then cups runs
[10:59] <binmkdir> hellomoto2007: installation will be in text mode, menu/dialog driven
[10:59] <Hawk||-> hellomoto2007, if u got an 450mhz pc, use xubuntu... u will not have much fun with ubuntu... i promise...
[10:59] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, no it doesn't
[10:59] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, cups it's not running
[10:59] <hellomoto2007> ok ty
[10:59] <fignew> ?
[10:59] <binmkdir> zorba64: many newbies can't read anymore...
[10:59] <hellomoto2007> :)
[10:59] <mtymobile> fignew: what?
[10:59] <Hawk||-> hellomoto2007, i tried it a few times...and then tried xubuntu, and its much faster for me...
[11:00] <binmkdir> zorba64: read & understand i mean :)
[11:00] <fignew> nisq: tell what?
[11:00] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: mixandgo there might be something wrong in your config, but if it restarts without an error it runs
[11:00] <hellomoto2007> hmm
[11:00] <nisq> what you told me
[11:00] <fignew> about hibernate?
[11:00] <nisq> fignew do you use hibernate?
[11:00] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, if it runs it should pe in ps -ax ! and it's not
[11:00] <mtymobile> fignew: tell me tell me a bout hibernate
[11:00] <zorba64> binmkdir: yah...so it would seem........:)
[11:00] <fignew> nisq: sometimes... suspend 99% of the time
[11:01] <fignew> mtymobile: what do you want to know?
[11:01] <nisq> cool,   does suspend use the battery power up?
[11:01] <kalikiana> jeffz: so any other suggestions to my usb modem problem?
[11:01] <binmkdir> zorba64: windows has brainwashed them
[11:01] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: what do you get when you run ps aux|grep cups
[11:01] <mixandgo> KenSentMe, nothing
[11:01] <hellomoto2007> il will try xubuntu then, ty
[11:01] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: hmm
[11:01] <fignew> yes, suspend uses a very small amount, I'd say I could suspend my laptop for 5 days
[11:01] <zorba64> binmkdir: not only them too...eg Novell
[11:02] <hellomoto2007> i see theres a kubuntu as well?
[11:02] <boink> yes
[11:02] <boink> kubuntu uses kde
[11:02] <Hawk||-> yes
[11:02] <KenSentMe> mixandgo: can you stop it by sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys stop?
[11:02] <mtymobile> fignew: i have my laptop that when i try to hibernate (without suspend2patch) it takes like 10 minutes to write to disk
[11:02] <sc0tt> !nvidia
[11:02] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:02] <jeffz> kalikiana: lsusb is probably waiting for a response from the device
[11:02] <sc0tt> !@#
[11:02] <sc0tt> !nv
[11:02] <boink> !kubuntu
[11:02] <ubotu> Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment. For more info see http://kubuntu.org for support: #kubuntu ; to install from Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[11:02] <nisq> I will try fignew...   but often I forget and when I need the laptop it is dead
[11:02] <jeffz> kalikiana: kalikiana does the device show in dmesg?
[11:02] <fignew> mtymobile: is it actually writing, or just sitting there?
[11:02] <nisq> I hate it when that happens
[11:02] <erUSUL> kalikiana: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem
[11:03] <kalikiana> jeffz: unfortunately even after half an hour, lsusb won't answer
[11:03] <mtymobile> fignew: hibernate works, it's just that it takes forever to write
[11:03] <Hawk||-> mhh kalikiana was a name from a ship in starwreck right?!
[11:04] <nisq> Thanks for saying that mtymobile.....
[11:04] <mtymobile> fignew: for instance: i leave the laptop to hibernate and take up to 20 min to actually turn off
[11:04] <fignew> mtymobile: yes, but while it's taking forever, is it actually doing anything (is the HD light blinking?)
[11:04] <nisq> time is time,   why wait?
[11:04] <mtymobile> fignew: yes
[11:05] <Hawk||-> nisq, but if u have to go, and take ur notebook with u , its a looong time...
[11:05] <fignew> Hawk||-: moving the notebook while it's writing to the HD is bad
[11:05] <Hawk||-> yes i know...
[11:05] <fignew> mtymobile: 1 sec
[11:05] <kalikiana> Hawk||-: that's interesting, i got the name becuase it's the hawaiian equivalent to my name 'christian' :)
[11:06] <nisq> HawkII,   I got a plugin for the lighter socket in the car,   I just use the lock screen
[11:06] <v3rmap> I need to share a folder in my Ubuntu machine (using Samba) so that winduhs machines on my network can access the folder. Is there any graphical tool that I can use?
[11:06] <Hawk||-> kalikiana, mhh i read ur name again, and misses some caracters... its kalinka in starwrek
[11:06] <kalikiana> jeffz: i sayd sth about it, i think, but i got no id or sth :/
[11:06] <nisq> almost instantly I am back up and running, very little time lose
[11:06] <hellomoto2007> i cant wait to get a new desktop and chuck ubuntu on it
[11:06] <nisq> Why would i Want to hibernate?   It takes more time to hibernate than to reboot?
[11:07] <fignew> mtymobile: what does sudo hdparm -tT /dev/hda
[11:07] <fignew> say?
[11:07] <kalikiana> erUSUL: thx, i'll see what i find there
[11:07] <v3rmap> nisq:hibernate preserves your open programs.
[11:07] <mtymobile> fignew: some testing aye
[11:07] <fignew> also, mtymobile how much ram does your laptop have?
[11:08] <mtymobile> fignew: Timing cached reads:   680 MB in  2.01 seconds = 338.55 MB/sec
[11:08] <acuster> Hey all, what's the ubuntu approach to sharing my internet connection? (i.e. I connect by wireless and nat another machine connected by ethernet)
[11:08] <mtymobile> fignew: 512
[11:08] <fignew> what about buffered?
[11:08] <mtymobile> fignew:  Timing buffered disk reads:   54 MB in  3.06 seconds =  17.64 MB/sec
[11:09] <fignew> mtymobile: what about sudo hdparm -d /dev/hda
[11:09] <kalikiana> erUSUL: do you know where to get the 'list of USB ADSL modems' the page is talking about?
[11:10] <mtymobile> fignew: using dma
[11:10] <fignew> how big is your swap partition?
[11:11] <fignew> kalikiana: have you tried it under different distros?
[11:11] <fignew> it could just be a bug in this particular kernel?
[11:12] <mtymobile> fignew: 1 gb
[11:12] <bestadvocate> hello
[11:12] <kalikiana> fignew: i only tried xubuntu becuase i that's what i use most of the time; so could it be just the kernel?
[11:12] <mtymobile> bestadvocate: hello
[11:13] <fignew> kalikiana: I would try something like knoppix and see if it works under that
[11:13] <mtymobile> kalikiana: if you like xfce try dreamlinux
[11:13] <boink> would xubuntu be better for an ancient Sony Vaio laptop?
[11:14] <boink> I tried using the live cd on that ancient Sony Vaio, but neither 6.06 nor 6.10 would boot
[11:14] <hellomoto2007> whats the shell? does everyone using linux know loads of commands
[11:14] <fignew> mtymobile: solution: use suspend instead :P (i'm stumped)
[11:14] <tehuti> hello all... will a flash-based Sony .mp3 player mount and will drag-and-drop work?
[11:14] <KenSentMe> boink: try using alternate cd's for a text mode installer
[11:14] <kalikiana> mtymobile: i already tried that but it appeared to lack consistency, like it did not work good together with itself
[11:14] <mtymobile> boink: you should go with a custom install instead of running ubuntu or xubuntu
[11:15] <hellomoto2007> boink-- im downloading the alternate cd foe xubuntu as we speak
[11:15] <KenSentMe> boink: and for older pc's it's maybe better to use xubuntu instead of ubuntu, it's lighter
[11:15] <boink> that's what I think too .. gnome can be bloaty at times
[11:15] <kalikiana> fignew: yes, maybe it should do that, good idea :)
[11:15] <boink> <= windowmaker fanatic :P
[11:15] <VSpike> The Dapper Drake install CD would not start on my machine unless i went for safe graphics mode.  Now I'm installed (immediately upgraded to Edgy) I'm on the VESA driver.  I just followed these instructions http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24557 but it hangs the system.  Any ideas?  Card is a X800 GTO2
[11:15] <po0f> KenSentMe: The CDs feel the same weight to me.  ;)
[11:15] <mtymobile> fignew: but before installing xubuntu i used gentoo, and hibernate worked great and fast
[11:15] <hellomoto2007> i read that xubuntu only needs 64mb or RAM once its inctalled and only 1.5gb of disk space
[11:16] <KenSentMe> po0f: you can hardly feel the difference :)
[11:17] <po0f> mtymobile: You might try compiling your own kernel then.
[11:17] <boink> I've never used the WM on xubuntu .. I think I'll give it a go :)
[11:17] <mtymobile> po0f: do you use hibernate?
[11:17] <mtymobile> xfce rocks linux world
[11:18] <mtymobile> hey guys, what about ratbuntu
[11:18] <mtymobile> :D
[11:18] <binmkdir> or aubuntu? :)
[11:18] <po0f> mtymobile: No, my laptop has a life of about 1.5 hours, so I don't bother taking it anywhere I don't have access to a plug.
[11:18] <WindDragon> mtymobile: but things and info are not too much compared to kubuntu and ubuntu
[11:18] <boink> or tubuntu .. for those who like pain
[11:18] <hellomoto2007> can u customise xubuntu if so in what ways?
[11:18] <WindDragon> m not sure if canonical is doing that intentionally
[11:19] <boink> well, for most sane people .. ubuntu and kubuntu are fine
[11:19] <WindDragon> hellomoto2007: so many ways.. compiz... beryl...
[11:19] <mtymobile> boink: tubuntu??
[11:19] <VigoFuse> Why does the Loading Firefox screen just poop out and then nothing from LiveCD
[11:19] <tehuti> do Sony .mp3 players work with Ubuntu?
[11:19] <po0f> mtymobile: Plus, it doesn't play nice with the savage driver, and I never bothered resolving the issue.
[11:19] <WindDragon> boink: u mean using xubuntu is insane?
[11:19] <binmkdir> mtymobile: i guess twm
[11:20] <mtymobile> ah great twm
[11:20] <mtymobile> po0f: don't get mad but i have to tell you: your lappy is shit
[11:20] <kalikiana> binmkdir: aubuntu, like for autistic persons? *lol*
[11:21] <po0f> mtymobile: I think I was the first one who realized that, thank you.  ;)
[11:21] <binmkdir> kalikiana: hehe, no. it would be with afterstep window manager. but i guess afterstep is dead anyway.
[11:21] <nisq> am I in another forum beside ubuntu?
[11:21] <nisq> Am I lost?
[11:21] <christianp> hi all
[11:21] <kalikiana> binmkdir: oh, ok, nearly the same. :)
[11:21] <zalbor> Is there an easy way to tell which disk grub considers to be hd0? I have two disks, one is seen as the first by default, but I've set it to be second in the BIOS settings. I've had trouble with ubuntu not seeing them in the right order before, and I don't want to install grub on the wrong one.
[11:22] <mtymobile> boink: don't forget blowbuntu, the ubuntu for debian loving pornstars
[11:22] <christianp> i have to install python 2.3.5 in my ubuntu edgy. How can i do this? It's safe to use dapper package?
[11:22] <mtymobile> zalbor: hd0 is the primary master
[11:22] <kalikiana> nisq: what's wrong?
[11:22] <mnepton> christianp: 2.4 won't work?
[11:23] <Seveas> chrisbudden14, python 2.3 is not supported
[11:23] <boink> thanks lads .. I'm downloading kubuntu now
[11:23] <christianp> mnepton, for my zope 2.8.8 installation it's not right :)
[11:23] <mtymobile> zalbor: unless you have a dev in the primary master which is not a disk
[11:23] <kalikiana> Are there repositories for alternative edgy kernels?
[11:23] <Seveas> chrisbudden14, and it's very unsafe (if at all possible) to install it in edgy
[11:23] <zalbor> mtymobile:  Even if I've set another one as first? For example, dapper sees my third master as hd0 because I've set it first in the BIOS. But the grub installation in dapper still sees it as hd1.
[11:23] <nisq> I am trying to find the Ubuntu forum,,,,,    join #ubuntu?
[11:24] <Seveas> !forum
[11:24] <ubotu> The Ubuntu forums can be found at http://www.ubuntuforums.org
[11:24] <christianp> Seveas, what you mean with "unsafe"? Can it brake my installation?
[11:24] <boink> nisq: this is #ubuntu
[11:24] <mnepton> christianp: 2.4 works, it just hasn't had a Zope audit
[11:24] <boink> !ask
[11:24] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:24] <Seveas> chrisbudden14, it not only can, it will
[11:24] <mtymobile> zalbor: what do you mean by bios position?
[11:24] <christianp> mnepton, zope 2.8.8 needs python 2.3.5
[11:24] <nisq> thanks
[11:24] <Seveas> christianp, then use ubuntu zope packages...
[11:24] <mnepton> christianp: incorrect
[11:24] <nisq> for a moment I thought I was somewhere else
[11:25] <Seveas> !info zope edgy
[11:25] <ubotu> Package zope does not exist in edgy
[11:25] <Seveas> !find zope edgy
[11:25] <ubotu> Found: python-zopeinterface, zope-common, zope-debhelper, zope3, zope3-doc (and 97 others)
[11:25] <mnepton> christianp: http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.8.8/Zope-2.8.8-released
[11:25] <zalbor> My primary master is an old disk with win98. Winxp and ubuntu are on my third master. So I've set the bios to look for an OS to boot in the 3rd master first, instead of the primary, which is the default.
[11:25] <Seveas> !info zope3 edgy
[11:25] <ubotu> zope3: Open Source Web Application Server (Libraries). In component main, is optional. Version 3.2.2-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 4051 kB, installed size 27928 kB
[11:25] <zalbor> mtymobile: Message above, I forgot to include your name
[11:25] <mtymobile> zalbor: hd values are absolute in grub, they don't depend on the bios boot order
[11:25] <Zaire> how do you change the font color for the cli konsole?
[11:26] <nisq> Someone correct me if I am wrong, but when you install the Grub, it does it on the first master?
[11:26] <kalikiana> Are there repositories for alternative kernels?
[11:26] <mtymobile> zalbor: so if you need to boot the second disk on third partition you sould boot from hd1,2
[11:26] <christianp> mnepton, as you can see in the link: Using Python 2.4.X is not supported and not recommended at this time
[11:26] <mnepton> nisq: it installs where you tell it to. MBR or partition
[11:26] <nisq> mnepton on which drive?
[11:27] <christianp> Seveas, i need zope 2.8.8
[11:27] <mnepton> christianp: what i *don't* see is "Zope 2.8.8 will not work with Pythin 2.4"
[11:27] <nisq> I know about the partition stuff
[11:27] <Seveas> christianp, that doesn't mean it does not work...
[11:27] <Zaire> Im running transparent konsole and the font colot is impossible to see how do you change it?
[11:27] <zalbor> mtymobile: I just checked my menu.lst in dapper. It's set to boot from hd0, which indeed is my third master. But last time I used grub-install, it thought hd0 was my primary master.
[11:27] <nisq> And I know how to set the grub, but when I install it on another drive it always set things on the first drive
[11:28] <mnepton> christianp: "Python 2.4.X will be supported when a security audit takes place."  <--- as i previously said, the only thing preventing Zope from certifying 2.4 is their own audit.
[11:28] <Kwako> hi
[11:28] <Kwako> how can i join the ubuntu french canal ?
[11:28] <pazemlsqdfmo1> how do i turn off the grouping of tabs in my task bar? its annoying the crap out of me
[11:28] <christianp> Seveas, mnepton: my products (in Zope) needs python 2.3.5
[11:28] <nisq> ah master,  what be I doing right or wrong?
[11:28] <Seveas> Kwako, type this: /join #ubuntu-fr
[11:28] <kalikiana> Kwako: #ubuntu-fr i think
[11:28] <Kwako> thanks
[11:28] <Seveas> christianp, then fix themor don't use ubuntu 
[11:28] <zalbor> pazemlsqdfmo1: Right clock on the small space on the left of the window list, preferences
[11:28] <nisq> ah master primary
[11:28] <zalbor> *click
[11:28] <mnepton> christianp: then good luck. installing a downgraded Python in Ubuntu is not for the timid.
[11:29] <pazemlsqdfmo1> zalbor: you're a life saver :D first thing to go right in a long time :|
[11:29] <christianp> Seveas, mnepton ok, thanks
[11:29] <kishore> how to change the path from /var/cache/apt/archives to .. specified folders
[11:29] <zalbor> One is glad to be of service...
[11:29] <mnepton> i get the distinct odor of BS ...
[11:29] <Seveas> mnepton, then take a shower
[11:29] <nisq> Now if I remove the master and make the slave the master, it boots using the MBR into XP
[11:29] <mtymobile> zalbor: let's repeat hd0 = primary master, hd1=primary slave, hd2=secondary master, and so on
[11:29] <mnepton> Seveas: sorry, my odor is intractable.
[11:29] <mnepton> :/
[11:30] <kishore> during downloading pakages it get dloaded defaultly..at /var//... how to change tat path
[11:30] <kishore> can we change tat path... :(
[11:30] <Seveas> kishore, you don't want todo that
[11:30] <zalbor> mtymobile: If that's definitely so, then how come I can boot dapper when menu.lst says to boot from hd0 which is /dev/sda?
[11:30] <zalbor> (and my other disk is /dev/hda)
[11:30] <nisq> is mtymobile correct about the hd0 and hd2?
[11:30] <dom_f> Hi all - on a fresh install of edgy how do I add 'terminal' to the menu I get from a right click on my desktop?
[11:30] <kishore> Seveas, i want to change the path .. can i..
[11:31] <nisq> hmmm.... let me check my grub out
[11:31] <mnepton> zalbor: hd* numbers are prety much arbitrary
[11:31] <dooglus> dom_f: install nautilus-open-terminal, I think
[11:31] <Seveas> kishore, you can but it's silly to do so
[11:31] <mnepton> zalbor: they are created by GRUB, and are self-referential to a degree
[11:31] <kishore> Seveas, ya its ok. even then. how to change the path
[11:32] <dooglus> kishore: what you could do is put a symbolic link there instead
[11:32] <WindDragon> dom_f : y not use yakuake... alot better
[11:32] <eXistenZ> any recommended spam filter for evolution?
[11:32] <Seveas> eXistenZ, bogofilter
[11:32] <kishore> dooglus, symbolic link in the sense wot ??
[11:32] <nisq> yep he is
[11:32] <mnepton> eXistenZ: you just need the client pieces of Spamassassin
[11:32] <WindDragon> eXistenZ: it has built-in spam filter
[11:32] <mtymobile> zalbor: i'm going crazy, please explain the hole disk set to me
[11:32] <zalbor> Still, grub while booting thinks hd0=/dev/sda and thinks hd0=/dev/hda when installing. I guess the only way to be sure is to disable the old disk.
[11:32] <kishore> dooglus, noob here... :(
[11:32] <dom_f> Thanks both
[11:33] <dooglus> kishore: ie.  mkdir /my/big/dir/archives; sudo mv /var/cache/apt/archives/* /my/big/dir/archives; sudo rmdir /var/cache/apt/archives; sudo ln -s /my/big/dir/archives /var/cache/apt/archives
[11:33] <dooglus> kishore: run each of those commands one after the other if you don't get any errors.
[11:33] <po0f> dooglus: Or you could just replace the ; with &&.
[11:33] <kishore> dooglus, cant i defaultly change..
[11:33] <mtymobile> zalbor: ahhh now i get what your problem is
[11:34] <dooglus> kishore: ie. 1) make a new archive directory somewhere where you have space, 2) move existing files to the new directory; 3) remove the old directory; 4) put a link in place so that when dpkg tries to find /var/cache/apt/archives, it really finds your new directory
[11:34] <zalbor> mtymobile: Primary master=/dev/hda. Third master=/dev/sda. No other hard disks. While installing grub (with grub-install), hd0=/dev/hda. I need to boot from /dev/sda, and the only way to do that is to type in menu.lst this: root		(hd0,6)
[11:34] <mtymobile> zalbor: what is it sda? raid? sata>
[11:34] <zalbor> Sata
[11:34] <eXistenZ> Seveas, Do you prefer bogofilter over spamassassin?
[11:34] <mnepton> zalbor: just edit /boot/grub/device.map
[11:35] <Arepie> how do i able to set startup programs?
[11:35] <kishore> dooglus, but tat new directory shud me in /var/cache/apt/ ? only
[11:35] <dooglus> kishore: I don't know if it's possible to get apt-get and/or dpkg to use a different directory.
[11:35] <Seveas> eXistenZ, definitely
[11:35] <ripper> does anybody know what would cause my pc to hang when i try to change the screen saver?
[11:35] <mtymobile> zalbor: where do you want the mbr?
[11:35] <dooglus> kishore: the new directory can be wherever you like.  preferably on a partition with lots of space
[11:35] <Seveas> eXistenZ, it's much more resource efficient (read: faster)and for me it's proven to be far more accurate
[11:35] <eXistenZ> Seveas, I see. Thanks!
[11:35] <kalikiana> ripper: make shure your opengl dirvers are workin correctly
[11:35] <kishore> dooglus, wot i actully want to do. is. .during time of dloading debs.. i want to specify the path whr to dload...
[11:35] <zalbor> mtymobile, mnepton: I want grub to be installed in the mbr of /dev/sda. device.map doesn't exist on edgy's live.
[11:36] <Seveas> kishore, 'wot', 'whr', 'dload'?
[11:36] <ripper> kalikiana im not sure how to @ openGL
[11:36] <mnepton> zalbor: installed to hda* but GRUB on sda*?
[11:36] <kishore> Seveas, sorry "what" where and download
[11:36] <zalbor> mnepton: No, everything ubuntu installed in sda. I want hda untouched.
[11:37] <mnepton> zalbor: so unplug it during installation.
[11:37] <WindDragon> zalbor: installed to hda* but GRUB on sda* -> maybe a disaster....
[11:37] <zalbor> mnepton: I guess that's the only way to be sure.
[11:37] <mtymobile> zalbor: then install it with grub-install hd1,0
[11:37] <ESPOiG> i used chmod 777 /folder/folder/* to get the contents all accessible & readable, writeable but wat if i want it to do it for all the sub dirs of the other sub dirs??
[11:37] <zalbor> WindDragon: It's not that way :)
[11:37] <kalikiana> ripper: i mean do have have any problems running opengl apps or games in fullscreen? if so, that might be a clue
[11:37] <Seveas> ESPOiG, chmod -R 777 /folder/folder/
[11:37] <po0f> ESPOiG: chmod -R
[11:37] <mnepton> mtymobile: grub-install requires a chroot and a /dev target ;)
[11:38] <zalbor> mtymobile: Is that for sure? And I want to isntall it with the edgy installer.
[11:38] <zalbor> Which simply gives a choice of hd0 or hd1
[11:38] <ripper> kalikiana not sure havent tried
[11:38] <ESPOiG> Seveas, so that will do all files and sub sub dirs, yes? and also this allows me to read, write etc them yes??
[11:38] <Seveas> ESPOiG, correct
[11:38] <ESPOiG> Seveas, thankyou
[11:39] <kalikiana> ripper: in fact, if e.g. SuperTux and the screensaver are causing trouble, it should be graphics drivers
[11:39] <mtymobile> zalbor & mnepton : i wasn't giving out the correct command, i was just saying that the disk zalbor is looking for is hd1,n
[11:39] <mnepton> mtymobile: not necessarily. it depends on what GRUB has decided hd1 is
[11:40] <zalbor> mtymobile: Although dapper boots from hd0?
[11:40] <Shaye> Easyubuntu is a great tool for beginners, don't you think?
[11:40] <zalbor> (which is the same disk)
[11:40] <Shaye> I find it very useful
[11:40] <ripper> is there a way i can manually (by editing a config file) change my screensaver back to a blank screen?
[11:40] <mnepton> Shaye: EasyUbuntu is a nightmare. :)
[11:40] <mtymobile> zalbor: mnepton seems more accurate and prepared than me on the matter, ask him
[11:40] <Shaye> ripper, why would u want to do it manually btw?
[11:40] <Shaye> mnepton, why :O
[11:41] <ripper> because when i try to change it, it hangs my system
[11:41] <seshomaru123> hi , my friend has an Ubuntu laptop - how do I find out how much memeory it has?
[11:41] <ripper> when the screen saver kicks in, my pc hangs
[11:41] <mnepton> Shaye: if *anything* goes wrong somewhere along the way it can leave a machine in an unbootable state.
[11:41] <zalbor> mtymobile: Heh, ok. THanks for the help anyhow
[11:41] <Shaye> ripper, can you tell me your specs? just out of curiosity
[11:41] <Shaye> mnepton, really? should i unistall it then?
[11:42] <po0f> seshomaru123: cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal
[11:42] <mnepton> Shaye: no, just in the future use Synaptic
[11:42] <seshomaru123> po0f, thanks
[11:42] <zalbor> mnepton: Did you understand this issue so far? hd0 in dapper's menu.lst is /dev/sda, which is where I want edgy installed, but last time I used grub-installed hd0 is /dev/hda, which I want untouched.

[11:43] <dom_f> Hi - does anyone know how fsck determines the fs type?  I have a ext3 fs that mounts & works OK but if I run fsck against it it says fsck.ntfs not found!  running fsck.ext3 manually shows it is clean.  Running fdksi-l again the disk shows the fs of type 83 (ext3).   Any ideas anyone?
[11:43] <mnepton> zalbor: i understand. and i still think the safest, easiest way is to just unplug the power form the PATA drive.
[11:43] <mnepton> *from
[11:43] <Dimensions> hi ... i am using ubuntu linux ... with apache2 ... when i try to access my pages with localhost/ i get error unlable to connect while if i instead use 127 ip then i get connected ... what is the problem ? same is the case with mysql commands i have used in php pages .. they give me error of local host too ... ?
[11:43] <dom_f> should have been fdisk -l
[11:43] <zalbor> mnepton: That's what I was thinking too. Thanks for the help everyone, I guess I'll do that to be sure. I can mount hda manually later :)
[11:43] <mnepton> zalbor: in the time you have spent asking how to avoid unplugging the drive you could have actually unplugged it like 15 times ;)
[11:44] <binmkdir> dom_f: look if your /etc/fstab lists the partition with type ntfs
[11:44] <zalbor> hehe :p
[11:44] <roycebarber> For those who care... Configuring WINE to use all the windows libraries from my WindowsXP drive, took for freakin' ever! A really long time. Anywho, my question is... Why does the Audio tab in WineCFG freeze the program?
[11:44] <eXistenZ> I need to activate the 3D acceleration of my ATI 9200. Where can I find information about that?
[11:44] <dom_f> binmkdir - fstab shows type ext3
[11:44] <mnepton> !fglrx > eXistenZ
[11:44] <zalbor> byebye, thanks again
[11:44] <binmkdir> dom_f: hmm, then i don't know
[11:45] <roycebarber> Any of you guys Wine fanatics..?
[11:45] <math_> hello there
[11:45] <po0f> roycebarber: I'm more of a beer person.
[11:45] <mtymobile> hello math_
[11:45] <math_> does someone know how to unzip zip files with dpkg?
[11:45] <math_> hi :)
[11:45] <roycebarber> *sadly shakes head* :)
[11:45] <dom_f> nice rioja!
[11:46] <Hgill> Why unzip a dpkg file?
[11:46] <math_> no
[11:46] <math_> I've a zip file
[11:46] <math_> but want to unpack it
[11:46] <math_> dunno how
[11:46] <Hgill> on the commandline type: unzip -d MY_DIR_NAME FILENAME
[11:46] <binmkdir> math_: unzip filename.zip
[11:46] <WindDragon> math_: use the default unpack utils
[11:46] <Hgill> where FILENAME is the filename (duh)
[11:46] <mtymobile> math_: may unzip?
[11:46] <math_> so I've to apt-get install unzip
[11:46] <binmkdir> math_: yes
[11:47] <Hgill> unzip is installed by default
[11:47] <math_> oh ok
[11:47] <dom_f> math_: Probably easiest to go places ->Home folder from your desktop menu, navigate to the file and doucle click on it!
[11:47] <math_> yeh... but this install is a bit plain
[11:47] <math_> lol I dont have a filebrowser...
[11:47] <eseong> how to use " chmod " command ?
[11:47] <Hgill> What do you mean, plain install.
[11:47] <math_> wich filebrowser I have to use in windowmaker?
[11:47] <gigatare> a
[11:47] <math_> well... I've got ubuntu 5.10 as server installed
[11:47] <eseong> how to use " chmod " command ?
[11:47] <ripper> ok supertux works fine
[11:47] <Hgill> xterm :-)
[11:48] <dom_f> chmod --help
[11:48] <binmkdir> math_: apt-get install mc
[11:48] <math_> mc is
[11:48] <math_> ?
[11:48] <eseong> dom_f, i tried but don't understand >.<
[11:48] <binmkdir> math_: then run mc is a terminal window
[11:48] <ripper> but yet the screensaver hangs my pc
[11:48] <mtymobile> math_: apt-cache search "yoursearch" to search new apps
[11:48] <Hgill> Midnight commander, best filebrowser since 1985
[11:48] <math_> ok thnx a lot guys
[11:48] <math_> lets see this :D
[11:48] <po0f> eseong: What are you trying to do?
[11:49] <mtymobile> eseong: do you understand what chmod does?
[11:49] <binmkdir> actually, mc (norton commander clone) is around since 1995 or so. norton commander is older.
[11:49] <dom_f> eseong: Have a look at http://www.cs.bu.edu/help/unix/using_chmod.html
[11:49] <eseong> po0f, i want to change a file to 777
[11:49] <reazn> I'm having issues using the generic kernel (i want smp).. the kernel stops booting, even in recovery mode saying "mounting root filesystem" - any idea's ?
[11:49] <po0f> eseong: chmod 777 /path/to/file
[11:49] <Shaye> Is it risky to use apt-get autoremove?
[11:50] <Shaye> I mean, it can delete files I need, right?
[11:50] <Dimensions> aahhh ... any one knows setting for apache 2 ?
[11:50] <mtymobile> Shaye: at times
[11:50] <sc0tt> interesting
[11:50] <sc0tt> when attempting to upgrade to edgy, i get "Could not calculate the upgrade"
[11:50] <kalikiana> ripper: so supertux works in fullscreen? are you able to run glxgears or the screensaver preview?
[11:50] <pazemlsqdfmo1> for samba: is domain = workgroup?
[11:51] <eseong> po0f, thanks alot bro..
[11:51] <sc0tt> pazemlsqdfmo1: domain and workgroup are different
[11:51] <Hgill> pazemlsqdfmo1: yes
[11:51] <mtymobile> pazemlsqdfmo1: by default yes
[11:51] <sc0tt> heh
[11:51] <dom_f> sc0tt:   There's a bug open for this - https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/56627
[11:51] <pazemlsqdfmo1> im trying to access my local share through samba, but i cant log in for some reason
[11:51] <pazemlsqdfmo1> while i CAN access the shares through my windows laptop....
[11:51] <reazn> I'm having issues using the generic kernel (i want smp).. the kernel stops booting, even in recovery mode saying "mounting root filesystem" - any idea's ?
[11:52] <pazemlsqdfmo1> but when i connect to the samba share i can only set domain, not workgroup
[11:52] <math_> wow, thnx a lot binmkdir!
[11:52] <ripper> screensaver preview probably hangs me
[11:52] <math_> just like norton commander :DDD
[11:52] <ripper> and yes i can run glxgears
[11:52] <ripper> and supertux does work in fullscreen w/ opengl enabled
[11:53] <binmkdir> math_: yes. and of course it doesnt need X to run.
[11:53] <math_> very cool
[11:53] <math_> I love it
[11:53] <dom_f> sc0tt: In fact there's a few - go to https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs and search for "could not calculate" without the quotes
[11:53] <math_> how you can speak to me with those red letters?
[11:53] <math_> like binmkdir:
[11:53] <dom_f> anyone know much about fsck?
[11:54] <kalikiana> ripper: hm, then it's not the kind of problem i had; I'm afraid i don't know that much to do for you then, sry
=== Popsickle_ is now known as Popsickle
[11:54] <binmkdir> math_: thats probably your irc client. i dont use any color.
[11:54] <math_> oh
[11:54] <math_> got xchat
[11:54] <Hgill> dom_f: fsck is one off the tolls I hope never to use :-)
[11:54] <math_> @binmkdir
[11:54] <math_> something like that?
[11:54] <ripper> Hgill fsck is not harmfull
[11:54] <pazemlsqdfmo1> You must log in to access user@servername/share domain MYDOMAIN
[11:54] <pazemlsqdfmo1> but i cant get logged in....
[11:55] <Hgill> no, but not needed for normal opperation...
[11:55] <binmkdir> math_: i think so. xchat uses a special color for lines addressed to your nickname
[11:55] <math_> k nice :)
[11:55] <ripper> fsck keeps filesystems sane :)
[11:55] <binmkdir> this line won't be red, i guess
[11:55] <math_> I've got also some other problem in windowmaker
[11:55] <Hgill> in sane conditions Filesystems keep themselves sane
[11:55] <math_> when I click on xterm it doesnt work
[11:56] <unfun> Iv'e got tv-out but I don't know how to use it in ubuntu, can anyone tell me where to go?
[11:56] <math_> but when I hit xterm from the menu it does
[11:56] <binmkdir> math_: don't know about windowmaker
[11:56] <math_> Could not execute command "x-terminal-emulator"
[11:56] <math_> it says
[11:56] <Nickle0de0n> ripper: i've been using fsck whenever my FS loses track of its journals and ends up failing to boot. Although fsck/e2fsck manages to fix the probs, it recurs.
[11:56] <math_> u use gnome binkmkdir
[11:56] <math_> ?
[11:56] <Nickle0de0n> could this be a physical damage?
[11:57] <binmkdir> math_: no, i use xfce
[11:57] <Nickle0de0n> to the HD.
[11:57] <math_> ok nice
[11:57] <math_> like that one
[11:57] <math_> xubuntu?
[11:57] <binmkdir> math_: not here, but yes.
[11:57] <Hgill> Physical damage, maybe, or the FS does not get Umoaounted proppperly
[11:57] <math_> :)
[11:57] <math_> I'm very happy with mc
[11:57] <unfun> !tvout
[11:57] <ubotu> For help with enabling the TV-Out on certain NVidia cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOutNewbieEdition
[11:58] <Nickle0de0n> Hgill: but it uses the default fstab options. and i think the dump/pass are both set to 1.
[11:58] <Kim^J> Recommend a good DC client.
[11:58] <Kim^J> That works.
[11:58] <ripper> i've considered trying nubuntu
[11:58] <unfun> Is it possible to use tvout if you have ati radeon in ubuntu?
[11:58] <binmkdir> math_: mc belongs to the collection of all-time-favourite text tools. just like w3m, centericq, mutt and screen.
[11:58] <Hgill> Nickle0de0n: then as long as you don't pull the poweer chord, your FS should _stay_ in a sane condition....
[11:59] <dooglus> kishore: to change the path used my apt-get for its package cache, do:  sudo bash -c "echo 'Dir::Cache \"mnt/bigpartition/apt-cache\";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50cache"
[11:59] <binmkdir> math_: oh, i forgot irssi :)
[11:59] <Shaye> firefox causing me so many problems :|
[11:59] <dooglus> kishore: then    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bigpartition/apt-cache/archives/partial
[12:00] <kishore> ok..
[12:00] <math_> oh cool, more apps :D
[12:01] <math_> I'm a bit new to linux
[12:01] <Dimensions> connect to server at 'localhost' failed error: 'Access denied for user 'filter'@'localhost' (using password: YES)' why ?
[12:01] <math_> but, this is much better then writing on a forum :P
[12:01] <dooglus> Dimensions: try mysql -u root
[12:02] <roycebarber> Updates: I got wine'
[12:02] <Dimensions> dooglus: i can login as root and filter both ... but i can't access pages with //localhost/abc
[12:03] <dooglus> Dimensions: do you mean 'abc' as in the bittorrent client?  or what are you trying to do?
[12:03] <dark_light> math_, i agree, irc is so cool :P
[12:03] <roycebarber> oops i pressed enter too fast! i got wine's winecfg to stop freezing on the audio tab, by renaming a file. also, i got my windows partition to be writable by using the ntfs-3g driver.
[12:03] <unfun> How do I use the fglrx-control ?
[12:03] <mtymobile> anyone here uses autoscan on edgy???
[12:03] <Shaye> I have installed the flash player and plugin few times but i can't still view flash animations, nor java applications
[12:03] <math_> dark_light yes it is
[12:03] <math_> :D
[12:03] <jasper_> can someone help me with a problem im having with my sound card
[12:04] <Dimensions> dooglus: when i am accessing my pages from /var/www folder i can type in browser 127.0.0.1 to access them but same thing with localhost in browser generate error can't connect to local host ... etc etc
[12:04] <dodo> hello
[12:04] <Shaye> IRC's cool, otherwise, why would i be spending 3 years of my life using it :)
[12:04] <dark_light> jasper_, tell us your problem
[12:04] <Shaye> I have installed the flash player and plugin few times but i can't still view flash animations, nor java applications
[12:04] <math_> haha Shaye
[12:04] <roycebarber> Also... i found out how to get access to files that i didnt have permission. i simply type "sudo nautilus" in terminal. so i hope that helps someone.
[12:04] <dodo> i wanna to know how can i programming JAVA under ubuntu....!
[12:04] <jasper_> a few days ago my sound worked, then when i re hooked up my pc it didnt detect the card
[12:04] <roycebarber> dodo isnt java os independent..?
[12:04] <math_> what's the best way to search files in console?
[12:04] <pazemlsqdfmo1> FFS this networking stuff is driving me crazy :@
[12:04] <n00mz> Please could someone tell me why this is happening:  http://rafb.net/paste/results/wgdp0b32.html
[12:04] <dodo> yes
[12:04] <n00mz> thanks
[12:05] <pazemlsqdfmo1> why cant i get the friggin permissions set correctly ffs
[12:05] <math_> locate, find, search...?
[12:05] <dark_light> Shaye, how you installed the flash and java?
[12:05] <dooglus> Dimensions: these are dynamic pages which use MySQL only?  or all pages, even static ones?
[12:05] <dark_light> jasper_, (what is hooked up? heh)
[12:05] <binmkdir> math_: locate is fast but it depends on the locate database being up to date
[12:05] <roycebarber> If you want to view videos on CNET, you have to have Flash9. A google search will bring that up.. that might solve flash issues..?
[12:05] <jasper_> i fully powered off the pc to connect another one
[12:05] <dark_light> math_, i dunno, i love find, but i heard locate is faster if you mind about creating the db in a regular basis
[12:06] <binmkdir> math_: find actually searches the filesystem and can have many search criteria
[12:06] <jasper_> i know it uses the es1968 driver
[12:06] <binmkdir> math_: and mc has a built-in find function
[12:06] <math_> ok
[12:06] <JQK> roycebarber,  It's not necessary *have* to use flash9, but all that person needs to type in the terminal is -> sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree .
[12:06] <math_> k nice nice
[12:06] <jasper_> but when i use lspci it says ESS unkown device 1970
[12:06] <mtymobile> well, see ya folks
[12:06] <mtymobile> bye bye
[12:06] <Lemino> my swap doesn't mount
[12:06] <roycebarber> JQK the cnet site requires flash9.. i dont know if any other site does.
[12:06] <math_> a whole new world has open my eyes for me
[12:06] <binmkdir> math_: mc -> Command -> Find file
[12:07] <UmbraAdmin> dooglus -> apt-get install sun-java5-jdk should work i think
[12:07] <math_> and without mc?
[12:07] <dark_light> jasper_, tried to load manually the module?
[12:07] <Lemino> i just tried the xubuntu live-cd and after that the swap isn't mounted.
[12:07] <math_> if u want to find in all files
[12:07] <dooglus> UmbraAdmin: you have the wrong man, I think
[12:07] <Lemino> i have restarted and everything.
[12:07] <dodo> how can i make XGL working in my laptop (siemens fujitsu amilo L 6820 )
[12:07] <jasper_> i did and all it did was return to the prompt with no errors
[12:07] <binmkdir> math_: find start_dir -name "filename"   (filename may use wildcards)
[12:07] <math_> in dos I uses: dir /s I thought
[12:07] <ripper> UmbraAdmin do i know you from another network via a different nick?
[12:08] <dark_light> jasper_, try lsmod|grep esl
[12:08] <math_> k lets try
[12:08] <binmkdir> math_: no, msdos's dir /s just lists dirs recursively, it does not search
[12:08] <roycebarber> Anyone know why Firefox (and a few other apps) load slow on a fresh reboot?
[12:08] <Dimensions> dooglus:  when i am trying to access /var/www where all of php pages are residing ... i can't access any of them using http://localhost/ but i get message unable to connect
[12:08] <DarkMageZ> dodo, XGL is in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:08] <Lemino> please, without swap it's no fun at all.
[12:08] <UmbraAdmin> ripper its not imossible
[12:08] <dodo> ok thanx
[12:08] <UmbraAdmin> impossible
[12:08] <dooglus> binmkdir: you can give dir/s a wildcard - then it will only list files matching that wildcard
[12:08] <binmkdir> math_: if you want something like dir /s, try ls -R
[12:08] <dark_light> jasper_, or only lsmod without parameters.. it shows the loaded modules
[12:08] <math_> k
[12:08] <ripper> UmbraAdmin what other nicks might you use?
[12:09] <binmkdir> dooglus: okay. haven't used msdos in years..
[12:09] <roycebarber> I used dos a few days ago to fix a friends xp box... i ended up using knoppix instead...
[12:09] <dooglus> Dimensions: if you log in as root from a terminal and run:  SELECT Host, User FROM mysql.user;     can you pastebin the output?
[12:10] <math_> haha cool binmkdir, even with colours in it! :D
[12:10] <roycebarber> Anyone know why Ctrl+V doesnt Paste in terminal?
[12:10] <n00mz> Please could someone help me with compiler issues?
[12:10] <dooglus> roycebarber: because control-v is useful as the 'quote' character in terminals.
[12:10] <UmbraAdmin> ripper i only use Umbra
[12:10] <math_> roycebarber, maybe the difference between x-system and console?
[12:10] <jasper_> when i manualy loaded the driver with modprobe it is listed in lsmod but there is no sound
[12:10] <JQK> roycebarber,  ctrl+shift+v .. try that.
[12:10] <dooglus> roycebarber: paste is usually ctrl-shift-v in terminals
[12:10] <lastnode> roycebarber, ctrl+shift+v
[12:11] <TiffOn> nas a todas
[12:11] <ripper> UmbraAdmin then i dont know ya
[12:11] <UmbraAdmin> hehe
[12:12] <roycebarber> Hehe i figured it out, i renamed the paste command to Ctrl+V. i'm so used to it i just have to have it that way. who wants to hold 3 buttons just to paste :)

[12:13] <jasper_> modprobe es1968 loads the drivers but i still get no sound
[12:13] <lord_08> i need a root scaner pls
[12:13] <dooglus> pazemlsqdfmo1: there's a setting in the windows registry somewhere about whether to use plain-text or enctypted passwords.  make sure it's set to the same as samba uses
[12:13] <lastnode> lord_08, a what?
[12:13] <pazemlsqdfmo1> dooglus: im trying to access my samba share from the computer whos doing the sharing
[12:14] <dooglus> pazemlsqdfmo1: oh, I see
[12:14] <Shaye> I need help getting my firefox to play java and flash stuff, I have these installed but still not working
[12:14] <linopil> jasper maybe it is installed but silenced?

[12:14] <jasper_> alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[12:15] <pazemlsqdfmo1> dooglus: i cant get the umask for files correctly when working on the folders internally, so to bypass that i decided to also use the samba share locally
[12:16] <lord_08> whi mi computer blocks ?
[12:16] <math_> now I've started to find with: find / -name 'file', but what I have to do when it keeps running and I want to quit the operation?

[12:23] <matahari> hi
[12:24] <grant> well ideally the middle mouse button but a keyboard shortcut would do math, its to execute 3ddesk, cheers
[12:24] <matahari> i think there was a possibility to do an apt-get upgrade only for security fixes.....
[12:24] <matahari> but i forgot it - could you telle it to me please?

[12:33] <Dimensions> sorry but i asked that ... i have got my problem resolved half ... by changing ip of localhost to .0.1 from .1.1 ... but when i still do sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart it says ... access denied for user using passwd yes ...
[12:33] <mikeymike-linux> ps aux | grep beryl emerald ?
[12:33] <linopil> look carefully there maybe a backup in directory (folder)
[12:33] <Dimensions> i can login with specified user into mysql but when doing a restart with init.d it gives that error why ?
[12:33] <dooglus> Dimensions: did you run the 'select' query I asked you to?
[12:33] <bimberi> eXistenZ: icecast2 ?
[12:33] <Dimensions> yes i did ...
[12:33] <dooglus> sorry, I didn't see it
[12:34] <roycebarber> Here I go... im going to freeze my computer by trying to run guildwars... Good bye cruel world....
[12:34] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[12:34] <mikeymike-linux> someone explain grep syntax to me
[12:34] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[12:34] <Dimensions> i am waiting on paste bin to send my query ... its stucked can't i paste it here  ?
[12:34] <mikeymike-linux> when piping it
[12:34] <dooglus> mikeymike-linux: you put "grep", then the flags, then the thing to search for, then optionally some files to search through
[12:34] <grant> excellent dooglus, cheers
[12:34] <Dimensions> mikeymike-linux: grep -i abc *.extension|wc
[12:34] <grant> all working now
[12:34] <dooglus> mikeymike-linux: when piping into grep, don't give any filenames to search
[12:34] <ionela> wolaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[12:35] <mikeymike-linux> well i want to grep my ps output for beryl and emerald
[12:35] <mikeymike-linux> ps ax | grep beryl emerald ?????
[12:35] <mikeymike-linux> that doesnt work
[12:35] <bimberi> Dimensions: try another pastebin - pastebin.ca is one
[12:35] <dooglus> grant: any luck binding it to a mouse button?  or only a key?
[12:35] <ionela> k tal a todos
[12:35] <wozzlle> hello all
[12:35] <samir85> Can somebody send me his edgy sources.list to samir.vds@googlemail.com ? I screwed my sources.list so I need a new one !
[12:35] <mikeymike-linux> dooglus, perhaps you can clear it up for me?
[12:35] <wozzlle> can anyone suggest a linux app for converting divx dual layer to svcd*
[12:35] <ifireball> mikeconcepts: ps ax | grep "(beryl|emerald)"
[12:36] <boink> samir85: use google
[12:36] <mikeymike-linux> whaaaaaaat
[12:36] <mikeymike-linux> ahaha
[12:36] <mikeymike-linux> weird.
[12:36] <grant> only tried it with the key at the moment dooglus, going to try that now thinking <Control><Mouse3> maybe?
[12:36] <boink> sources.list ubuntu edgy .. how difficult must that be?
[12:36] <mikeymike-linux> that didnt work
[12:36] <samir85> ok you right boink found one with google ;)
[12:36] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: not so wierd if you know regular expressions
[12:36] <Dimensions> here it is dooglus: http://pastebin.ca/235667
[12:36] <mikeymike-linux> 19488 ?        S      0:00 sh -c ps ax | grep "(beryl|emerald)"
[12:36] <mikeymike-linux> 19490 ?        R      0:00 grep (beryl|emerald)
[12:36] <dooglus> samir85: http://s89213869.onlinehome.us/sources.list.txt

[12:37] <Dimensions> and thanks bimberi thanks ..
[12:37] <ripper> !pastebin > mikeymike-linux
[12:37] <mikeymike-linux> sorry
[12:37] <mikeymike-linux> i didnt think it would be more than 1 line
[12:37] <ripper> tis all good
[12:37] <bimberi> Dimensions: np :)
[12:37] <mikeymike-linux> i forget that it shows the grep as well
[12:37] <ripper> just use pastebin :)
[12:38] <ripper> anyone in here play with qemu?
[12:38] <mikeymike-linux> ok so.. there has to be a simpler way and why is there a sh -c running now
[12:38] <ifireball> mikeconcepts: oh right is should be "grep -E" (otherwise you need to put "\" before the brackets)
[12:38] <dooglus> Dimensions: is 'BILAL' your hostname?
[12:38] <binmkdir> ripper: i do
[12:38] <dade`> i'm using edgy, i compiled my own kernel (vanilla) with "make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers modules_image" and i get "could not open /lib/modules/2.6.18.1/modules.dep" at boot, then some script crashe 'cause the boot is frozen, any hint for me ?
[12:38] <Dimensions> dooglus: yes ... it is ...
[12:38] <ripper> binmkdir any luck running windows xp w/ sound and video on it?
[12:38] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, hm? example if you dont mind
[12:39] <dooglus> Dimensions: and you get an error message when you run "sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart"?
[12:39] <Dimensions> yes dooglus true ...
[12:39] <Jaeke555> A quick question: Where can I get X for my ubuntu?
[12:39] <binmkdir> ripper: xp runs, but not very fast
[12:39] <ripper> binmkdir win2k?
[12:39] <binmkdir> ripper: i don't run xp in qemu to watch videos
[12:39] <dooglus> Dimensions: can you pastebin that interaction too?  the command and the whole output?
[12:40] <ripper> binmkdir does sound work on it?
[12:40] <Dimensions> sure ... dooglus
[12:40] <binmkdir> ripper: win2k runs slightly faster
[12:40] <mikeconcepts> ifireball, please include the y in mikey with tab
[12:40] <whaley> is there a package available that allows mathematical notation to be easily written like word processing?
[12:40] <whaley> (if oo does this, i apologize for not checking it out)
[12:40] <nisq> samir85 check this out http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper#How_to_upgrade_from_Hoary_Hedgehog_-.3E_Breezy_Badger_-.3E_Dapper_Drake
[12:40] <binmkdir> ripper: sound runs. i chose -soundhw es1370 in qemu
[12:40] <mikeymike-linux> haha mikeconcepts
[12:40] <lord_08> i need a hacking site pls
[12:40] <binmkdir> ripper: qemu can emulated two different soundcards since 0.8.0
[12:40] <ripper> yeah i've been looking for a way to use Y! voicechat on nix, and it dont seem that wine wants to run Y! messenger at all
[12:41] <Redcyborg> yo what sup
[12:41] <Jaeke555> Can someone who know the console commands help me with something
[12:41] <dooglus> !ask
[12:41] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:41] <grant> can't seem to get it with the mouse dooglus
[12:41] <ifireball> mikeconcepts: ps ax | grep -E " (beryl|emerald) " <-- adding the spaces there will probably make it not give you the "grep" line
[12:41] <dooglus> grant: me neither :)
[12:41] <Redcyborg> echo "hello world"
[12:41] <Dimensions> dooglus:  http://pastebin.ca/235675 with thanks
[12:42] <binmkdir> ripper: i don't know anything about this Y! thingie
[12:42] <grant> shame, would be nice if you could just ctrl middle mouse to run it
[12:42] <ifireball> mikeconcepts: sorry
[12:42] <dooglus> grant: I'm sure it's possible - I just don't know how
[12:42] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, oh
[12:42] <ripper> binmkdir the worlds worst chat service , Yahoo
[12:42] <mikeymike-linux> i want a simpler way... lol
[12:42] <Nickle0de0n> Hi, does installing a lotta fonts slow down linux boxes as it does in windows
[12:42] <binmkdir> ripper: so why do you want to use it?
[12:42] <Jaeke555> I need X for my ubuntu, I've got server version installed, so I heard that there is a command which will start downloading packages...
[12:43] <ripper> binmkdir cause all of my family uses it, and wont convert to skype
[12:43] <grant> i'm sure it is from what i've seen of ubuntu, but to be honest dooglus, been using linux for 3 days, think i'm doing ok so far, give me a week or two before i start really mucking around with it
[12:43] <Redcyborg> does anyone know if nvidia drivers are officially supported by edgy/
[12:43] <bimberi> Jaeke555: 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' will install X and all the applications of a normal desktop install
[12:43] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: like all things classic-unix grep power != simple
[12:44] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[12:44] <binmkdir> ripper: anyway, qemu does not emulate usb, so if you need any webcam hardware in the guest OS running in qemu, it won't work
[12:44] <mikeymike-linux> i suppose
[12:44] <dooglus> grant: the problem is, it's hard to find out how to do things like that.
[12:44] <Jaeke555> bimberi, thanks a million!!
[12:44] <bimberi> Jaeke555: np :)
[12:44] <ripper> binmkdir thats what usb ---> serial adapters are for :)
[12:44] <mikeymike-linux> and if i wanted to add 4 words to that search? " (word1|word2|word3|word4 ) " ???
[12:44] <BeanBag> i have a question about ubuntu dapper drake LTS
[12:45] <grant> well dooglus, give me a couple of weeks and i'll figure it out, or i'll break it, one of the two, remember, "There are three ways to do anything in life, the right way, the wrong way and the Max Power way." "Homer isn't that the wrong way?" "Yes, but faster"
[12:45] <dade`>  i'm using ubuntu edgy, i compiled my own kernel (vanilla) with "make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers modules_image" and i get "could not open /lib/modules/2.6.18.1/modules.dep" at boot, then some script crashe 'cause the boot is frozen, any hint for me ?
[12:46] <BeanBag> it want to know if dapper instalation (via the live cd desktop) will allow you to resize NTFS drive without losing data?
[12:47] <mikeymike-linux> BeanBag, resizing ntfs out of ntfs is scary
[12:47] <dooglus> Dimensions: this is strange.  I wonder why it's trying to log in as you, instead of as root.
[12:47] <bimberi> BeanBag: yes it can, but you should back up first
[12:47] <reazn> I'm having issues using the generic kernel (i want smp).. the kernel stops booting, even in recovery mode saying "mounting root filesystem" - any idea's ?
[12:47] <mikeymike-linux> i never understood that advice.... 'back up first'
[12:47] <mikeymike-linux> if you back up then why are you even resizing
[12:47] <mikeymike-linux> lol

[12:48] <mikeymike-linux> :-P
[12:48] <OoberMick> BeanBag: In my experience it works most of the time, try runing scandisk on windows first
[12:48] <grant> brb guys time for a cig
[12:48] <mnk0> hello all. i am trying to do a video conference with someone using ms netmeeting. can someone please show me how to do it? i really don't understand as i am new to ekiga
[12:49] <ripper> mnk0 i dont think you can use ekigia for that
[12:49] <mnk0> ripper, it says u can
[12:49] <fishsponge_> can anyone help? i need to dump the configuration of a newly built system so it can be cloned using the network install... does anyone know how to dump the configuration in the format of an auto-install script?
[12:50] <ripper> try gnome-meeting?
[12:50] <mnk0> ripper, on their faq - that u can connect to windows netmeeting
[12:50] <mnk0> ripper, i thought ekiga is gnome-meeting
[12:50] <ripper> no.
[12:50] <erUSUL> ripper: yes
[12:50] <BeanBag> mikey: Why is resizing NTFS scary?
[12:50] <bimberi> yes it is
[12:50] <Jon335> I'm having trouble printing on Edgy. It is a clean install, and both of my printers just say receiving data...  Can anyone help?
[12:50] <KenSentMe> Anyone here got hula running on ubuntu dapper? I get this error when running the hula-admin: Driver MDBLDAP failed to load:Driver MDBLDAP, Init failed with: Could not initialize LDAP connection
[12:50] <mnk0> so does anyone else know how to do a video conference with someone using window$?
[12:51] <Dimensions> dooglus: what should i do then ? any idea ... second thing i noticed when i open my page in which i mentioned a database filter user as filter and passwd as filter .. and did grant filter.* to filter @ localhost identified by filter; i get error can't connect using filter localhost filter passwd etc ...
[12:51] <BeanBag> bimberi: will it work if i convert to FAT32 first, install ubuntu, then convert back to NTFS?
[12:51] <mnk0> or is there another piece of software that a windows user can download and thus have a video conference with me using ekiga?
[12:51] <mnk0> any help will be appreciated
[12:51] <mnk0> pls
[12:52] <free_omen> why do ubuntu updates break the system?
[12:53] <KenSentMe> mnk0: for the ekiga site: http://www.gnomemeeting.org/index.php?rub=3&pos=0&faqpage=index.html#AEN21
[12:53] <mnk0> thanks KenSentMe
[12:53] <Shaye> how can I lock a folder that is already exists
[12:53] <Jaeke555> ubunsdfsasfd
[12:53] <BeanBag> OoberMick: Whats the worst thing that can happen when trying to install dapper and resizng NTFS partitions?
[12:53] <mnk0> yeah i have seen that KenSentMe, but how do i actually do it!?
[12:54] <bimberi> BeanBag: That would be just as risky imo.  Many people have successfully used the Ubuntu installer to resize ntfs to make space for the install.  It's just always s good idea to make a backup in case it goes wrong.
[12:54] <KenSentMe> mnk0: good question
[12:54] <free_omen> deleting  your window partition
[12:54] <Shaye> how can I lock a folder that is already exists
[12:54] <free_omen> use partition magic for windows
[12:54] <free_omen> safest way to resize the partition
[12:54] <free_omen> but not cheapes
[12:54] <free_omen> t
[12:55] <erUSUL> Shaye: what do you mean by lock?
[12:55] <xdude> bimberi   same goes for backing up you linux OS before installing an upgrade
[12:55] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: do you know umm.. how do I get connected to internet?  ( I got wired up but I'm not getting IP from DHCP )
[12:55] <Shaye> erUSUL, simple as it sound, lock it with a password
[12:55] <OoberMick> BeanBag: well the worst thing is that you'll lose all your data... but that is highly unlikely. The worst thing that has happened to me is that the installer simply refused to do it. It would scan the disk then stop claiming it had done it
[12:55] <dooglus> Dimensions: I would try logging in to mysql as root and running an "update mysql.user set host='%' where user = 'filter';"
[12:55] <BeanBag>  free_omen: okay, how many parititions should i create for linux, and what type of filesystem is the best?
[12:55] <Shaye> erUSUL, so when someone try to open it, it will ask for password
[12:55] <frinov> hello. i loaded ubuntu 6.10 on my thinkpad 570. the mic does not work with skype, arecord or the gui sound recorder. each hang when trying to record.
[12:55] <bimberi> xdude: of course :)
[12:56] <claygucci> anyone here ever use a barebones built laptop
[12:56] <frinov> i think this is same bug as http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=141616
[12:56] <lord_08> i need a root terminal 4 ubuntu linux
[12:56] <frinov> sound playback works but not sound record
[12:57] <bimberi> Jaeke555: does 'sudo dhclient' help?
[12:57] <Jon335> Can anyone help? I'm having trouble printing on Edgy. It is a clean install, and both of my printers just say receiving data...
[12:57] <free_omen> BeanBag, 1 for window and 1 for linux
[12:57] <bimberi> lord_08: 'sudo -i' in a normal terminal
[12:57] <erUSUL> Shaye: afaik it is not possible you can change permissions and ownership but not "lock it" with a password
[12:58] <free_omen> BeanBag, if you want to exchange files, use windows' fat32 (not ntfs).. and for linux ext3 type would be good
[12:58] <Shaye> erUSUL, well alright
[12:58] <brice> hello
[12:59] <jpfarias> hi!
[12:59] <Jaeke555> bimberi: I got my ip from DHCP now but it said Chown: failed to get attributes of '/etc/resolv.conf': No such file or directory and the next like is chmod: failed to get attributes of...(the rest is the same )
[12:59] <brice> french

[12:59] <jpfarias> what can I do to make it reload without killing gnome-panel?
[12:59] <erUSUL> Shaye: you can try this though https://wiki.ubuntu.com/encryption_with_encfs_and_pam-encfs?highlight=%28fs%29%7C%28crypt%29
[01:00] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: ops, cancel that last message, I did dhclient again and now I didn't get any error messages :)
[01:00] <erUSUL> Jaeke555: what gives 'ls -al /etc/resolv.conf' ??
[01:00] <bimberi> Jaeke555: phew, I was struggling with that one :)
[01:00] <sheri_rao> i'm newbie , can anyone tell me simplest way to do P2P internet sharing, i have network card and using internal-modem for Internet connection , this PC has internet but other does not
[01:01] <erUSUL> !firestarter
[01:01] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[01:01] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: I'm still having a small prob, can't ping to anything outside :)
[01:01] <erUSUL> sheri_rao: with firestarter you can enable inet sharing iirc
[01:01] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: so I guess there's still something that needs sharpening :)

[01:02] <sheri_rao> erUSUL:  i am using firestarter but no success
[01:02] <Shaye> How can I limit the ping requests when I ping something
[01:02] <bimberi> Jaeke555: yes, what's the nature of your internet connection.  Via a local router?
[01:02] <free_omen> i hate file sharing that way though
[01:02] <free_omen> you tell the thing to download 50 files and you're lucky if you get like 5
[01:03] <bimberi> Shaye: ping -c 5 google.com
[01:03] <AlanHaggai> any way to put an Ubuntu system to standby mode?

[01:04] <BeanBag>  free_omen: what should the size be for the ext3 partition, and then should i create a swap paritition, if yes, what should the size be?
[01:04] <sheri_rao> any idea about P2P internet sharing both PC have ubuntu , i m provider , using dial-up modem and network card
[01:05] <sheri_rao> erUSUL:  thanks a lot let me check link
[01:05] <mirak> hi
[01:05] <AlanHaggai> any way to put an Ubuntu system to standby mode?
[01:05] <bimberi> Jaeke555: so does 'ifconfig' show an IP address?
[01:05] <frinov> i am using ubuntu 6.10 edgy on thinkpad 570 and see sound recording bug same as other people seeing with http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=141616
[01:05] <free_omen> BeanBag, how much total ram and harddrive space have you got?
[01:06] <frinov> anyone is have advice?
[01:06] <mirak> fglrx-kernel-source seems broken, or the name doesn't match the name that module assistant knows
[01:07] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: Yeah, its shows my ipaddress ( the one I get from my firewall dhcp ) my mask address...
[01:07] <compengi> is edgy now more stable, i mean less buggy?
[01:07] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: RX bytes: 57,8KiB      TX bytes 12,7KiB
[01:07] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: doesn't that mean that there's atleast some traffic ? :)
[01:07] <Dimensions> dooglus:  it says ... ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '%-filter' for key 1
[01:07] <Ayabara> When I try to start firefox ubuntu tells me it is already running, but I can't find any processes belonging to it.
[01:08] <bimberi> Jaeke555: possibly. so pinging a named address doesn't work?
[01:08] <KenSentMe> Anyone here got hula running on ubuntu dapper? I get this error when running the hula-admin: Driver MDBLDAP failed to load:Driver MDBLDAP, Init failed with: Could not initialize LDAP connection
[01:08] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: should it even be possible to ping for example google.com (ping google.com)
[01:08] <erUSUL> Ayabara: ps ax  | grep firefox
[01:09] <bimberi> Jaeke555: yes, if dns is working
[01:09] <Jaeke555> bimberi: oh and the fun part, when I try pinging google.com it show's the ip address for google.com :D
[01:09] <bimberi> Jaeke555: you could also try its ip address -  ping 72.14.207.99
[01:09] <free_omen> i've seen a lot of package manager failures in ubunut
[01:09] <free_omen> that should be the most important piece of software in a distribution targetted for newbies
[01:09] <Jaeke555> bimberi: no luck: 10 packets transmitted , 0 received
[01:10] <free_omen> package managers just wont run

[01:13] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: I'm connected straight to the Firewall, so I get my ip from there and it should go out like no problem :)
[01:13] <binmkdir> howieson26_: you keep asking ubotu over and over. what are you trying to do?
[01:13] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: most odd :)

[01:13] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: one second, gotta try something :)
[01:14] <coz_> DJAdmiral, here is one link   http://groundhog.klik.atekon.de/
[01:14] <DJAdmiral> !ubotu
[01:14] <DJAdmiral> Checking, thanks coz_
[01:14] <DJAdmiral> Isn't there one of those !commands that makes ubotu say "please do not abuse the bot" or something?
[01:14] <coz_> DJAdmiral, http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/01/1741229
[01:15] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: no, no luck...
[01:15] <bimberi> DJAdmiral: !botabuse
[01:15] <DJAdmiral> Thanks coz_, that /. article seems of relevance
[01:15] <DJAdmiral> Thanks bimberi
[01:15] <bimberi> Jaeke555: does 'route' give back a "default" line with a gateway?
[01:15] <bimberi> DJAdmiral: yw :)
[01:16] <DJAdmiral> !botabuse > DJAdmiral
[01:16] <DJAdmiral> Neato.
[01:16] <DJAdmiral> Any ideas on release dates for Grumpy Groundhog?
[01:16] <Jaeke555> bimberi: yes, it says  destination: default      gateway: mygateway address :D genmask: 0.0.0.0
[01:16] <DJAdmiral> I might end up going for it.
[01:17] <Dimensions>  why do i get a restart error with mysql as sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart ... generates error ... http://pastebin.ca/235675
[01:17] <DJAdmiral> Dimensions: I'm looking at your paste right now
[01:17] <free_omen> i want to be a channel operator
[01:18] <bimberi> Jaeke555: well that is strange
[01:18] <coz_> free_omen, yeah... me too lol
[01:18] <bimberi> make your own channel then :)
[01:18] <Dimensions> thanks DJAdmiral
[01:18] <free_omen> bimberi, no one would come
[01:18] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: is there a way I can sort of release the IP number and fetch a new one from DHCP?
[01:18] <bimberi> free_omen: minor issue :)
[01:19] <free_omen> not really.. it's no fun to be an operator with there is 3 or 4 people in the channel
[01:19] <free_omen> with = when
[01:20] <yolk> ...
[01:20] <DJAdmiral> Dimensions: Hmm. It could probably be because it's trying to connect to localhost and not BILAL, or you're issuing this command to the mysql executable in the init.d directory, which is basically where programs boot on startup.
[01:20] <DJAdmiral> Dimensions: Otherwise it's kinda odd.
[01:20] <boink> Jaeke555: just restart the dhclient
[01:21] <boink> or stop it, then start it up again.
[01:21] <Jaeke555> boink: how? :D
[01:21] <boink> well .. there are a few ways
[01:21] <bimberi> Jaeke555: man page says 'dhclient -r'
[01:22] <boink> sure, try dhclient -r
[01:22] <boink> but there a few ways of doing this
[01:22] <baastrup> hi, how do i record everything that comes from my sound card?
[01:22] <boink> baastrup: like from radio?
[01:22] <cartucho> whats the package for developing man docs ?
[01:22] <Dimensions> DJAdmiral:  but the problem is when i try to connect to a database called filter user called filter and passwd filter ... while permissions are granted to it by root in mysql ... i get same error unable to connect password supplied yes ...
[01:22] <Jaeke555> Boink, Bimberi:  yeah thanks, I got the IP released and fetched again...
[01:22] <baastrup> yeah, its a smale sampel from a falsh animation
[01:23] <cartucho> whatas the package of the linux api manpage ?
[01:23] <boink> what type of file is it? mp3 file?
[01:23] <Jaeke555> bimberi: but still no luck  :)
[01:23] <boink> .flv file?
[01:23] <mirak> is there a way to compile the retricted modules along the a kernel build ?
[01:23] <ailean> what's the "generic" kernel selection?  does that mean -686?
[01:23] <baastrup> boink: its a flash animation from the net, i just need a few sec of the sound as a file
[01:23] <Jaeke555> Bimberi: I'll try something, will be offline for few minutes...
[01:23] <bimberi> Jaeke555: at least your smiling though.  Sorry but I'm struggling.
[01:24] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: Try a flash decompilers?
[01:24] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: decompiler*
[01:24] <boink> hmm, I've never done that myself .. with flash
[01:24] <frinov> any advice for thinkpad 570 users trying to record sound on edgy?
[01:24] <bimberi> ailean: yes
[01:24] <ailean> bimberi, thanks
[01:24] <baastrup> DJAdmiral:  do you know a name program
[01:24] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: Or I could probably try and grab the sound of the flash movie for you if you like.
[01:24] <ailean> bimberi, so, that enables HT?
[01:24] <speedy> how can i list a
[01:25] <bimberi> cartucho: manpages-dev (iirc)
[01:25] <binmkdir> cartucho: manpages-dev
[01:25] <cartucho> thanks alot
[01:25] <bimberi> ailean: that i don't know sorry
[01:25] <speedy> how can i list wireless networks in range and select from them?
[01:25] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: that would be nice
[01:25] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: I know some for windoze. You could try WINE with them.
[01:25] <ailean> k thanks bimberi
[01:25] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: But if you just go ahead and send me a link for the flash
[01:25] <Jaeke555> bimberi: yeh, its certainly the computers fault, since it won't connect to internet from the other wire either :) any more ideas? :)
[01:25] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: I might be able to grab it.
[01:26] <Jaeke555> bimberi: my network has been a little mystic for few days now, so I might call the problem to that too :)
[01:26] <carlosd> what version of Xorg is shipped with 5.04?
[01:26] <speedy> check distrowatch
[01:27] <binmkdir> cartucho: i think 6.8.1, dont know for sure
[01:27] <binmkdir> carlosd: i think 6.8.1, dont know for sure
[01:27] <bimberi> Jaeke555: I'd look at the firewall config, for one.  Otherwise I'm really not sure sorry
[01:27] <Jiggi> clueles newbie queston- where can I get gcc, cc or cl from?
[01:27] <bimberi> !info xserver-xorg hoary
[01:27] <geniusvicks> I cant seem to access my Windows PC using Network

[01:27] <kalikiana> I'm searching for a good torrent gui app w/o gnome dependencies.
[01:27] <meneg> hi, have you seen anything like it for 2.6? http://www.tls-technologies.com/CPU/cpu-download.html
[01:27] <BeanBag>  free_omen: Ive got a 250gig hardrive and a gig of ram. i can spare about 15 - 20 gig for ubuntu, rest i'm using for data
[01:27] <mnk0> has anyone used ekiga to do a video conference with windows live messenger?
[01:27] <carlosd> binmkdir, there is any place in ubuntu site where I can see the packages for each release?
[01:28] <free_omen> BeanBag, it's hard for me to help you if you answer me in forever time
[01:28] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: look in yor pm
[01:28] <bimberi> carlosd: 6.8.2 is the current hoary versoin, not sure what's shipped on the CD though
[01:28] <Jaeke555> bimberi: the firewall doesn't have anything to config :) I'm sure of it :)
[01:28] <binmkdir> carlosd: bimberi has asked the bot, look at the answer
[01:28] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: I don't see any pms.
[01:28] <Jaeke555> bimberi: this is probably the 5th computer thats been on this network, but this one doesn't work for some reason...
[01:28] <wk> i have problems with the radeon driver on my edgy on notebook with a ati mobility radeon 9000 (M9) - directrendering doesn't work - someone here who can elp?
[01:28] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: what is the command for a pm?
[01:29] <BeanBag>  free_omen: sorry that i took long, had to get some coffee
[01:29] <DJAdmiral> Jiggi: try build-essential
[01:29] <carlosd> bimberi, where I have to type this?
[01:29] <DJAdmiral> kalikana: Dunno about that, but maybe Bittornado might help?
[01:29] <free_omen> 15 gb for ubuntu is a great size
=== aloysio_ is now known as AFigueiredo
=== macgregor is now known as ianmacgregor
[01:29] <Jiggi> DJAdmiral,  where is that?
[01:29] <bimberi> Jaeke555: right.  so that points the finger at that pc then.  What does a 'tracepath 72.14.207.99' say?
[01:29] <free_omen> i have 6 gb for ubuntu (before i switched distros)
[01:29] <DJAdmiral> Jiggi: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:29] <free_omen> i'm on pclinuxos
=== _zappe is now known as zappe
[01:30] <bimberi> carlosd: http://packages.ubuntu.com
[01:30] <jzzat> Does anyone know a  linux compatible 16 bit pcmcia to ethernet card?
[01:30] <mnk0> does anyone here know how to do a video conference with ekiga and netmeeting?
[01:30] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: /msg DJAdmiral blah blash
[01:30] <Jaeke555> bimberi: goes as far as to the gateway but not any further :)
[01:30] <bimberi> Jaeke555: heh
[01:30] <BeanBag>  free_omen: how much does ubuntu need for a install? and how big should my swap file be?
[01:30] <DJAdmiral> mnk0: AFAIK I think Ekiga is just VOIP, not video.
[01:30] <Jaeke555> bimberi: doesn't that point the finger at my firewall again :)
[01:31] <bimberi> Jaeke555: pass :)
[01:31] <free_omen> i think it'll take about 3 GB.. and since you have plenty of ram, you can set the swap size to 500 MB or so
[01:31] <DJAdmiral> BeanBag: Keep at least 5 GB for Ubuntu system itself, preferably 10 GB or more, and keep swap file as much as your RAM.
[01:31] <mnk0> DJAdmiral, no it does do video too, but i don't know how to do it
[01:31] <pty> DJAdmiral: Ekiga does h.232 video too
[01:31] <Jiggi> damn lol need cd...
[01:31] <mnk0> pty, how? :)
[01:31] <free_omen> i have 1 gb ram but not much disk space, so i don't use a swap parition
[01:31] <DJAdmiral> Oh cool, didn't know that. Cool!
[01:31] <kalikiana> DJAdmiral: I tried that already, but it was too memory-consuming with multiple downloads
[01:31] <Jaeke555> bimberi: this really stuns me over and over again, can't understand why its not working :D
[01:31] <free_omen> 1gb ram is pretty much enough for me
[01:32] <DJAdmiral> free_omen: Do use a swap partition. Keep one for 500 megs then.
[01:32] <bimberi> Jaeke555: me either
[01:32] <pty> mnk0: i dunno, it just does ;p
[01:32] <mnk0> maaaaaaaaaaaan
[01:32] <Jaeke555> bimberi: this usually skips my interest about linuxes for the next 6 months :D, but I'll see if its any better tomorrow :)
[01:32] <thyko> how do i install all packages including the 'recomended' ones from the command line?
[01:33] <mnk0> pls can SOMEONE help!?
[01:33] <DJAdmiral> kalikiana: Try WINE+uTorrent.
[01:33] <free_omen> i don't see the point
[01:33] <niksavel> hey all
[01:33] <pty> mnk0: what client is the person you're trying to chat to on?
[01:33] <thyko> any ideas?
[01:33] <BeanBag>  free_omen: thanks, also, will ubuntu dapper drake be compatible with my nvidia 6600 PCI-express card? Do i need to do something to get it to work?
[01:33] <DJAdmiral> free_omen: Sometimes RAM isn't as flexible as swap.
[01:33] <niksavel> anyone know anything about beryl?  My right alt (AltGr) is disabled when using it  !!!???  :/
[01:33] <SirKillalot> which device stands for a usb keyboard in ubuntu?
[01:34] <mnk0> any windows client u want them to :) pty
[01:34] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: can you see the link
[01:34] <DJAdmiral> free_omen: Expect serious crashes and errors without a swap partition of at least 500 megs.
[01:34] <pty> mnk0: microsoft netmeeting should work
[01:34] <mnk0> as long as it can do video chat, pty
[01:34] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: Nope.
[01:34] <mnk0> i know, pty, but HOW?
[01:34] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: http://www.stofa.dk/logik/sefilm.php?menuid=5
[01:34] <geniusvicks> How do I access my Windoes laptop thru my Ubu desktop and vie cersa
[01:34] <geniusvicks> vice versa
[01:34] <pty> ok, is your webcam working in ekiga? or at all?
[01:34] <free_omen> DJAdmiral, i'll keep that in mind
[01:34] <mnk0> yes pty
[01:34] <kalikiana> DJAdmiral: i don't think i want to use wine for that, and it would have no tray icon
[01:35] <niksavel> geniusvicks: vnc
[01:35] <pty> ok, do you have a windows pc closeby to test on?
[01:35] <mnk0> i just want to know how to connect to the other guy on netmeeting pty
[01:35] <geniusvicks> niksavel: whats vnce
[01:35] <mnk0> the guy is on the other end, pty
[01:35] <DJAdmiral> kalikiana: It works great. PLENTY of people have tried it. Works flawlessly.
[01:35] <mnk0> but i need to know how to connect to him, as i have an internal ip
[01:35] <johnnybuoy> hello
[01:35] <mnk0> but i need to know how to connect to him, as i have an internal ip, pty
[01:35] <free_omen> BeanBag, well NVidia has good support for linux.. ubuntu worked with my geforce 6600 gt but that was an agp card
[01:35] <johnnybuoy> what is the default kernel in edgy for x86?
[01:35] <free_omen> anyone else knows?
[01:36] <niksavel> geniusvicks: if you are talking about working on a remote connection than the answer is vnc, if it's file sharing than you need to setup samba on ubuntu
[01:36] <geniusvicks> niksavel: I downloaded Samba
[01:36] <johnnybuoy> is it not -generic?
=== sal is now known as salus
[01:36] <geniusvicks> niksavel: I made one of the folders sharable
[01:36] <pty> mnk0: if you have an internal IP you need to set up port forwarding
[01:36] <niksavel> geniusvicks: so it's filesharing
[01:36] <kalikiana> DJAdmiral: maybe it works, but i just don't want to depend on wine
[01:36] <mnk0> pty, is there no way we can call each other using an ekiga.net account?
[01:37] <niksavel> geniusvicks: you need to set it up...  I've found it's easiest through a little prog called webmin
[01:37] <kalikiana> DJAdmiral: thx anyway
[01:37] <pty> ekiga.net uses SIP which doesn't do video
[01:37] <niksavel> geniusvicks: setup the users, workgroup and folders right there
[01:37] <Jaeke555>  bimberi: umm, one more try, do you know how I can set this machine to a domain, or maybe manually configure the DNS / gateway / ip addresses?
[01:37] <geniusvicks> niksavel: no, the folder displayed in the Windows laptop
[01:37] <johnnybuoy> what is the default kernel in edgy for x86?
[01:37] <johnnybuoy> is it not -generic?
[01:37] <mnk0> ekiga also uses h.323
[01:37] <BeanBag> what would you prefer: 64bit dapper or 32bit??
[01:37] <mnk0> oic
[01:37] <niksavel> geniusvicks: you need to configure the windows shared files or ubuntu shared files?
[01:37] <geniusvicks> niksavel:  When i click on it I have to ype the user name and pwd. When I type it, the login screen keeps coming back
[01:37] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: can you decode it?
[01:38] <niksavel> ach
[01:38] <niksavel> hold on
[01:38] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: The video's not showing and the audio's scratchy. Maybe I need to install some codecs.
[01:38] <pty> mnk0: the client does, yes.  to do a h323 call though you one party needs to have their router set up so incoming h.323 stuff goes to your ekiga/netmeeting computer
[01:38] <baastrup> is it possible to record sound like this cat /dev/dsp > raw.file
=== DJAdmiral is now known as Aamir
=== Aamir is now known as Adnurak
[01:39] <geniusvicks> niksavel:  I basically need to access the DVD drive on the laptop thru Ubuntu
[01:39] <mnk0> so if the other guy has an external ip and i have an internal ip, can i call him? pty
=== Adnurak is now known as DJAdmiral
[01:39] <niksavel> geniusvicks: you need to setup a samba user and his password on ubuntu machine
[01:40] <geniusvicks> niksavel:  How do I setup a samba user?
[01:40] <pty> mnk0: as far as i know but i'm not 100% sure
[01:40] <DJAdmiral> !samba > geniusvicks
[01:40] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: its some crazy sounds i know, but i really need that last part of the sound in the video, the chicken sound hehe
[01:40] <niksavel> just type smbpasswd in console
[01:40] <niksavel> and set it up
[01:40] <niksavel> than the login should be your username and the password that what you will type there
[01:40] <DJAdmiral> baastrup: Can't you go find another chicken sound? lol
[01:40] <niksavel> I believe that's all
[01:41] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: nope hehe
[01:41] <baastrup> DJAdmiral: this is the one and only
[01:41] <DJAdmiral> I've never heard chickens referred to as that, but I'll look into this
[01:41] <DJAdmiral> For now I need to go check up on codecs.
[01:41] <johnnybuoy> thanks for the help
[01:42] <mnk0> pty, which ports do i need to fwd?

[01:51] <rope> Is this the same as the freenode.org  #ubuntu chat???
[01:51] <Lattyware> Ethernet is allways better than USB
[01:51] <Lattyware> It going to be faster, more reliable, and easier.
[01:51] <screechingcat> stevr1it: there is no 686 kernel for edgy
[01:51] <[SashOk] > fuck
[01:51] <[SashOk] > di4
[01:52] <Fade> stevr1it: there is no real difference between 386 and 686 from the perspective of the OS.
[01:52] <screechingcat> Lattyware: alwight thanks
[01:52] <stevr1it> no?
[01:52] <bimberi> !language

[01:55] <jstew> Hey, kind  of OT, but has anyone ever had success training spamassassin to reject those 'gibberish' mails, you know the ones that ook like real email but it's just a bunch of non-related words?
[01:55] <Lattyware> So, Anyway, my problem. I have updated to Egdy, and it changed to UUIDs (And my keyboard layout, apparently  <- not a quote) and now it doesnt see my /dev/hdb1 - or d8b2f1c0-7c0c-4f63-960f-2dda3deb18fb
[01:55] <bimberi> ailean: thanks, rub it in ;p
[01:55] <ailean> lol
[01:55] <ailean> hey, i was ready to kick jim
[01:56] <seanh> What is the best way to burn video CDs and DVDs from AVI and MPEG files on Ubuntu? K3b?
[01:56] <Lattyware> GnomeBaker.
[01:56] <stevr1it> i want to unistall automatix and other software unsupported by edgy, how can i do it?
[01:56] <gnomefreak> seanh: gnmebaker or k3b
[01:56] <jstew> can gnomebaker really remaster the AVI into vobs? I never knew that
[01:56] <screechingcat> seanh: k3b does it all. but gnomebaker is simpler
[01:57] <jatt> stevr1it: one advice: do not install automatix.
[01:57] <Lattyware> oh
[01:57] <jatt> stevr1it: sorry read wrong
[01:57] <stevr1it> i had it already, how to uninstall
[01:57] <screechingcat> seanh: but be warned, gnomebaker multisession support is HELL
[01:57] <jatt> stevr1it: sudo apt-get --purge remove
[01:57] <seanh> gnomefreak screechingcat -- the gnomebaker website says it doesn't do video yet?
[01:57] <Lattyware> I just hate K3B for being a KDE app :P
[01:57] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: remove anything that you used automatix to install than change your sources.list file to get rid of automatix stuff or anything else that it added
[01:58] <Lattyware> DeVeDe?
[01:58] <gnomefreak> seanh: than use k3b
[01:58] <screechingcat> seanh: cant u burn it as a data disc with just the video file in it ?
[01:58] <apokryphos> which was a direct GTK copy of k3b, seemed to me
[01:58] <jstew> I really like to look of the Qt widgets but I dont care for how KDE tries to be like windows
[01:58] <apokryphos> jstew: errrrr, it doesn't.
[01:58] <pazemlsqdfmo1> are there any known edgy/samba conflicts?
[01:59] <apokryphos> seriously, jumping between the gnome and kde community is so funny as they both claim that the other looks too much like windows
[01:59] <gnomefreak> pazemlsqdfmo1: not that i know of
[01:59] <teledyn> wow i just discovered ncal
[01:59] <Lattyware> I think KDE is just ugly.
[01:59] <pty> KDE is a little 'cluttered' for my liking
[02:00] <teledyn> uh oh its 'rag on kde' morning!
[02:00] <stevr1it> jatt it does not work
[02:00] <seanh> screechingcat -- it needs to play on a DVD player. Can k3b do it then?
[02:00] <Lattyware> So, Anyway, my problem. I have updated to Egdy, and it changed to UUIDs and now it doesnt see my /dev/hdb1 - or d8b2f1c0-7c0c-4f63-960f-2dda3deb18fb
[02:00] <pazemlsqdfmo1> when i set a map to 2777 and share it over samba, i can access it no problem, when i set it to 2770, i cant access it
[02:00] <pazemlsqdfmo1> it pops a login screen, but i cant log in
[02:00] <Lattyware> teledyn: Everyone is a fanboy at heart :P
[02:00] <pty> lol teledyn: everyone i've helped move to linux in the last few months has prefered KDE
[02:00] <Lattyware> The games console community is worse.
[02:00] <gnomefreak> Lattyware: in menu.lst do you have UUID or root=/dev
[02:01] <jstew> no offense or anything apokryphos but I really think it does *shrug*. Of course this is coming from a guy who switched to gnome from blackbox for 4 years
[02:01] <mirak> I don't understand what is in linux-restricted-modules
[02:01] <Lattyware> UUID=
[02:01] <mirak> is that only firmwares ?
[02:01] <stevr1it> I was updating 6.06 to 6.10 directly and i still have automatix and VMware. Thes system indicates them as errors. How can unistall them? I have tried sudo apt-get --purge remove   but sitll there
[02:01] <gnomefreak> mirak: modules for restricted apps like nvidia and wireless cards so on
[02:02] <mirak> gnomefreak: yes but they aren't kernel modules right ?
[02:02] <jstew> I love modul-assistant.
[02:02] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: i told you how to remove them
[02:02] <mirak> jstew: me too
[02:02] <gnomefreak> mirak: they are
[02:02] <tuxtheslacker> hey, what is the easiest way to track down what is eating up my memory?
[02:02] <stevr1it> no you did not.
[02:02] <jstew> ps auxww
[02:02] <mirak> gnomefreak: so if I build a kernel, how do I have the corresponding restricted modules ?
[02:03] <stevr1it> i have tried sudo apt-get --purge remove but un successfully
[02:03] <gnomefreak> 07:57 <      gnomefreak > stevr1it: remove anything that you used automatix to  install than change your sources.list file to get rid of  automatix stuff or anything else that it added
[02:03] <jstew> look at the mem column
[02:03] <Lattyware> gnomefreak: UUID=
[02:03] <tuxtheslacker> anyone know?
[02:03] <jstew> I just told you tux
[02:03] <gnomefreak> Lattyware: does it prevent it from loading the kernel?
[02:03] <stevr1it> how can I do it? can you be more precise? please
[02:03] <Lattyware> no
[02:03] <mirak> gnomefreak: also by the I built a kernel with make-kpkg and it didn't created kernel-headers packages
[02:03] <gnomefreak> Lattyware: mine does same. i wouldnt worry about it for now
[02:04] <rag> teledyn: hi!!! how are you friend?
[02:04] <tuxtheslacker> stevr1it, was that to me?
[02:04] <gnomefreak> mirak: i havent built a kenrel in years
[02:04] <teledyn> hi rag!
[02:04] <gnomefreak> kernel
[02:04] <Lattyware> gnomefreak: Urm... Well, I kinda cant access my drive.
[02:04] <stevr1it> no to gnomefreak
[02:04] <Lattyware> Which I kinda need
[02:04] <mirak> gnomefreak: there is a bug on radeon 9600 I must build my own
[02:04] <tuxtheslacker> if so... I have 24 gigs of my hd just being eaten by something, and I don't know what it is.
[02:04] <teledyn> you guys, check this out: open a console and type 'ncal'    its totally rad
[02:04] <tuxtheslacker> about a gig dissappears a week....
[02:04] <jstew> I think everyone should build a kernel at least once a year :)
[02:04] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: remove anything that you used automatix to install
[02:04] <rag> teledyn: dont remember all, because i connect other channels and then...
[02:04] <SirKillalot> is there a program which can emulate a keyboard keypress?
[02:04] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: do you remember what you installed with it?
[02:05] <SirKillalot> like "keyboard_emu STRG+C"
[02:05] <Lattyware> tuxtheslacker: Try filelight or disk usage analyzer.
[02:05] <stevr1it> yes
[02:05] <rag> teledyn: my head is...
[02:05] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: remove them
[02:05] <stevr1it> some of them
[02:05] <tuxtheslacker> Lattyware, are they installed by default?
[02:05] <stevr1it> how to remove them?
[02:05] <mirak> I am searching sombody that knows very well kernel building
[02:05] <tuxtheslacker> Lattyware, and if not, what are the programs full names?
[02:05] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: synaptic or apt-get remove
[02:05] <Lattyware> I think DUA comes with Egdy, Filelight is a KDE app you can get from synaptic.
[02:05] <stevr1it> i ok
[02:05] <gnomefreak> or adept
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> I'm on dapper drake.
[02:06] <Lattyware> Ah
[02:06] <Lattyware> it called baobab
[02:06] <Lattyware> nice name :/
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> that's the DUA?
[02:06] <Lattyware> yeah
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> thanks
[02:06] <Lattyware> NP
[02:06] <pty> Lattyware: baobab is also a kind of tree
[02:07] <Lattyware> pty: Ah. right.
[02:07] <tuxtheslacker> hopefully I can find what's eating my hdd.... df can only go so far... hahahah!
[02:07] <stevr1it> it says :  E: vmware-player: il sottoprocesso post-installation script ha restituito un codice di errore 1
[02:07] <stevr1it> error 1
[02:07] <stevr1it> what does ti means?
[02:07] <Lattyware> After the update to edgy, I have lost one of my hard drives (hdb1). It just not there. Can anyone help?
[02:08] <tamacracker> Hey guys what's up?
[02:08] <gnomefreak> if it was in english i could read it than but it prolly says post install script returned code 1
=== Turk is now known as Turk_
[02:08] <tamacracker> I have a silly question... that most likely linux in general won't have
[02:08] <nehoksan> linux sucks
[02:08] <nehoksan> use windows!!
[02:08] <gnomefreak> or along those lines.
[02:08] <Lattyware> ...
[02:08] <tuxtheslacker> nehoksan, thanks... grow a brain please.
[02:08] <stevr1it> the process post - instalaltion script has answered error code 1
[02:09] <screechingcat> is there some kind of GUI frontend for Wine ? i used to have it but i've forgotten the name
[02:09] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: leave it alone what else did you install with it
[02:09] <Lattyware> That is a classy script.
[02:09] <tamacracker> I have a Toshiba mp3 player, and I wanted to know if there was a program for ubuntu that could upload MP3s into my mp3 player
[02:09] <Lattyware> screechingcat: winecfg?
[02:09] <mezoko> hi
[02:09] <samu> How can I find out the IP-address of the system I'm logged into?
[02:09] <jrib> tamacracker: most mp3 players just get mounted like a thumb drive and then you can transfer files back and forth
[02:09] <stevr1it> i don't remeber exactly
[02:09] <gnomefreak> samu: ifconfig
[02:10] <Hgill> samu: type /sbin/ifconfig
[02:10] <tamacracker> jrib I believe my mp3 player has to convert the file to .sat in order to play them.
[02:10] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: than just open /etc/apt/sources.list and remove anything that isnt official repos
[02:10] <mezoko> Where can I donwload the ndiswrapper deb packages, so I can put them on a flash drive? All I have access to atm is a windows box and flash drive
[02:11] <stevr1it> ok
[02:11] <screechingcat> Lattyware: not winecfg. something with options to install/remove software, edit the reg, install basic stuff (like IE and installshield)
[02:11] <tuxtheslacker> okay, my .trash folder has like 24 gigs of stuff in it, and it's not showing up in the trash folder icon... how do I empty that folder safely?
[02:11] <jrib> tamacracker: any hits when you google for your mp3 player model and "linux"?
[02:11] <Lattyware> screechingcat: oh.
[02:11] <jstew> cd .Trash && rm -rf *
[02:11] <tuxtheslacker> jstew, there's nothing in trash that I still need?
=== Turk_ is now known as Turk
[02:12] <tamacracker> jrib: just a bunch of questions regarding to it... but not legit answers
[02:12] <jstew> Thats up to you to decide
[02:12] <tuxtheslacker> jstew, that's a bad question considering it's trash... but there's nothing in there that needs to be there for it to work as the trash, right?
[02:12] <jstew> open a terminal and look at it
[02:12] <jstew> Nope. .Trash is a regular old folder
[02:12] <jrib> tamacracker: you can try emailing toshiba
[02:12] <tamacracker> jrib hm... true.
[02:13] <tamacracker> jrib, thanks... I'll do that :D
[02:13] <Lattyware> I think DUA comes with Egdy, Filelight is a KDE app you can get from synaptic.
[02:13] <Lattyware> whoops
[02:13] <gnomefreak> stevr1it: after you fix your sources.list save and close it than open termianl type sudo apt-get update
[02:13] <Lattyware> I allways end up doing that
[02:13] <mezoko> Does anyone know where I can download the ndiswrapper packages?
[02:13] <tuxtheslacker> holy god that cleared a lot of memory.
[02:13] <tuxtheslacker> hahahaha!
[02:13] <Lattyware> After the update to edgy, I have lost one of my hard drives (hdb1). It just not there. Can anyone help?

It has been shutting off on her randomly, and when I started working on it (unplugged her drives, set it up to install one at a time) and when I plugged it back in, nothing, no fans, no lights nothing. So I tossed in a new motherboard (tried my power supply first and it still didn't respond). I plugged it in and it started so I switched it off, and plugged everything back in. Turned

[02:17] <jstew> NineTeen67Comet: any POST beeps?
[02:17] <sd00> Hi all.  Can anyone help with the following:  if I  "#apt-get install gnome-main-menu"  it reports that it needs   libdbus-1-2  (in edgy, this is  libdbus-1-3).   Should I find a repository for  libdbus-1-2 or do something else?
[02:17] <gnomefreak> mezoko: its not in my edgy repos
[02:17] <mezoko> gnomefreak: hmm where the path for that
[02:17] <mezoko> i downloaded on edgy
[02:17] <mirak> how do I build the restrited modules so they match my custom kernel ?
[02:17] <mezoko> maybe it was in easy ubuntu
[02:17] <Lattyware> After the update to edgy, I have lost one of my hard drives (hdb1). It just not there. Can anyone help?

[02:35] <ianmacgregor> sam_ubtoo: avi is just a container. The video inside it may be something else, like a wmv. If you get an error that a avi won't play stating lack of codec for wmv, it could be a wmv9 inside the avi.
[02:35] <vhzzz> thanks
[02:36] <sam_ubtoo> ohhhh
[02:36] <sam_ubtoo> like that a!

[02:38] <livingdaylight> Guys, to install nivida: after i've installed nvidia-glx and linux-resticted-modules is going into my /etc/X11 xorg.conf and changing driver 'nv' to 'nvidia' enough?
[02:38] <livingdaylight> last time i did sudo nvidia-glx-config enable i had lots of trouble
[02:39] <livingdaylight> someone told me i could just change nv to nvidia
[02:39] <livingdaylight> can someone confirm?
[02:39] <ianmacgregor> livingdaylight: You'll also need to restart X
[02:40] <jrib> Arrick: you can pipe to 'tee' (I think)
[02:40] <livingdaylight> ianmacgregor: yes, of course :) but i meant aside from that - so, answer is yes, thx
[02:40] <sam_ubtoo> What is a GOOD media player then?  is Mplayer ok?
[02:40] <vhzzz> hmm...
[02:40] <vhzzz> nice, hearing some music
[02:40] <hoarycripple> how can i get identd working properly?  i installed midentd, enabled it in xinetd and still irrsi tells me that i don't have any ident response
[02:40] <jrib> sam_ubtoo: mplayer, vlc, xine are all good imo.  totem-gstreamer is ok too
[02:40] <vhzzz> how do i change mp3 to be played in vlc by default?
[02:41] <ianmacgregor> sam_ubtoo: I use MPlayer, but I know vlc is quite popular too
[02:41] <jrib> !defaultapp | vhzzz
[02:41] <ubotu> vhzzz: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties -> Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror -> Settings -> Configure and then hit "File Associations"
[02:41] <vhzzz> found it
[02:41] <sam_ubtoo> wonderful   do you like VCL??
[02:42] <stasislove> i cant change refresh rate, i tried everything i found on ubuntuforums with moduline but still its on 50hz...
[02:42] <Arrick> jrib, morning
[02:42] <jrib> morning Arrick
[02:42] <ianmacgregor> sam_ubtoo: I've never used it. AFAIK, it doesn't do closed captions like MPlayer does.
[02:42] <Arrick> hey you gonna be here for a few jrib ?
[02:42] <vhzzz> more boze
[02:43] <vhzzz> *booze*
[02:43] <mirak> how do I build the restrited modules so they match my custom kernel ?
[02:43] <Arrick> i am trying to install some modules from perl, and they dont seem to come up as a thing I can get
[02:43] <jrib> Arrick: yes, probably
[02:43] <jrib> Arrick: what modules?

[02:44] <cpk1> station_: what does sudo ddcprobe say?
[02:44] <iturk> hi there i have follow this link in order to install windows fonts in my ubuntu -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto !! Now in Gaim when some user try to talk to me i only see chinesse characters !! What happen ???
[02:45] <mirak> so nobody knows ?
[02:45] <Oni-Dracula> anyone know how to fix the roster in gajim if one accidently combined various contacts?
[02:45] <jrib> Arrick: what's the name of the program that needs these things?
[02:45] <Arrick> jrib,  its a pastebot
[02:46] <cpk1> stasislove: what does sudo ddcprobe say?
[02:46] <cpk1> station_: ignored what I said to you, bad tab complete =)
[02:46] <keithhhhh> can anyone tell me where the sound files are for GAIM?
[02:47] <stasislove> cpk1, sudo ddcprobe =\
[02:47] <stasislove> ops
[02:47] <stasislove> cpk1, command not found
[02:47] <stasislove>  it says... =\
[02:47] <james> hello, I am trying to install the nvidia drivers, on edgy, when I do ctrl+alt+F1 and run the installer it tells me I am still running X?
[02:48] <sam_ubtoo> i had a massive problem with chinese on this OS
[02:48] <jrib> !nvidia > james
[02:48] <sam_ubtoo> other OSs seems to be ok but this one isnt good with chinese...
[02:48] <stasislove> james, must kill x....
[02:48] <sam_ubtoo> huangzuobin ni shi zhongguo ren ma ?
[02:49] <sam_ubtoo> wo de shurufa youwenti la !!!  :(
[02:49] <james> stasislove, I have tried that too, I did killall -9 Xorg and it locked the system up
[02:49] <cpk1> stasislove: hrmm I guess we can just try the nitty gritty way, do you know the vertrefresh and horizsync of your monitor?
[02:49] <cpk1> james: pretty sure in edgy you dont need to stop X to install the nvidia package
[02:49] <binmkdir> james: switching to a text console doesnt terminate your X session. /etc/init.d/gdm terminates it.   (and killall -9 Xorg is wrong)
[02:49] <Arrick> jrib, and I think the program thats needs those modules is perl
[02:49] <stasislove> cpkl, yes, i changed that in xorg
[02:49] <Arrick> I cant run a amake
[02:50] <binmkdir> james: /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:50] <cyzie> im puzzled, why is my movie no sounds? i tried a few movies it is the same :/ when i play mp3, it is all fine
[02:50] <james> binmkdir, I did that, I switched and the did the /etc/init.d/gdm stop and the installer still said x was running
[02:50] <earthian> cyzie what player do you use?
[02:51] <binmkdir> james: then the installer is braindead
[02:51] <cpk1> stasislove: would you mind pasting the output of cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:51] <iturk> hi there i have follow this link in order to install windows fonts in my ubuntu -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto !! Now in Gaim when some user try to talk to me i only see chinesse characters !! What happen ???
[02:51] <jrib> Arrick: do you ave libhttp-request-params-perl installed?
[02:51] <binmkdir> james: i don't use those binary only sh*t drivers so i cant tell
[02:51] <cpk1> !pastebin
[02:51] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[02:51] <cyzie> earthian, i tried wxvlc, gxine, mplayer, totem, all is the same :/
[02:51] <earthian> james ctrl+alt+f2 then /etc/init.d/gdm stop and then you should be left with console only? <-- idea.. not sure tho
[02:51] <james> binmkdir, I even rebooted and hit esc when grub came up and went into recovery mode, then tried and it said I couldnt be in telinit 1
[02:51] <earthian> cyzie how about other computers... maybe the movie has damaged sound track?
[02:52] <gnomefreak> earthian: thats how it should work

[02:53] <pazemlsqdfmo1> anyone know why samba is forcing people to log in with Guest?
[02:53] <jrib> Arrick: I don't really do perl, but I'm pretty sure most of that stuff is included.  Maybe it's a version problem
[02:53] <leafw> how can one find out about which packages have been installed from which repository? For example, which of my installed pkgs are from multiverse ?
[02:54] <earthian> cyzie maybe your alsa is not properly configured? hmm.....
[02:54] <Headie> i justupgraded to edgy and now only th eold kernel will boot, a amd64 machine, any standard upgrade problem you already encountered?
[02:54] <earthian> its pretty weird that mp3 have sound and movies dont
[02:55] <cyzie> earthian, if alsa not configured properly, why is mp3 can play?!
[02:55] <earthian> Headie yup :D
[02:55] <earthian> cyzie goot question :(
[02:55] <earthian> good*
[02:55] <gnomefreak> cyzie: try with mplayer see if you get sound an video
[02:55] <totall_6_7> or install VLC
[02:55] <earthian> gnomefreak, totall_6_7 : [15:51:35]  <cyzie> earthian, i tried wxvlc, gxine, mplayer, totem, all is the same :/
[02:56] <cpk1> or try a different backend
[02:56] <Headie> earthian: i am getting a bit confused about the kernel things, it is being moved to kernel-generic or something? instead of a amd64 kernel?
[02:56] <cyzie> gnomefreak, had tried.
[02:56] <gnomefreak> cyzie: what type of video is it?
[02:56] <Arrick> jrib, is there a way to install all the perl lib?
[02:56] <cyzie> avi
[02:56] <Arrick> with ne command?
[02:56] <WonLi> salut
[02:56] <Arrick> one command even
[02:56] <WonLi> je suis nouveau
[02:57] <gnomefreak> cyzie: install w32codecs?
[02:57] <stasislove> cpk1, here is my xorg http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30026/, i tried without modeline to but same result, always 50hz
[02:57] <cyzie> gnomefreak, had installed
[02:57] <earthian> Headie i do not know... i know that my hard drives are not usable now because dmraid is not working with current edgy kernel.. so i decided to compile my own kernel.. whish is ok, but i fail to build initrd image that would launch dmraid at startup before system needs rootfs.
[02:57] <cyzie> gnomefreak,   ii  w32codecs      20060611-0.0   win32 binary codecs
[02:57] <gnomefreak> !avi

[02:57] <gnomefreak> hmmmmm
[02:57] <earthian> hm... vlc should play movies without codecs!
[02:58] <jrib> Arrick: well I don't think that would fix your problem.  libwww-perl should give you HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response, but those are probably the wrong version
[02:58] <gnomefreak> earthian: *should* = keyword
[02:58] <earthian> well it does play everything i have except wmv
[02:58] <Arrick> ok
[02:58] <Headie> earthian: aha, that explaining grub-install not finding the good mappings
[02:58] <WindDragon> any idea what is missing when i play DVD, i have no sound?
=== acuster is now known as avc_feed
[02:59] <cpk1> huh, since when did ubuntu have a "useedid" "false/true"
[02:59] <jrib> Arrick: actually I think I'm wrong
[02:59] <Arrick> I installed it, and am gonna try it lol
[02:59] <Arrick> gotta get this bot working today
[03:00] <gnomefreak> jrib: ty for the reply yesterday about freenode
[03:00] <WonLi> mince
[03:00] <WonLi> alors pourquoi il y a trop de message
[03:00] <jrib> gnomefreak: np, I was confused too about what was going on
[03:00] <jrib> !fr
[03:00] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[03:00] <WonLi> i have a problem
[03:01] <WonLi> what is the default roop password
[03:01] <jrib> !root | WonLi
[03:01] <ubotu> WonLi: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:01] <leafw> how can one find out about which packages have been installed from which repository? For example, which of my installed pkgs are from multiverse ?
[03:01] <stasislove> cpkl i must have sueedid otherwise i cant change resolution eather
[03:01] <WonLi> ok
[03:02] <gnomefreak> leafw: in synaptic on the left side click multiverse
[03:02] <gnomefreak> or universe
[03:02] <leafw> gnomefreak : thanks
[03:02] <stasislove> cpk1, i red in forum about that
[03:02] <WonLi> because my root session ask a password
[03:02] <jrib> WonLi: what root session?
[03:02] <leafw> gnomefreak : so it was that easy
[03:02] <gnomefreak> WonLi: user password
[03:02] <gnomefreak> leafw: in theory its that easy
[03:03] <livingdaylight> ianmacgregor:  that didn't work :(
[03:03] <Kabefis> Hi , when Ubuntu start these 2 line "Failled" => "loading hardware drivers" and "assembling raid arrays" , what's it?
[03:03] <gnomefreak> leafw: ive never tried it but that makes sense
[03:03] <livingdaylight> Wondering if someone can help me enable nvidia 3d?
[03:03] <leafw> gnomefreak : hum, I see a list, but of "Sections", with the repository name in parenthesis
[03:03] <leafw> gnomefreak : not so easy (tedious, at least)
[03:03] <Shaye> livingdaylight, follow the instructions on the wiki page?
[03:03] <cpk1> stasislove: but you set use edid to false?
[03:03] <binmkdir> leafw: for p in `dpkg -l |grep ^ii | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 2` ; do echo $p ; apt-cache show $p | grep ^Section: ; echo ; done |less
[03:03] <gnomefreak> leafw: it should be in the multiverse section
[03:03] <cpk1> edid is what auto detects what your monitor can do
[03:04] <livingdaylight> i've installed nvidia-glx and linux-resticted-modules but when i change nvidia driver from 'nv' to 'nvidia' in /etc/X11xorg.conf and restartX i get the blue error screen
[03:04] <livingdaylight> Shaye: what do you think i did?
[03:05] <Kabefis> i've same problem that you livingday :/
[03:05] <leafw> binmkdir: that's more what I was looking for. I was not sure whether dpkg would keep track of where each pkg came from
[03:05] <binmkdir> leafw: not dpkg, but apt-cache knows it. it is called in the for loop.
[03:05] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: try reinstalling the nvidia-glx and or the l-r-m package
[03:05] <vhzzz> hmm
[03:05] <stasislove> cpk1, yes i red on in thte forum to set it to false to change the resolution and i did and now i can have 1024x768 where i before could only have 800x600 but refresh rate is still locked on 50 but if i dont set useedid to false resolution is locked to
[03:05] <vhzzz> where is my mozilla folder?
[03:06] <leafw> bash voodoo, thanks binmkdir
[03:06] <jwise> hello,boys
[03:06] <jrib> vhzzz: ~/.mozilla ? /usr/lib/mozilla?
[03:06] <binmkdir> leafw: i like bash scripting
[03:07] <jrib> binmkdir: what would that do if the package "foo" is in more than one repository?
[03:07] <vhzzz> this plinux is quite strange for me now
[03:07] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: ok, that's interesting. nvidia-glx is fine but l-r-m i get E: couldn't find package l-r-m . What gives?
[03:07] <leafw> binmkdir : tell me then, the ^Section is multiverse, but the ^ii  ?
[03:07] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: l-r-m = linux-restricted-modules
[03:07] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: yet, when i check in Synaptic i see that it is installed!
[03:07] <aoupi> http://xkcd.com/c178.html
[03:07] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: i know what you meant by l-r-m
[03:07] <binmkdir> jrib: are there packages in more than one repo for one version of ubuntu?
[03:08] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: so, when i apt-get install l-r-m i get error E: package not available and when i check in synaptic i see that it is there and ive installed it before
[03:08] <vhzzz> omg how much places to put these flash systems
[03:08] <binmkdir> leafw: with ^ii i filter the installed packages (dpkg also lists packages that were removed but config was kept)
[03:08] <jrib> binmkdir: possibly if he uses some outside repositories
[03:09] <jwise>  how can I get make my system looks like that:http://www.dailymotion.com/tag/DOCK/video/x7k9h_gnome-dock-akamaru-dock
[03:09] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: did you isntall your kernels version of them?
[03:09] <binmkdir> jrib: okay, then the script would list more than one section per package
[03:09] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: 2.6.17? [edgy] 
[03:10] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: whatever uname -r says
[03:10] <binmkdir> jrib: the ^ in ^ii stands for beginning of a line (it is a metacharater in regular expressions)
[03:11] <binmkdir> jrib: sorry, that should go to leafw
[03:11] <vhzzz> where is firefox? /browser/plugins
[03:11] <rikai> Hm... there any way to access a windows share on a passwordless windows machine from ubuntu? The windows machine has no internet access, so there's really no need for a password, but ubnutu still asks for one when i try and connect to it via places > connect to server.
[03:12] <redmonkey> is it really necessary to have always the latest linux system with all updates and everything? a friend of mine wants to install linux but he has only got a 28.8k modem..
[03:12] <Elohimus> Morning, I'm having an issue with my sound, it doesn't work. lspci shows: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 04)
[03:12] <cpk1> stasislove: well you might want to stick to the forum post to get it to work, I havent tried edgy so dont know if there are differences there, plus it sounds like you might be mangling your xorg a little and I dont want to help mangle it further =P
[03:12] <mikeymike> ok so how do i run metacity from a tty and make it run on my xserver thats still up on ctrl-alt-f7
[03:12] <mikeymike> its saying display not found obviously i dont know how to make it "go to" the x server
[03:12] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: aha! so uname -r gives 2.6.17-10 but what i had had installed checking in synaptic is 2.6.17-11. Would that be a problem. I found next to it 2.6.17-10 and installed that now
[03:12] <Crembo> gaim displays gibberish on all my ICQ buddies with hebrew nicks.. is there a way to change the encoding it uses?
[03:12] <ianmacgregor> vhzzz: /usr/lib/firefox/plugins ?
[03:13] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: when i initially installed it i obviously just picked 2.617 not worrying about the difference of 11 or10
[03:13] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: try it. i cant rememeber the versions needed as i use different packages
[03:13] <mikeymike> if i ctrl alt f7 i get a blank screen but a cursor i want to restore a window manager on my x session
[03:13] <Fade> ubuntu uses utf8 encodings by default now, so if you have a hebrew font installed, and game understands utf8, you should be good to go.
[03:14] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: should i uninstall 2.6.17-11 or will EFT just select the right one if both are available?
[03:14] <zerokarmaleft> in the middle of a fresh edgy install with the alt CD, and it's sitting at 6% after copying the files over
[03:14] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: you should be fine leaving it
[03:14] <livingdaylight> ok
[03:14] <rikai> redmonkey, not at all. You can ignore any update requests, as updating is always at the users disgression.
[03:14] <Crembo> Fade:  well, gaim seems to handle MSN hebrew nicks okay, but not from ICQ...
[03:14] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: if it conflicts it will remove it for you
[03:14] <stasislove> cpk1, well i started small just changing vertical and horisontal rate, but as it didt work i started to change more and more, all i did i did from ubuntuforums but all say same thing and it didt work, so i dont know what to do, forum dont work in my case
[03:15] <Arrick> jrib,nogo on the libwww-perl
[03:15] <rikai> redmonkey, the only point an upgrade of anything might be required is when installing new packages.
[03:15] <mikeymike> can anyone tell me how to run a window manager from tty1 and make it "work" in 7?
[03:15] <gnomefreak> ill be back in a few minutes
[03:15] <redmonkey> rikai: but do you still have the security if you dont update your system at all?
[03:15] <mikeymike> or perhaps a gnome key-combo to bring up a "run" box
[03:15] <jrib> Arrick: pastebin the configure script
[03:16] <Arrick> jrib, the configure script?
[03:16] <xorllu> how can i remove this proftpd error =>"error setting IPV6_V6ONLY: Protocol not available" (from proftpd.log)
[03:16] <Arrick> uhm, dont know what you mean
[03:16] <Arrick> there is no conf
[03:16] <mikeymike> anyone?
[03:16] <rikai> redmonkey, you'll not patch any security holes, so the secrity flaws will still be there. If you're running a stable release, most updates are small anyway.
[03:16] <kmaynard> xorllu, you need to set proftp to use ipv4
[03:17] <mikeymike> i get an error trying to run metacity from tty1 because x is still running on 7... how do i run it from tty1 to restory access to my x ?
[03:17] <ianmacgregor> redmonkey: Well, if a security exploit has been found, and a patch release to fix it, you will still be vulnerable to that exploit if you don't upadate the system.
[03:17] <xorllu> kmaynard, how?
[03:17] <sam_ubtoo> can someone PLEASE tell me where i can get the codexes from ...
[03:17] <zerokarmaleft> is it possible to trace from tty2 what part of the installation script is hanging?
[03:17] <rikai> redmonkey, i've run ubuntu on a 14.4 modem before, and didn't have any major major problems with updating occasionally.
[03:17] <mikeymike> i get an error trying to run metacity from tty1 because x is still running on 7... how do i run it from tty1 to restore access to my x ? **
[03:17] <mikeymike> sorry
[03:17] <sam_ubtoo> i still cant play this one AVI file!! its just sound!!!
[03:17] <kmaynard> xorllu, or if you're already using ipv4, the daemon is trying and failing to load 6. if it's working all except for that one error, ignore it
[03:17] <kmaynard> !codec > sam_ubtoo
[03:17] <vhzzz> hmm.. cant copy because not superuser
[03:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about codec - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:18] <kmaynard> !codecs > sam_ubtoo
[03:18] <sam_ubtoo> codec hehehe
[03:18] <kmaynard> my ba

[03:18] <vhzzz> dont remember the folders
[03:18] <me> ubuntu kewl
[03:18] <jrib> Arrick: aren't you running ./configure?
[03:18] <mikeymike> i get an error trying to run metacity from tty1 because x is still running on 7... how do i run it from tty1 to restore access to my x on ctrl+alt+f7
[03:18] <Arrick> jrib, nope
[03:18] <Arrick> wasnt told to
[03:18] <jrib> Arrick: oh what are you running to get that?
[03:18] <Arrick> exit
[03:19] <zerokarmaleft> the normal edgy install iso hangs for me too when firing up X
[03:19] <Arrick> wrong place

[03:23] <mikeymike> how do i sort my ps output by cpu usage
[03:23] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: arrr... still no joy :|
[03:23] <Nauhs> can anyone help me? i have ubuntu installed on my system but when i try to log on it accepts the password and user then the cursor turns into an hourglass then goes back to log on
[03:23] <ifireball> Marelo: e.g. edgy or dapper?
[03:23] <Marelo> ifireball: dapper
[03:23] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: what version of the drivers and what card are you using?
=== avc_feed is now known as acuster
[03:23] <Trist_an> Nauhs, did you upgrade from Dapper to Edgy?
[03:24] <Nauhs> from 386 to 686
[03:24] <Elohimus> Morning, I'm having an issue with my sound, it doesn't work. lspci shows: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 04) is there a certain driver I'm going to need?
[03:24] <Marelo> ifireball: any clue??
[03:24] <xaxcasd> hi
[03:25] <ianmacgregor> hi
[03:25] <me> Latty: have you worked with BlueTooth on Uduntu?
[03:25] <Nauhs> in my boot menu it never had ubuntu 686 but now it does
[03:25] <ifireball> Marelo: boot into rescue mode (with the GRUB menu selection) then run update-rc.d remove postfix
[03:25] <me> Ubuntu, pardon ma french
[03:25] <Marelo> ifireball: I'll try
[03:25] <xaxcasd> I need help with setting up a lamp server easily... I need a GUI like that one for mac os x http://mamp.info/images/screenshot_s1_1_en.jpg
[03:25] <Marelo> just a minute
[03:25] <what_if> Elohimus: is that an Intel HD audio chip ??
[03:25] <mikeymike> how do i restore a windowmanager on an x session that lost one
[03:25] <ifireball> Marelo: this will disable postfix from laoding on startup, then you can boot to full mode and try to fix the config
[03:25] <Elohimus> what_if: it is indeed.
[03:25] <mikeymike> from a tty
[03:26] <Trist_an> Nauhs, what is your version of Ubuntu?
[03:26] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: GeForce 6600/GeForce 6600 GT
[03:26] <mikeymike> running one from a tty yields a no display
[03:26] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: not sure whaqt you mean by version of drivers?
[03:26] <what_if> Elohimus: good luck, I have one of those and support is spotty at best
[03:26] <Marelo> ifireball: ok. actually I don't want postfix... I think the Adept package manager auto-select it...
[03:26] <Nauhs> it is the newest dapper LTS
[03:26] <mikeymike> how do i run it as whatever tty the xsession is running from
[03:26] <Elohimus> what_if: hah, fuck. ;)
[03:26] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
[03:26] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: what version
[03:26] <what_if> Elohimus: there is in the kernel a specific intel HD driver the may work
[03:26] <Nauhs> Trist_an: it is the full update of Dapper LTS
[03:26] <Trist_an> Nauhs, the newest is Edgy Eft
[03:26] <Elohimus> what_if: I would have imaged it would work with Dapper.
[03:27] <what_if> Elohimus: mine pops and has low audio, but kinda works
[03:27] <Trist_an> Nauhs, so you are now under Edgy, right?
[03:27] <what_if> Elohimus: it worked in dapper ?
[03:27] <Elohimus> what_if: no, I'm using dapper right now.
[03:27] <Nauhs> Tristan_an now im in live cd
[03:27] <Elohimus> what_if: I'm just saying I would have imagined it would have.
[03:27] <kromel> Anyone here able to assist me with a Wireless mouse?  The dongle is USB.  Every time I reboot, I have to unplug the dongle and plug it back in, in order to get the mouse to work.
[03:27] <awerley> can someone explain to me how to mount a LUN  on an hba?
[03:27] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30029/
[03:28] <ifireball> Marelo: Actuall I'm not sure that its not part of the default Ubuntu, every UNIX is supposed to have an MTA but you can try simply "apt-get remove --purge"ing it
[03:28] <what_if> Elohimus: OIC... it may work now my kernel is at least 6 months old.....

[03:28] <Trist_an> Nauhs, what version of Ubuntu do you have currently installed? I had that trouble when upgrading from Dapper to Edgy
[03:28] <The_9> ok
[03:28] <gnomefreak> The_9: please use pastebin when you need to paste
[03:28] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: k
[03:29] <what_if> how do I tell the ubuntu installer to install the server kernel instead of the generic ??
[03:29] <Nauhs> trist_an i think thats what i've done, i did an update through command
[03:29] <Nauhs> trist_an: iwill show you the link
[03:29] <xaxcasd> hey, do anybody know an alternative to mamp ? http://mamp.info
[03:29] <gnomefreak> what_if: OEM mode installer or server installer
[03:29] <salome> does anyone at ubuntu know that the mozilla-thunderbird package has been broken since the beginning of dapper?
[03:30] <vhzzz> that didn't help me to see youtube.com
[03:30] <vhzzz> hmm..
[03:30] <Trist_an> Nauhs, did you try to boot in safe mode? Then try startx and try to go in the monitor display to change the currently used Xorg driver
[03:30] <vhzzz> strange is this life
[03:30] <what_if> gnomefreak: I am using the "install a command line system" option
[03:30] <ianmacgregor> salome: What is the problem with it?
[03:30] <jrib> Arrick: are you still getting HTTP:: errors?
[03:30] <salome> it segfaults on imap handshaking
[03:30] <stasislove> anyone can help me change refresh rate in edgy?
[03:30] <jrib> s/errors/warnings
[03:30] <salome> if I build it from source its fine.
[03:30] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: xorg.conf output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30030/
[03:30] <Nauhs> trist_an: i put this sudo apt-get install linux-686 in command
[03:31] <Nauhs> trist_an: then i restarted
[03:31] <Arrick> jrib, yep
[03:31] <cntb> I am now in ubuntu generic install
[03:31] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: is it an onboard video card?
[03:31] <salome> its also fine if its set to pop or local
[03:31] <awerley> anybody have any experience mounting arrays via a hba?
[03:31] <coz_> stasislove, what is the problem
[03:31] <cntb> what repos from here to have full running system
[03:31] <Trist_an> Nauhs, and if you reboot on linux-386?
[03:31] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: no
[03:31] <xaxcasd> is there any solution to get an "apple-quartz"-like graphiccard-accelerated gui ?
[03:31] <OoberMick> The_9: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/apache/+bug/6742
[03:31] <ifireball> xaxcasd: Syanptic :P
[03:31] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: than your bus id is wrong
[03:31] <Nauhs> trist_an: same problem
[03:32] <Trist_an> Nauhs, normally if you're under Edgy you have only generic kernel
[03:32] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: change the pci bus id to match the slot the card is in
[03:32] <xaxcasd> ifireball, but ist here a gui control for lamp server ?
[03:32] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: it has onboard inegrated graphics but the nvidia is not . it is AGP
[03:32] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: lspci should give you a hint
[03:32] <Nauhs> ahh
[03:32] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: the bus id 1:0:0 is for onboard cards
[03:32] <Trist_an> Nauhs, I think you should try to boot in safe mode and maybe change the xorg.conf to change the graphic card driver to vesa.
=== sd00_away is now known as sd00
[03:33] <Nauhs> ok
[03:33] <Nauhs> i will do that
[03:33] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: i see.. any idea what agp card bus id would be?
[03:33] <Nauhs> trist_an: i should restart in recovery mode? yea?
[03:33] <Trist_an> Nauhs, I can only tell you my idea since i finished by formatting and reinstalling edgy over dapper since no one seems to have ahd this troube*
[03:33] <stasislove> coz_, i installed nvidia beta drivers to run beryl and beryl works but i cant change resolution or refresh rate, but i managed to change resolution by disabling useedid but refresh rate is still 50 and i cant change that no matter how many forum posts i read
[03:33] <Trist_an> Nauhs, btw, are you on a laptop?
[03:33] <Nauhs> desktop
[03:33] <Imrahil> does anyone have an opinion as to which totem (xine or gstreamer) can handle h.264 quicktime movie trailers better?
[03:33] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: lspci should give you a hint if you give me the numbers next to it in lspci i might beable to convert it from hex if its in hex
[03:34] <ifireball> xaxcasd: as far as starting and stopping goes, you can do it with System->Administration->services; for more advanced config you can try using webmin for apache and phpmyadmin for mysql
[03:34] <vhzzz> is there anybody who is drunk in here?
[03:34] <Trist_an> Nauhs, also check if you have xserver-xorg installed....
[03:34] <coz_> stasislove, did you do an dpkg-reconfigure xser-xorg
[03:34] <tritium> vhzzz: stay on topic, please
[03:34] <Nauhs> ok i will restart in safe mode an try sort this
[03:34] <sd00> I'm trying to get SLAB installed.  I followed the apt-get route (as listed here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Slab). It seemed to complete OK, but there is no change (i.e. no slab).  Any Clues?
[03:34] <coz_> stasislove, dpkg-recongiure xserver-xrog
[03:34] <Nauhs> thanks
[03:34] <Nauhs> tristan
[03:34] <gnomefreak> reconfigure
[03:34] <stasislove> coz_, yes if i do that i get resolution 800x600 and refresh rate 50
[03:35] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: lspci output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30031/ sorry about this :|
[03:35] <coz_> stasislove, well you have to tell xserver what resolution youwant and to do that during recongifure you have to choose the resoution with the space bar
[03:35] <Marelo> ifireball: the correct syntax was "update-rc.d postfix remove" and it told me to use "-f" option. I will reboot it now and see if it works...
[03:35] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: according to this its the onboard card that is nvidia
[03:36] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: no, lol, never was
[03:36] <xaxcasd> I love ubuntu :)
[03:36] <xaxcasd> Our company is now free !
[03:36] <stasislove> coz_, i did but it changes when i look into log file it says i cant use 1024.. using default o.0
[03:36] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: its a cheap asus motherboard
[03:36] <gnomefreak> 15. 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV43 [GeForce 6600/GeForce 6600 GT]  (rev a2)  the 1:0:0 is for onboard cards
[03:36] <vhzzz> hm.. where can i chat offtopic with some drunken plinux pros?
[03:37] <gnomefreak> 01:00.0*
[03:37] <gnomefreak> ah
[03:37] <tritium> vhzzz: #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:37] <u221e> Has anyone tried emacs-snapshot-gtk? Is it any good?
[03:37] <coz_> stasislove, i assume your monitor can handle that resolution correct?
[03:37] <what_if> ok... i need ipsec support in ubuntu. there is no module for it, how so i see if it is compiled in ?
[03:37] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: in your xorg.conf file change the PCI:1:0:0 to 01:00.0
[03:38] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: ok
[03:38] <gnomefreak> leave the PCI alone just change the numbers and :.
[03:38] <cntb> is there a compiz in ubuntu?
[03:38] <stasislove> yes i had that resolution and refresh rate in older ubuntu and in windows
[03:38] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: change the nv to nvidia
[03:38] <stasislove> coz_, ^
[03:38] <gnomefreak> livingdaylight: save restart X
[03:38] <livingdaylight> gnomefreak: yea, i was looking at the last line for a hint
[03:38] <Marelo> ifireball: are you there?
[03:38] <tritium> what_if: ipsec is supported in the 2.6 kernels, and there is an ipsec-tools package, among others
[03:38] <coz_> stasislove, is your nic registered?
[03:38] <coz_> stasislove, it would be easier to talk in pm
[03:39] <stasislove> coz_, no =\
[03:39] <what_if> tritium: nice... thankyou
[03:39] <Marelo> ifireball: i think it worked. but got other problem now: the bootscreen is freezed again, with nothing on it. just the kubuntu logo and the progress bar empty
[03:39] <coz_> stasislove, ok start from the beginning, tell me how you installed the OS and what happned
[03:39] <sd00> Anyone? -->  I'm trying to get SLAB installed.  I followed the apt-get route (as listed here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Slab). It seemed to complete OK, but there is no change (i.e. no slab).  Any Clues?
[03:40] <gnomefreak> sd00: did you add it to your panel?
[03:41] <gnomefreak> sd00: right click panel in gnome and choose the one for slab
[03:41] <ifireball> Marelo: so your problem is probably not with postfix, try tweaking the GRUB boot line and removing the "spalsh" parameter from the kernel line, then it will boot in text mode and you can maybe see some more information
[03:41] <sd00> gnomefreak: thats what i was looking for - thanks
[03:42] <gnomefreak> yw
[03:42] <gnomefreak> brb reboot see if i got everything :)
[03:42] <Marelo> ifireball: and how do I do that? (I'm kind a noobie in linux... just learning...)
[03:42] <ianmacgregor> In my kernel line, I see "quiet", does that suppress some boot up info? What does that do?
[03:43] <stasislove> coz_, i installed ubuntu, there is really not many options, i did clean install and it started wothout problems, so i went to beryl-project and folowed walktrhrough, that is i installed nvidia beta drivers, it works fine but i cant change resolution or refresh rate so i started looking in forums
[03:43] <cyzie> im puzzled. why is my movies no sound output. i have tried to play with vlc, gxine, mplayer, totem. all no sounds. however, when i play mp3, i got sound. any idea why is this happening ?
[03:43] <coz_> stasislove, what is your monitor size and make
[03:44] <ifireball> ianmacgregor: it makes the kernel not spew out tons of debug text as it loads
[03:44] <ianmacgregor> ifireball: Ahh, ok. heh, I'l leave it in there then :)
[03:44] <stasislove> coz_, 17" hansol monitor
[03:44] <coz_> stasislove, and what how to did you use to install beryl
[03:45] <tim__> anyone solved this low framerate prob with the fglrx drivers under edgy?
[03:45] <livingdaylight> arrrr...
[03:45] <stasislove> coz_, from repositories
[03:45] <stasislove> coz_, both drivers and beryl packedges
[03:45] <skel> quick question, is it possible to install packages via apt-get on the livecd ?
[03:46] <coz_> stasislove, I will give you link to follow, can't hurt anything to check if everythng is installed correctly     http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-5021-howto-beryl-aiglx-nvidia-drivers
[03:46] <skel> I'd try but I don't have one handy and didn't want to download / burn one to find out
[03:46] <coz_> stasislove, read carefully and try it out
[03:46] <tritium> !beryl
[03:46] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[03:47] <gigiven> ola
[03:47] <Marelo> ifireball: and how do I do that? (I'm kind a noobie in linux... just learning...)
[03:48] <u221e> How do I have 3d accell if I haven't installed the ATI drivers yet?
[03:48] <gigiven> uuuua
[03:48] <jdroid-> how can i map the right alt key to be a normal alt key?
[03:48] <[A] ndy80> hi
[03:48] <cntb> what mono components are installed by default
[03:48] <kimmern> Hey! I've got a really annoying problem here..my fan goes on for about 2 sec..pause 2 sec..runs 2 sec..and so on..never experienced this before..I'm going to throw my laptop out the window soon, cause this makes me really angry to listen to..use a FS amilo L1300..any suggestions? anywhere I can check the temprature of my laptop? use kubuntu edgy
[03:48] <coz_> stasislove, later we can fo through the recongiure while you are here
[03:49] <Tomcat_> kimmern: Try acpi -V in the console
[03:49] <Tomcat_> kimmern: You can check what's causin the fan to go on with top.
[03:49] <cntb> amilo is truly a bad notebook kimmern
[03:49] <Tomcat_> kimmern: But in my experience, Amilo have a tendency to not work well with Linux.
[03:49] <Tomcat_> Haha cntb. :)
[03:49] <kimmern> cntb: yeah, I know!
[03:50] <ifireball> Marelo: in the grub menu, you can see instractions beneath the menu, basically, you go the the normal line you ususally select to load the system, press "e", the go to the "kernel" line press "e" again move with the arrows and delete the words "quiet" and "splash" then press "esc" and "b" to bood with yout modified line, that should give you a "noisy" boot with debug info
[03:50] <kimmern> Tomcat: I've checked, but didn't find anyting particulare..
[03:50] <cntb> my client got rid of his
[03:50] <stasislove> coz_, it seems like i installed everything right, and no matter what i do to xorg it refuse =\
[03:51] <Marelo> ifireball: thanks again! trying it right now
[03:51] <cntb> want a cheap and reliable no windows PC
[03:51] <kimmern> Tomcat_: No support for device type: thermal....
[03:51] <cntb> try CLEVO
[03:51] <[A] ndy80> I tried to dist-upgrade two different kind of PC's from dapper to edgy without success. The first PC is my home PC (amd 1300, 512 ram, matrox g400). The other one is one of the PC of my LUG (linux user group) in our office. No success with both of them! We encounter errors with xorg-* package. In particular xkb-data on my home PC and other xorg packages with the LUG PC. Why the dist-upgrade is so unstable?!
[03:52] <cntb> what is mono used for ? what mono is installed by default ?
[03:52] <coz_> stasislove, that doesn't make sense
[03:52] <mypapit_> [A] ndy80: i've ran into the same problem too
[03:52] <coz_> stasislove, ok open terminal and typ in the sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:52] <Delkster> cntb, at least Beagle needs mono
[03:53] <mypapit_> [A] ndy80: i just apt-get install xorg-* package, and/or apt-get uninstall ubuntu-desktop, and install it back
[03:53] <stasislove> coz_, ok, but i warn you i did it before =)
[03:53] <Delkster> There may be something else in the default install that requires mono, but I can't remember
[03:53] <mypapit_> [A] ndy80: it worked somehow
[03:53] <[A] ndy80> mypapit_: cool to ear... so it's not only a my problem :)
[03:53] <raghu206> there is shutting down problem in my edgy it shutdowns normally but waits untill i manually turnoff my box
[03:53] <coz_> stasislove, when you get to the part that about the driver make sure you space bar nvidia
[03:53] <mypapit_> [A] ndy80: yeah..
[03:53] <bRutEado> Hi! I have a cd with the KUBUNTU Linux 6.06 but when i try to start the program nothing happens. The computer starts but nothing happens. How can i make to the compuiter start from the cdrom?
[03:53] <[A] ndy80> mypapit_: on my home PC the problem is with xkb-data.... I should try to unistall ubuntu-desktop anyway?
[03:54] <mypapit_> [A] ndy80: it's related somehow
[03:54] <stasislove> coz_, ok ill try it
[03:54] <mypapit_> [A] ndy80: i've the exact same problem with you
[03:54] <defrysk> bRutEado, usually one can set the cd as bootable in the bios
[03:54] <coz_> stasislove, I am sure you know what you are doing but tell me ech window that it shows
[03:54] <Marelo> ifireball: weird... it booted at text mode... tty1.... a little up there was: - Starting periodic command scheduler [ok]  (other line) - Configuration syntax error detected, not starting/reloading... [fail] 
[03:54] <[A] ndy80> mypapit_: ok, let me try then...
[03:54] <[A] ndy80> we :)
[03:55] <[A] ndy80> (sorry, wrong window)
[03:55] <Marelo> then it's said "starting k display manager: kdm" but stayed on text mode tty1
[03:55] <coz_> stasislove, the first window should have nivida as default
[03:55] <bRutEado> defrysk how can i make that in the bios? I was ther but i don't understand how can i modify
[03:55] <coz_> stasislove, make sure nvidia is highlighed an dhit ok
[03:56] <[A] ndy80> mypapit_: ops! I forgot I installed edgy from scratch on the desktop PC :( So I'll try on my LUG's PCs when I'll go there.
[03:56] <stasislove> coz_, ok drivers i space nvidia so its marked with blue and press ok... next identifier: gneric video card
[03:56] <defrysk> bRutEado, usually the cdrom can be set as bootable , just like your hard drive , just set cdrom as bootable first of at least before your harddrive
[03:56] <coz_> stasislove, right just kind of hit ok for everything until you get to the resolution window
[03:57] <Trist_an> Is anyone running on a laptop has control over his processor speed and so on?
[03:57] <ifireball> Marelo: wierd indeed, did you try using cron? if not, there may be a bad file in /etc/cron.d (did you did some local compiles, manual installs, etc. ?)
[03:57] <stasislove> coz_, bus: PCI 1:0:0
[03:57] <coz_> stasislove, right just keep hitting ok until the resolution window
[03:57] <Marelo> no I didn't any of that
[03:58] <Marelo> ifireball: no, I didn't do any of that...
[03:58] <texas915> can someone help me how to build and install a program in ubuntu

[04:09] <ntoll> where do I check "Show commercial applications"????
[04:09] <zerokarmaleft> ok, installing edgy with the alternate iso, and it's hanging where dpkg configures all the packages
[04:09] <[BreliC] > did anyone else have a problem with the Edgy partitioner when installing?  I specifically assign a root partition but it says I don't have one assigned
[04:09] <cyzie> anyone using onboard sound card?
[04:09] <sheri_rao> any help on JVC GC-A33 webcam ?
[04:09] <defrysk> ntoll, go to the link provided

[04:09] <Marelo> ifireball: lucky alright!! :-) weel, thanks again and... "Will now halt" :-P
[04:10] <[A] ndy80> [BreliC] : same problem for me!!!
[04:10] <Gamma> i got few questions here
[04:10] <[BreliC] > [A] ndy80, really?  damn
[04:10] <cyzie> tarzeau, defrysk any problem with the sound ?
[04:10] <[BreliC] > [A] ndy80, how many partitions do you have?
[04:10] <defrysk> cyzie, nope and what type of probs ?
[04:10] <zerokarmaleft> ridiculous, this is SO Knot 4
[04:10] <cyzie> defrysk, im puzzled. why is my movies no sound output. i have tried to play with vlc, gxine, mplayer, totem. all no sounds. however, when i play mp3, i got sound. any idea why is this happening ?
[04:10] <kishore> hi all
[04:11] <Gamma> would it faster if i install the catalyst driver for radeon while using XGL ?
[04:11] <ntoll> defrysk, its for dapper not edgy... the repos are for dapper
[04:11] <[A] ndy80> [BreliC] : don't remember in that pc... but if you use the alternate cd installation (textual installer) it works fine
[04:11] <VigoFuse> These are the facts, http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_to_Promote_Linux_The_Details/1162528842
[04:11] <defrysk> ntoll, commercial apps also should work for edgy afaik
[04:11] <Ropechoborra> http://xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png Check this out ! xDD!
[04:11] <[BreliC] > [A] ndy80, oh where is the textual installer?  I tried the second option (graphics safe mode) but didn't find the text installer
[04:11] <ntoll> defrysk, so its safe to add that as a repos?
[04:12] <[A] ndy80> [BreliC] : you need another CD called "alternate - i386"
[04:12] <[A] ndy80> download it
[04:12] <[BreliC] > [A] ndy80, ok, thanks
[04:12] <defrysk> ntoll, not sure to be honest but it should be safe for just installing binaries like opera and realplayer
[04:12] <defrysk> ntoll, its closed source so not mutch could go wrong
[04:13] <defrysk> as in with your os that is
[04:13] <Gamma> ... so would it be faster if i install the catalyst driver for radeon while using XGL ?
[04:13] <OoberMick> Ropechoborra: I tired that with my girlfriend she said I'm not a sudoer :(
[04:13] <coz_> stasislove, well
[04:13] <ntoll> defrysk, hmmm... I've got my sources file pointing ta the cannonical.com commercial.... seems there isn't anything there :-(
[04:13] <ntoll> or they haven't re-pointed the URL
[04:13] <stasislove> coz_, the resolution is 800x600 refresh rate is 50hz and in cant change it
[04:13] <Ropechoborra> OoberMick hahaha lol ! :P
[04:14] <defrysk> ntoll, otherwise go to opera.com , there is a .deb available for ubuntu
[04:14] <coz_> stasislove, this is puzzling try another guyhere maybe they can help this is mystifying and I would have to be there to see it
[04:14] <coz_> stasislove, sorry for making redo things you already did
[04:15] <stasislove> coz_, thanks for trying.
[04:15] <texas915> is there a repos for mplayer
[04:15] <fuoco> anyone here has an ibook 1.42 Ghz ?
[04:15] <defrysk> texas915, yes
[04:15] <defrysk> !mplayer
[04:15] <ubotu> mplayer is a media player. Enable multiverse repo and type sudo apt-get install mplayer for more info please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer  To compile it from source see:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer/Compile

[04:16] <FuriousRage> i got the ubuntu cd-s a while ago and was thinking on to turn my old box into a server, on the cd, is it "only" the desktop version or does the "server" also come in that cd? (from shipit)
[04:17] <VigoFuse> I am just curious by nature, and that deal between Novell/Microsoft is a threat to all open source develpment.

[04:19] <defrysk> money shakes anything
[04:19] <VigoFuse> It happened
[04:19] <mikeymike-linux> is it possible to play drm protected files in linux if you have the key bakups
[04:19] <[A] ndy80> lukas_: interoperability between the two systems.
[04:19] <Corbo> hello
[04:19] <mjr> mikeymike-linux, afaik no. Don't buy drm.

[04:22] <Goomie> Is there a limit on the size of swap space.  I read it each swap space should be no more then 2048MB is that still true?
[04:22] <cntb> better use router config it and be happy
[04:22] <lukas_> [A] ndy80: so what Suse is used for ? when Windows system is enough ?
[04:22] <Corbo> cntb: I have my vpn connected, but can't contact anything on the other end, can you help?
[04:22] <MasseR> I doubt anyone of you know, but what could cause my ethernet NIC to stop working after fast transfer rates (100mbps). If I ping while transferring it complains about buffer full. The card still recieves, but can't transmit. I think
[04:23] <VigoFuse> I just read about it myself 2 hours ago, didnt want to spam this #channel with it, but I get apprehensive when Microsoft takes over or becomes a part of anything.
[04:23] <Lattyware> I have a partition (hdb1) which takes up the entire drive, but it has dissapeared, and GParted shows it as unallocated.
[04:23] <cntb> I am not sure
[04:23] <Lattyware> Anyone know what I can do?
[04:23] <Corbo> cntb - love to, but my crappy router has no vpn facility
[04:23] <[A] ndy80> lukas_: they will exchange information to permit both systems to interoperate
[04:23] <cntb> ah
[04:23] <Goomie> Lattyware: sounds like it was deleted
[04:23] <cntb> hi LjL
[04:24] <Lattyware> Goomie: Any way of recovering?
[04:24] <Corbo> the vpn authenticates, and is connected, but it's not playing
[04:24] <Lattyware> Because there was like 250GB of data there.
[04:24] <lukas_> [A] ndy80: why don't M$ and Ubuntu but Suse ? lolz
[04:24] <Goomie> Lattyware: did it have your install or just another partition
[04:24] <LjL> hi
[04:24] <Lattyware> Data partition
[04:24] <lukas_> Corbo: you need to add route
[04:24] <cntb> hip hip! -when did it happen ? finally installing flash is a breeze . LjL ?
[04:24] <Corbo> lukas: I have added the route 192.168.222.0/24 - which is the network at the other end, yes?
[04:24] <Goomie> Lattyware: i know little about drive recovery, i just chalk it up as a lose usually
[04:25] <Lattyware> Goomie: Yeah, I have done the same in the past, but that is alot of data to loose
[04:25] <LjL> cntb, dunno, i never had it installed in the first place ;)
[04:25] <Goomie> Lattyware: yeah, I'd google it, what filesystem?
[04:25] <FlyingSquirrel32> is it hard for me to upgrade my mysql server to 5.0 from 4.0 if it's already set up and all?

[04:26] <sandy16> how can i make my own apt-cd
[04:26] <cntb> flash is widely used how can you not install it ?
[04:26] <Goomie> Lattyware: any ideas on what caused it?
[04:27] <[A] ndy80> lukas_: why Ferrari uses Shell Vpower and Not Agip/Esso/Q8? just commercial agreement :)
[04:27] <manen_> apt-cdrom
[04:27] <Lattyware> No, the only things I have done recently are updating to Egdy and installing Beryl
[04:27] <Lattyware> and it happened after those anyway
[04:27] <ifireball> FlyingSquirrel32: from 4.0 to 4.1 it was no swaet just "apt upgrade" can't give any gurantee about 5 though, I suppose you should just "mysqldump" and go for it
[04:27] <Lattyware> (as in like 3 boots after
[04:27] <Lattyware> )
[04:28] <Goomie> Lattyware: maybe improper umount but im no expert.

[04:37] <Lattyware> Anyone know how to recover data (either an entire partition, or the data from within) from a missing Ext3 partition?
[04:37] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, are using a LAN connection or a dial up
[04:37] <fran> lol
[04:37] <LjL> salome: it does if i'm here
[04:38] <salome> wow
[04:38] <LjL> why would it be different than the correctly spelled word anyway?
[04:38] <salome> your kids must be the most well behaved humans to have EVER lived.
[04:38] <Lattyware> Shorthand fails.
[04:38] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, whats the type of your internet connection?
[04:38] <zerokarmaleft> anyone know how to get more detailed info on the "select and install software" step of the alternate install iso?
[04:39] <hellomoto2007> broadband
[04:39] <hellomoto2007> wifi on the laptop
[04:39] <fran> i have xp on my desktop and ubuntu on laptop, but xp got sum svchost.exe error |:(
[04:39] <VigoFuse> Lattyware: How was it lost/corrupted?
[04:39] <LjL> zerokarmaleft: that's probably "dselect". google for that
[04:39] <Lattyware> VigoFuse: Not sure, booted one day, and now gparted says it is unallocated.
[04:39] <zerokarmaleft> well yea, but during the install
[04:39] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, so first let me tell you to configure your network in ubuntu (or xubuntu)
[04:40] <hellomoto2007> yeh
[04:40] <LjL> zerokarmaleft: yes i think it's still dselect
[04:40] <hellomoto2007> can u tell me in classroom
[04:40] <hellomoto2007> please
[04:40] <fran> is anyones ubuntu boot up slower than there xp boot?
[04:40] <zerokarmaleft> how do i get to dselect if i can't switch over to tty2?
[04:40] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, you can see the applications > system > network settings
[04:41] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, there you can setup your network settings like DNS,IP,GATEWAY everything
[04:41] <ifireball> zerokarmaleft: ctrl+alt+f2 doesn't work for you?
[04:41] <zerokarmaleft> LjL, nope it's just stuck
[04:41] <LjL> zerokarmaleft, i'm not saying you should *run* dselect. i'm simply saying that i think the "select and install software" step is using dselect
[04:41] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, if yours is a DHCP concetion then take the option DHCP available there
[04:41] <LjL> not much info on the wiki about the alternate cd, unfortunately
[04:42] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, DHCP means the broad band
[04:42] <zerokarmaleft> LjL, i think it's equivalent to dpkg --configure -a
[04:42] <idanimrod> hello, i tried installing Edgy, and had alot of problems, so i had to go back to Dapper, but i want all the latest and greatest stuff. should i change a distro or wait for Feisty?

[04:44] <sandy16> hellomoto2007, so you may try that out i am sure it will work
[04:44] <LjL> zerokarmaleft, have you verified the burn?
[04:44] <zerokarmaleft> yes
[04:44] <hellomoto2007> omg, i need some help

[04:47] <zerokarmaleft> LjL, this network connection is spotty though sometimes, i wonder if a network timeout makes it choke
[04:47] <sjust1216> is it possible to have two xmodemap file one for gnome and one for xgl each one loading with the right one
[04:47] <dv5237> is there a way that i can reload gnome whitout closing the apps?
[04:47] <hellomoto2007> i just want to be able to know how to install software
[04:47] <LjL> bRutEado: i would try this one specifically: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto
[04:47] <hellomoto2007> or shld i just reinstall XP?
[04:47] <bRutEado> LjL i will try now to see if i can install
[04:48] <LjL> zerokarmaleft, i think it might...
[04:49] <zerokarmaleft> LjL, i wish there was some way i could tell for sure before filing a bug
[04:49] <zerokarmaleft> LjL, ideally, it should bail out with an error and let me retry the step
[04:49] <nanomike> Hey, I just installed Ubuntu 6.10 Desktop. And there are only 2 virtual desktops in 6.10. That annoys me. Is there a way to get 4 Virtual desktops again like in previous Ubuntu versions?!?
[04:49] <zerokarmaleft> nanomike, right click on the workspaces
[04:49] <Yancho> what is the default folder of apache pls ?
[04:50] <LjL> zerokarmaleft, that's what it usually does. anyway, you should be able to get to a console with alt+Fx, and try looking at /var/log...
[04:50] <zerokarmaleft> nanomike, ...in your panel, you can change the settings
[04:50] <LjL> Yancho: /var/www will contain the website data normally
[04:50] <Yancho> thanks LjL
[04:50] <nanomike> OMG, how simple.. i see Thanks a million!!!
[04:50] <Lattyware> Hey all, does fdisk just write to the partition table, correct?
[04:51] <oblib> can anyone tell my why there is no Usplash screen in my Edgy install? I am using only TV-out and I think I saw a warning once about not finding a 640x480 splash or something
[04:51] <G-net|Gilnim> hi guys
[04:51] <Lattyware> It doesnt actually do anything to the drive data
[04:51] <G-net|Gilnim> does somebody know images with *bin or *cue at the end?
[04:51] <hellomoto2007> is linux capable of doing anything that windows is?! or am i just not getting this?

[04:52] <LjL> hellomoto2007, what are you thinking of specifically? clearly, Linux won't run Windows programs (well, it can, sometimes), just like Windows won't run Linux programs. but your question is kind of generic
[04:52] <ifireball> hellomoto2007: are you just trying to troll or do you have an actual question
[04:52] <Yancho> LjL how can i make apache read in /home/css/cstrike/ranks/ ? pls
[04:53] <mikeymike-linux> is there a speed limitation with sftp?
[04:53] <LjL> Yancho: make a symlink in /var/www
[04:53] <mikeymike-linux> using ssh2
[04:53] <Yancho> ok thanks :)
[04:53] <LjL> Yancho: and set permissions appropriately.
[04:53] <Lattyware> Question: Does fdisk just write to the partition table? And if so, If I have a partition, and the partition table got damaged, but I know that it spanned the entire disk, can I just make a new partition in fdisk that spans the entire disk and is the correct file system to fix that?

[04:54] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: do you want do limit the speed or are you getting a slow d/l and wondering why?
[04:54] <Lattyware> LjL: Tried it
[04:54] <idanimrod> anyway to change the color text on Dapper's splash screen? besides changing the whole usplash itself?
[04:54] <Lattyware> Didn't work
[04:54] <Lattyware> gave me nothing
[04:54] <LjL> Lattyware: short answer, yeah, you can recreate the partition in theory. cross your fingers.
[04:54] <hellomoto2007> i have 100s of questions, i need help. Iv just loaded xubuntu, form being on windows all my life. and i dont know what on earth is going on
[04:54] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, slow
[04:54] <hellomoto2007> im on my desktop
[04:54] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, im sftp'ing from my windows laptop on 100mbps network to my linux box
[04:54] <mikeymike-linux> and its slow
[04:54] <mikeymike-linux> i mean...... "slow"
[04:55] <hellomoto2007> with Xp, my laptop has xbuntu
[04:55] <mikeymike-linux> for ethernet....
[04:55] <johnm1019> are there any good solutions for using an IPOD in ubuntu? i can get my music to play, but i see that wine cant emulate itunes, so whats the consensus for easy sync'ing?
[04:55] <deever> hi
[04:55] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: it isn't the fastest protocol with all the encryption etc... try to see if you can enable/disable compression from your client
[04:56] <Lattyware> LjL: After doing fdisk, Gparted still shows unallocated...
[04:56] <LjL> hellomoto2007: perhaps to start with, you could have used Ubuntu if you've never touched Linux before, rather than Xubuntu or Kubuntu, which can do doubt be nice, but also a tad more complicated
[04:56] <LjL> Lattyware, reboot.
[04:56] <Lattyware> ah
[04:56] <Lattyware> ok, thanks
[04:56] <deever> how can i install courier-pop without postfix?
[04:56] <Lattyware> fingers crossed
[04:56] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, disabling it will go faster?
[04:56] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: on ethernet you're better off using nfs/smb
[04:56] <Yancho> does ubuntu has search / find / locate pls ?
[04:56] <LjL> Lattyware, partitions are not always read "on the fly"
[04:56] <Lattyware> ok, thanks
[04:56] <hellomoto2007> ljl my laptop isnt powerfull enuff to load xubuntu
[04:56] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, ah yeah you're right
[04:56] <hellomoto2007> i mean
[04:56] <Lattyware> I'll be back... :P
[04:56] <hellomoto2007> ubuntu
[04:56] <LjL> hellomoto2007: what are the specs?
[04:56] <iam8up|lpy> can anyone tell me how to install php4 and the apache module? i tried an apt-get install libapache2-mod-php4 php4 - but it doesn't execute the php files, it just tries to have me download them
[04:56] <LjL> Lattyware: let me know
[04:56] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, i dont want to share my linux machine at all so i figured ssh would be best
[04:56] <iam8up|lpy> Yancho - find, locate - for certain
[04:56] <hellomoto2007> 450mhz, 128mb ram
[04:57] <hellomoto2007> it crashed when i loaded it
[04:57] <LjL> hellomoto2007: well, yes, the RAM is a bit limiting
[04:57] <hellomoto2007> :S
[04:57] <deever> since i don't really like postfix, i want to use courier-base as mta
[04:57] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: since its enternet CPU may be slower then net, so compression puts the bottleneck in the wrong place...
[04:57] <hellomoto2007> yeh
[04:57] <Yancho> iam8up|lpy i tried apt-get install locate .. no luck
[04:57] <LjL> hellomoto2007: you should upgrade to at least 256MB IMHO
[04:57] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, gotcha
[04:57] <iam8up|lpy> Yancho - it's installed by default
[04:57] <deever> how can i install courier-pop without postfix?
[04:58] <iam8up|lpy> Yancho - it does updatedb daily afaik
[04:58] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, how do you 'share' ubuntu directories
[04:58] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: with some tweaking you can IP-limit your smb/nfs shares, also you can try sharing the files with apache (you can put lotsa control/security there)
[04:59] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, so i should set up an apache server on the linux machine??
[04:59] <mikeymike-linux> or ftp
[04:59] <mikeymike-linux> ftp would be faster
[04:59] <mikeymike-linux> no?
[04:59] <skel> anyone know if you can install packages on the livecd?
[04:59] <skel> I just want to grab the msttcorefonts
[04:59] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: there is a new System->Shared Folders menu on ubutu that seems promising if you want to just click stuff
[04:59] <CarinArr> hey, i managed to kill synaptic while it was installing fluxconf, and whne restarting it tells me to run "dpkg --configure -a", but when i do it hangs at "setting up fluxconf..."
[05:00] <ignus> how do i find out what grub is calling each of my harddrives?
[05:00] <CarinArr> and doesn't seem to do anything else
[05:00] <Atomiku> Hi there, I'm having a problem with ubuntu. When I login to GNOME, it gets to the part where the wallpaper shows, then the screen goes black, then it goes back to GNOME (frozen) then it goes to the login screen. What is going on?
[05:00] <LjL> skel: yes you can
[05:00] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: ftp/http give you about the same preformance level, smb should be a little faster and by far the fastest is NFS
[05:00] <skel> LjL: ty sir =] 
[05:00] <Atomiku> I have 64mb of ram and a 450mhz processort
[05:00] <LjL> skel: they'll be installed to temporary storage, and they clearly won't survive reboots
[05:00] <mikeymike-linux> so..... how would i do NFS
[05:00] <Atomiku> *processor
[05:00] <mikeymike-linux> in ubuntu
[05:01] <skel> LjL: thats fine, just need to copy off
[05:01] <iam8up|lpy> mikeymike-linux - google nfs
[05:01] <CarinArr> could anyone help?
[05:01] <mikeymike-linux> ok
[05:01] <LjL> Atomiku: that's way too  little RAM, unfortunately
[05:01] <ignus> can anyone help me with a grub problem?
[05:01] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: that is rather easy, the hard part is windows...
[05:01] <Atomiku> LjL: I think I can get hold of another 128mb ram
[05:01] <iam8up|lpy> ignus - don't ask to ask, just ask
[05:01] <Atomiku> Would that be enough?
[05:01] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, oh?
[05:01] <ignus> iam8up|lpy: tried that, got no resopnse
[05:01] <lord_08> hello
[05:01] <iam8up|lpy> Atomiku - he just said no - if you do NOT do any gui, you should
[05:01] <lord_08> what it means :

[05:02] <iam8up|lpy> sc0tt_ - not well
[05:02] <sc0tt_> but worked fine
[05:02] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: I think the only NFS client for windows is SFU and you need some UNIX know-how to set it up
[05:02] <Keigo-kun> My keyboard is acting weird :( Is there any way to get a Macally Slim USB keyboard to work on Ubuntu?
[05:02] <sc0tt_> sure it was iam8up|lpy

[05:03] <Lattyware> LjL: Nope, failed.
[05:03] <Lattyware> Still just says empty
[05:03] <mikeymike-linux> ohhhhhh
[05:03] <mikeymike-linux> something for unix
[05:03] <mikeymike-linux> i remember now
[05:03] <ignus> ok, during the install of ubuntu it asks you what hdd you want to install grub to grub has a different way of naming hdds than they are named in /dev. can anyone tell me how to find out how to get the right syntax for grub so the install wont fail??????
[05:03] <mikeymike-linux> 'services for unix'
[05:03] <LjL> Lattyware: have you set the partition type to the appropriate type (ext3, whatever) in fdisk?
[05:03] <CarinArr> anyone around tha tcould possible help out ith dpkg --configure -a hanging?
[05:04] <Lattyware> LjL: I think so
[05:04] <LjL> Lattyware, can you be sure that really *only* the partition table was damaged, and not part of the actual partition as well?
[05:04] <ayaa> i want to install a light pc station that will be an internet navigation station (firefox), what distribution would you suggest me ?
[05:04] <lord_08> lol
[05:04] <Lattyware> LjL: I can't see how it could have damaged that actual data

[05:07] <LjL> Lattyware, doesn't necessarily have to take time... just overwrite the right parts of the drive, and your partition is gone
[05:08] <Lattyware> LjL: OK, that's wierd, running fdisk, it's showing no partitions again.
[05:08] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Trentster about boot
[05:08] <LjL> Lattyware: err, did you save? :P
[05:08] <Lattyware> LjL: I just did what I did before, then opened fdisk again and told it to pritnt the partition table and it showed nothing again
[05:08] <Lattyware> yeah, w which is write and quit

[05:10] <cpl-tnt44> hey guyz ?  plz i need a quick answere ...How can i know which header should i install ?
[05:10] <jvolkman> mikeymike-linux, sftp
[05:10] <mikeymike-linux> sftp is slow
[05:10] <mikeymike-linux> this is why im here
[05:10] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: and it won't be much faster then SSH
[05:10] <mikeymike-linux> dude
[05:10] <mikeymike-linux> 200k max is slowwwww
[05:10] <scamboy> how 2 instal a download application like .deb or .tgr ???
[05:10] <mikeymike-linux> on 100 mbps ethernet
[05:10] <mikeymike-linux> this 100 meg folder should be DONE
[05:10] <thee3> what happens if i run an infect exe in wine?
[05:10] <LjL> cpl-tnt44: how could *we* know? "what header should i install" doesn't sound like a question that makes sense - unless we can read your mind, which we can't :-P
[05:10] <cpl-tnt44> !Header
[05:10] <mange2> Hi! Has anyone built XGL from pure sources ? .. im a coder and im having alot of troubles with it...
[05:10] <thee3> infected

[05:11] <piratepete> anyone know if there's anything like Unyte or webex for linux (unbuntu)?
[05:11] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: yeah, but FTP transfers the files in about the same way as SFTP so it won't be faster unles one of the machine has a REAL slow processor
[05:11] <u221e> fglrx is really slow in edgy, some of the screensavers run a 5 fps.
[05:11] <webben> piratepete: what are Unyte and webex? what do they do?
[05:11] <mikeymike-linux> hmm.......
[05:12] <LjL> Lattyware: i'd give it another try. perhaps gparted overwrote your changes, though i doubt it. but i have no better ideas
[05:12] <mikeymike-linux> well i know its capable of being sent WAY faster... i've done it in windows between the same 2 computers using windows networking
[05:12] <xroach> Is there a partition manager in Edgy, and if is , where?
[05:12] <piratepete> webben: they allow desktop sharing
[05:12] <almir> is there a difference if i burn the ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso to a empty CD or a empty DVD, if, what?
[05:12] <Lattyware> LjL: OK, I think the Hard Drive might be physically damaged
[05:12] <LjL> xroach: GParted, in System / Administration
[05:12] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: for windows<->linux you should use samba (e.g. windows networking)
[05:12] <LjL> Lattyware: do you have SMART on that drive?
[05:12] <mikeymike-linux> yeah
[05:12] <piratepete> webben: want to show an application to another location
[05:12] <mikeymike-linux> i guess i should snaptic samba then.....
[05:12] <cpl-tnt44> any one plz help me ... i need to know how can i tell if i need to update the "header" ???
[05:12] <Lattyware> LjL: Yeah, how do I take a look at the SMART stats?
[05:12] <mange2> i have an issue with a dell box GX260 and Ubuntu 6.10, it turns black when booting (copies files to ram) and then nothing happens for atleast a few hours.. etc
[05:12] <webben> piratepete: desktop sharing across a network?
[05:12] <LjL> cpl-tnt44, no, nobody can help you with that, becausee the question doesn't make any sense.
[05:13] <segfault> almir, iirc that is a cd image not a dvd image
[05:13] <webben> piratepete: like remote access?

[05:13] <Gamma> how to install catalyst driver in ubuntu please
[05:13] <cpl-tnt44> hey LjL what do u mean doesnt make any sence ?
[05:13] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: just go into system->admin->shared folders it can install the packages for you
[05:13] <mange2> The Ubuntu devs should consider only copying required parts to ram
[05:13] <LjL> Lattyware: "sudo apt-get install smartmontools"   -   then "smartctl -H /dev/whatever" and "smartctl -A /dev/whatever"

[05:14] <scamboy> guys, how 2 make a manual instal like .exe or in .deb?????
[05:14] <LjL> xroach, i can guarantee it's there. i could be mistaken on the exact location in the menu, since i use KDE normally
[05:14] <graveson> i have installed a 2nd language set on my systems - how doi switch between these 2 languages (arabic)
[05:14] <webben> piratepete: I'm pretty sure it should be possible. Never tried to do anything like that myself though.
[05:14] <LjL> scamboy: an .exe is a Windows program normally, not a Linux program
[05:14] <mange2> scamboy: lol, .exe ? :)
[05:14] <Kubu> when i install ndiswrapper by sudo make, it tells me that it cannot find build files in the kernel source
[05:14] <segfault> scamboy, do u want to know how to make a deb pkg or how to install one?
[05:15] <LjL> scamboy: as for .debs, you mostly shouldn't install them manually. what are you trying to install?
[05:15] <Lattyware> Ugh, Shorthand FTL.
[05:15] <Kubu> actually i dont have any build folder in it
[05:15] <Kubu> and i have installes build-essential
[05:15] <Kubu> does anyone know why?
[05:15] <scamboy> bluez..hehehe
[05:15] <scamboy> i know .exe in windows....:-P
[05:15] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell kubu about ndiswrapper
[05:16] <mange2> Kubu: either they are missing or you dont instruct ./configure to use the source headers
[05:16] <Marc_> is there any advantage to installing kubuntu over installing member:ubuntu and then just using synaptic to install kde
[05:16] <segfault> almir, im telling u that iso is a cd image, i have never tried to burn a cd image to a dvd, seems like a waste of space to me, but feel free to try

[05:40] <mikeymike-linux> :] 
[05:40] <sheri_rao> ifireball, i m not good at cmd , if u pls tell me some specific command , synk like?
[05:40] <LjL> cpl-tnt747, when i ask you "what happens", i usually mean: paste the full errors output into the pastebin. anyway, if you don't have a working internet connnection, it doesn't surprise me that that command eson't work

[05:40] <mtymobile> hi all

[05:40] <lord_08> LjL I NEED a hackers site pls
[05:40] <Lattyware> Wait, you refer to partitions as UUIDs, but drives as /dev/whatever, correct?
[05:40] <Geoffrey2> is Evolution not used very much, or am I just trying to do something not done very often?
[05:41] <cpl-tnt747> LjL , i have a working internet through LAN , but i wanna get my wireless to work ..

[05:41] <mtymobile> how can i add more terminals to switch to alt+Fn
[05:41] <awerley> hey guys I am having an issue with an HBA card (qla2312)... it loads the qla2xxx module at startup, however doesnt come online until I do modprobe -r qla2xxx add it back with modprobe -i qla2xxx... any ideas?  I think it is loading the modules in an incorrect order but not sure how to determine that
[05:41] <sheri_rao> ifireball, i tried many flv files , none of them worked, what should i type in terminal
[05:41] <ifireball> sheri_rao: where did you put the file? on the desktop?
[05:41] <mikeymike-linux> "On a UNIX machine the encrypted SMB passwords are usually stored in the smbpasswd(5) file." where is this file???????????
[05:42] <boink> in /etc/samba/
[05:42] <Lattyware> drive = /dev/hd* partition old = /dev/hd** partition new=a load of random charachters.
[05:42] <bRutEado> LjL 'Then use rawrite command: rawrite -f sbm.bin (rawwritewin.exe sbm.bin)' I also not understanding this phrase, I know what is rawrite. How do i use it?
[05:42] <mikeymike-linux> o.
[05:42] <Lattyware> So, why are UUIDs better?
[05:42] <omkar86> HELP there is probelm with ubuntu live install cd on 256MB ram installation stops after partition manager.
[05:42] <samuel> sup all
[05:42] <LjL> lord_08: not the right channel to ask about that.
[05:42] <mtymobile> no one ?
[05:42] <sheri_rao> ifireball, few of them r on desktop, does it matter?
[05:42] <ifireball> sheri_rao: besically its "mplayer <file name here>" but you need to be where the file is
[05:42] <boink> and fix your "?" key as well
[05:42] <segfault> awerley, does dmesg say anything that helps
=== gorded is now known as opixus
[05:42] <samuel> is there any way to change the System/Help menu? i want to add my own help links
[05:43] <Lattyware> Anyone
[05:43] <Lattyware> ?
[05:43] <Gwildor> bRutEado, the stuff (in here) is for windows...
[05:43] <boink> !ask
[05:43] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:43] <ifireball> sheri_rao: use "cd ~/Desktop" to enter the desktop in the console
[05:43] <Gwildor> bRutEado, the rest...for linux
[05:43] <sheri_rao> ifireball, got it , no prob in playing in simple way even through cmd , but is there any specific syntex
[05:43] <LjL> bRutEado: you must find the rawwritewin.exe file in the Ubuntu CD (at least, i think it's there), and then type the stuff in parenthesis i.e. "rawwritewin.exe smb.bin"
[05:43] <segfault> Lattyware, i believe they are supposed to make ur system more reilient to changes
[05:43] <Lattyware> ah...
[05:43] <mtymobile> please help me... i don't know why, but i got no terminals on Alt+Fn
[05:43] <awerley> segfault, i will check 1 sec
[05:43] <sheri_rao> ifireball, ok let me get there through cmd
[05:43] <segfault> Lattyware, reilient=sesilient
[05:43] <Lattyware> lol
[05:44] <segfault> Lattyware, reilient=resilient sry i cant type or spell :)
[05:44] <ifireball> sheri_rao: nope but maybe you can see more elaborate error messages there
[05:44] <Lynoure> mtymobile: tried ctrl+alt+Fn?
[05:44] <sheri_rao> ifireball, i m on desktop
[05:44] <mtymobile> Lynoure: yes just black
[05:44] <Lynoure> mtymobile: From X, you need the ctrl there
[05:44] <LjL> Lattyware: UUIDs serve two purposes mainly:  1) let you move drives around without (well, in theory) worrying about /dev/names changing, and breaking your boot   2) smooth the transition to the new IDE drivers, which will use /dev/sdX names instead of /dev/hdX names
[05:44] <zerokarmaleft> next problem, nvidia-glx deps appear to be broken
[05:44] <Tarandus> I have an IBM Thinkpad T21, and using DRI with S3 Savage. Google Earth locks up the machine. What should I do?
[05:44] <Lattyware> right, thanks.
[05:44] <omkar86> can i use live install cd as TEXT INSTALL CD
[05:44] <mtymobile> Lynoure: yes Ctrl+Alt does not work
[05:44] <boink> omkar86: why do that?
[05:45] <mtymobile> Lynoure: just goes blank
[05:45] <boink> use the server install cd
[05:45] <Lattyware> Can anyone help: I cannot do anything (not even format) my /dev/hdb.
[05:45] <omkar86> i have live install cd
[05:45] <Lynoure> mtymobile: That's unusual' but I'm afraid I'm not much help today if you are on Edgy
[05:45] <segfault> LjL, interesting i did not know #2
[05:45] <boink> but for which version is that? desktop?
[05:45] <omkar86> and my ram is less
[05:45] <omkar86> 6.06 dapper
[05:45] <boink> you have the server install and the alternate install
[05:45] <omkar86> no
[05:45] <boink> the alternate install doesn't do the live thing
[05:45] <omkar86> ok
[05:46] <LjL> segfault: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks
[05:46] <mtymobile> Lynoure: is it strange that i don't have /etc/inittab , or is it just edgy's new boot ??

[05:47] <Ambos> i'm searching for a german support-channel for aiglx or beryl

[05:48] <ifireball> sheri_rao: sorry I'm no mplayer expert, but you can try going to #mplayer with that
[05:48] <LjL> sheri_rao: ^
[05:48] <boink> well, no .. you need the right codecs
[05:48] <zyclop> boink, thx
[05:48] <open-src> Can anyone help with k9copy, it will not install for me..
[05:48] <boink> and the default ubuntu install doesn't come with the right stuff in the /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:48] <leidenhoven> quit
[05:48] <sheri_rao> LjL, :)
[05:48] <profoX`> thanks zyclop :) that looks great
[05:48] <profoX`> zyclop: anything i can do for you ? :D
[05:48] <boink> you need to adjust the sources.list, and get the right stuff
[05:48] <omkar86> is i install from 6.06 cd; can i upgrade to 6.10 using 'apt-get dist-upgrade' like debian?
[05:48] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell omkar86 about upgrade
[05:48] <zerokarmaleft> why does nvidia-glx dep on linux-386 modules when it's been obsoleted?
[05:49] <Lynoure> mtymobile: Yes, upstart is different. (But I'm not on edgy yet, cannot give you the details)
[05:49] <c_lisp> I get an unable to access smb file folder for my shares on ubuntu anybody know what can cause that
[05:49] <profoX`> omkar86: if you change dapper to edgy in sources.list, yes
[05:49] <boink> omkar86: yes, but read the upgrade page first
[05:49] <c_lisp> it was working before
[05:49] <sheri_rao> ifireball, i played it with #mplayer
[05:49] <boink> !upgrade
[05:49] <Gwildor> omkar86, after you change the sources.lst.......like debian
[05:49] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[05:49] <zyclop> profoX`, there is also the possibility to record internet radio with streamtuner/ streamripper
[05:49] <omkar86> ok
[05:49] <boink> important instructions!
[05:49] <profoX`> zyclop: yea but I really want free music.
[05:49] <mtymobile> Lynoure: you should try it is much faster
[05:49] <profoX`> zyclop: not radio music :)
[05:49] <boink> if you don't follow the instructions closely, you'll fsck up your system
[05:49] <zyclop> profoX`, you probably overlooked the "record" part
[05:49] <ifireball> sheri_rao: I ment going to the #mplayer channel...
[05:50] <MasseR> I doubt anyone of you know, but what could cause my ethernet NIC to stop working after fast transfer rates (100mbps). If I ping while transferring it complains about buffer full. The card still recieves, but can't transmit. I think. Are there some kernel options that could help?
[05:50] <omkar86> is using IRC as root harmfull?
[05:50] <omkar86> in any way
[05:50] <Ademan> with the tar command does gzip or "compress" compress data better?
[05:50] <sheri_rao> ifireball,  :) i m already there now
[05:50] <boink> you shouldn't irc as root
[05:50] <profoX`> zyclop: aww.. well.
[05:50] <zyclop> profoX`, or do you mean free as in free software?
[05:50] <bRutEado> [LjL] : i had understand. I already have the rawwrite. Wher do i write
[05:50] <Ademan> omkar86: you shouldn't do anything as root unless you NEED TO
[05:50] <omkar86> ok
[05:50] <boink> ubuntu doesn't have a root account :)
[05:50] <profoX`> zyclop: well... i'm not sure ;) that would be better, but it's not necessary
[05:50] <livingdaylight> if i'm using Dapper does that mean i can't upgrade to Gnome 2.16?
[05:51] <bRutEado> [LjL] : i had understand. I already have the rawwrite. Where do i write? Where say Image file?
[05:51] <open-src> profoX -> you could always use gnutella
[05:51] <don_o> MasseR: that does sound hard to diagnose. sounds like a problem with the kernel driver. since ethernet cards are cheap, id switch to a different brand.
[05:51] <profoX`> zyclop: i'm going to be on a computer hobbymarket soon probably with a ubuntu stand.. and we'd like to play music on one of the machines :)
[05:51] <ifireball> boink: that just an urban legent, it does. it wouldn't work otherwise
[05:51] <profoX`> zyclop: so good legal music would be nice
[05:51] <c_lisp> anybody had problems with smb file sharing?
[05:51] <boink> well .. ok
[05:51] <profoX`> zyclop: and real free music even better (in the free software meaning)
[05:51] <ifireball> boink: just try "sudo su -" and violla! you're root.
[05:52] <boink> well, yes
[05:52] <omkar86> i have some old slackware installed, but #slackware channel is banning me before i actually join it
[05:52] <boink> or sudo sudo .. how's that?
[05:52] <MasseR> don_o: The device driver is b44 but I changed it an older and still buggy
[05:52] <don_o> ifireball: or "sudo -s"

[05:52] <profoX`> ah thats not so bad
[05:52] <Lynoure> mtymobile: It's hassle to install to, for many, and there is a potential hibernation problem with this hardware, so probably not fast enough to make up for that
[05:52] <MasseR> And I'm using laptop so no new network cards
[05:52] <profoX`> mp3 is bad though ^_^
[05:52] <omkar86> is it due to I am root?
[05:52] <don_o> anyone know why a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy holds back about 15 python packages?
[05:52] <MasseR> don_o: They conflict
[05:52] <MasseR> don_o: Run sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
[05:53] <don_o> MasseR: is there a workaround?
[05:53] <don_o> MasseR: ah thanks
[05:53] <don_o> MasseR: is aptitude somehow smarter than apt-get ?
[05:53] <MasseR> Yes
[05:53] <livingdaylight> <livingdaylight> if i'm using Dapper does that mean i can't upgrade to Gnome 2.16?
[05:53] <bRutEado> Peolpe: I already have the rawwrite. Where do i write? Where say Image file?
[05:53] <ResearchGuy> basically i have installed a few mips programs and ghdl using synaptic package manager i have not been able to run the programs.  The OS says they are properly installed but i cannot run them using the Alt-F2 and they do not show in the applications menu.  I have search forums for the last couple of days trying solutions people have found but nothing has worked.

[05:55] <mikeymike-linux> what might this error mean when trying to change a user's smbpass ? Could not connect to machine 127.0.0.1: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
[05:55] <MasseR> hc: Hold on :)
[05:55] <hellomoto2007> it just wont run the instalation CD
[05:55] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: you may get some hints as to where the binaries are by looking at the list of files installed by synaptic (right-click the packages)
[05:55] <MasseR> hc: http://www.students.cs.uu.nl/people/wbeekhui/FujitsuSiemens-AmiloL7300.html check the rt2500 part
[05:55] <livingdaylight> <livingdaylight> if i'm using Dapper does that mean i can't upgrade to Gnome 2.16?
[05:55] <mikeymike-linux> is there a default password for samba?
[05:55] <graveson> what do i have to do to get an answer : i have installed a 2nd language set on my systems - how doi switch between these 2 languages (arabic)
[05:55] <ResearchGuy> ifireball: what should i do after i do that
[05:55] <open-src> BRB..
[05:56] <LjL> bRutEado: i'm not sure if the linux headers are on the CD. if they are, you can get them even without an internet connection
[05:56] <kmaynard> livingdaylight, http://www.gnome.org/projects/garnome/
[05:56] <LjL> bRutEado: try typing "sudo apt-cdrom add" with your Ubuntu CD in the drive, and see if you can then fetch them
[05:56] <don_o> graveson: if noone answers, it means noone has a good answer for your question.
=== CarlF1 is now known as CarlFK
[05:56] <ifireball> mikeymike-linux: 1st time you setup password for a user you should run it as root (e.g. using sudo) and use the "-A" switch (as far as I can remeber, read the man please)
[05:56] <hc> MasseR: so i plug it in, open terminal, check that it works, then type those commands?
[05:56] <boink> then you try to ask another time
=== mumbles-out is now known as mumbles
[05:56] <mikeymike-linux> right
[05:56] <mikeymike-linux> i just did that
[05:56] <mikeymike-linux> :)
[05:57] <graveson> don_o:thanks don
[05:57] <MasseR> hc: Yes
[05:57] <mikeymike-linux> ifireball, haha i just did that :)
[05:57] <mikeymike-linux> it works i think
[05:57] <mikeymike-linux> :)
[05:57] <MasseR> If you have any trouble ask me again
[05:57] <boink> who knows ... maybe your question is too difficult
[05:57] <MasseR> I'll try and fix it
[05:57] <don_o> graveson: i know thats not much consolation but at least know you're not being ignored.
[05:57] <bRutEado> LjL and where do i write that?
[05:57] <boink> then again, one can search google
[05:57] <boink> learning how to solve problems is an important skill too
[05:57] <hc> ah. okey. i'm booting up the machine right now. if it works on the test-machine, then it's ubuntu next on the family laptop :D
[05:57] <LjL> bRutEado: in a terminal. same place you write "sudo apt-get ..."
[05:58] <ResearchGuy> ifireball: the binaries do exist but i still need the programs to show in the apps-menu so students will have easy access to them
[05:58] <livingdaylight> kmaynard: so, the anser is yes. But there wouldn't be a simple upgrade from Dapper - i'd have to build it myself, is that what it s saying?
[05:58] <graveson> don_o : thanks again and understood,i just need to come back another time
[05:58] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: see for example what did it install in /usr/bin and try running that from the command line, basically you should obtain the manual for what you;ev installed and read how to use it... :P
[05:58] <don_o> MasseR: woot. aptitude led me to remove a couple packages i didnt need and now im finally upgrading python.
[05:58] <MasseR> don_o: Could you help me create a google searchword?
[05:58] <MasseR> With my trouble
[05:58] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: oh.. now I get it...
[05:58] <bRutEado> [LjL] : i tried in the cmd and it don't recognize
[05:58] <kmaynard> livingdaylight, i seriously doubt it will be backported to dapper...at least not any time soon
[05:58] <don_o> MasseR: i have no idea what you're asking
[05:58] <ResearchGuy> ifireball: ok
[05:58] <kmaynard> livingdaylight, if you want it tho, you can get it...your choice as to how
[05:59] <hellomoto2007> can anyone help me please
[05:59] <zyclop> hellomoto2007, just ask
[05:59] <MasseR> don_o: I'm trying to google my way out of this. But it doesn't give me a proper error, so I can't google easily
[05:59] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: does each student has his own login ore are they all using the same user?
[05:59] <LjL> bRutEado: please just type "LjL:  blah", otherwise my IRC client won't highlight your messages, and i'll miss them
[05:59] <LjL> bRutEado: what error does it give precisely?
[05:59] <ResearchGuy> ifireball: they are installed in /usr/lib and /usr/share but i still need the programs to show...i think one they are in the apps menu they will run
[05:59] <Amgine> Is there a flash player for Ubuntu64/AMD64?
[05:59] <hellomoto2007> iv just installed xubuntu on a diffrent computer, now i need help getting it running
[06:00] <zyclop> hellomoto2007, so, what exactly is the problem?
[06:00] <kmaynard> if you installed it it should run
[06:00] <Seveas> Amgine, no
[06:00] <hellomoto2007> its the first time iv ever installed a linux OS
[06:00] <hellomoto2007> and i cant work it
[06:00] <MasseR> don_o: And it also complains about buffer being full (but googling with that it didn't help)
[06:00] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: you can add then there with the menu editor System->Menu Layout
[06:00] <hellomoto2007> its so diffrent to windows
[06:00] <bRutEado> [LjL] : it says that don't recognize the word "sudo" like a internal command or external command or batch file
[06:00] <hellomoto2007> its on a laptop
[06:00] <hc> hellomoto2007: you'll get used to it
[06:00] <Amgine> tnx Seveas
[06:01] <[GuS] > Seveas, that not totally true... there is a open source flash implementation
[06:01] <[GuS] > that could be compiled under amd64
[06:01] <kmaynard> hellomoto2007, what is it not doing? can you get to the desktop?

[06:02] <hc> hellomoto2007: using synaptic or apt-get
[06:02] <teledyn> MasseR: excerpt a portion of the error that is the most common, and put quotes around it and search google
[06:02] <hc> synaptic?
[06:02] <LjL> oh bRutEado, i messed up completely. i was giving you the advice that concerned another person... =) scrap everything. so, you have downloaded rawwrite?

[06:02] <MasseR> teledyn: Didn't find anyone with similar symptoms
[06:02] <ResearchGuy> ifireball: i cannot find the programs in the menu editor
[06:02] <c_lisp> but when I open back up its still there
[06:02] <MasseR> Well I did but no solution
[06:02] <Ademan> hc:

[06:04] <bRutEado> [LjL] : i opend it. i did not save the program
[06:04] <zyclop> novome, it's the i386 version
[06:04] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: just add them with the "new item" button putting the filenames from /usr/bin in the "command" field
[06:04] <Ademan> novome: just "ubuntu" vs kubuntu and xubuntu
[06:04] <novome> ok thanks!

[06:06] <crawler> hellomoto2007: if you have the inf files from windows it should work using the NdisWrapper

[06:07] <XlBfmZo> ianmacgregor: the package is called: libdrm but checking it out its called drm

[06:12] <hellomoto2007>  your device is not listed in this area, then your wireless device does not have a working or functioning driver. To troubleshoot and set up your device with a driver see need to set up wiki link to move forward with driver
[06:12] <Geoffrey2> sheri_rao, as far as I know, that version hasn't been ported to Ubuntu yet, so as far as I know, your only method is downloading the source from mplayer's website and building it yourself

[06:13] <bRutEado> [LjL] : it's called G:
[06:13] <LjL> bRutEado: ok, then type   "rawwritewin.exe G:\install\sbm.bin"
[06:13] <ianmacgregor> dooglus: Is that a debian repo?
[06:13] <dooglus> ianmacgregor: yes
[06:13] <zyclop> hellomoto2007, it seems that your card is not supported.

[06:14] <zyclop> hellomoto2007, if it's not listed it is unlikely to be supported

[06:14] <dooglus> ianmacgregor: it doesn't contain anything other than multimedia packages
[06:14] <crawler> hellomoto2007: whats the brand and model?
[06:15] <LjL> bRutEado: where did you type "dir *.exe" and all the rest. same place.
[06:15] <zyclop> hellomoto2007, for the terminal: search for a menu entry that is named something like xterm or konsole
[06:15] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: reading the description on synaptic, it seems "ghdl" is only a command line tool, did you also install "ivi" ?

[06:16] <hellomoto2007> i have a instalation cd for that card
[06:16] <LjL> !automatix | foureight84
[06:16] <ubotu> foureight84: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.

[06:17] <foureight84> hah okay... well anyway it works fine... but i just wanna know how i would go about configuring SLAB
[06:17] <ifireball> hellomoto2007: because the vendor for the card didn't include a linux driver on the CD, most of them arn't nice enough to do that
[06:17] <MasseR> So the problem isn't in b44 driver..

[06:18] <bRutEado> [LjL] : I'm confused another time. I never write "dir *.exe". There are here simple things that you are confusing. I know what is Rawwrite. I now what is a Explorer window. So where do you want than i write?
[06:18] <crawler> hellomoto2007, it will just use the NdisWrapper, oh and before that you should read a little bit about the how-to of that NdisWrapper..I've tried it before, and it works perfectly, it just needs you to locate the .inf file from the installation disk.
[06:18] <shiv> zyclop: ya i ca see it in computer menu
[06:18] <hellomoto2007> ok

[06:19] <LjL> bRutEado, then you're confused because you aren't doing what i'm telling you, and then saying "yes, i did that", when you really didn't. please follow the steps i'm asking you to do.
[06:19] <hellomoto2007> hello

[06:25] <LjL> skel, zyclop: perhaps try mounting with "mount -t hfsplus", just a guess.
[06:25] <boink> but dapper is a "lts" release. edgy isn't
[06:25] <zyclop> LjL, tell that shiv. i confused skel with him
[06:25] <LjL> shiv, try mounting using "mount -t hfsplus"
[06:25] <bRutEado> [LjL] : it says the same thing. I don't understand why the prompt did not chenge to D:
[06:25] <tremaine> well i know that i am saying reliability wise?
[06:25] <tremaine> any major differnce
[06:26] <tremaine> ?
[06:26] <LjL> bRutEado: type "D:"
[06:26] <LjL> bRutEado: does it change now?
[06:26] <LjL> tremaine, Dapper currently is probably somewhat more reliable.
[06:26] <livingdaylight> does anyone know, is: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 the command?
[06:26] <bRutEado> [LjL] : it stays equal
[06:26] <Arrick> whats the ubuntu breezy command for finding out the spes of your box, from terminal?

[06:29] <Legendre> but the old setup had cups+foomatic
[06:29] <LjL> bRutEado: wait, let me try it on a Windows computer
[06:29] <babis85> boink: thanks, but the connection would be through the msn server or the LAN? Should i make another profile?
[06:30] <Legendre> zyclop - should I try deleting the printer and using a diff driver?
[06:30] <boink> msn
[06:30] <zyclop> Legendre, well, it's worth a try
[06:30] <bRutEado> [LjL] : i'm wayting
[06:30] <babis85> boink: i don't want this
[06:30] <nastas> could anyone help me please?

[06:31] <nastas> ianmacgregor: you are right... sorry
[06:31] <ifireball> ResearchGuy: e.g. "dpkg -L ivi | grep bin"

[06:45] <Legendre> can't even send them from the CLI.

[06:45] <TheWheat> Flyinprogramer: it doesnt show up in ifconfig
[06:46] <thee3> nastas: it is a partition automounted on boot but i want that only root has writing permissions on it. changing the permission through rightclick ->permissions doesn't work.
[06:46] <boink> then edit the /etc/network/interfaces and comment out dhcp
[06:46] <ifireball> Trist_an:, Xappe : sure you can with screen and then ctrl+A shift+S
[06:46] <AsheD> is there any way to find out which hard drive is which [when shown in dmesg]  ?

[06:46] <TheWheat> Flyinprogramer: so i edited the /etc/network/interfaces file to try put it in, but when i plugged the usb adapter in it just consumed all cpu cycles forcing a reboot. couldnt even kill the process
[06:46] <rrittenhouse> (This might be a general hardware question..

[06:51] <Atomiku> LjL: WHo?
[06:51] <dougal> I'm trying to upgrade from dapper to edgy. My network connection has been kind of flaky lately, so I burned a cd. But when I run upgrade-manager or the cdromupgrade script, it still insists on trying to upgrade over the net. What am I missing?
[06:51] <apokryphos> ayaa: join us in #kubuntu
[06:51] <dom_f> Atomiku:  What happens when gnome tries to start?  What graphics card do you have?
[06:51] <LjL> Atomiku: whoever said it. ifireball, namely
[06:51] <Atomiku> Its a very crappy onboard one
[06:51] <ifireball> anyone els want to tell me about RTFM! >< I practically told him everything he wanted to know then recommande more ino
[06:51] <ifireball> info*
[06:51] <miranda82> hello everyobdy
[06:51] <dom_f> do yuo know what make?
[06:52] <Trist_an> ayaa, if you wan to add programs loading at your kde session you can make a file in the .kde/Autostart directory
[06:52] <LjL> ifireball, i'd only have told you once, but i had some technical difficulties that i'll refrain from explaining :P
[06:52] <Atomiku> Basically, Ubuntu login screen comes up, I login, gets into gnome then the screen goes black then it puts me back to the login screen
[06:52] <Atomiku> it also mentions something about the panel already running, it will now exit
[06:52] <XlBfmZo> miranda82: How sexxi :)
[06:52] <miranda82> Hi XlBfmZo
[06:52] <Trist_an> Atomiku, I had that problem when upgrading from Dapper to Edgy
[06:52] <XlBfmZo> Hi!
[06:53] <miranda82> i achieved to make dual view, usiong xinerama on a nvidia, and all i can get is one in the left of the other, does not matter waht i write on XineramaOrientation... any ideaS?
[06:53] <Atomiku> So
[06:53] <Trist_an> It was accpeting my login and pass and black screen and then back to login
[06:53] <Atomiku> yeah
[06:53] <ifireball> LiL: in anycase I'm still annoyed, since I didn't deserve this at all; I was practiaclly typing the goddamn manpage here; I just decided to stop half-way becasuse the guy seemed he cuold handle it
[06:53] <Atomiku> Would it help if ubuntu booted up in the correct screen res and depth?
[06:53] <XlBfmZo> Miranda82: Its Miranda veraHoya DelaCruz right :) / Thatd have been cool
[06:53] <Trist_an> And when I was booting in safe mode and do a startx I could log in
[06:53] <Atomiku> Hmmm
[06:54] <wimpies> I am trying to install 6.06 on my compaq armada and after I select 'start and install ubuntu' it does some processing but hangs after a while ... How can I figure out what might be wrong ?
[06:54] <Atomiku> Ive tried to do failsafe gnome login
[06:54] <Atomiku> That didnt make a difference
[06:54] <Atomiku> Its currently booted up in 800x600 16bit
[06:54] <XlBfmZo> Miranda82: or was it Delahoya :)
[06:54] <Trist_an> Atomiku, I think it's a problem with the graphic card driver
[06:54] <dom_f> Atomiku:  Just guessing - try editing your xorg.conf and changing the driver to vesa - do you know how to do that?
[06:54] <miranda82> DelaHoya
[06:54] <Atomiku> dom_f: Nope
[06:54] <XlBfmZo> Miranda82: neat package :)
[06:54] <dom_f> Do you know how to use vi or any other non gui editor?
[06:54] <boink> wimpies: using the live CD?
[06:54] <Atomiku> dom_f: Nope
[06:54] <Atomiku> Sorry :P
[06:55] <Trist_an> dom_f, I think nano would be more indicated
[06:55] <dougal> Anyone? Advice on why I can't do an edgy upgrade from CD?
[06:55] <snoops> question.. I'm going to need to reinstall windows on a dual booting machine with ubuntu for various reasons soon, and I was wondering how to go about it. When I reinstall windows, it's going to overwrite the boot sector of the disk (ie grub).. I believe I could save a copy of the boot sector of the disk before I reinstall windows, then live cd and copy the original boot sector back
[06:55] <dom_f> sorry - showing my age!
[06:55] <ianmacgregor> dom_f: I believe if it was a graphics card problem, then he wouldn't get the gdm screen either as X is indeed running at that login screen.
[06:55] <Trist_an> dougal, is the CD in your repos list?
[06:55] <snoops> any advice would be appreciated
[06:55] <XlBfmZo> Miranda82: youre cleared, need any help ?
[06:55] <Atomiku> Well
[06:55] <Atomiku> I can get into the terminal okay
[06:55] <cemil> hi there - i have a question to kickstart
[06:55] <Atomiku> from the ubuntu login screen
[06:55] <samuel> is there a package that contains ps2pdf?
[06:55] <cemil> how can i install ubuntu dapper server(!) with kickstart?
[06:55] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, in twinview options is "montiro 1 RighOf Monitor2"
[06:55] <dom_f> ian - You're probably right but it seemed an easy one to rule out?
[06:55] <boink> samuel: do an apt-cache search
[06:55] <wimpies> yes the live CD.  I can Install from it no ?\
[06:56] <kmaynard> !grub > snoops
[06:56] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, or "Mon1" Right of "mon2" ?
[06:56] <ianmacgregor> cemil: /join #kubuntu
[06:56] <cemil> i just found e way to install normal ubuntus
[06:56] <jrib> samuel: gs-common on my system
[06:56] <cemil> ianmacgregor: that is not a kubuntu toppic
[06:56] <Trist_an> samuel, it should be out of the box
[06:56] <ianmacgregor> cemil: Ahh, ok, my bad.
[06:56] <XlBfmZo> Miranda82: what driver ?`
[06:56] <snoops> kmaynard so you don't recommend to just dd the boot sector, then reinstall, then copy boot sector back?
[06:56] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, nvidia
[06:56] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, i already got twinview working
[06:57] <alesdoc> Hi. I've a video and on a separate file the subtitles. How can i attacht the subtitles to the video so i can burn it and watch with the dvd-player
[06:57] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, but i always have the CRT at left
[06:57] <dom_f> Atomiku: This may be worth trying - Press CTRL ALT F1 to get to a login prompt and login
[06:57] <dougal> Trist_an: There's a line in /etc/apt/sources.list, "deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ ..."
[06:57] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, does not matter, what i put in xorg.conf..
[06:57] <Trist_an> Atomiku, than if you have terminal you can edit your xorg.conf
[06:57] <Atomiku> Okay
[06:57] <wimpies> boink it is now shown 'installing hardware', and it still is booting ok  (currently network interfaces ...)
[06:57] <Atomiku> Let me just plug in my mouse/keyboard/monitor back into this other box
[06:57] <Trist_an> dougal, with a # in front of or not?
[06:57] <XlBfmZo> miranda82: hmm, clone. left, right. center..... test
[06:57] <kmaynard> snoops, reinstall windows, the run the appropriate grub commands from a live cd
[06:57] <Atomiku> I will just try CTRL ALT F1 a minute
[06:57] <boink> maybe that laptop just needs some time
[06:57] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, i tested.. but i always get the same..
[06:57] <dom_f> Atomiku: Then sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.master
[06:57] <dougal> No, not commented out.
[06:58] <Trist_an> dougal, then I don't understand why you can't upgrade
[06:58] <dom_f> Atomiku: This copies your xorg.conf so we can always put it back later
[06:58] <snoops> kmaynard, so why not the boot sector copying method?
[06:58] <dougal> Should it have the actual path to the mounted cdrom?
[06:58] <samuel> jrib, Trist_an
[06:58] <samuel> thx
[06:58] <Trist_an> dougal, should be
[06:58] <XlBfmZo> miranda82: yes, if you back up your old x-conf to /root xorg will PRIO that and use it over the regualr location
[06:58] <kmaynard> snoops, why complicate it? grub has the ability to re-do the MBR...why not use it?
[06:58] <miranda82> XlBfmZo, u really don't understand me...
[06:58] <gigiven> ola
[06:58] <wimpies> boink : it shows not an X cursor that moves ...
[06:58] <dom_f> then sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:59] <wimpies> s/not/now
[06:59] <XlBfmZo> miranda82: but in aft youll get me :)
[06:59] <boink> nice :)
[06:59] <dougal> Trist_an: It doesn't have a path. It's exactly this: deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ - Release i386 (20061025)] / edgy main restricted
[06:59] <Atomiku> Okay back
[06:59] <Atomiku> I pressed CTRL ALT and F1, the screen flashed black, back to the login screen then froze
[06:59] <dougal> Should the bits between []  be replaced with /media/cdrom?
[06:59] <boink> !tell Trist_an about upgrade

[07:02] <dougal> Yes, I've read the upgrade notes.
[07:02] <Trist_an> ayaa, in your K menu, in configuration you should have boot up manager
[07:02] <wimpies> boink : now disk activity has stopped, the mouse cursor no longer moves and I am looking at the blue (KDE) screen

[07:10] <at0miku> Okay one minute
[07:10] <tritium> boink: ;)
[07:11] <dom_f> Atomiku: Now edit the file using nano - type 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' (again no quotes) and you will get in a text editor.  Look for a section that says Section Device followed by Identifier and the name of your Graphics card
[07:11] <Arrick> jrib, you still here?
[07:11] <dom_f> Atomiku: Change the driver line in this section from whatever it is now to vesa
[07:11] <livingdaylight> ianmacgregor: i took my nvidia card out of its AGP socket and did dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg to set the computer to its default onboard graphics card
[07:11] <at0miku> Okay one minute
[07:11] <dom_f> Atomiku: Save it by hitting CTRL-O then CTRL-X

[07:12] <Arrick> can someone help me out here?
[07:12] <vgoltser> ok, dapper ... samba on a B class network does not see windows shares, any pointers?
[07:12] <dom_f> be very careful with the typing - the path is /etc/X11/xorg.conf (the first X is capital the rest lower case!)
[07:12] <boink> Arrick: you tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
[07:13] <livingdaylight> Can someone possible help me?
[07:13] <Arrick> nope
[07:13] <boink> !ask
[07:13] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:13] <livingdaylight> ubotu: i have!
[07:14] <dom_f> Atomiku:To try it out hit CRTL-ALT-F7 to get back to your Gnome session and restart it with CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
[07:14] <livingdaylight> there are these clever ones around here that just wait to tell you not to ask to ask but just to ask your question, but they never answer the questions posed, but they want to appear useful nontheless
[07:14] <Arrick> wat is a good default video card when you dont know what your card is and its built in boink ?
[07:14] <boink> try lspci
[07:14] <boink> you might see the card there
[07:14] <livingdaylight> boink: so, you wanna help or are you gonna tell me to just ask my question again?

[07:15] <boink> feisty fawn will be the next development version
[07:16] <livingdaylight> LjL: any chance you might understand my problem?

[07:17] <kitche> livingdaylight: your video card has nothing to do with name and password probably a pam issue have you checked your logs?

[07:17] <LjL> shiv: as i said, it was just a guess. i'll google a bit
[07:18] <livingdaylight> LjL: says it is wrong name or password, basically get the dialog one would get if one put either wrong name or password
[07:18] <ScruffyScrode> is there something similar to umask that can be used on a per directory basis?

[07:19] <dom_f> Atomiku: Capital X in the X11
[07:19] <at0miku> oh
[07:19] <at0miku> :P
[07:20] <livingdaylight> LjL: weird, huh?
[07:20] <LjL> livingdaylight: well, the password of course is asterisk, but i suppose that you can see that the user name is input correctly... well, actually, perhaps you have the username pre-typed by default. in that case, tried erasing it an typing it in again?
[07:20] <at0miku> lol yeah I forgot its case sencifive
[07:20] <soundray> morgue: no, can't you just ask what you want to know from it?
[07:20] <dom_f> Atomiku: Make sure you have copied down all the steps - particularly the one about how to put the original file back!
[07:20] <soundray> shiv: I believe you need to load a module for the mac disklabel
[07:21] <morgue> soundray, I'm not getting the 'set as desktop background' option so I want to check if my build is different or something like that
[07:21] <livingdaylight> LjL: dude, just to be triple sure, i even typed the password in the name dialog, to make sure that the other characters in the password were the correct ones
[07:21] <dougal> Okay, I give up trying to do this upgrade via CDROM. :-/
[07:21] <dougal> No matter what I've tried, it insists on trying to fetch everything from the network.
[07:22] <boink> dougal: check your /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:22] <shiv> soundray: whats that ?
[07:22] <boink> and read the upgrade documentation
[07:22] <livingdaylight> LjL: what could dpkg-reconfigureing xorg have to do with name and password?
[07:22] <boink> !tell dougal about upgrade
[07:22] <dougal> boink: I did both of those.
[07:22] <morgue> soundray, at the ff forum someone told me the edgy version doesn't come with the option

[07:22] <dougal> boink:  I even did an 'apt-cdrom' add, and it generated the same deb line that was already in my sources.list
[07:23] <vgoltser> samba does not see windows xp systems (dapper drake, class B network)
[07:23] <soundray> shiv: mac disks don't use the DOS-style partition table. Instead they use what is called a mac disklabel.
[07:23] <boink> and is everything else in the sources.list uncommented out?
[07:23] <Arrick> tritium, you here?
[07:23] <dougal> boink: no.....
[07:23] <morgue> soundray, how do i get that?
[07:23] <LjL> livingdaylight, i don't know, but if you don't mind a temporary workaround... try installing xdm
[07:23] <warkruid> natas: wasn't there an article about mondo in linux journal a year or two back?
[07:23] <boink> dougal: *duh*
[07:23] <soundray> shiv: but I'm wrong: ubuntu has support for it by default
[07:23] <ResearchGuy> ifireball: thanks for the help i really appreciate it i still need to seeif  can get the graphical interface working though
[07:24] <nastas> warkruid: where?
[07:24] <morgue> soundray, found it
[07:24] <dougal> boink: you have to comment out everything else? There's no easier way to tell it to get the packages from CD?
=== boink is now known as Father_Ted
[07:24] <Father_Ted> of course, dougal, of course ..
[07:24] <warkruid> natas: linux journal. www.linuxjournal.com (?)
[07:24] <dougal> The  cdromupgrade script doesn't try to do anything like that...
[07:24] <soundray> !hfsplus | shiv
[07:25] <morgue> soundray, omg thanks!
[07:25] <Father_Ted> then do an apt-get clean && apt-get upgrade, and off you are. just follow the documentation

[07:25] <morgue> soundray, how did you find that?
[07:25] <livingdaylight> LjL: what is xdm?
[07:25] <warkruid> natas: why data recovery?
[07:25] <Father_Ted> xdm is the x-server login
[07:25] <soundray> morgue: I didn't. I remembered that I installed it.
[07:25] <aergern> Does anyone know how to get dapper to see multiple lo devices? Such as lo:1 and lo:2
[07:25] <LjL> livingdaylight: a display manager (i.e. a login screen), like GDM
[07:25] <Arrick> tritium, please see http://sial.org/pbot/20860 and take care of this issue for me
=== Father_Ted is now known as boink
[07:25] <morgue> soundray, THANKS
[07:25] <tritium> Arrick: ?
[07:25] <livingdaylight> LjL: this is a temporary solution, because?
[07:26] <nastas> warkruid: because i was trying to mount an ntfs hdd in ubuntu
[07:26] <dougal> No, seriously, I have to comment every other repo out by hand? That's retarded.
[07:26] <Arrick> yes tritium look at that paste please, he is pm'ing me for some reason
[07:26] <LjL> livingdaylight: because XDM is not quite nice to look at ;)
[07:26] <carlosd> I can't download Ubuntu 5.04 from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/5.04/ubuntu-5.04-install-i386.iso

[07:26] <nastas> warkruid: i'm not running windows anymore
[07:26] <warkruid> natas: auch!
[07:26] <Arrick> and i am tired of being spammed cause of it
[07:26] <boink> why would  you want 5.04?
[07:26] <carlosd> I get error 403
[07:26] <tritium> Arrick: please paste it to me in a query.
[07:26] <livingdaylight> LjL: so, it wouldn't be temporary
[07:26] <Arrick> ok
[07:26] <warkruid> natas: readonly or write access?
[07:27] <nastas> full access
[07:27] <Arrick> tritium,how do I do that?
[07:27] <aergern> Does anyone know how to get dapper to see multiple lo devices? Such as lo:1 and lo:2
[07:27] <LjL> livingdaylight: well, if it works, you can use that indefinitely. but that would sound far from optimal to me. of course it's your computer, so if you're ok with that...
[07:27] <warkruid> natas: and now disk crashed?
[07:27] <at0miku> dom_f: Okay ive changed the driver line to "vesa"   (with quotes)
[07:27] <at0miku> rebooting now...
[07:27] <livingdaylight> LjL: and once i'm in gnome desktop environment everything is the same again?
[07:28] <nastas> warkruid: a girl in my home!!!
[07:28] <LjL> livingdaylight, try. install xdm and then do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xdm"
[07:28] <LjL> livingdaylight, you've got nothing to lose at any rate.
[07:28] <warkruid> natas: lucky you..
[07:28] <osacix> hi
[07:28] <mythril> if I use `usermod -G www-data user` is there any way to restore my original groups or am I just screwed?
[07:28] <osacix> i have problems with ndiswrapper
[07:28] <osacix> i install the ndiswrapper-utils and ndisgtk packages, after i set the inf driver for my wifi card, allrigth, but when i try make the modprobe ndiswrapper the system show me one error message: invalid argument
[07:28] <nastas> warkruid: lucky!!!!
[07:28] <killown> how I share directories of partition ntfs with samba?
[07:29] <soundray> aergern: I think you just have to define them in /etc/network/interfaces. Not entirely sure, though.
[07:29] <aergern> I need to port the loopback settings from a SUSE box to an Ubuntu machine .. the machine has multiple ifcfg-lo entries.
[07:29] <warkruid> natas: errr. not?
[07:29] <aergern> Yeah. I've been trying that. It keeps saying it can't assign the ip specified.
[07:29] <LjL> livingdaylight, in any case, pastebin your current xorg.conf, i'll see if i can find a clue.
[07:30] <aergern> SIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot assign requested address
[07:30] <dougal> aergern: sudo ifconfig lo0:0 127.0.0.5
[07:30] <livingdaylight> LjL: with installing xdm is a new name and password setup?
[07:30] <g333k_work> I want to erase a user, but it tells me that is connected, how do I kick out the user in order to delete him/her?
[07:30] <aergern> ah
[07:30] <dougal> oops. lo:0, not lo0:0
[07:30] <J-_> what's the best light weight browser? anything better than firefox?
[07:30] <aergern> Ok
[07:30] <kitche> livingdaylight: xdm,. kdm and gdm don't touch any user information
[07:31] <LjL> livingdaylight: no
[07:31] <warkruid> J-_: w3m.. very light weight... command line  :-)
[07:31] <J-_> hmm, a little heavier than that lol
[07:31] <LjL> livingdaylight: it's just a different display manager. hopefully, if the problem is with GDM, XDM will work. for that matter, you could install KDM, but that would take a huge lot of KDE libraries with it
[07:31] <aergern> dougal: Not working.
[07:31] <aergern> Does this look right?
[07:31] <aergern> auto lo:0
[07:31] <aergern> iface lo:0 inet loopback

[07:32] <soundray> J-_: links2 has a graphical mode I hear
[07:32] <warkruid> J-_: true!
[07:32] <LjL> sometimes it even works!
[07:33] <J-_> I think i'll jsut install Opera heh, had no problem last time I used it
[07:33] <warkruid> rarely.
[07:33] <livingdaylight> LjL: xorg.conf output http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30059/
[07:33] <aergern> It works if I do .. ifconfig lo:0 65.106.7.196
[07:33] <soundray> J-_: dillo is another light browser
[07:34] <aergern> But how do I get it to up the interfaces on boot?
[07:34] <LjL> livingdaylight: oh, you're using the VESA driver even
[07:34] <LjL> !browsers
[07:34] <ubotu> Browsers available for Linux: Firefox (GTK, Gecko engine), Konqueror (KDE/Qt, KHTML engine), Epiphany (GTK, Gecko engine), Dillo (GTK), Links2 (terminal-based or graphical, see !man page), Opera (Qt, proprietary)  -  HTTP servers: apache2
[07:34] <warkruid> not actively developed anymore :-(
[07:34] <dougal> Okay, back to my upgrade problem... I commented out everything in sources.list except for the cdrom: line. Now it won't upgrade anything at all. It says that libc6-dev is being held back (I think it was in the middle of downloading that when I canceled the network upgrade)
[07:34] <livingdaylight> kitche: precisley. if gdm doens't touch userinfo then why would i not be able to get in with my correct name and password after i've taken out my nvidia card and usding dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg changed back to my default onboard graphics card???
[07:34] <J-_> soundray: cool, thanks.
[07:34] <phaldmmor_> #ubuntu-nl
[07:35] <dougal> Do I need to flush a cache somehow?
[07:35] <kitche> livingdaylight: it's a pam issue most likely
[07:35] <warkruid> J-_: dillo -> no scripting support!
[07:35] <livingdaylight> LjL: yes, i thought vesa was the default driver for my onboard graphics card
[07:35] <soundray> dougal: what are you trying to do?
[07:35] <livingdaylight> kitche: pam issue? can you say more?
[07:36] <dougal> I'm trying to upgrade from dapper to edgy via CDROM. My network connection has been too slow to rely on a network upgrade.
[07:36] <killown> how I share directories of partition ntfs with samba?
[07:36] <kitche> livingdaylight: pam is what gdm and such use but your log would probably help more it's in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[07:36] <at0miku> dom_f: WE HAVE A RESULT! :D
[07:36] <at0miku> dom_f: Seems to have booted up fine, this time in (what looks like) 1200x1024 :D
[07:36] <dougal> But even though I tried to upgrade via the cdromupgrade script, it still wants to get all the new updates from the het.
[07:36] <dougal> net
[07:37] <livingdaylight> kitche: lol, do you know how long that is?!
[07:38] <kitche> livingdaylight: yes it's very long
[07:38] <dougal> I'm about to the point now that I'm thinking of just doing 'apt-get -d dist-upgrade', and cancel when I need to leave the office. And just keep doing that each day until I have everything downloaded before I procede with the actual install.
[07:39] <deb_user> does anybody have any idea why voip connections on ubuntu are so lossy?
[07:39] <nastas> kilown: what exactly you wanna do?
[07:39] <bushblows> in ubuntu server 6.10 when i do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
=== edge_ is now known as EdgeT
[07:39] <deb_user> I have a dual boot system, when I use the same exact voip softphone on windows I get a MUCH better connection
[07:39] <EdgeT> Hey ppl got a huge prob
[07:39] <dougal> Our stupid net connection at work has been crappy lately, I'm getting like 9KB/s, so it's going to take like 20 hours to download everything.
[07:39] <LjL> livingdaylight, maybe it is, if your card is not supported by anything else... i was just commenting
[07:39] <deb_user> not lossy at all, on ubuntu my voip connections are extremely lossy
[07:39] <bushblows> it gives me failed to bringup eth0, and the card is in and shows up on the switch
[07:40] <dougal> That's why I burned an ISO, so I could install from CDROM.
[07:40] <pibarnas> My nvidia-settings isn't working well: It only displays nvidia-settings-configuration on the left place.
[07:40] <soundray> dougal: that's one way you could do it. Another option might be a fresh install...
[07:40] <tritium> deb_user: voip uses lossy compression for bandwidth efficiency
[07:40] <dusk> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1709631#post1709631
[07:40] <dusk> can anyone help me with that?
[07:41] <dougal> soundray: yeah, I thought about just booting the cd and seeing what options it gave me. But it seems a little scary :)
[07:41] <deb_user> tritium: yes but, when I use x-lite on xp (same machine, dual boot mind you), i get a waaaaaaay better connection, hardly lossy at all
[07:41] <dougal> I was happier when I thought I'd be able to use a more standard upgrade method.
[07:41] <deb_user> its so strange
[07:41] <nastas> kilown: ?
[07:41] <J-_> !dual boot
[07:41] <at0miku> Hmm
[07:41] <at0miku> dom_f: you still there?
[07:41] <J-_> hmm
[07:41] <EdgeT> Can anyone help me "repair" my ubuntu? I installed 6.06 LTS then upgraded to 6.10, but it's highly unstable
[07:42] <at0miku> when I try to change the screen resolution, screen goes black then puts me on the login screen
[07:42] <kitche> deb_user: no it's not it uses a different compression then what linux does most likely
[07:42] <soundray> dougal: have you got plenty of HD space? Like 6GB?
[07:42] <dougal> soundray: 16GB free
[07:42] <[SUDO] Tux> hey
[07:42] <[SUDO] Tux> i need some help

[07:44] <vegetarian> Hi, I have a question about Java runtime environment
[07:44] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, the user .mozilla
[07:44] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, I think they changed formats
[07:44] <EdgeT> oki thnx
[07:44] <kitche> livingdaylight: looks ok I would look at the log in /var/log/gdm and see if there's any errors in there
[07:44] <open-src> deb_user ... you can install skype ... it is probably a bit better..
[07:44] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, what formats?

[07:45] <deb_user> open-src: skype is pretty crappy on ubuntu...and besides, I need something to interface with my asteriskpbx in our central office
[07:45] <warkruid> dusk: "cd" is an internal command and can not be used by sudo !!!
[07:45] <soundray> dougal: here's something else though: do you have a fast connection at home or elsewhere?
[07:45] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, and their new parser doesn't fail gracefully
[07:45] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, And, my system is quite slow (??)
[07:45] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, I don't know, but that's what it looks like to me

[07:45] <[SUDO] Tux> i need help getting XQF game browser to work
[07:45] <dougal> soundray: Yeah, we've got a pretty good connection at home. I just don't have much time at home for booting up the laptop. I've got three kids :)

=== ppeeop is now known as imp
[07:46] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, the newbie pack manager?
[07:46] <kronoman> vegetarian: there are many ways to install java, I found the easiest to just download from sun official website, and follow instructions
[07:46] <[SUDO] Tux> does anyone here use the XQF game browser?
[07:46] <KrakensDen> deb_user, gizmo, maybe?
[07:47] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, the "basic" one
[07:47] <deb_user> KrakensDen: thanks, but I've tried it
[07:47] <[SUDO] Tux> does anyone here use the XQF game browser?
[07:47] <soundray> dougal: I know, I have two, so I have a third more time than you ;) -- but here's the method: "Using APT offline" -- http://www.batmat.net/apt-offline/
[07:47] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, not Synaptic, the other

[07:50] <livingdaylight> kitche: does this look right? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30065/ :-P
[07:50] <[SUDO] Tux> yasuo and kraken I really have  no clue what this is
[07:50] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, eww. /usr/bin/gnome-app-install ?
[07:50] <[SUDO] Tux> yasuo and kraken lol
[07:50] <dusk> warkruid: this is ubuntu, I installed base-server and they do it for safety Id imagine
[07:50] <owl_> is there anyway to fix libsdl so tremulous will work propperly ????
[07:50] <kitche> livingdaylight: yea
[07:50] <KrakensDen> EdgeT, perhaps your path is screwed?
[07:50] <KrakensDen> owl_, yes
[07:50] <[SUDO] Tux> yasuo and kraken but I would like to learn how to use it
[07:50] <owl_> how?
[07:50] <Arrick> doggone it, dpkg-reconfigure xubuntut-xorg doens fix the problem
[07:50] <KrakensDen> owl_, I think you have to install the development libraries
[07:51] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, I dunno, I upgraded this thing, then it became unstable slow, and can't find certain stuff
[07:51] <Yasuo> [SUDO] Tux, read the manopage :)
[07:51] <Arrick> kik the box to the curb
[07:51] <KrakensDen> Yasuo, bad advice
[07:51] <owl_> hmm ok
[07:51] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, there are two steps
[07:51] <Arrick> sick of ubuntu not working
[07:51] <livingdaylight> kitche: so, you're saying there's no  reason why it shouldn't let me in?
[07:51] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, first you have to configure your individual games
[07:51] <owl_> ill try that the tutorial on the forums did not work correctly to solve the problem
[07:51] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, tell it how to launch them
[07:51] <kitche> livingdaylight: error opening security policy file /usr/lib/xserver/SecurityPolicy hmm that looks bad to me
[07:51] <[SUDO] Tux> yasuo and kraken okay...
[07:51] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, then you click on a game, and hit 'update'
[07:51] <warkruid> dusk: Didnt know that. Just starting to gather info about Ubuntu. Now on Slackware :-)
[07:52] <dusk> heh
[07:52] <livingdaylight> kitche: seems the simplest thing is to just reinstall
[07:52] <[SUDO] Tux> wait krakensden can you tell me in private channel?
[07:52] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, to configure the game, hit preferences->games
[07:52] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, nothing .. :(
[07:52] <warkruid> dusk: seems strange though. Must be a way to switch to root ??
[07:52] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden i gotta get this all down
[07:52] <livingdaylight>  kitche coz i don't know what the problem is how it happend and least of all how to fix it
[07:52] <Malachi> Is there a way I can have static IPs for _different_ networks using NetworkManager?
[07:52] <EdgeT> KrakensDen, this sux, FF's still crashing
[07:53] <alesdoc> Salve, non sono pratico di queste cose. Ho un AP a casa. Esiste un modo per vedere le persone collegate?
[07:53] <alesdoc> sorry wrogn channel

[07:54] <kalikiana7> oblib: try 'env'

[07:54] <livingdaylight> kitche: that is what i did
[07:54] <KrakensDen> owl_, libsdl1.2-dev
[07:54] <mariano_> asked for the password and then just got another line of mariano@mariano-desktop:~$
[07:54] <gb> peija-kas:  Ver 5

[07:55] <KrakensDen> owl_, what error message do you get?
[07:55] <EdgeT> Guys, is ff1.5.x.x still in the repositories?
[07:55] <KrakensDen> owl_, launch it from the command line
[07:55] <Keigo-kun> I wan't all the cool stuff, wobbly windows, transperancy, 3dcube desktop... how do I fix it? Do I need XGL or is AIGLX enough?
[07:55] <owl_> KrakensDen, ok shall do
[07:55] <LjL> EdgeT: it's in the Dapper repositories, yes
[07:55] <kitche> mariano_: your X seemed to crash or you are using failsafe login
[07:55] <peija-kas> EdgeT yes in Dapper repos at least
[07:55] <nastas> gb: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_upgrade_from_Dapper_Drake_to_Edgy_Eft_.28experimental.29
[07:55] <gb> peija-kas:  ok ty so much
[07:56] <billytwowilly> wobbly windows is REALLY irritating...
[07:56] <EdgeT> Oki, thanks, but in which ones ,? :)
[07:56] <kitche> Keigo-kun: you need XGL or AIGLX and beryl or compiz installed
[07:56] <gb> nastas: ty u too
[07:56] <Keigo-kun> billytwowilly: Well. it's mostly a test for now
[07:56] <nastas> gb: ok
[07:56] <[SUDO] Tux> yasuo?
[07:56] <Keigo-kun> kitche: I think I have AIGLX installed.. how do I turn features on/off etc?
[07:56] <mariano_> does this mean that I have to reinstall or  will the dpkg-reconfigure xorg fix it??
[07:56] <billytwowilly> Keigo-kun: transparency is cool though.
[07:56] <oblib> kalikiana7: It says it's on '0.0' but any attempts are rejected. Do I need to allow permission somewhere?
[07:56] <Keigo-kun> I saw a youtube movie where a dude had tons of options
[07:56] <julljoll> hola

[07:57] <owl_> KrakensDen, nvidia ge force fx 5500 installed nvidia drivers via automatix
[07:57] <dougal> soundray: I dunno. seems kinda kludgy. But I'm still researching.
[07:57] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden I keep pming ya
[07:58] <gb> well later guys
[07:58] <KrakensDen> ok, nvm, I'm not identified
[07:58] <dougal> soundray: thanks for the link, though.
[07:58] <gb> ty so much
[07:58] <oblib> kalikiana7: start an X program from an SSH command prompt. I used to just type "export DISPLAY=':0'" and it would launch on the xserver
[07:58] <KrakensDen> ...
[07:58] <KrakensDen> nickserv says I am
[07:58] <soundray> dougal: the wget method is not bad at all, I've done that myself
[07:58] <at0miku> when I try to change the screen resolution, screen goes black then puts me on the login screen
[07:58] <at0miku> how can i fix this?
[07:58] <oblib> kalikiana7: now I get "Cannot connect to X server :0.0."
[07:59] <owl_> KrakensDen, shall i re-install the nvidia drivers ??
[07:59] <KrakensDen> owl_, huh. type `glxinfo |grep render` in the console
[07:59] <owl_> KrakensDen, ok
[07:59] <at0miku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3UPnriIxc
[07:59] <KrakensDen> owl_, send me the output
[07:59] <J-_> finally a good install, woo hooo =D
[07:59] <at0miku> haha bouncy windows
[07:59] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, are you registered on freenode?
[07:59] <x_0r> hey
[07:59] <owl_> direct rendering: Yes
[07:59] <owl_> OpenGL renderer string: GeForce FX 5500/AGP/SSE2
[07:59] <soundray> dougal: it's even easier when you have a slow connection (rather than no connection). Just copy the downloaded files into /var/cache/apt/archives on the target machine. Then it will only download the debs that it doesn't find in the cache.
[07:59] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden i dont know what that is
[07:59] <x_0r> is it just one cd for ubuntu?
[08:00] <knoppix> Question: How much disk space does Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Kubuntu need (running without swap partition) ?
[08:00] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, hmm... it's an IRC-ism
[08:00] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, I could message you on some other network, if that would help
[08:00] <dougal> Oh frak. I think I just realized part of my problem :-/
[08:00] <soundray> knoppix: a basic install with gnome uses 1.5 to 2 GB.
[08:00] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden ok... should i register?
[08:00] <soundray> dougal: is it sitting at the keyboard?
=== Danniisannoyed is now known as Dannilion
[08:00] <kalikiana7> oblib: hm... i'm no ssh expert... but isn't 0.0 the local server?
[08:01] <knoppix> soundray: and with xfce ?
[08:01] <dougal> I burned my ISO from the desktop CD. I think I was supposed to get the "alternate install" CD.
[08:01] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, probably
[08:01] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, are you using xchat?
[08:01] <soundray> knoppix: less ;)
[08:01] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden yes, are you getting my PM's?
[08:01] <oblib> kalikiana7: local to where I'm logged onto I believe. Whatever the case, it used to work, I updated to Edgy, and now it doesn't
[08:01] <knoppix> soundray: okay, thank you
[08:01] <kitche> kalikiana7: 127.x.x.x is local machine
[08:02] <nastas> i have try many times to make xgl to work in my laptop but... nothing. its because i'm in laptop???
[08:02] <soundray> knoppix: remember to get xubuntu rather than ubuntu if gnome is dispensable.
[08:02] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, no
[08:02] <kronoman> how I configure my screensaver properly? seems that the gnome-screensaver is broken...
[08:02] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden ok....
[08:02] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, click on the 'ubuntu servers' tab
[08:02] <oblib> kalikiana7: Fixed it. Turns out I needed to type "xhost +" on my xserver machine, and that disabled authorization. Thanks for the help.
[08:02] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden ok...
[08:02] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden now what
[08:02] <dougal> But now I'm stuck with this error about libc6-dev being held back. Arg!
[08:03] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, there hsould be some messages from NickServ
[08:03] <x_0r> is it just one cd for ubuntu?
[08:03] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, they should tell you how to register
[08:03] <kalikiana7> oblib: ok then :)
[08:03] <owl_> x_0r, yes
[08:03] <x_0r> oh ok lol
[08:03] <oblib> Does anyone know where the default settings are for xhost?
[08:03] <x_0r> easy to install?
[08:03] <owl_> x_0r, yes
[08:03] <z0id> hi. does ubuntu have an equivalent to debian's base-config? ie. a console based configuration of keyboard mapping, timezone, accounts, etc.
[08:04] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden there is a ton of stuff typed there, i can't find it
[08:04] <kronoman> can I go back to the old screensaver system ?
[08:04] <knoppix> soundray: i sure will ;)
[08:04] <kronoman> where I could choose options and all
[08:04] <kalikiana7> z0id: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:04] <kronoman> and get rid of gnome-screensaver for good ?
[08:04] <Rappermas> i'm trying to do some development here, and I'm missing these header files: GL/glu.h, X11/Xlib.h, X11/Xutil.h
[08:04] <soundray> knoppix: this page says 1.4GB is enough for xubuntu: http://www.linuxcompatible.org/Xubuntu_6.06_s68294.html
[08:04] <Rappermas> how do i get them?
[08:04] <g333k_work> Hi, how do I remove a second installation of ubuntu removing it also from the grub menu?
[08:04] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, try /msg nickserv help
[08:04] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, and then /msg nickserv register
[08:05] <Rappermas> i tried looking them up in synaptic and didn't have too much luck
[08:05] <Rappermas> i thought maybe someone here would know
[08:05] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, /msg nickserv register YOURPASSWORD will register you
[08:05] <owl_> !pastebin
[08:05] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[08:05] <Rappermas> I think if i can get GL/glu.h, i would be in much better shape
[08:05] <dougal> kronoman: I'm in the same spot. I was going to try uninstalling both gnome-screensaver and xscreensaver, then reinstalling xscreensaver. But I haven't tried it yet.
[08:05] <teledyn> Rappermas: use apt-file to find them
[08:05] <DeeTahPanLtah> hiya mates
[08:05] <DeeTahPanLtah> i got a funny problem
[08:05] <Rappermas> teledyn: how does that work?
[08:05] <DeeTahPanLtah> my mate has to compile kernel to use latest drivers
[08:06] <Rappermas> is it just apt-file <name>?
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> on a just-installed ubuntu
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> the problem is he has no GNU make
[08:06] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden it says: Register :No such nick/channel
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> which package is it in?
[08:06] <teledyn> Rappermas: man apt-file
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> he has no internet access on his laptop
[08:06] <Rappermas> ok, man entry, nice
[08:06] <Rappermas> brb
[08:06] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: ooh search in synaptic for "linux"
[08:06] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, nono... um.. /msg nickserv register
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> well
[08:06] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, not /msg register
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> he has outdated version of ubuntu
[08:06] <teledyn> Rappermas: you need to run update first to update its list
[08:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> ;p
[08:06] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: then upgrade :P:P
[08:07] <Rappermas> teledyn: it's not even installed
[08:07] <[SUDO] Tux> The nickname [[SUDO] Tux]  is already registered
[08:07] <soundray> Rappermas: install it, then
[08:07] <Rappermas> right, lol
[08:07] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden it says: The nickname [[SUDO] Tux]  is already registered
[08:07] <z0id> kalikiana7: i dont have x :). i found it though. base-config is in universe
[08:07] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden does that mean i allready did it?
[08:07] <DeeTahPanLtah> could anybody help me then?
[08:07] <g333k_work> Hi, how do I remove a second installation of ubuntu removing it also from the grub menu?
[08:07] <CarlFK> this popped up in a shell: kernel: [17235297.184000]  Disabling IRQ #11
[08:08] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: for the upgrade?
[08:08] <DeeTahPanLtah> well
[08:08] <CarlFK> should I care?
[08:08] <Guardian> hi
[08:08] <DeeTahPanLtah> the problem is:
[08:08] <kronoman> g333k_work: how is installed ? in another partition ? you could just erase it, and erase the entry in grub menu
[08:08] <soundray> g333k_work: format the partitions and run 'sudo update-grub' from the remaining installation
[08:08] <DeeTahPanLtah> he needs to launch his modem
[08:08] <Guardian> what should i do to upgrade from dapper to edgy eft ?
[08:08] <DeeTahPanLtah> and he has outdated version of ubuntu
[08:08] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: in synaptic in settings there is a "distribution" tab you can upgrade everything there
[08:08] <DeeTahPanLtah> i just need an package name
[08:08] <soundray> !upgrade | Guardian
[08:08] <ubotu> Guardian: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[08:08] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: ohh so no broadband
[08:08] <Guardian> thx soundray
[08:08] <DeeTahPanLtah> not yet ;<
[08:08] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: a new kernel?
[08:09] <DeeTahPanLtah> just a cd
[08:09] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden it says: The nickname [[SUDO] Tux]  is already registered
[08:09] <kronoman> does ubuntu supports USB joysticks ? there is a any configuration tool ?
[08:09] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden does that mean i allready did it?
[08:09] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: a d/l link for edgy cd?
[08:09] <DeeTahPanLtah> he actually copied the sources on the usb stick
[08:09] <DeeTahPanLtah> nah
[08:09] <DeeTahPanLtah> he already has ubuntu
[08:09] <DeeTahPanLtah> just has to install make ;p
[08:09] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: ahh so complicated sry im nboob :P
[08:09] <UmbraAdmin> why did apt-get install vlc remove gnoma and about all my system files ?
=== Adol is now known as Ziemas
[08:09] <UmbraAdmin> Gnome
[08:10] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: sources? you mean lots of .deb packages?
[08:10] <DeeTahPanLtah> nope
[08:10] <DeeTahPanLtah> just linux-thingy.tar.bz2
[08:10] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: AHH :D:D
[08:10] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden You there?
[08:10] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: then honestly i dont know... you have to select kernel modules then compile a kernel image, then make it boot
[08:11] <DeeTahPanLtah> yeah i know
[08:11] <DeeTahPanLtah> the problem is
[08:11] <DeeTahPanLtah> he's out of make
[08:11] <strabes> does anyone know why a mounted vfat partition would randomly change its name from 'data' to '_PNG' ???
[08:11] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: then it will be hard without make (impossible)
[08:11] <DeeTahPanLtah> damnit
[08:11] <strabes> i've tried changing the location it is mounted to to things like 'shared' and 'windows' and rebooting but it doesn't seem to help
[08:11] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: so your friend needs a newer kernel than the default in edgy eft?
[08:11] <EdgeT> oh god, what's the opera's package name?
[08:12] <strabes> it keeps the name '_PNG'
[08:12] <DeeTahPanLtah> epsilon_: its 6.06 TLS
[08:12] <sd00> Hi, how can I play music files from an smb:// address ?  (e.g. smb://musicserver/elvis/sometrack.mp3) ?  Must I mount the share first?
[08:13] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: ty. it's an older version now it's 6.10 (its more "experimental" but newer)
[08:13] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, yes, sorry
[08:13] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden okay did you see what it says?
[08:13] <phxheat> hi, as a web developer, everyday i load the same applications and files in order to work on my projects (firefox bookmarks, jedit, ftp program, ssh client, etc), however i was wondering if there is some sort of launcher that exists that can load all these for me automatically, with the added benefit of loading specific files inside those programs, for example, loading the directory for projectx in jedit, opening projectx's bookmark tabs, aut
[08:13] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, yes
[08:13] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: your friend should upgrade everything from a cd
[08:13] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden what does this mean then?
[08:13] <Samus_Aran> does anyone know how to fix this problem: "Failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon: Unable to determine the address of the message bus"
[08:13] <soundray> strabes: it's probably the filesystem label. You can change that with one of the utils from the mtools package... I think it's called mlabel
[08:13] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, well... either you don't have a unique name
[08:13] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, or you should log in :)
[08:14] <epsilon_> phxheat: hmm thats complicated
[08:14] <Samus_Aran> the dbus service is running
[08:14] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, /msg nickserv identify YOURPASSWORD
[08:14] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden i dont remember the password it sent me
[08:14] <morgue> is GNOME 2.16.1 the default image viewer on 6.06?
[08:14] <epsilon_> phxheat: one solution for example is to make a command file with those programs and their parameter is the file
[08:14] <fenotype_> ehil gente
[08:14] <kronoman> guys : does ubuntu supports USB joysticks ? there is a any configuration tool ?
[08:14] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden Password Incorrect
[08:14] <soundray> morgue: no. Gnome isn't an image viewer
[08:14] <epsilon_> phxheat BUT that depend on the programs :(
[08:14] <phxheat> epsilon_: yea, i was thinking that too, hmm
[08:14] <phxheat> like a bash script?
[08:14] <fenotype_> sorry, i see i'm not in ubuntu-it
[08:15] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden should i re-register and choose a diff username?
[08:15] <kronoman> there is a project or something for joystick support ?  gaming is important to reach desktop audience
[08:15] <epsilon_> phxheat yes something like that
[08:15] <morgue> soundray, excuse me I meant Eye of GNOME 2.16.1
=== lejocelyn is now known as lejocelyn_fedora
[08:15] <epsilon_> phxheat not even a script just a file but thatz depends on the program
[08:15] <epsilon_> phxheat i dont know how to auto-start them im looking for that info i need it too :)
[08:15] <soundray> morgue: yes, that's the one
[08:16] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, I guess... I'm not exactly an IRC guru
[08:16] <joevandyk> Why is the font in Firefox different looking?
[08:16] <morgue> soundray, funny 'cause I used to get options when I right clicked on pictures, now I don't
[08:16] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden okay. brb
[08:16] <joevandyk> (just installed 6.10)
[08:16] <phxheat> epsilon_: auto starting programs on boot?
[08:16] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden wait do you have AIM or some other program?
[08:16] <epsilon_> phxheat auto start when logging in to x yes :)
[08:17] <morgue> joevandyk, you can change the default font going to the Content tab on Preferences
[08:17] <phxheat> does this help?: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_run_programs_on_startup_when_login_into_GNOME
[08:17] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden you could just explain it to me over dat
[08:17] <smoenux> !nvidia
[08:17] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:17] <[SUDO] Tux> krakensden it would be SOO much easier
[08:17] <KrakensDen> [SUDO] Tux, I'm krakensden on AIM
[08:17] <epsilon_> phxheat it might a min then thx :)O
[08:17] <open-src> question >> is there a way to install k9copy on ubuntu (gnome) -- Not kubuntu....?
[08:17] <sd00> Anyone: can I play music files from an smb:// address ?  (e.g. smb://musicserver/elvis/sometrack.mp3) ?  or must I mount the share first?
[08:18] <epsilon_> open-src search for it in add/remove programs or synaptic :)
[08:18] <clearzen> open-src: sudo aptitude install k9copy
[08:18] <epsilon_> phxheat it seems to be easy cool thank you :D
[08:19] <at0miku> when I try to change the screen resolution, screen goes black then puts me on the login screen. how can I fix this?
[08:19] <epsilon_> at0miku but does it change? or this happens while gaming for example?
[08:19] <dusk> at0miku: xorg?
[08:19] <at0miku> Nothing changes
[08:19] <at0miku> it just goes back to the login screen
[08:20] <at0miku> Uhh yeah its xorg
[08:20] <epsilon_> at0miku hmm. do you have latest nvidia/ati drivers?
[08:20] <epsilon_> at0miku i think it helps :S
[08:20] <at0miku> I'm using an onboard gfx card
[08:20] <at0miku> voodoo3
[08:20] <clearzen> I've been running edgy for about a week now and I've noticed that it is very random with samba shares. Sometimes they show up and other times I have to hit reload to see them only to lose other pc's on my network. Does anyone know why?
[08:20] <owl_> KrakensDen, worked on the video :) but its still dark :)
[08:21] <epsilon_> so phxheat make a command file in your home for example "my-autorun" then mak ie automatically run :)
[08:21] <owl_> KrakensDen, but ill fix that :) thanks alot
[08:21] <cynical> clearzen: Make sure they are on the same workgroup
[08:21] <cynical> clearzen: if they are that is a bit strange
[08:22] <clearzen> cynical: they are on the same network. And it is only with samba
[08:22] <clearzen> cynical:NTF is fine and so is ssh
[08:22] <DeeTahPanLtah> how to unpack dpkg?
[08:22] <KrakensDen> owl_, yeah, gamma ftw :P
[08:22] <cynical> clearzen: No I'm saying are they on the same workgroup
[08:22] <DeeTahPanLtah> dpkg file*
[08:22] <clearzen> cynical: it is all the same workgroup
[08:22] <clearzen> cynical: I checked
[08:22] <cynical> clearzen: ah ok
[08:22] <owl_> KrakensDen, im just going to use the nvidia settings panel and do it there :) rather than recompile libsdl :P
[08:23] <clearzen> cynical: I thought it was a known problem. But I guess not
[08:23] <cynical> clearzen: No I've never had that issue on my network
[08:23] <nastas> bye!
[08:23] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah: .deb file? dpkg -i file.
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> na
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> not install
[08:24] <kouaks> hello everyone... anybody familiar with Acer laptops? I'm having trouble booting Edgy...
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> i want to skip dependencies
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> just install what's inside
[08:24] <epsilon_> DeeTahPanLtah noo that wont work in a debian (linux) system everything depends on everything :(
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> even kernel if i get just an image and its modules? ;p
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> dont think so
[08:24] <DeeTahPanLtah> how to decompress?
[08:25] <MarcN> DeeTahPanLtah: what is dpkg complaining about?
[08:25] <DeeTahPanLtah> nothing yet
[08:25] <morgue> So the difference between ubuntu and kbutun is that the first uses gnome and the second uses kde?
[08:25] <smoenux> can anyone tell me how I can install the previous version of my Nvidia Drivers? I cannot see them in the Package Manager.
[08:25] <DeeTahPanLtah> but ima install a package from 6.10 under 6.06
[08:25] <DeeTahPanLtah> it surely *will* complain ;>
[08:25] <kitche> smoenux: yes
[08:25] <epsilon_> morgue yes. gnome is simpler faster easier to use, kde is more configurable. both are lovely :)
[08:25] <MarcN> DeeTahPanLtah: you may already have the deps met
[08:26] <DeeTahPanLtah> fat chance
=== xalbertox is now known as fulldisclosure
[08:26] <morgue> epsilon_, when you say more configurable what do you main?
[08:26] <morgue> mean*
[08:26] <open-src> it worked.. that awesome.
[08:26] <epsilon_> smoenux: try the nvidia.com site :)
[08:26] <morgue> afk
[08:26] <snoops> all settings for thunderbird - accounts, smtp servers, emails etc can be transfered from the windows thunderbird client to the linux one, correct?
[08:26] <shwag_> anyone know if edgy works on a mac mini intel ?
[08:26] <epsilon_> morgue more options, more but you dont need them all. i love them both
[08:27] <open-src> ty <clearzen> and <epsilon_> :)
[08:27] <epsilon_> morgue AND you can run KDE programs in GNOME and vice versa.
[08:27] <tich> i am unable to connect to my wireless network-- can anyone help me?
[08:27] <epsilon_> open-src cool :)
[08:27] <DeeTahPanLtah> shwag: if some architecture has a gcc kernel ported,it will work :>
[08:27] <smoenux> epsilon_: I have, but those drivers are weird... they are asking me to compile some kernel or something, and I'm still noobish, and affraid to kill my system
=== bab is now known as Peggerr
[08:28] <epsilon_> smoenux yes it may :). why do you need those older drivers?
[08:28] <kitche> smoenux: you jut need the kernel-sources
[08:28] <oangefly> i setup samba and everything seems to be working, but i can login the same name at the same time on 2 pc's....can anyone help....???....
[08:29] <epsilon_> kitche smoenux there is no kernel-sources package
[08:29] <killown> how I define route eth0 to eth1 in iptables?
[08:29] <Samus_Aran> doesn't anyone know any way to make Debian/Ubuntu ignore the dependancies of a package so that apt never again complains about it ?  I have a couple packages which think they have unmet deps, but they do not, they work fine .. but apt wants to uninstall them every time I run it
[08:29] <Sebboh> Is there a normal, easy way to gain access to directories that need root access, from within the file browser?
[08:29] <smoenux> epsilon_, I need the old ones to fix a font problem I'm having with Guild-Wars in cedega
[08:29] <Samus_Aran> I have found nothing on Google to help and nobody has ever suggested a solution in the channel ..
[08:29] <epsilon_> smoenux that MAY be cedega's fault are you absolutely sure its the nvidia?
[08:29] <kouaks> Sebboh, try running sudo nautilus from a terminal inside gnome
[08:30] <clearzen> Samus_Aran: use dpkg to force install
[08:30] <POVaddct> killown: enabling routing has nothing to do with iptables. sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
[08:30] <Sebboh> Samus, I've often had the same problem.  I've thought about making a meta package, but I don't know how to do that.
[08:30] <clearzen> Samus_Aran: you could try apt-get -f install as well
[08:30] <Sebboh> Kouaks, *within the file browser*?
[08:30] <tich> i don't know if it even recognizes that a wireless network exists. i have tried both dhcp and with a static ip and nothing ever happens
[08:30] <kitche> epsilon_: sure there is even though it's an old version of the kernel
[08:30] <Samus_Aran> clearzen: installing is not the issue I am talking about.  the issue is that apt recognizes the packages as missing dependencies, and then proceeds to refuse to do anything until those apps have been "fixed" (removed from the system)
[08:30] <killown> POVaddct I do it
[08:30] <Samus_Aran> clearzen: "apt-get -f install" is what removes the apps I want installed
[08:30] <smoenux> epsilon_, I've been on all the forums and tried everything, on the one forum the guys were saying that the font problem is only with nvidia drivers 8xxx and that I need to install 7xxx
[08:31] <kouaks> sudo nautilus *will* fire up Nautilus, only with root privs
[08:31] <Sebboh> Samus, make a meta package that "provides" whatever the missing packages are.  I don't know how to do that, though. =)
[08:31] <tenshu> plop
[08:31] <POVaddct> killown: iptables can be used for setting up masquerading though
[08:31] <fialar> trying to compile wine on 64-bit with Ubuntu 6.10.. in config.log I get: "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGL"
[08:31] <DeeTahPanLtah> afk
[08:31] <fialar> skipping incompatible /usr/bin/../lib/libGL.so when searching for -lGL
[08:31] <jrib> smoenux: take a look at equivs, but be sure that it is not actually a broken package...
[08:31] <killown> POVaddct teach -me
[08:31] <jrib> Samus_Aran: take a look at equivs, but be sure that it is not actually a broken package...
[08:31] <epsilon_> kitche then i dont find it :( what is the exact source package name? tell smoeux. are the headers enough?
[08:31] <kmaynard> kouaks, actually, you'll have to run gksudo nautilus
[08:31] <bRutEado> Does anyone can explain to me what to do by this phrase 'Then use rawrite command: rawrite -f sbm.bin (rawwritewin.exe sbm.bin)'. I don't understand what to do
[08:31] <at0miku> okay
[08:31] <fialar> anyone know where I can find a valid -lGL (opengl lib)
[08:31] <clearzen> Samus_Aran:  have you tried using aptitude? It may provide a solution on it's own
[08:31] <at0miku> im gonna say my problem again :)
[08:31] <jrib> smoenux: sorry, I can't type :)
[08:31] <Sebboh> Kouaks, I know.  I don't want to fire up a terminal.  Thanks anyway.
[08:31] <POVaddct> killown: which one is the interface to the public?
[08:31] <Gwildor> bRutEado, still?
[08:31] <at0miku> when I try to change the screen resolution, screen goes black then puts me on the login screen. how can I fix this?
[08:32] <kouaks> Sebboh, then use Alt+F2 (Run) and type sudo nautilus
[08:32] <Samus_Aran> jrib: I saw mention of equivs on a Debian forum, but I didn't see it on this system.  is it available on Ubuntu then ?
[08:32] <kitche> smoeux you need the linux headers
[08:32] <jrib> Samus_Aran: by the way, I'm assuming this isn't an official package
[08:32] <DeeTahPanLtah> bakc
[08:32] <Gwildor> bRutEado, rawrite -f sbm.bin == linux      rawwritewin.exe sbm.bin == windows
[08:32] <epsilon_> kitche are they enough?
[08:32] <Sebboh> Kouaks, I've seen other people that can right click a folder and "browse as root".
[08:32] <killown> POVaddct nope
[08:32] <kitche> epsilon_: kernel-source-2.4.27 is the package name it's very old don't know why they don't have the one up that they use sinc it's sorta breaking the GPL
[08:32] <bRutEado> [Gwildor] : i still have no answer for my questions
[08:32] <Gwildor> bRutEado, do that from command line!
[08:32] <Samus_Aran> jrib: if so, I will uninstall the apps it thinks are broken and install 'equivs'
[08:32] <kitche> epsilon_: yes it should be enough
[08:33] <Gwildor> bRutEado, maybe say WHAT you dont understand!
[08:33] <jrib> Samus_Aran: no, what exactly is broken?
[08:33] <Gwildor> bRutEado, cuz ive answered you 3 times now
[08:33] <tich> there doesn't seem to be much info on either the wiki or forum on wireless stuff so if anyone could help i would appreciate it.
[08:33] <epsilon_> kitche smoeux: look for meta-packages. smoeux if oyu have linux kernel generic then install generic linux headers :)
[08:33] <Sebboh> Samus_Aran: Right, equivs!  Good idea...
[08:33] <POVaddct> killown: sorry, i have to go. set masquerading with: sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ethX -j MASQUERADE   (replace ethX with the interface going to the internet)
[08:33] <kouaks> Sebboh, sorry, not sure how that is done... I use sudo nautilus from a terminal :(
[08:34] <krups> guarddog is blocking my ktorrent.  other then enabling bittorrent in the settings, what should i be looking at?
[08:34] <Samus_Aran> jrib: I am trying to use an older version of the Opera web browser (which depends on a no-longer-existant, empty, transitional package) and a very new version of TuxPaint (which asks for *very* specific versions of common libs that it doesn't actually need)
[08:34] <Sebboh> ok Kouaks... Thanks. =)
[08:34] <bRutEado> [Gwildor] : what exactly can i write in the command line? I will experience all the ways
[08:34] <smoenux> epsilon_ ,  kk ... thankx
[08:34] <Gwildor> bRutEado, from linux?  rawrite -f sbm.bin
[08:34] <jrib> Samus_Aran: you just use equivs to make a fake package with the name of that dep but doesn't actually install anything
[08:35] <mirak> how can I know if my X uses fglrx module or radeon ?
[08:35] <epsilon_> smoenux: so firs install kernel headers and dl nvidia drivers.
[08:35] <kouaks> anybody familiar with boot params? :)
[08:35] <Sebboh> I am SOO going to equivs evolution.
[08:35] <Samus_Aran> jrib: well that is exactly what I need.  I was just asking if Ubuntu had this package ... as I can't install anything until apt removes these packages it thinks are broken
[08:35] <Gwildor> Gwildor, ive alread told you.....outside () is linux command... inside () is windows command
[08:35] <jrib> Samus_Aran: yes, it does.  It is in universe
[08:35] <Sebboh> Kouaks, just ask the question, someone will answer. =)
[08:35] <zyclop> kouaks, man bootparam?
[08:35] <jrib> !info equivs
[08:35] <ubotu> equivs: Circumvent Debian package dependencies. In component universe, is extra. Version 2.0.7 (edgy), package size 18 kB, installed size 128 kB
[08:35] <epsilon_> smoenux: THEN press ctrl-alt-f1 and login. then "sudo rm /tmp/.X0-lock" then "bash nvidia-driver....run"
[08:36] <epsilon_> smoenux *"sudo bash nvidia...run"
[08:36] <Samus_Aran> epsilon_: that would need to be sudo as well, the nvidia driver install
[08:36] <Samus_Aran> epsilon_: nm =p
[08:37] <kouaks> I'm having trouble booting Edgy on a Acer Aspire 1690. Booting Dapper was a snap (no special params needed). Edgy on the other hand just hangs :(
[08:37] <kmu> How can I determine the version of a software package installed with apt-get?
[08:37] <epsilon_> Samus_Aran =)
[08:37] <n1gke> Good afternoon folks.
[08:37] <slinky_> Good day folks, can I safely remove xorg.conf.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn files if they are no longer needed or are they tracked in some index?
[08:37] <jrib> kmu: apt-cache policy package_name
[08:37] <epsilon_> kmu search for it in synaptic :)
[08:38] <epsilon_> slinky_ you can remove them but it doesnt hurt if they are there.
[08:38] <zyclop> kmu, sometimes foo -v works
[08:38] <kmu> thanks everyone
[08:38] <Sebboh> kouaks, google for info about the parameters apci=off, noapic, and nolapic.
[08:38] <slinky_> epsilon: they are incorrect, so I don't want to refer to bad install options in the future, thanks
[08:39] <zyclop> kouaks, define "trouble"
[08:39] <kouaks> Sebboh, i've tried all of them... also tried irqpoll pci biosirq, vga=771, vga=791... no go
[08:39] <bRutEado> [Gwildor] : And what are the words i can write since i have the windows xp?
[08:39] <smoenux> epsilon_: ok, I seem to have the headers install allready
[08:39] <Gwildor> bRutEado, the shit inside of the (HERE)
[08:39] <epsilon_> smoenux: cool. read what i said before then try to do it. :)
[08:39] <slinky_> Have a great day everyone, bye and thanks
[08:39] <epsilon_> smoenux: shall i write them down again?
[08:40] <smoenux> na it's ok
[08:40] <smoenux> I can scroll :P
[08:40] <Darxus> how do I make it so I can switch between workspaces via alt-F# instead of ctrl-alt-left/right arrow?
[08:40] <epsilon_> smoenux okok :P
[08:40] <bRutEado> [Gwildor] : You are joking with me? I'm not vey dumb
[08:41] <Gwildor> bRutEado, i am not joking
[08:41] <bRutEado> [Gwildor] : You are joking with me? I'm not very dumb
[08:41] <larsemil_> in what folder should put codecs to play whatever in mplayer?
[08:41] <Gwildor> bRutEado, rawwritewin.exe smb.bin     thats what you do!
[08:41] <epsilon_> smoenux i hope it wont make you X crash. if so then in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, reset your driver from "nvidia" to "nv"
[08:41] <tannerld> how do I configure the DNS settings for my ubuntu server?
[08:42] <n1gke> Is anyone here experienced with Matrox G400 video card in Ubuntu please.
[08:42] <warkruid> tannerId: edit resolv.conf
[08:42] <kouaks> Sebboh, I've booted off in Text-mode installation. Hopefully the problem is somewhere in the RAMdrive area :S
[08:42] <smoenux> epsilon_ . yeah, I figured that :P .... that much at least I know
[08:42] <jafaar> can anyone help me with a problem?
[08:42] <tannerld> warkruid: ok :) thanks

[08:43] <SeanTater> Gwildor: eh -- okay
[08:43] <n1gke> jafaar, how much video memoery do you have ?
[08:43] <jafaar> it just started happening after i installed the xubuntu-desktop(i was on GNOME) before
[08:43] <SeanTater> Gwildor: I was afraid so --

[08:44] <n1gke> Hmmm

[08:44] <n1gke> Hi Sam
[08:44] <jafaar> i've reinstalled my graphics drivers
[08:44] <rockobop> #ubuntu-es
[08:44] <jafaar> it happens whenever i scroll in any window
[08:45] <jafaar> or move a window around my screen
[08:45] <boybach> hello, i have a problem getting my monitor to display higher than 1024 x 768.
[08:45] <rockobop> #ubuntu-es
[08:45] <DeeTahPanLtah> !highresx
[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about highresx - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <DeeTahPanLtah> !highres
[08:45] <ivx> boybach do you have genertic drivers or the offical ones
[08:45] <n1gke> boybach, have a look at your xorg.conf file.
[08:45] <jStefan> !fixres | boybach
[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about highres - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <larsemil_> in what folder should put codecs to play whatever in mplayer?
[08:45] <ubotu> boybach: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[08:45] <jafaar> when i run a video file, it is unaffected though
[08:45] <DeeTahPanLtah> damnit,sorry ;p
[08:45] <tefsom> hi all

[08:46] <tefsom> have i to recompile something?
[08:46] <jrib> larsemil_: the README file in the codec tarball should say ( /usr/local/lib/codecs/)
[08:46] <boybach> offical ones
[08:46] <SeanTater> tefsom: not likely
[08:46] <DeeTahPanLtah> !damnit_isnt_a_swearword | SeanTater
[08:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about damnit_isnt_a_swearword - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:46] <n1gke> boybach, in your xorg.conf file, look for default depth

[08:56] <Phaqui> Where the hell can I find the system requirements for Ubuntu ??
[08:56] <variant> Phaqui: it's quite simple really.. if you mean minimum
[08:56] <Phaqui> minimum, yes
[08:57] <variant> Phaqui: for a desktop system with gnome or kde a 1ghz cpu and 128mb ram _can_ run it but it wont be very happy
[08:57] <limqareb> well i got one other thing
=== Zeroteku is now known as TheJF
[08:57] <variant> Phaqui: with that you would be better with xfce.. which can use much less ram than that
[08:57] <RichW> Im running Ubuntu on 400mhz processor and 192mb of ram
[08:57] <limqareb> i got 2 sound cards onboard and the audigy 4 which one is the one default choosen
[08:57] <Phaqui> oic
[08:57] <variant> Phaqui: if you have less than 64mb ram you can use fluxbox
[08:58] <RichW> i would recommend 192mb minimum
[08:58] <shwag_> what is the difference betweent he install cd or the install DVD ?
[08:58] <variant> Phaqui: i use fluxbox anyway because its good..
[08:58] <Phaqui> I think I have enough ram
[08:58] <limqareb> is 2 gb ram good?
[08:58] <Phaqui> but I only got a 2GB HD.....
[08:58] <The_Machine> yes
[08:58] <The_Machine> it's more than good
[08:58] <variant> Phaqui: Phaqui a 2gb hd?
[08:58] <The_Machine> it's excessive.
[08:58] <The_Machine> :P
[08:58] <Phaqui> yes... variant
[08:58] <The_Machine> for windows 95
[08:58] <limqareb> i have 2 gb for windows
[08:58] <RichW> and how come nobody answers my question.. anyone here upgraded from dapper to edgy?
[08:59] <variant> Phaqui: you can install on that.. jus tbe carefull about what packages you install

[08:59] <Phaqui> okay
[08:59] <variant> RichW: yes i have
[08:59] <Phaqui> I'll give it a try
[08:59] <RichW> gksu "update-manager -c", will it install and configure upstart?
[08:59] <Phaqui> need to get my hands dirtey first tho
[08:59] <variant> RichW: i did it months ago though and have just kept it up to date
[08:59] <Phaqui> that is
[08:59] <rucoma> Alguien que hable espaol?
[08:59] <boybach> That did not work ?
[08:59] <RichW> i want upstart for the extra speed boost
[08:59] <shwag_> where can I find a FAST torrent for ubuntu 6.10
[09:00] <variant> RichW: there is not much of a speed boost at the momment as it still uses all the old init scripts
[09:00] <RichW> :O
[09:00] <RichW> really?!?!
[09:00] <n1gke> boybach, well can you post some where I can see you xorg.conf file ?

[09:00] <razormade> shwag_: Use th eftp! it was fat for me!!
[09:00] <variant> RichW: yes, once they have been moved to the new system then you will start to see improvements
[09:00] <RichW> guess I gotta wait for them to get fixed?
[09:00] <variant> RichW: infact, some people have noticed speed decrease..
[09:00] <variant> RichW: but this is temporary

[09:06] <RichW> stasislove: hah dont ask me, i spent a whole day trying to get it working with my 9800 pro.. ATI based cards and XGL dont like me much.
[09:06] <cartucho> luisbg: well try to down your vertical res
[09:06] <luisbg> cartucho, how?
[09:06] <stasislove> RichW, ATI dont seem to like anyone running linux =)
[09:07] <cartucho> luisbg: say if you use 1024x768 try 1024x800 and stuff like that
[09:07] <A[D] minS> !info scripts
[09:07] <ubotu> Package scripts does not exist in any distro I know
[09:07] <cartucho> i have ati running nice
[09:07] <A[D] minS> !info irc
[09:07] <ubotu> Package irc does not exist in any distro I know
[09:07] <luisbg> cartucho, but in the system menu> resolution, I don't have a 1204x800 option
[09:07] <RichW> stasislove: my ATI card didnt even work with vista, let alone linux.
[09:07] <A[D] minS> letme pvt better than flood main
[09:07] <n1gke> !info xirc
[09:07] <ubotu> Package xirc does not exist in any distro I know
[09:07] <axl> hi, does anyone know, how i can start scripts on bootup with upstart??
[09:07] <cartucho> luisbg: edit your xorg.conf or change the monitor model,
[09:08] <luisbg> where the monitor model?
[09:08] <cartucho> luisbg: i dont know i just set everything manually in xorg.conf
[09:08] <klm-> variant: thanks! I'll try that
[09:08] <limqareb> wtf i tried every single solution
[09:08] <RichW> A[D] minS: use a pastebin
[09:08] <limqareb> still no sound
[09:08] <luisbg> cartucho, ok cool! thanks for the help
[09:08] <limqareb> wtf
[09:09] <cartucho> luisbg: in xorg.conf you will have a DefaultDepth entry with some resolutions, try to add some
[09:09] <stasislove> RichW, vista... i dont even consider that as an operating system i would ever try =)
[09:09] <mirak> does anyone knows how to rebuild a kernel image package from the source package and a specific target ?
[09:09] <axl> noone familiar with upstart??
[09:10] <limqareb> :|
[09:10] <luisbg> cartucho, yeah yeah... know what you mean? since my ubuntu install got the screen model perfectly, thought maybe there was a command to do that
[09:10] <stasislove> RichW, will keep xp for games as long as possible... perhaps then wine will be good enough to run games in linux =)
[09:10] <luisbg> cartucho, but by hand is good enough ;)
[09:10] <A[D] minS> RichW: sorry ?why u tell me pastebin?
[09:10] <RichW> stasislove: its crap, i need windows for some cirtain applications though. Was just trying it out tho :)
[09:10] <zyclop> axl, man upstart?
[09:10] <matahari> hi
[09:10] <limqareb> !sound
[09:10] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[09:10] <axl> already tried, but i cant get the job working...
[09:11] <g333k_work> Hello, I have installed another ubuntu, then I deleted that partition, now my grub says "Error 22" and i doesnt load, how can I solve it?
[09:11] <RichW> stasislove: I was quite shocked to see Medal oh honor allied assult run on Wine.. it ran really well, not sure about other games.
[09:11] <matahari> are there some bootscripts in ubuntu edgy, where i can add my commands? and a stopscript too?
[09:12] <stasislove> RichW. well steam needs better support and i must test Civ 4 and cossacs 2, if those work well i need windows no more =)
[09:12] <zyclop> g333k_work, was it the partition with /boot/grub?
[09:12] <RichW> A[D] minS: You paste a load of text on a website and give the link.... they are called pastebins..like: www.pastebin.ca
[09:12] <cartucho> matahari: /etc/rc.local ?
[09:12] <erUSUL> matahari: bootmisc.sh
[09:12] <g333k_work> zyclop, nop
[09:13] <erUSUL> ??
[09:13] <RichW> stasislove: opengl based games should run best.
[09:13] <zyclop> have you looked up error 22 yet?
[09:13] <d-snp> hey, edgy destroyed my xserver pretty bad, I get the no screens found error but the standard solution doesn't work :(
[09:13] <A[D] minS> RichW i know about it but am asking why
[09:13] <matahari> i mean something like /etc/conf.d/local.start and local.stop
[09:13] <A[D] minS> :D
[09:14] <A[D] minS> any way i think i missunderstood when i said will flood da main
[09:14] <cartucho> matahari: but why do u need to create another init ?
[09:14] <sven-tek> if /etc/default/rcS UTC=yes and /etc/timezone are identical in my dapper and my edgy partition, what else can cause the 1 hour difference between the systems?
[09:14] <cartucho> matahari: to mount stuffs in different places ?
[09:14] <A[D] minS> i was talking to ubotu just to leave man and open pvt to ask as much as i can
[09:14] <matahari> not a new init
[09:14] <d-snp> argh why do so many join and leave here :\
[09:14] <stasislove> RichiH, ye... *got to go*.
[09:14] <erUSUL> matahari: create it yourself use /etc/init.d/skeleton as a base and use update-rc.d to add it to init
[09:14] <matahari> cartucho: to load drivers used for parallels
[09:15] <g333k_work> zyclop, I think the error is because grub is looking for the 2nd ubuntu but it is deleted now, how can I solve it?
[09:15] <cartucho> matahari: do what erUSUL told then.
[09:15] <matahari> ok, thanks
[09:15] <cartucho> matahari: but measure if you really need this first ;0
[09:15] <The_Machine> I would like to 'create a shortcut' to a file that's on an SMB share.  how can i easily do that with gnome?  (If i right click on the file in the SMB share, and say "Make link" it doesn't let me) "unsupported operation"
[09:15] <zyclop> g333k_work, I'm googling for it atm
[09:15] <pOrnstAr> hey... i have this bug on kubuntu edgy, using a fresh install... i have an ati x700 mobile and when i switch from Xorg to console
[09:15] <aoupi> d-snp: you can tell most IRC clients to not show who joins and leaves
[09:15] <pOrnstAr> the screen is all messed up
[09:15] <pOrnstAr> anyone can help?
[09:16] <boybach> nlgke: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30084/
[09:16] <d-snp> aoupi: just did thanks
[09:16] <nolimitsoya> how do i remove a package and force a removal of all its dependencies using apt?
[09:16] <n1gke> boybach, okay, let me go look.
[09:16] <ippa> beeing totally new to ubuntu .. what kind of timeframe can one expect to get a bug like https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/22985 fixed?
[09:17] <ippa> it's currently the showstopper for my first ubuntuinstall
[09:17] <epsilon_> AHH this automatix thing is very very cool!
[09:17] <LjL> !automatix
[09:17] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[09:17] <epsilon_> lol.
[09:17] <epsilon_> :D:D
[09:18] <d-snp> so I'm trying to boot edgy, but it keeps giving the no screens found error, it seems module abi major version 0 mismatches with server's version 1, I use gflrx
[09:18] <dob1> there is an ubuntu package with 2.6.18 ?
[09:18] <Jas-Nix> I can not figure this out.. I installed x86_64 ubuntu edgy, everything worked ok, I then installed network-manager-gnome
[09:18] <Jas-Nix> and system hard locked
[09:18] <axl> does anyone know how i can kick upstart from my edgy and use the good ols sysvinit??
[09:18] <Jas-Nix> now when I try to reinstall, the install freezes at 70%
[09:18] <Skyrail> Anyone got dual screens running on Ubuntu?
[09:18] <nolimitsoya> ippa, how can it be a showstopper if it can be fixed through simplet xorg.conf editing?
[09:19] <ippa> nolimitsoya: it is? read all ppls descriptions of the bug without seeing a sollution
[09:19] <d-snp> Skyrail: did you check ubuntuguide.org?
[09:19] <Skyrail> or does anyone know how to set up dual screens in ubuntu?
[09:19] <n1gke> boybach, looks good. Did you try default depth of 16 ?
[09:19] <n1gke> !smooth scrolling
[09:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smooth scrolling - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:19] <RedRose> how do i configure what starts at bootup?
[09:20] <n1gke> !scrolling
[09:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about scrolling - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:20] <nolimitsoya> ippa, i see someone claiming to have a fix in the first post...
[09:20] <ippa> nolimitsoya: to make it clear, it's a totally new install.. I boot the CD, choose first alternative "install" .. and it dies (black screen) after 2 m ins.
[09:20] <RedRose> !upstart
[09:20] <ubotu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[09:20] <boybach> yeah no change I did notice in the log there is no resolution above 1024x768 isn't that the problem ?
[09:20] <mattik> What's wrong ATI Settings in Edgy to me? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30085/
[09:20] <nolimitsoya> ippa, use the alternate install cd, and do a text mode install
[09:20] <jStefan> RedRose, man update-rc.d
[09:21] <iMax> hi
[09:21] <RedRose> jStefan:but what about upstart?
[09:21] <n1gke> boybach, when I changed my default to 24, it opened up to1820x1024 and back
[09:21] <n1gke> that shud be
[09:21] <Skyrail> d-snp: heh, I'll give it a go :D
[09:21] <jStefan> RedRose, afaik upstart still uses the symlinks
[09:21] <n1gke> 1280x1024 and back.
[09:21] <aoupi> RedRose: it's backwards compatible with the old init
[09:21] <ippa> nolimitsoya: where's this "alternative" install-cd?
[09:21] <d-snp> this is stupid, I can't see anything, everyone keeps asking questions, and I'm at 640x480 on a 24" screen :P
[09:22] <boybach> my default is 24.
[09:22] <nolimitsoya> ippa, on the ubuntu mirrors, right with the desktop cd :)
[09:22] <n1gke> boybach, I was stuck in 1024x768 for a bit until I researched it out/
[09:22] <nolimitsoya> ippa, one moment, ill get youa link

[09:22] <Jas-Nix> LjL: do you use 64 bit or 32bit ?
[09:22] <n1gke> boybach, I am trying to remember where the setting for smooth scrolling is to turn it off......
[09:22] <AsheD> how does one view the setup of a software RAID?

[09:23] <ippa> mm tnx
[09:23] <SirKillalot> do I have to recompile the fglrx modules only when I update to a newer kernel version or also when I path my current kernel?
[09:23] <jStefan> ippa, consider using torrents
[09:23] <RedRose> also, what's up with Virtual terminals in eft? mine don't work
[09:23] <The_Machine> I would like to 'create a shortcut' to a file that's on an SMB share.  how can i easily do that with gnome?  (If i right click on the file in the SMB share, and say "Make link" it doesn't let me) "unsupported operation"
[09:23] <searey29> Hello all can I chime in
[09:23] <RedRose> they give me the framebuffer
[09:23] <RedRose> !vt
[09:23] <ippa> mm, but im hitting a .se-mirror
[09:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vt - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:24] <AsheD> squidly:: can I see what drives make it up?
[09:24] <zyclop> g333k_work, just a hypothesis: it might help to remove the entry for the non existant OS from /boot/grub/menu.lst (backup first)
[09:24] <nolimitsoya> RedRose, apt-get install screen?
[09:24] <aoupi> RedRose: is it all funky looking or do you actualy see text?
[09:24] <squidly> AsheD: umm... let me think for a sec
[09:24] <RedRose> done
[09:25] <AsheD> my friend has a 4-drive RAID5 setup atm, and one of the drives is buggy
[09:25] <SirKillalot> do I have to recompile the fglrx modules only when I update to a newer kernel version or also when I path my current kernel?
[09:25] <AsheD> I am helping him out while he is at work
[09:25] <ippa> nolimitsoya: there's no way to use the orig-install-cd but get thoose lines into the conf before graphic install starts?
[09:25] <squidly> AsheD: let me look up the mdadm command really quick
[09:25] <iMax> virtual terminals on edgy are broken here too.....at least the switch back to X11....it then sort of crashes, black screen, no reaction anymore
[09:25] <RedRose> aoupi:funy looking
[09:25] <squidly> but i think its something like mdadm --list
[09:25] <KennyTheFreak> How do i cross compile Cedega to ubuntu 64bit?
[09:25] <nolimitsoya> ippa, no
[09:26] <RedRose> when i got to VT-1 on CTRL-ALT-F1, it gives me bars
[09:26] <aoupi> RedRose: try removing 'splash' from the kernel argument in /boot/grub/menu.lst, you wont get a pretty splash screen at boot, but that fixed it for me
[09:26] <squidly> try madam --misc -Q /dev/md#
[09:26] <sven-tek> if /etc/default/rcS UTC=yes and /etc/timezone are identical in my dapper and my edgy partition, what else can cause the 1 hour difference between the systems?
[09:26] <pOrnstAr> aoupi: no it doesn't
[09:27] <pOrnstAr> :\
[09:27] <EagleS675> I have firewall firestarter how the heck can I do this : outbound from 1 to 5000 (port) to open that ports
[09:27] <aoupi> pOrnstAr: what? it did fix it what me
[09:27] <nolimitsoya> how do i remove a package and force a removal of all its dependencies using apt?
[09:27] <LjL> Jas-Nix: 32
[09:27] <pOrnstAr> this is a f... issue! :\
[09:27] <LjL> nolimitsoya: use apt-get autoremove, if you're on edgy
[09:28] <n1gke> boybach, does this happen in all screens or just in certain screens/programs ?
[09:28] <pOrnstAr> hey... i have this bug on kubuntu edgy, using a fresh install... i have an ati x700 mobile and when i switch from Xorg to console
[09:28] <pOrnstAr> the screen is all messed up
[09:28] <pOrnstAr> anyone can help?
[09:28] <nolimitsoya> LjL, that dont work on ubuntu-desktop...
[09:28] <Jas-Nix> LjL: hrmm ok
[09:28] <AsheD> ok, so it shows 3 of the 4 drives as being active, 1 being removed.  The removed one also does not show a partition in /dev, I suppose those are conencted?
[09:28] <Jas-Nix> it seems there's issues with the 64bit livecd
[09:28] <Jas-Nix> but it could just be my system
[09:28] <LjL> nolimitsoya, no, because that would imply removing everything
[09:28] <aoupi> pOrnstAr: see what I wrote to RedRose
[09:28] <joevandyk> I've got an nvidia 7800gtx card, but glxgears is only showing 680 fps or so.  Direct rendering is turned on.  Any ideas?
[09:29] <pOrnstAr> aoupi: been there done that
[09:29] <ippa> nolimitsoya: omg, I pasted the wrong bugpage ;) ... https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/67487
[09:29] <ippa> is it
[09:29] <nolimitsoya> LjL, more basic stuff in included in ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-standard
[09:29] <pOrnstAr> same shit
[09:29] <joevandyk> I've tried installing both the nvidia and nvidia beta drivers.
[09:29] <EagleS675> well you guys know ?
[09:29] <aoupi> pOrnstAr: ok, then I have no idea
[09:29] <nolimitsoya> is just want to get rid of the desktop stuf, and have a very basic custom install
[09:29] <nolimitsoya> *-s
[09:29] <pOrnstAr> f'in bug!
[09:29] <jStefan> joevandyk, test a 3d game instead, glxgears is not a benchmark ;)
[09:29] <ippa> nolimitsoya: something with edgy and ATI-cards
[09:30] <joevandyk> jStefan: is there one in the repository somewhere?
=== metatron_ is now known as metatro
[09:30] <VigoFuse> To use Ruby in Ubuntu can I just copy from a CD, or download another version into the Ubuntu?
[09:30] <jStefan> joevandyk, probably, outside the repos you could consider something like the Quake4 Demo
[09:30] <Skyrail> d-snp: screen still messed up?
[09:31] <nolimitsoya> ippa, still, get the alternate cd, use vesa if fglrx doesnt work
[09:31] <LjL> nolimitsoya, i understand your reasoning, but the problem is that, as soon as you remove *any* package, ubuntu-desktop will be removed -- now if ubuntu-desktop's dependencies (as installed by the ubuntu CD installer) were marked as automatically installed, removing ubuntu-desktop would mean removing them all as soon as an apt-get autoremove is issued
[09:31] <EagleS675> will please someone help me on my problem ? :\
[09:31] <LjL> nolimitsoya, the only real way to fix this would be to have "real" metapackages, i.e. distinguish metapackages from "normal" packages in some way. currently, metapackages like ubuntu-desktop are just normal packages that 1) are empty and 2) have lots of dependencies
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> LjL, im not quarreling with the chioce of not manking everything under ubuntu-desktop autoremovable, i just want to force it to uninstall :)
[09:32] <LjL> nolimitsoya, well, you can't. you can be clever and remove some packages that will wipe out of a lot of stuff that depends on them -- like for isntance libgnome
[09:32] <boybach> nlgke: as soon as I log into the machine.
=== recon is now known as recon0
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> LjL, or is there some intelligent way of using the alternate install cd todo a package by package install?
[09:33] <rambo3> what to do when rm -rf is not working with root
[09:33] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, you can install with "server" option or ubuntu-server
[09:33] <nolimitsoya> rambo3, cry, long and hard :P
[09:33] <phos> hi, wondering about my wireless card
[09:33] <LjL> nolimitsoya, i'm not sure, since i haven't used the alternate cd since breezy (when it wasn't alternate anyway), but that might be. or the server cd for that matter.
[09:33] <phos> belkin usb
[09:33] <nolimitsoya> jStefan, and this is parsed at boot from the alternate install?
[09:33] <nolimitsoya> :)
[09:33] <phos> its being recognised by the system
[09:34] <phos> but is loading 2 interfaces from it
[09:34] <phos> wmaster0
[09:34] <phos> and wlan0
[09:34] <LjL> nolimitsoya, or just somehow get a list of everything that a fresh ubuntu has installed, and mark them as autoremovables
[09:34] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, i dont remember the exact process
[09:34] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: you can use 'debfoster' to remove everything which ubuntu-server doesn't depend upon
[09:34] <phos> which is causing problems when i try to ndis wrap the drivers
[09:34] <phos> any ideas?
[09:34] <filipescrooff> isso mesmo cara...
[09:34] <Homer_Linux> hiya ppl upgrades to edgy and lost the disk management from system>adminstation and idea ppl
[09:34] <nolimitsoya> jStefan, ok, thank you anyway :)
[09:34] <filipescrooff> alguem a fala portugues?
[09:34] <nolimitsoya> dooglus, how would i do that?
[09:34] <EagleS675> I have firewall firestarter how the heck can I do this : outbound from 1 to 5000 (port) to open that ports
[09:35] <jStefan> dooglus, ubuntu-server does not have a meta-packages like the other distributions, afaik
[09:35] <LjL> nolimitsoya: oh, yes, that's an idea as well. debfoster works by asking you which packages you want to *keep* -- so if you tell it that the only package you want is, say, ubuntu-minimal, it should remove anything that's not depended upon by it
[09:35] <JoeMama> hello, does anyone have camfrog running like it should inside ubuntu (vmware, wine ?? )
[09:35] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: install debfoster, install ubuntu-server, run debfoster.  it'll ask you a bunch of questions.  answer 'y' about keeping ubuntu-server and 'p' (for purge) for everything else
[09:35] <nolimitsoya> jStefan, this could be done with ubuntu-minimal, so thats no problem :)
[09:35] <quintin> where is grub.conf ???
[09:36] <d-snp> Skyrail: what do you mean? mines messed up yeah :P
[09:36] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, it would be something like that, but beware of missing other important packages
[09:36] <LjL> !pt | filipescrooff
[09:36] <ubotu> filipescrooff: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[09:36] <livingdaylight> quintin: /boot/grub
[09:36] <nolimitsoya> dooglus, thank you! :D illplay around in vmware a bit first, i think :)
[09:36] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, ubuntu-minimal does not include the kernels
[09:36] <dave> Hey I have a question regarding the install process:  I am looking to install ubuntu on my server.  So I have 3 SCSI drives connected and have made /dev/sda1 my /boot partition.../dev/sda2 my swap.  Now the /dev/sda3 and sdb and sdc I want to have LVM control.  I have the alternative install CD.  How do i go aout this?
[09:36] <nolimitsoya> jStefan, but ubuntu-standard should?
[09:36] <joevandyk> how does twinview differ from xinerama?
[09:36] <joevandyk> and do I care if i want to rotate my monitors?
[09:36] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, don't know, i think not
[09:36] <linopil> irc.freenone.net and irc.ubuntu.com are one ?
[09:37] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, just be cautious
[09:37] <super> fala filipe!!!!!
[09:37] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: it seems there's no package called 'ubuntu-server' - but ubuntu-{minimal,standard,whatever} should do the trick
[09:37] <quintin> livingdaylight: no it's not.  where do I put kernel options to change ramdisk size at?
[09:37] <phos> any idea why i have 2 wireless interfaces from the same card, wmaster0 and wlan0
[09:37] <phos> ?
[09:37] <nolimitsoya> dooglus, i thought the same, but if they dont include the kernel thats a showstopper :/
[09:37] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: you don't need to be too cautious.  if you mess it up you can always boot from a live cd and reinstall ubuntu-desktop
[09:37] <jStefan> nolimitsoya, might be easier to read about the "server" option of the alternate CD
[09:38] <dooglus> nolimitsoya: debfoster will present you with a list of the stuff it wants to remove before it does anything.  you have to confirm that it's OK to remove it all.
[09:38] <dooglus> !info debfoster edgy
[09:38] <ubotu> debfoster: Install only wanted Debian packages. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6-2 (edgy), package size 35 kB, installed size 212 kB
[09:38] <nolimitsoya> dooglus, vmware is my friend, but it would eat up a lot of time, and this needs to be done by tomorrow. its already 21:30 here :)
[09:38] <dob1> someone have some experience with a network card mcp61 nvidia?
[09:38] <LjL> nolimitsoya, actually, doing an "apt-get rdepends linux" (and the various kernel image packages) seems to show that *nothing* depends on linux
[09:38] <LjL> i mean apt-cache
[09:39] <nolimitsoya> LjL, that seems a strange choice to me...
[09:39] <dooglus> LjL: I don't even have the 'linux' package installed, so it seems that nothing (much) does depend on it
[09:39] <jStefan> LjL, same can be proven by deborphan, which will show the kernels on the top of the food chain
[09:39] <joereth> can a newb get help for ubuntu 6.10 here?
[09:39] <strafe> hey
[09:39] <Tonren> Hey guys, running gksu "update-manager -c" doesn't show a 6.06 -> 6.10 update option.
[09:39] <LjL> dooglus, but i checked against more specific packages such as linux-image-generic and linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic as well
[09:39] <Tonren> How do I upgraded distro?
[09:39] <zyclop> joereth, just ask
[09:40] <joereth> ok
[09:40] <strafe> how do i access sites like singingfool.com
[09:40] <zyclop> Tonren, apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:40] <erUSUL> !limewire
[09:40] <ubotu> limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[09:40] <LjL> nolimitsoya, well, yeah, though you can probably just keep that one in mind and keep linux as a manually installed package
[09:40] <jStefan> Tonren, make sure you have an updated 6.06 so that you have the latest version of update-manager
[09:40] <zyclop> Tonren, twice
[09:41] <joereth> i have a dell d620 and everything works well so far except my video resolution is not correct It only lists 1024 X 768 I have NO idea where toeven start as far as drivers and whatnot.
[09:41] <LjL> nolimitsoya, what are you trying to accomplish anyway? if you want a server, perhaps it'd be easier to just reinstall using the server edition
[09:41] <macchiea> lets say I am deploying Ubuntu to a 100 machines. How would I install the same set of programs on all of them with minimal effort?
[09:41] <ippa> nolimitsoya: seems like some ppl have solved it with the alternative CD yes.. but that's only in slow vesa mode (for others, that didn't work either) .. while it might be the way forward right now, do you have any oppinoun on how long a Critical ubuntubug takes to fix?
[09:41] <nolimitsoya> LjL, a stripped down custom live cd
[09:41] <Tonren> jStefan: zyclop: The only thing keeping me from being 100% up-to-date is that Cafuego's bcm43xx won't install (I get a "size mismatch" error)
[09:41] <Tonren> Other than that I'm up to date, but it's not upgrading.
[09:42] <jStefan> macchiea, cloning the drive seems like a good option
[09:42] <nolimitsoya> ippa, that depends on how seious it is, but critical bugs are given a lot of manpower...
[09:42] <recon0> I'm trying to run the command "openssl s_client -starttls smtp -CApath /usr/lib/ssl/certs/ -connect smtp.gmail.com:25" to test my mail (I'm trying to set up postfix/fetchmail with gmail) but I get error "CONNECTED(00000003) \n 7130:error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol:s23_clnt.c:567:".
[09:42] <zyclop> joereth, where does it list the resolutions?
[09:42] <Ikci__> QuakeNet
[09:42] <ippa> nolimitsoya: right, it has been marked Critical.. so we're talking about maybe some days -> 1 week here?
[09:43] <nolimitsoya> ippa, as i said, that depends on how hard it is to fix...
[09:43] <ippa> mm
[09:43] <jStefan> !version | Tonren try this
[09:43] <ubotu> Tonren try this: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[09:43] <Le_Croat0Curde> y a t il des codeur asm sous linux ?
[09:43] <cafuego> Tonren: Yeah, working on it. Just downlaod manually and use 'dpkg -i' on it.
[09:43] <joereth> system>preferences>screen resolution
[09:43] <strafe> anyone know?
[09:43] <LjL> nolimitsoya, never made one, but i suppose in that case you'd want to make your own "nolimitsoya-desktop" metapackage
[09:43] <VigoFuse> On install of 6.alt will I get the partion option then?
[09:43] <Le_Croat0Curde> hi
[09:43] <zyclop> joereth, where you asked to enter your password?
[09:43] <Le_Croat0Curde> NASM LINUX ?
[09:43] <joereth> no
[09:43] <LjL> !fr | Le_Croat0Curde
[09:43] <ubotu> Le_Croat0Curde: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[09:43] <nolimitsoya> LjL, or just install all the packages i want manualy, but that requires i get rid of all the stuff i _dont_ want first...
[09:43] <Tonren> jStefan: Uh... I have Dapper, dude.
[09:44] <tecta> what kernel is stable on ubuntu?
[09:44] <atla> hi
[09:44] <atla> does someone know when SDL_Net 1.2.6 will make it into ubuntu?
[09:44] <Tonren> cafuego: How do I tell apt to stop worrying about it?
[09:44] <zyclop> joereth, is there a button for administrator mode or something like that?
[09:44] <jStefan> Tonren, you have dapper-security and dapper-updates in your sources.list, correct?
[09:44] <joereth> Zyclop let me check real quick
[09:44] <Tonren> jStefan: Yep.
[09:44] <nolimitsoya> LjL, are ubuntu and debian enough alike that i could just use an ubuntu sources.list for debian netinstall?
[09:44] <LjL> nolimitsoya, i do think that debfoster is your friend there.
[09:45] <LjL> nolimitsoya, ugh, i wouldn't think
[09:45] <aSt3raL> are there any known issues with edgy and amd64 turion cpus?
[09:45] <joereth> Zyclop no there isn't
[09:45] <nolimitsoya> ok...
[09:45] <sidewalk> im having problem with  in default ubuntu-installation
[09:45] <sidewalk> how do i get this working?
[09:45] <Tonren> cafuego: By the way... I'm not sure if you're aware of this already, or if you care, but I have noticed that ndiswrapper is MUCH more sensitive to access points.  Often, bcm43xx will detect them but not be able to connect.  If I switch to ndiswrapper, I can connect to them.
[09:45] <tecta> why doesn't ubuntu have many packages in the repository?
[09:45] <nolimitsoya> sidewalk, dpkg-reconfigure xserver.xorg
[09:45] <LjL> !packages | tecta
[09:45] <ubotu> tecta: You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[09:45] <mirak> is there hotplug in ubuntu ?
[09:45] <LjL> sidewalk, in KDE i have a "keyboard layout" control panel applet. i'm sure Gnome has the same
[09:46] <nolimitsoya> sidewalk, choose 105key keyboard and swedish layout
[09:46] <sidewalk> nolimitsoya: its only when i use the terminal window
[09:46] <sidewalk> and connect to my shell, that it doesnt work
[09:46] <zyclop> joereth, okay, then i have no idea what to do
[09:46] <sidewalk> with my IRC-client of the shell
[09:46] <tecta> LjL, well so much stuff comes up for kernel
[09:46] <ippa> sidewalk: spec sidewalk :)
[09:46] <sidewalk> spec ippa :P
[09:46] <joereth> LOL ok thanks
[09:46] <Spec> moo?
[09:46] <Tonren> jStefan: I was going to install manually, but apt-get update exploded when I did an s/dapper/edgy/.
[09:46] <VigoFuse> Thank you kindly
[09:46] <zyclop> joereth, except manually editing xorg.conf
[09:47] <ippa> spec glassbilen.net!
[09:47] <joereth> hmmmm
[09:47] <jStefan> Tonren, i think you should try to fix apt before anything else
[09:47] <aSt3raL> are there any known amd64 edgy installer issues?
[09:47] <joereth> sounds a little scary
[09:47] <LjL> tecta, hm, the keymap for console is asked during installation... of hands i don't remember how it's set afterwards
[09:47] <veleno> hello everyone. i'm running edgy eft, and i can't get my usb logitech mx518 mouse working correctly. anyone here ?
[09:47] <joereth> maybe I should stick with my old familiar windows xp for a while longer
[09:47] <Tonren> jStefan: Apt isn't broken...
[09:47] <mirak> !ubuto blacklist
[09:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuto blacklist - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:47] <joereth> familiar reality
[09:47] <jStefan> Tonren, "exploded?"
[09:47] <mirak> how do I blacklit a module ?
[09:47] <Tonren> jStefan: It only breaks when I do an s/dapper/edgy/.
[09:48] <zyclop> joereth, hey, dont give up so easily
[09:48] <Samus_Aran> veleno: is the light on the bottom of the mouse on ?
[09:48] <jStefan> Tonren, what is the error?
[09:48] <mirak> are there only newbies in this channel ?
[09:48] <joereth> well I am just frustrated cause I have no idea where to even start
[09:48] <freshmouse> Can you help me with a LITTLE problem in GNOME? ... I don't know why, but in Nautilus are emblems of symlinks showed so big. I don't know where I could edit it. I tried to use GConf, but I was lost: so many items... Can you help me?
[09:48] <freshmouse> Thx.
[09:48] <zyclop> joereth, there are other people with more clue than me in here. ask one of them
[09:48] <veleno> Samus_Aran, sorry, i should have been more precise. i can't get my mouse wheel working!
[09:48] <strafe> how do i access sites like singingfool.com?
[09:48] <aSt3raL> is there a place to find info about amd64 installation problems?
[09:48] <aSt3raL> specifically hanging on install
[09:49] <freshmouse>  http://freshmouse.ic.cz/screenshot.jpg -- on this screenshot you can see the problem.
[09:49] <Samus_Aran> veleno: ah.  "sudo kate /etc/X11/xorg.conf", scroll down to the input device section for your mouse
[09:49] <Samus_Aran> veleno: and add this to it: Option      "ZAxisMapping"  "4 5"
[09:49] <Tonren> jStefan: reproducing the error....
[09:49] <dio> Please help! How open subtitles in Totem?
[09:49] <bRutEado> Hi! I have a cd with the KUBUNTU LINUX 6.06 but it don't start because my computer is old and don't function with the boot. Because of that now i made a dislette that start the boot menu. When i choice the cd rom it give me a error
[09:49] <mabus_> how can I get my asr-2110s raid controller to work with ubuntu?
=== sidewalk is now known as sidewlk
[09:50] <Samus_Aran> veleno: if you have a seven button mouse and want to use the second other wheel, you will need a different line
[09:50] <phos> any ideas why im getting 2 wireless interfaces from the same card?
=== mmahan_ is now known as MitchM
[09:50] <joereth> i need some help with a video resolution/driver problem
=== sidewlk is now known as sidewalk`
[09:50] <epp> phos, maybe somethings wrong?
[09:50] <joereth> i have a dell d620 and everything works well so far except my video resolution is not correct It only lists 1024 X 768 I have NO idea where toeven start as far as drivers and whatnot.
[09:50] <Samus_Aran> veleno: the "z axis mapping" tells X which "buttons" on the mouse you want to use for scrolling windows, that being buttons 4 and 5 (buttons 1-3 are left/middle/right)
[09:51] <jStefan> !ifixres | joereth
[09:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ifixres - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:51] <jStefan> !fixres | joereth
[09:51] <ubotu> joereth: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[09:51] <epp> joereth, what is your chipset?
[09:51] <phos> epp; i put the wireless card (belkin usb) in and i get two interfaces
[09:51] <knix> joereth: 915resolution
[09:51] <phos> wmaster0 and wlan0
[09:51] <joereth> thankx
[09:51] <epp> phos, does it work?
[09:51] <joereth>  i'll try these things
[09:51] <phos> no
[09:51] <Tobberoth> My ubuntu freezes constantly :(
[09:51] <veleno> Samus_Aran, this is what i have at the moment in the relevant portion of xorg.cofn http://rafb.net/paste/results/ukfd5u16.html
[09:52] <joereth> but i am a total new so bear with me
[09:52] <phos> because ndiswrapper only wraps the drivers for wlan0
[09:52] <epp> phos, did you try the ubuntu forums?
[09:52] <Samus_Aran> veleno: if you don't have kate installed, just replace that with some other text editor you like to use.  you need to run it with "sudo" so that you are the root user who can save it in /etc/X11
[09:52] <phos> ive searched
[09:52] <veleno> Samus_Aran, yes.
[09:52] <freshmouse> Nobody knows?
[09:52] <Samus_Aran> veleno: just add it after that
[09:52] <Samus_Aran> veleno: you may also need to specify the number of buttons your mouse has, if X can't detect that properly
[09:53] <jStefan> freshmouse, try a different theme?
[09:53] <Samus_Aran> veleno: e.g. Option      "Buttons"       "5"
[09:53] <bRutEado> Hi! I have a cd with the KUBUNTU LINUX 6.06 but it don't start because my computer is old and don't function with the boot. Because of that now i made a dislette that start the boot menu. When i choice the cd rom it give me a error
[09:53] <lunaphyte_> grrr.  why does /etc/init.d/apache force-reload take so long sometimes?
[09:53] <lunaphyte_> s/apache/apach2/
[09:54] <FuriousRage> can i install the ubuntu cd 6.06 LTS as "server only" and not boot into the desktop on cd-boot? (only got a TNT2 32mb graphics card)
[09:54] <freshmouse> jStefan: I think it doesn't depend on the theme. I tried official GNOME icon set, but it didn't help me.
[09:54] <Samus_Aran> does anyone know how I can modify the dependancies of a .deb file I have ?  or how would I go about unpacking it for the sake of modifying the depend section and repacking it ?
[09:54] <Tonren> jStefan: It worked this time.
[09:54] <veleno> Samus_Aran, i added the zaxis option. do i need to reboot ?
[09:54] <jStefan> Tonren, update-manager is still preferred
[09:54] <Tonren> jStefan: But it doesn't work.
[09:55] <Samus_Aran> veleno: no, but you need to restart the X server.  log out of your desktop, and once you're in the display manager (the login screen) press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill it and reload it
[09:55] <Tonren> jStefan: Running gksu "update-manager -c" doesn't show an Edgy upgrade option.
[09:55] <glatzor> Tonren: Click on "check"
[09:55] <Samus_Aran> veleno: you can test it first, if you want
[09:55] <mamzers555> freshmouse; i think it is the theme that is the problem
[09:55] <Samus_Aran> veleno: by loading a second X server, just in case you typoed something and X won't load
[09:55] <mamzers555> try another and see if the problem still exist
[09:55] <veleno> Samus_Aran, ...how ? :-(
[09:56] <mew}{awmn> hello world!
[09:56] <freshmouse> Is here somebody who use the Tango icon set?
[09:56] <The_Machine> i'm experiencing a problem where my inbound vnc password seems to not work unless i go in and confim it before i leave for the night
[09:56] <Samus_Aran> veleno: "X :1" without the quotes, and then if it loads fine, use Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill it off
[09:56] <The_Machine> the server will be running, but it wont take the passwd
[09:57] <Samus_Aran> veleno: you will have a plain screen with a big X mouse cursor if it works
[09:57] <The_Machine> but if i type it in before I leave for the night, i can get in later
[09:57] <The_Machine> any ideas?
[09:57] <freshmouse> mamzers555: No. If I use Human icon theme, the problem is still here.
[09:57] <veleno> Samus_Aran, X: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting.
[09:57] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: what do you mean by "confirm it" ?
[09:58] <Samus_Aran> veleno: hm.  well then put sudo in front of it =)  "sudo X :1"
[09:58] <mamzers555> freshmouse; then i have no idea, sry
[09:58] <Tonren> jStefan: glatzor: ... that worked this time, too.
[09:58] <Samus_Aran> I thought all users could run the X server, as it was that way on my previous distros
[09:58] <Tonren> I feel like there's an "if" statement buried deep within Ubuntu's source code that makes things break unless you're in #ubuntu.  XD
[09:59] <The_Machine> go to System>Preferences>remote desktop
[09:59] <Samus_Aran> Tonren: heh
[09:59] <The_Machine> and type it in again
[09:59] <jStefan> Tonren, i suggest using update-manager then
[09:59] <veleno> Samus_Aran, k, X does starts..but since there's no window there, i can't scroll
[09:59] <cafuego> Tonren: omg. Now we'll have to kill you.
[09:59] <Tonren> cafuego: The Ubuntulluminati!
[09:59] <glatzor> Tonren: update-manager does a lot of checks to ensure that the upgrade will work
[09:59] <Samus_Aran> veleno: I just wanted to make sure you didn't do a typo which would prevent X from reloading once you restart it
[09:59] <cafuego> TINC
[09:59] <Tonren> So, Edgy uses AIGLX, right?  I have an ATI card.  Does that mean I'm screwed?
[09:59] <mabus_> how can I get my asr-2110s raid controller to work with ubuntu?
[09:59] <Samus_Aran> veleno: as you might not be comfortable reconfiguring X from the console
[10:00] <glatzor> Tonren: The AIglx extension is on by default but there is no app that makes use of it :)
[10:00] <veleno> Samus_Aran, i've no problem to configure it via console, Vim is my friend :)
[10:00] <Tonren> glatzor: Cool.
[10:00] <glatzor> Tonren: so don't worry :)
[10:00] <Samus_Aran> veleno: anyhow, log out of your desktop and Ctrl+Alt+Backspace the login manager, and all should be well
[10:00] <Samus_Aran> veleno: ah okay =)
[10:00] <Samus_Aran> veleno: I use Vim as well
[10:00] <Tonren> Is Edgy totally awesome?
[10:00] <veleno> Samus_Aran, k, thanks, hope to have it fixed!
[10:01] <The_Machine> Tonren: i'm liking it
[10:01] <glatzor> Tonren: If you don't have any problems using dapper or don't need the latest version of your apps, you could also stay with dapper :)
[10:01] <The_Machine> samus - did you see what i typed?
[10:01] <Tonren> The_Machine: What kind of big differences are there?
[10:01] <mirak> what is the file type of INITRD ?
[10:01] <mirak> image
[10:01] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: apparently not
[10:01] <Tonren> glatzor: Nah, I may as well stay up to date.
[10:01] <The_Machine> go to System>Preferences>remote desktop
[10:01] <Skyrail> I'm kinda lost with the ATi driver installing...I just want to enable two screens...
[10:01] <The_Machine> and typing it in again
[10:01] <The_Machine> that's what i mean by "confirm" password
[10:01] <glatzor> Tonren: you can read the release notes in update-manager :)
[10:01] <The_Machine> make sure it's liek..  IN there
[10:02] <The_Machine> tonren - upgrade of gnome, firefox 2..  um..  i like the splash screen..
[10:02] <The_Machine> i'm new to linux so i'm just liking everything right now
[10:02] <The_Machine> :)
[10:02] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: VNC doesn't have a "System>Preferences>remote desktop".  that sounds like Microsoft's RDP (remote desktop protocol)
[10:02] <Tonren> Skyrail: Use "aticontrol".  It's in Applications -> Accessories.  I think installing ATI's proprietary thingummy will do it.
[10:02] <Tonren> The_Machine: Ah.  I was wondering why Firefox didn't update automatically (I downloaded it manually).
[10:02] <Samus_Aran> VNC passwords are created with the "vncpasswd" command
[10:02] <cntb> where is the vnc client
[10:03] <Tonren> Is the new GNOME faster?  (not that GNOME is horribly slow)
[10:03] <joeljkp> is there a way to reference a samba share on the command line?  like "cp \\share\file ."?
[10:03] <glatzor> Tonren: yes. and it consumes less memory
[10:03] <Tonren> cntb: You can use "vncviewer" on the command line
[10:03] <zcat[1] > seveas here?
[10:03] <cntb> k
[10:03] <The_Machine> it's pretty darn fast.
[10:03] <cntb> ty
[10:03] <Tonren> joeljkp: There is a draconian command-line interface for using SMB, but I haven' tbeen able to figure it out myself
[10:03] <joeljkp> tonren: hmm, so the only way is to mount the share as a directory?
[10:03] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: Samba has a few command line clients for copying files
[10:03] <The_Machine> Samus_Aran: no, it does.  To get to remote desktop in gnome in ubuntu, you can go to System > Preferences > remote desktop
[10:03] <The_Machine> try it!! :)
[10:03] <The_Machine> hehe
[10:03] <Tonren> CRAP!  Not enough disk space on my root partition.
[10:04] <zcat[1] > Tonren: there's one in windows too.. nobody uses that either :)
[10:04] <Lattyware> !UUID
[10:04] <ubotu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid"
[10:04] <The_Machine> it starts up a VNC server
[10:04] <The_Machine> :D
[10:04] <Seveas> zcat[1] , yes
[10:04] <cntb> also Apps internet> terminal Services>protocol vnc
[10:04] <The_Machine> SMB is a pita for me :(
[10:04] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: you can additionally install LUFS, which is Linux Userland Filesystems, and one of the modules it provides allows you to dynamically browse the Microsoft Network
=== freach` is now known as freach`awy
[10:04] <zcat[1] > Seveas: just wondering if you'd consider packaging google earth.. or are there redistribution restrictions?
[10:04] <joeljkp> samus_aran: hmm, cool, that in synaptic?
[10:04] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: e.g. you can add /mnt/samba
[10:05] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: I'm not sure if it's available prebuilt on Ubuntu or not, I can grab you their web site if you like
[10:05] <Tonren> Weird... guys, I have 1.21 GB free on my root partition.  Why would it tell me I don't have enough space?
[10:05] <Seveas> zcat[1] , there are but I'm working on a packages that uses the installer
[10:05] <gean_> i need the t1lib, can i install it through synaptic, or need to download the .deb-file and perform a local install ... ?!
[10:05] <zcat[1] > cool!
[10:05] <Tonren> /dev/hda1 is windows and /dev/hda3 is Linux.  Could it be looking at /dev/hda1, which is full?
[10:05] <Skyrail> anyone know how to add a second screen? and able to go above the 1024/768 resoluction
[10:05] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: http://lufs.sourceforge.net/lufs/fs.html  << that's the list of filesystem modules it can create virtual filesystems for
[10:06] <The_Machine> or how about "Why does my VNC stop working nightly"
[10:06] <The_Machine> however you want to phrase it
[10:06] <The_Machine> it's like the password becomes invalidated after an evening of working just fine
[10:06] <joeljkp> samus_aran: yeah, but there's smbmount that does the same thing
[10:06] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: that just mounts a single share, it is not a dynamic network browser
[10:07] <mirak> how can I mount an initrd ?
[10:07] <gean_> skyrail: panels->configure, add workspaces as many as u want (say 8); then xorg-reconfigure gives the chance (older ubuntu on an other laptop of mine) to choose more resol's
[10:07] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: hm, apparently it doesn't directly support Samba, but it can use Gnome's virtual filesystem modules.  hm
[10:07] <Samus_Aran> hm hm.
[10:07] <Samus_Aran> I thought it had SMBFS
[10:07] <joeljkp> samus_aran: ah, i see
[10:07] <mikeconcepts> what is one highly recommended imaging program for Ubuntu? I would like to do imaging while running if possible.
[10:07] <vertana> GIMP
[10:08] <zcat[1] > imaging like ghost? partimage perhaps?
[10:08] <Samus_Aran> joeljkp: virtual filesystems can do neat things.  like SSH, FTP, even P2P filesharing networks like Gnutella, so that listing a directory is actually doing a search, etc.
[10:08] <zcat[1] > I don't think anything can or should image a mounted filesystem though...
[10:08] <Tonren> glatzor: It says it's going to remove a whole bunch of xserver packages.  Is that bad?
[10:09] <[SUDO] Tux> i need help running savage
[10:09] <glatzor> No. The package names have been changed
[10:09] <mikeconcepts> zcat[1] , wanting something that works well with Linux and also prefer imaging in the background
[10:09] <Tonren> glatzor: Ah, ok.  Also, it says I'm making a download of about 1 gigabyte.  Do I get any of that space back once it's done?
[10:09] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: I had that game, heh.  played it for quite a while
[10:09] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: what problem are you having ?
[10:09] <[SUDO] Tux> samus was it fun?
[10:09] <The_Machine> ET for atari?
[10:10] <glatzor> Tonren: please give me feedback how the upgrade ended
[10:10] <z0id> what's a good tool to create graph? i have some data from strace and some data from cpu and mem usage and i want to graph how different system calls affect cpu and mem usage
[10:10] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran one sec
[10:10] <jStefan> Tonren, get back to us, before restarting
[10:10] <Tonren> glatzor: Well, it'll probably take 3 or 4 hours.
[10:10] <zcat[1] > imaging to another system over the network? rsync ..
[10:10] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran i downloaded it...
[10:10] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran and installed it...
[10:10] <mikeconcepts> zcat[1] , ghost for linux I've not tried yet
[10:10] <glatzor> Tonren: the package chache will be reduced to 500 mb every  day by a cron job
[10:10] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran and when i sudo sh it
[10:10] <Tonren> glatzor: Whew.
[10:10] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran i get this:
[10:10] <Tonren> Well, here goes nothing!

[10:11] <glatzor> Tonren: you can run "sudo apt-get clean" to remove all packages from the cache
[10:11] <bRutEado> How do i run KUBUNTU LINUX 6.06 from a cd? It never start when i start the computer. What can i do?
[10:11] <[SUDO] Tux> ok one sec
[10:11] <zcat[1] > depends what you mean by imaging.. if you just want to mirror all your files I'd use rsync. Of you want an image youcan dump back to a drive and bootfrom, partimage, but you can't image a running filesystem because what's on the disk at any running moment isn't a clean filesystem..
[10:11] <jStefan> Tonren, or autocloean to remove only old pkgs
[10:12] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: anyway, the important piece of information above is that it is missing "libtiff.so.3"
[10:12] <mikeconcepts> zcat[1] , will look into rsync
[10:12] <mamzers555> bRutEado; change the boot-sequence in your bios
[10:12] <vertana> Glatzor: go into the bios and select "boot from cd (or IDE CD)"
[10:12] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran which means?
[10:12] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: what does "locate libtiff.so" show you ?
[10:12] <[SUDO] Tux> /usr/lib/libtiff.so.4
[10:12] <[SUDO] Tux> /usr/lib/libtiff.so.4.1.4
[10:12] <vertana> Sorry meant for bRutE
[10:12] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: it is a missing library file.  shared libraries are like DLL files on Windows
[10:12] <bRutEado> mamzers555 the problem is that my computer is a little old and don't have that option on the bios
[10:13] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran which means...?
[10:13] <gean_> i need the t1lib, can i install it through synaptic, or need to download the .deb-file and perform a local install ... ?!
[10:13] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: okay, so you have a newer version of libtiff than Savage is looking for.  you can solve it by either installing a copy of the old library, or you can try linking the new one to the old number, and it will probably work fine
[10:13] <jStefan> bRutEado, how old are we talking about here
[10:13] <vertana> gean: if you search Synaptic and it's not there... then try google.
[10:13] <vertana> Come on now... I know you think a little more than that.
[10:14] <mamzers555> bRutEado; are you sure, how did you installed a operating-system then? this wouldn't be possible then if you couldn't boot from cd

[10:14] <gopss> you tell me
[10:14] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran how do i do this?
[10:14] <bRutEado> jStefan about 4 years
[10:14] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran i am a noob on linux

[10:14] <jStefan> bRutEado, a 4 yeard old PC can boot from CD
[10:14] <jStefan> year*
[10:15] <vertana> Seeker: typically you do not need to defrag Ubuntu... ext3 filesystem beats the hell outta NTFS :D
[10:15] <[SUDO] Tux> bruteado: sudo sh "FILE"
[10:15] <Marcus> hello there
[10:15] <Samus_Aran> [SUDO] Tux: copy and paste this command, and put in your password when it asks you: sudo ln -s libtiff.so.4 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.3; sudo ldconfig
[10:15] <bRutEado> and how do i find that optino in the boot menu?
[10:15] <Samus_Aran> patrick_king: "./file.sh" or if it is not executable "bash file.sh" or "sh file.sh"
[10:15] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran ok...
[10:15] <vertana> Seeker: Try disabling some services.  You might also want to invest in a firewall if you do not have one.
[10:15] <jStefan> bRutEado, do you know what bios you have?
[10:16] <Samus_Aran> patrick_king: and put sudo in front of it, if it needs to be installed as root user
[10:16] <Alex> @t
[10:16] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran ok...
[10:16] <[SUDO] Tux> samus_aran ok, now what?

[10:18] <joevandyk> I have 'Option "RandRRotation" "on"' in my xorg.conf file (using nvidia and xinerama), and the log file says that RandR is loaded, but when I run xrandr, it says the extension "RANDR" is missing on the display.
[10:18] <mabus_> I can't install ubuntu on my asr-2100s raid controller... it will install it fine, but it won't boot into it... gparted will also recognize the drives
[10:18] <patrick_king> it says it isnt but i can see it on my desktop
[10:18] <[SUDO] Tux> THANKS!
[10:19] <Cale> about half the time when hitting refresh in a Windows Network (samba) window in Nautilus, the icons show up as the blank page icon and don't work. By refreshing repeatedly, I'll get the icon that I'm supposed to, but this is annoying.
[10:19] <bRutEado> [jStefan] : I know. But when i try to put the cd with this linux version it doesn's work
[10:19] <Samus_Aran> joevandyk: are you using the "nv" or "nvidia" Xorg driver ?
[10:19] <Cale> (In Edgy)
[10:19] <seeker1> all of a sudden Dapper is running slowly on my system.  Things load very slowly, and my mouse moves slowly on screen!  What can be wrong?  Do I need to defrag the hard drive or something else?
[10:19] <bRutEado> [jStefan] : now i'm trying to find a solution
[10:20] <tich> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30093/
[10:20] <zcat[1] > seeker1: run 'top' in a terminal.. something might be eating 100% cpu
[10:20] <seeker1> vertana: I have no services running!  and I have a firewall!  nothing has changed on my system, and it was running fast!  but all of a sudden it now runs slowly
[10:20] <freach`> seeker1: don't think its a hdd porblem, sounds like cpu problem
[10:20] <joevandyk> Samus_Aran: the beta nvidia driver
[10:20] <hrach> hallo does anybody knows what is this?  ->> Driver 'sd' needs updating - please use bus_type methods
[10:20] <mamzers555> bRutEado; go into your bios and change the boot-sequence
[10:20] <seeker1> freach`: what can I do?
[10:20] <mamzers555> also you can try to make the cd-rom the master with the jumper
[10:21] <vertana> seeker: did you install anything around the time the slowdown started?
[10:21] <seeker1> when I run TOP, nothing is using CPU 100%
[10:21] <Samus_Aran> joevandyk: and it is in the kernel fine ?  grep nvidia /proc/modules
[10:21] <freach`> seeker1: check with top what's your cpu usage, like zcat[1]  said
[10:21] <zcat[1] > what's the load average?
[10:21] <dirtbag> Hello, I'm new to linux (just installed ubuntu =)6.06) Im currently upgrading to 6.10 using Synaptic. Is that ok or should I do a "fresh" install?
[10:21] <Samus_Aran> joevandyk: have you asked in #NVidia if the new driver has any randr issues ?
[10:21] <seeker1> firefox and xorg is at the TOP of TOP and only using minum CPU
[10:21] <bRutEado> [mamzers555] : i've thinked in do that but i'm not very experienced in this area and i thougth i could have a problem
[10:22] <vertana> I'm using irssi and I need to know the command to make window 2 and window 3 be on the same screen (#ubuntu and #kubuntu) anyone know this command?
[10:22] <seeker1> freach`: any other ideas why all of a sudden my system is running slowly to load things and mouse moves slowly?
[10:22] <Samus_Aran> dirtbag: it is supposed to be fine upgrading overtop of the previous version
[10:22] <freach`> seeker1: maybe a porblem with your ram
[10:22] <Samus_Aran> vertana: splitscreens in irssi are a pain to operate =/
[10:22] <seeker1> freach`: xorg = 7% and firefox = 14%
[10:22] <sd00> Anyone: Is it possible to play music files from an smb:// address ?  (e.g. smb://musicserver/elvis/sometrack.mp3) ?  or must I mount the share first?
[10:22] <vertana> I know... but I like them :P
[10:22] <zcat[1] > seeker1: high load-average (which isn't always CPU) -- running short on ram, or something..
[10:22] <dirtbag> Ok cool
[10:22] <mamzers555> bRutEado; you should try to change boot-sequence in bios first, before change the hardware. all i can tell u is that pc t
[10:23] <seeker1> zcat[1] : what? I doint understand
[10:23] <Jas-Nix> anyone here using amd64 and have network-manager-gnome installed ?
[10:23] <mamzers555> that are 6 years old have this feature of boot-sequence
[10:23] <freach`> seeker1: full ram, so your system have to swap
[10:23] <freach`> seeker1: check your swap
[10:23] <Samus_Aran> vertana: I love splitscreens, and use them very often in GNU Screen and Vim ... but I gave up trying to get them to function in irssi, as the commands were so ugly.  anyhow, their web site has basic instructions for doing it, as well I recommend asking in #irssi (if anyone is awake)
[10:23] <aSt3raL> what package is gnome-network-manger in?
[10:23] <vertana> Thank you ^.^
[10:24] <mikeconcepts> zcat[1] , will look into rsync further, but check this out http://www.falkotimme.com/howtos/systemimager/index.php
[10:24] <variant> Samus_Aran: yeah, it's not logical in irssi
[10:24] <sentinel> hi: I went through "ATI HOWTO BINARY DRIVERS" thrice - still doesn't work, still using mesa. Any Ideas?
[10:24] <zcat[1] > top-right corder of top, the numbers should be below 1 normally.. also take a look at swap...
[10:24] <variant> sentinel: buy a radeon 9250 and use the free software drivers

[10:25] <sparrwork> I installed kubuntu.  I ran OpenGL screensavers very nicely.  I did a package upgrade, and installed a few new things.  Two reboots later I notice my OpenGL screensavers are running software-ishly slow.  glxinfo says "Direct Rendering: no".  Help?

[10:27] <Tonren> variant: Yeah, I'm on the "Fetching & Installing Upgrades" part.
[10:27] <variant> Tonren: so just kill it/ close it whatever
[10:28] <zcat[1] > cntb: well, mplayer, w32codecs and mplayer-firefox-plugin .. something like that
[10:28] <sentinel> variant: I can't even switch to it, can't get away from mesa. that's the point!!
[10:28] <variant> Tonren: then next time you start it will continue
[10:28] <cntb> zcat done that restart smthing>?
[10:28] <variant> sentinel: sorry i never used them so am not the best person to help
[10:28] <Tonren> variant: Oh... so I can just run gksu "update-manager -c" again, anytime, and it will continue?
[10:28] <variant> Tonren: correct
[10:28] <zcat[1] > restart firefox?

[10:39] <ubotu> qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
[10:39] <sd00> I'm assuming its a setup problem on my box!
[10:39] <phillip> qemu vs vmware?
[10:39] <zugu> vmware wins
[10:39] <immrtl> its a .run not .sh

[11:05] <toros> Trent, here: https://shipit.ubuntu.com/
[11:05] <seeker1> freach`: a Intel CPU :)
[11:05] <Chinesefood> oobermick: any ideas?
[11:05] <Firefoxman> I am trieing to convince my schools ITC to swich the school to edubuntu rather than update all 200 pcs to vista
[11:05] <seeker1> freach`: im sure its EDO RAM
[11:05] <juanmedinpineiro> Do you know what is the easiest way to share a dir between a mac and a mac osx machine ? I'm tired of ftp
[11:05] <Firefoxman> Can anybody give me any ideas?
=== juanmedinpineiro is now known as Juan_damnit_Juan
[11:06] <seeker1> freach`: its an older system
[11:06] <Chinesefood> firefoxman: tell them that edubuntu comes bundled with strictly educational software and is free
[11:06] <Ostizzle> I just finished installing Ubuntu Edgy and am having problems.  While I was installing from the LiveCD everything seemed to be working fine.  Once I finished the installation and restarted the login GUI came up and I logged in.  After accepting my user/pass it showed the splash screen and the the little icons of the stuff that was loading.  It starts to play the startup sound but doesn't finish.  Then I just get dropped to a bar

[11:06] <marcin_ant> hi guys - in edgy in my fstab I got two entries for floppy: /dev/   /media/floppy0 and /dev/sdf/  /media/floppy1 while I got only one
[11:06] <Trent__> thanks toros
[11:06] <Malachi> I'm having a problem pinging hostnames to and from Windows machines
[11:06] <g333k_work> Hi, how to install the madwifi driver for ubuntu 6.10 64bits ?
[11:06] <toros> Trent, oh, no, sorry, yo can only order the version 6.06
[11:06] <Firefoxman> well, it comes with IRC, and they are paranoid about it not working with their filter.
[11:06] <Firefoxman> We use Novell now.
[11:06] <claygucci> Malachi, local hostnames?
[11:06] <Malachi> Yes.
[11:06] <toros> don't you have any friend, with fast internet connection?
[11:06] <claygucci> Malachi, can you ping them by IP but not by hostname?
[11:06] <boybach> Chinesefood: is there a free one.
[11:06] <OoberMick> Chinesefood: It's hard to tell.. do you are another linux box (or maybe just a live cd)? If you did then you could check that printing from that worked.
[11:07] <toros> above 384kbps?
[11:07] <Malachi> claygucci: I can. I can't even ping my OWN hostname.
[11:07] <marcin_ant> could someone tell me why I got these duplicate entries?
[11:07] <freach`> freach`: are you sure ??? edo ram ?
[11:07] <toros> b'coz, it is easyer to download it...
[11:07] <claygucci> If you can ping IP's on the local net but not hostnames
[11:07] <claygucci> you need to check your hosts file
[11:07] <freach`> seeker1: are you sure ??? edo ram ?
[11:07] <claygucci> make sure it has ip-to-host references
[11:07] <Malachi> claygucci: I did, and now I can ping them, but they can't ping me.
[11:07] <claygucci> so it knows what "bedroomcomputer" is
[11:07] <claygucci> or whatever
[11:07] <marcin_ant> the same thing is for cdrom /dev/hdb and /dev/sdg.... weird...
[11:08] <Malachi> claygucci: And there's no automatic way to do this, by the way?
[11:08] <claygucci> ok
[11:08] <Chinesefood> oobermick: nope but im convinced that its windows because it can print locally from ubuntu
[11:08] <claygucci> what about the hosts file on those machines?
[11:08] <freach`> seeker1: so you have to use a 486 or pentium I, so I think thats the problem why your ubuntu is damn slow
[11:08] <Firefoxman> well, it comes with IRC, and they are paranoid about it not working with their filter.
[11:08] <Juan_damnit_Juan> No one sharing directories with mac machines ?
[11:08] <claygucci> they need to know who "mycomputer" really is
[11:08] <claygucci> or whatedver
[11:08] <Trent__> Okay, mounting is driving me mad.
[11:08] <freach`> seeker1: try it with better hardware ;)
[11:08] <Trent__> I can't unmount my windoze partition.
[11:08] <Firefoxman> I am running livecd right now.
[11:08] <Malachi> claygucci: I would do that, but I'm wireless, and everytime I reconnect I get reassigned an IP.
[11:08] <claygucci> no automatid way and the hosts file on windows is hidden, lemme check where it lives
[11:08] <Crankymonky> Marcin_ant, /media is the mount point, /dev is...I'm not sure, but I know it's different and you don't need to worry
[11:08] <claygucci> Malachi, you need a static IP address
[11:09] <Firefoxman> help.
[11:09] <claygucci> in windows you can easily set it up, also i think this is what is causinf the problem
[11:09] <Malachi> claygucci: How would I set that in Ubuntu if my /etc/interfaces eth0 is commented out?
[11:09] <OoberMick> Chinesefood: I've never tried printing windows->linux so I don't know. Perhaps you should find a windows irc channel and ask around that
[11:09] <claygucci> I'd just google for ubuntu static ip
[11:09] <Firefoxman> hello?
[11:09] <claygucci> copy it into your interfaces file and change as needed
[11:09] <claygucci> thats what i always do
[11:09] <Trent__> I need help unmounting two NTFS drives!
[11:09] <sidewalk`> i have a freshly installed ubuntu and i cant get Beryl working
[11:09] <sidewalk`> anyone have any tips?
[11:10] <claygucci> on windows you do that through start>control panel>network> then look around
[11:10] <Chinesefood> oobermick: lol windows users wouldnt know...the majority are very simple beings :P
[11:10] <Malachi> claygucci: Yes, but I use Network Manager for my wifi. It comments out the interfaces
[11:10] <marcin_ant> Crankymonky: I don't worry but it's pretty sick that in gnome in 'Computer' I got two entries for floppy and two for cd/dvd
[11:10] <toros> sidewalk, there is a good step-by-step tutorial, somewhere...
[11:10] <claygucci> but you should also create/change your hosts file (nix and windows) to tell the machine what ip is what host
[11:10] <marcin_ant> Crankymonky: while I got single fdd and single dvd in my machine
[11:10] <toros> have you found it?
[11:10] <Lattyware> Anyone know of a good download manager that supports FTP?
[11:10] <Crankymonky> marcin_ant, you mean two entries when you searched?  or it is showing up twice in the list?
[11:10] <secleinteer> lattyware: kftpgrabber ;)
[11:10] <jStefan> marcin_ant, i had 7 floppies once
[11:10] <claygucci> Malachi, ok we are talking abot a linux system now
[11:11] <Malachi> claygucci: Yes, I'm sorry.
[11:11] <Chinesefood> oobermick: thanks anyways man
[11:11] <claygucci> just do it manually
[11:11] <marcin_ant> Crankymonky: two different entries
[11:11] <Firefoxman> can anybody help me.
[11:11] <Lattyware> secleinteer: I love that, an app for everything :P
[11:11] <Trent__> Lattyware, try FireFTP
[11:11] <OoberMick> Chinesefood: I'm sure there must be some clever ones somewhere.
[11:11] <Chinesefood> firefoxman: what do you need help with?
[11:11] <Lattyware> secleinteer: To be picky, and Gnome ones?
[11:11] <OoberMick> Chinesefood: np
[11:11] <Lattyware> Trent__: Cool, I'll take a look
[11:11] <claygucci> you want a pastebin of mine, so you can change it and use it?
[11:11] <secleinteer> lattyware: not sure about that - you might be able to use the ubuntu "connect to server" feature
[11:11] <jStefan> marcin_ant, i just removed all the mount points, and commented related entries on fstab, and let it autodetect again
[11:11] <Firefoxman> Finding good resons convince my school to swich to edub
[11:11] <Malachi> claygucci: I would do it manually, but I move from location to location and the only program I can find to manage different locations is Network Manager
[11:11] <Firefoxman> edubuntu
[11:12] <Malachi> sure.
[11:12] <Crankymonky> firefoxman, you said they are running Novell Network or a Windows Domain?
[11:12] <cntb> what is beryl? ok ok I will google  it !
=== Juan_damnit_Juan is now known as Juan_
[11:12] <claygucci> I see, you mean move as far as from Local network tio local netowkr
[11:12] <marcin_ant> jStefan: well it's propably a kind of solution but it should be considered as bug...
[11:12] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell cntb about beryl

=== jzzat__ is now known as jzzat
[11:12] <toros> beryl is the 3d desktop for linux
[11:12] <Chinesefood> firefoxman: 1. because it comes bundled with educational software free of cost 2. Vista will require a major upgrade on ALL 200 COMPUTERS ...big time dollars

[11:12] <Firefoxman> Crankymonkey: novel
[11:12] <claygucci> i can see this being a problem if say your home network is 192.168.1.1 and the net at school lets say is 192.168.10.1
[11:12] <toros> like compiz
[11:13] <Crankymonky> Firefoxman, are you working on their IT dept. or a student?
[11:13] <Lattyware> beryl also rocks.
[11:13] <Malachi> claygucci: That's exactly how it is.
[11:13] <Firefoxman> Student
[11:13] <dredhammer> hello how do you limit a guest account ?
[11:13] <Chinesefood> firefoxman: which school is this? MIT?

[11:13] <seeker1> freach`: you dont listen well do you? LOL!  I said... Dapper has been running well and rathwer fast!  But all of a sudden yesterday, it began to run slow!  WHY?
[11:13] <K1765> I have a lexmark x1000 series printer, I installed the driver x125 from linuxprinting.org, but its still not printing why?
[11:13] <Firefoxman> Each comp gets their own ip, mine is only assigned to one compy

[11:14] <jkimball4> does anyone know how to get compiz working on intel graphics?
[11:14] <Crankymonky> Firefoxman, I wouldn't bother trying to convince your school, they've already bought plenty of Windows Liscences, and most likely they would have no interest in running linux, their IT dept. most likely can;'t support linux
[11:14] <seeker1> freach`: let me repeat in case you miseed it "again" ;0
[11:14] <Malachi> claygucci: So you have no answer? Oh well. off to do more intense googling.
[11:14] <Firefoxman> 13.
[11:14] <seeker1> freach`: you dont listen well do you? LOL!  I said... Dapper has been running well and rathwer fast!  But all of a sudden yesterday, it began to run slow!  WHY?
[11:14] <Chinesefood> firefoxman: holy shit...

[11:14] <K1765> I have a lexmark x1000 series printer, I installed the driver x125 from linuxprinting.org, but its still not printing why?
[11:15] <seeker1> freach`: any ideas whats happened to cause that?
[11:15] <claygucci> Malachi, i have none for that.  For static machines yes, you just create/update hosts files I(windows and nix)
[11:15] <seeker1> freach`: ok! now that you finally got it!  Any ideas? ;)
[11:15] <claygucci> after of coarse creating a static ip
[11:15] <claygucci> wait

[11:15] <Jas-Nix> can anyone tell me how to find out which package installed a file
[11:15] <freach`> seeker1: no ;)
[11:15] <claygucci> maybe WIFI dynamic and LAN static
[11:15] <toros> is Ubuntu the distro for children? :)
[11:15] <Lukian> My parents use ubuntu :p
[11:15] <claygucci> give that a "whirl"
[11:15] <seeker1> freach`: in all honesty, I been happy, its run rather fast and well!  but yestreday for some reason, it began to run slowly. mouse mocing sloely on screen etc!  ANY ideas?

[11:16] <seeker1> brb
[11:17] <toros> i know...
[11:17] <Chinesefood> :|
[11:17] <Trent__> toros: do not put your own mother through that type of misery
[11:17] <Crankymonky> Trent__, blasphemy!
[11:17] <claygucci> I ask because I seem to remember the interfaces file having multiple reference to multiple adapters
[11:17] <Trent__> toros: it is so noob-unfriendly
[11:17] <toros> but before i moved out, i used to have SUSE with KDE
[11:17] <Firefoxman> Before I used ubuntu, i used fedora, and it is crap compared to this...

[11:18] <toros> and i dont want to leave she alone with Gnome

[11:24] <Chinesefood> ALL: YO MI OUT..LIKLE MORE!
[11:24] <Crankymonky> Bassetts, you could try Xubuntu, but probably a bit heavy.  Vector Linux may be able to work well if you are looking for something rather easy to use
[11:24] <LjL> !caps | Chinesefood
[11:24] <ubotu> Chinesefood: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[11:24] <Firefoxman> Oh well, I have to explain to a Win/Mac user now how to use linux.

[11:24] <toros> join #ubuntu-offtopic
[11:24] <Tobberoth> Since I started installing XGL, Beryl etc my Ubuntu has gotten VERY unstable. Help?
[11:24] <dredhammer> how do i limit a guest account?
[11:24] <Firefoxman> Some of the teachers here do not know how to turn on a projector
[11:24] <Bassetts> Crankmonky, i dont mind, comand line would do so i get experience with it, but ubuntu crashes on install
[11:24] <jStefan> Tobberoth  #ubuntu-xgl
[11:24] <FuelB> why do I come to this channel when i type /join #ubuntu+1 ?
[11:24] <Malachi> claygucci: No :( I'm not one of them.
[11:25] <toros> beryl IS unstable...
[11:25] <Tobberoth> jStefan: I'm there, they don't seem to be able to help me.
[11:25] <ivx> does anyone know how to do virtual hosts on proftpd
[11:25] <LjL> FuelB: because that channel is closed. there is no Ubuntu+1 available yet
[11:25] <toros> maybe you should use compiz
[11:25] <Firefoxman> it is sad.
[11:25] <claygucci> ok, are you using Zmodem or Xmodem to download?
[11:25] <jeffreyb> Is there a way to view AOL videos.. firefox tries to install an activex plugin but can't find one.
[11:25] <Crankymonky> Bassets, did your try with the alternate install disk?  You need 128MB RAM to use live CD install
[11:25] <jStefan> FuelB, because a fwd is in place
[11:25] <claygucci> I prefer zmodem
[11:25] <toros> but Compiz isn't the best example for stability, either...
[11:25] <Bassetts> Crankymonky, thats what I used, just stalls
[11:26] <Crankymonky> Bassetts, Vector Linux is much snappier than Ubuntu as is Puppy Linux
[11:26] <kstc> hi
[11:26] <Tobberoth> The problem is, I'm not running xgl or beryl
[11:26] <toros> maybe you should wait for version 7.04, before using XGL
[11:26] <ivx> ng
[11:26] <Tobberoth> it's still unstable
[11:26] <LjL> !offtopic | Crankymonky
[11:26] <ubotu> Crankymonky: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[11:26] <Bassetts> Crankymonky, ok thanks

[11:26] <FuelB>  I upgraded to edgy and now my keyboard layout is screwed up and all the layouts have disappeared from the kde control center... Are the keyboard layouts in some special package or something?
[11:26] <kstc> i installed ubuntu edgy eft with a x2 3800+ but how can i see if i have a smp kernel?
[11:26] <Honk> Does anyone know of any issues with chipsets VIA P4M800 or VT8251 with Edgy? Am thinking of purchasing motherboard with these bridges
[11:26] <Malachi> claygucci: I'm using Centurytel DSL.
[11:26] <jStefan> Bassetts, sorry not that, google for DSL linux
[11:26] <kenny> how i see how many ram memory my pc is using?
[11:26] <Crankymonky> Bassets, no problem, LjL, sorry for going off-topic:P
[11:26] <LjL> FuelB: no, it's a bug. hold on
[11:26] <Bassetts> ok jStefan, tried that but the video is all messed up on it
[11:27] <toros> have you undo every changes in the files xorg.conf
[11:27] <Firefoxman> .
[11:27] <LjL> FuelB: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/kdebase/+bug/66442 might be it

=== kstc is now known as KSTC
[11:28] <compilerwriter> It appears that my upgrade to Edgy has not helped my palm situation one bit.  Does anyone know a quick, dirty, and reliable way to get my zire 22 to sync?
[11:28] <kaariq> kstc: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[11:28] <kaariq> kstc: if it shows two processors you have smp kernel
[11:29] <ryanakca> why doesn't ctl-alt-numpad+/- work anymore?
[11:29] <KSTC> kaariq, there is only processor 0
[11:30] <KSTC> and how can i activate smp
[11:30] <Crankymonky> ryankca, you mean to move a window from workspace to workspace?
[11:30] <kaariq> kstc: so it seems that you don't have kernel with smp support
[11:30] <FuelB> LjL: it worked for me too
[11:30] <KSTC> why? i installed edgy eft and it didnt asked me if i want to install smp
[11:30] <compilerwriter> grndslm we seem to be in the same boat.  The damned palm devices are not being cooperative.
[11:31] <Honk> This motherboard has an S3 Integrated video chipset. Is that going to screw with an ol' nvidia geforce2 that I want to put in there?
[11:31] <Honk> I suppose I could disable it in the BIOS?
[11:31] <jStefan> Honk, other than that, this is not windows :P
[11:31] <Tobberoth> "You can only run one xsettings manager at a time" is the error I get when I try to run gnome-settings-daemon. Help please
[11:31] <kitche> Honk: well you have to change the default card the slot that the geforce is in but it will work
[11:31] <grndslm> compilerwriter....i've gotten the device node to show up as ttyUSB0 or ttyUSB1 in previous releases....but i can't get it in edgy
[11:32] <kaariq> kstc: you should try to install another kernel image with apt

[11:33] <marcin_ant> in nautilus in 'computer' I got 'local disk' and 'local disk(2)' is there any way to change these names to something like hde1 or hde2?
[11:33] <pkilgore_> Is there a way for me to explicitly remove a directory from the linker config?
[11:33] <mahognyy> Hi, I tried "apt-get install fluxbox" but got "E: Couldn't find package fluxbox"?
[11:33] <vertana> exit
[11:33] <vertana> exit
[11:33] <jStefan> KSTC, edgy's linux-generic kernel has SMP
[11:34] <pkilgore_> vertana, I do that too.
[11:34] <pkilgore_> Haha
[11:34] <skel> mahognyy: that the correct name for the package? apt-cache search fluxbox
[11:34] <kaariq> kstc: if you install same version with it is not necessary to reinstall modules
[11:34] <OoberMick> mahognyy: make so you have universe added to /etc/apt/sources.lst

[11:35] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[11:36] <tannerld> I recently removed xcfe on my ubuntu box and now I have to start gdm and then x from the terminal
[11:36] <jStefan> KSTC, make sure you have linux-generic installed, and it's the option grub is using (ad grub sorts alphabetically by default and i386 will go 1st)
[11:36] <KSTC> kaariq, you mean when i have now 2.11 and when i install 2.11 smp i don t have to reinstall modules?

=== dominik is now known as deko
[11:36] <KSTC> jStefan linux-generic isnt installed
[11:36] <kaariq> kstc: yes

[11:37] <mahognyy> # deb http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe <- this?
[11:37] <mahognyy> OoberMick
[11:37] <NoGodNoMaster> \join #gnome
[11:38] <jStefan> KSTC, in edgy, install pkg "linux"
[11:38] <tannerld> no one knows?
[11:38] <KSTC> how
[11:38] <OoberMick> mahognyy: yep
[11:38] <cntb> where is krusader ?
[11:38] <jStefan> KSTC, sudo apt-get install linux
[11:38] <KSTC> i thought linux-generic
[11:38] <KSTC> and what then?
[11:39] <jStefan> KSTC, restart and select the new kernel
[11:39] <jStefan> KSTC, from the grub list
[11:39] <kaariq> kstc: what is the output of "uname -r" command
[11:39] <tannerld> I recently removed xcfe on my ubuntu box and now I have to start gdm and then x from the terminal; how can I fix this?
[11:39] <CptBrutal> hello everyone. quick question. In terminal when I type "gedit something.txt" it opens gedit and all but the terminal wont take commands, until I close gedit
[11:39] <KSTC> 2.6.17-10-386
[11:39] <xgn> hi
[11:40] <mahognyy> is there an easier editor than vi which is installed by default
[11:40] <strabes> CptBrutal: if you put an & sign after a command it will run it in the background
[11:40] <epsilon_> CptBrutal: type "command &"
[11:40] <cntb> CptBrutal: this is normal
[11:40] <OoberMick> mahognyy: nano
[11:40] <kitche> CptBrutal: you need to gedit something.txt & and it will free that console up so you can keep using it
[11:40] <kaariq> kstc: well than I suggest apt-get install linux-generic
[11:40] <jStefan> KSTC, as expected the -386 kernel does not support SMP
[11:40] <strabes> mahognyy: use nano
[11:40] <xgn> can anyone help me, with ubuntu 6.10 installation in a PC with geforce 6600?
[11:40] <KSTC> and grub automatically refreshes its bootlist?
[11:40] <strabes> mahognyy: like sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:40] <mahognyy> thanks
[11:40] <jStefan> KSTC, "linux" depends on "linux-generic" which depends on image and restricted modules
[11:40] <strabes> !ask > xgn
[11:40] <toros> xgn whats the problem?
[11:40] <KSTC> so only: "apt-get install linux-generic"
[11:41] <kaariq> kstc: i am not sure but it is possible
[11:41] <mahognyy> apt-cache search fluxbox returned nothing
[11:41] <jStefan> KSTC, either, but "linux" would be more correct
[11:41] <KSTC> so "apt-get install linux"?
[11:41] <OoberMick> mahognyy: did you do apt-get update?
[11:41] <strabes> mahognyy: got the correct sources in your sources.list? updated?
[11:41] <CptBrutal> sweet, thanks guys
[11:41] <jStefan> KSTC, sudo...
[11:42] <mahognyy> OoberMick: what command?
[11:42] <KSTC> ok, thanks
[11:42] <kaariq> kstc: and then reboot
[11:42] <OoberMick> mahognyy: sudo apt-get update
[11:42] <KSTC> yes ok
[11:42] <cntb> what graphical manager in KDE ?
[11:42] <Ratzilla> does powernowd come activated with edgy? or do i have to turn it on/
[11:42] <xgn> Why I can't install ubuntu 6.10 in a pc with geforce 6600?
[11:42] <jStefan> KSTC, remember -386 will be sorted before -generic, so 386 will still be default on boot
[11:42] <mahognyy> updating stuff
[11:42] <Ratzilla> xgn: i have nvidia 6600 and it works fine with 6.10
[11:42] <ifrozen> hali
[11:42] <tannerld> no one can help me?
[11:43] <mahognyy> Found!
[11:43] <compilerwriter> curses, oaths, and epithets!!!@!!$%#$%^^##@@@$$#%$$  Why can't I get my palm to talk to edgy?
[11:43] <xgn> Ratzilla did you pass any arguments to kernel on boot the livecd?
[11:43] <Ratzilla> xgn: none
[11:43] <Ratzilla> xgn: what happens when you try installing?
[11:44] <xgn> the screen turns green when entering in X, and resolution changes
[11:44] <KSTC> jStefan, yes thanks. and the old programs will work under the generic kernel?
[11:44] <epsilon_> xgn: i think that has nothing to do with the 6600 (it should install fine with nv drivers, i have 6600GT)
[11:44] <KSTC> or do i have to adjust something?
[11:44] <Ratzilla> xgn: are you sure you have the correct architecture?
[11:45] <xgn> yes
[11:45] <compilerwriter> goes looking for his short sword
[11:45] <TGPO> KSTC, try safe mode graphics
[11:45] <lynnandy> /echo $server
[11:45] <xgn> I cant never use the nv drivers
[11:45] <xgn> always I have to install nvidia official drivers
[11:45] <grndslm> why doesn't the edgy kernel or udev create a device node for my treo 650 when i try to hotsync??
[11:45] <KSTC> TGPO, why?
[11:46] <killown> what the best image viewer for linux?
[11:46] <epsilon_> xgn: but does it work with the nv drivers???
[11:46] <jrib> !best | killown
[11:46] <ubotu> killown: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[11:46] <epsilon_> killown: chhose one :)
[11:46] <jrib> killown: I like feh personally
[11:46] <OoberMick> tannerld: is it the gdm problem that you are asking about?
[11:46] <epsilon_> killown: type "image" into add/remove programs and chhose one.

[11:51] <xgn> epsilon_ thanks

[11:52] <epsilon_> xgn: honestly i dont remember, but setting it to another number did the work i had a screen freeze before
[11:52] <TGPO> strabes in the login manager, there is a color selector as well
[11:52] <xgn> epsilon_ so I have to pass mem=nopentium to livecd kernel?

[11:59] <avagant> I hear that edgy doesn't like ati amd hardware.
[11:59] <kstc> 7600 gt nvidia 96xx
[11:59] <mahongyy> choose "vesa" as X server driver?

[12:01] <avagant> I couldn't even boot the livecd up.
[12:01] <jStefan> kstc, removing the drivers from nvidia.com using their uninstaller and using the ones in the repos
