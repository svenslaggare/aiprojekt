[12:01] <finalbeta> mc44 , it's up to you then how you interpret freak "someone who is so ardently devoted to something that it resembles an addiction) "a golf addict"; "a car nut"; "a bodybuilding freak"; "a news junkie"" Doesn't have to be negative ;), but very well, this is not ubuntu-offtopic
[12:02] <DigitalNinja> How can I find out who is using Ubuntu
[12:02] <sidny4> how do I make ubuntu start to text mode, then if I want x I can start it
[12:02] <Beep> digital: it's a good bet the people here are.
[12:02] <Doow> Beep: =)
[12:02] <mc44> sidny4: choose recovery mode
[12:03] <ciphex> pecisk: thanks
[12:03] <mc44> sidny4: on the grub screen
[12:03] <sidny4> ok
[12:03] <DigitalNinja> Beep: I know that much. How do I find out what compaines are using ubuntu
[12:03] <Beep> though I'm a wrench in the bookies calculations.  I cant make the damn thing install
[12:03] <Doow> Beep: what's the problem?
[12:03] <mc44> Beep: you get the alternate CD?
[12:04] <Beep> yup. Alternate locks up.. last thing showing in the boot is adding the mouse.
[12:04] <Armagguedes> can someone recommend me a desktop file & content search engine, like guggel desktop?
[12:04] <mc44> Beep: tried removing rthe mouse? :p
[12:04] <bigmoe> i have a pcmcia wlan card but ubuntu doesnt recognize it a a wireless card what can i do to update the drivers
[12:04] <Beep> what mouse?
[12:04] <finalbeta> DigitalNinja, I don't believe that that is being indexed.
[12:04] <mc44> Armagguedes: beagle? or tracker
[12:04] <synjet> armagguedes: beagle?
[12:04] <Beep> there wasnt one installed at the time.  I'd yanked it to this computer I'm typing on now
[12:04] <finalbeta> bigmoe, what card?
[12:04] <edmondsc> join #osu-lug
[12:05] <DigitalNinja> finalbeta: They should be keeping tapbs on this kind of data
[12:05] <mc44> Beep: have you tried attaching one :P
[12:05] <Armagguedes> beagle, and what about the frontend (for KDE?)
[12:05] <bigmoe> finalbeta: smc wireless card 11Mbps
[12:05] <synjet> armagguedes: beagle has a deskbar applet that can be added to the top panel like spotlight in osx
[12:05] <finalbeta> bigmoe, ehm, ok, what card?
[12:05] <Beep> plht..  ok....
[12:05] <Spee_Der> !kasbar
[12:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kasbar - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:06] <Armagguedes> ok tks
[12:06] <bigmoe> finalbeta: what do u mean what card??
[12:06] <Armagguedes> btw, how do i do the initial WINE config?
[12:06] <finalbeta> DigitalNinja, it's free to download... i'll assume they keep a record of what companies have support contracts. I do know google uses ubuntu desktops, or a modded version of them.
[12:07] <finalbeta> bigmoe, yes, what card, what type, must have a proper name, that might tell us what chipset it uses. You could google it up yourself, and then google on how to get a card running with that chipset.
[12:07] <DigitalNinja> finalbeta: I foudn that while searching google :)
[12:07] <zucaritas> i need some help configuring the BMC4318 wireless card on Edgy.. any ideas? ndiswrapper or should I go native?
[12:08] <amicke> anyone that successfully  cracked a wep-key with airsnort?
[12:08] <lufis> Hi. I accidentally deleted a file in my /etc/gconf directory and now gnome-panel keeps crashing. Any ideas?
[12:08] <bruenig> lufis what was the name of the file?
[12:08] <bigmoe> finalbeta: ah ok but i have a cd for installation but it is a win driver
[12:08] <lufis> bruenig: It started with a percent sign and had -de- in it
[12:09] <lufis> bruenig: XML, also
[12:09] <finalbeta> zucaritas> i need some help configuring the BMC4318 wireless card on Edgy.. << BCM? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx but the card only runs at 11Mbit for me. The forums have howtos on how to run them with ndiswrapper at full speed.
[12:09] <bruenig> %gconf-tree.xml
[12:09] <bruenig> that one?
[12:09] <lufis> bruenig: Yes, but it was %gconf-tree-de.xml, I think
[12:09] <bruenig> de like netherlands?
[12:10] <lufis> bruenig: I don't know. I'm running the English version...
[12:10] <finalbeta> bigmoe, yes, that doesn't help me. that win driver might be usable with ndiswrapper, but you want to look up the chip it's using first to make sure you can't run it native
[12:10] <synjet> /etc/gconf/%gconf-tree-de.xml is there for english version too
[12:10] <bruenig> lufis, well that is all I have found. I am on edgy so don't know if that makes a difference
[12:10] <finalbeta> I need to go. ciao
[12:10] <Spee_Der> ciao

[12:11] <Orkie_> hi
[12:11] <bigfuzzyjesus> hi
[12:11] <bruenig> lufis, maybe synjet can send it to you, he appears to have it
[12:11] <lufis> Lovless: Try soulseek plus
[12:11] <lufis> bruenig: Alright, thanks
[12:11] <Lovloss> okay =) thanks
[12:11] <pedro> how can i enable firestarter to work with fire fox ?
[12:11] <Orkie_> anybody who can help me with an in-progress dapper->edgy upgrade that has got stuck on bluez-utils?
[12:11] <bigfuzzyjesus> how come they didnt make edgy a LTS version
[12:11] <synjet> lufis, I do have have the file, but it seems to be empty
[12:11] <Orkie_> it has just got stuck at "starting bluetooth services"
[12:11] <lufis> synjet: Hmm... maybe i should just create a file?
[12:11] <Spee_Der> bigfuzzyjesus: SOmeday perhaps.....
[12:12] <pedro> somebody can help me ?
[12:12] <synjet> lufis, yes as my english file also happens to be empty
[12:12] <bruenig> bigfuzzyjesus, edgy is more of an experimental kind of bleeding edge build, not a super stable Dapper like build
[12:12] <Spee_Der> !ask | pedro
[12:12] <ubotu> pedro: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:12] <lufis> bigfuzzyjesus: Because Dapper was LTS. Edgy is supposed to be "Edgy"
[12:12] <Orkie_> i have no idea what to do from here. can i roll back to dapper?
[12:12] <bigfuzzyjesus> oh is that why edgy was put out much faster than the time between breezy and dapper
[12:12] <bruenig> !downgrade
[12:12] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[12:13] <cfedde> better to backup, reinstall and merge
[12:13] <bruenig> bigfuzzyjesus, it was put out faster because they spent 8 months on dapper as opposed to the normal 6 months, meaning they had to only spend 4 months on edgy to make up the time they lost polishing dapper
[12:13] <synjet> lufis, oops, sorry my en file isnt empty
[12:13] <Orkie_> ummm... yeah, but my system is in the middle of an upgrade and has got stuck...
[12:13] <lufis> synjet: Hmm...
[12:13] <synjet> lufis, do you want me to copy the de contents on pastebin?
[12:13] <Orkie_> i can't believe that the only solution is to reinstall
[12:14] <bigfuzzyjesus> bruenig, oh that makes sense
[12:14] <lufis> synjet: I'm not sure. Will it break anything using someone else's config? Well, who am I kidding, I just borked my panel :P Yes, please
[12:14] <Orkie_> i am not stupid, i am quite capable of using the command line where needed :S
[12:14] <bruenig> lufis, are you sure that is the problem, correlation is not equal to causation as the saying goes
[12:14] <bigfuzzyjesus> Orkie_,  did if give you an error message
[12:15] <Orkie_> bigfuzzyjesus: yeah, i'll paste it to a paste site

[12:15] <tjb891> is there anything you need to do to get a digital camera to work with myspace
[12:15] <tjb891> *ubuntu
[12:15] <tjb891> sorrey
[12:15] <TheDebugger> haha, myspace
[12:15] <tjb891> not thinking ubuntu
[12:15] <lufis> bruenig: I'm pretty sure. I did a really stupid thing and tried moving the file because of some installation issues with dpkg. I typed "sudo mv foo ./". The file disappeared and gnome-panel constantly crashes
[12:16] <bigfuzzyjesus> tjb891, not if it is supported, install picasa on your linux box and plug in your cam see what happens
[12:16] <tjb891> ok got yeh, it that in synaptic
[12:16] <cfedde> tjb891: might depend on the camera. but at worst you can always use a card reader
[12:16] <Lovloss> Is there a linux program for reconfigureing one's router, whatever that means?

[12:16] <bigfuzzyjesus> tjb891, it should be
[12:16] <tjb891> ok, thanks
[12:17] <Lovloss> I dont know how o pick ports and whatever...
[12:17] <cfedde> Lovloss: most routers these days have a web interface.

[12:17] <synjet> lufis, hope this helps: http://pastebin.com/827023
[12:17] <lufis> Thank you immensely.
[12:17] <Lovloss> Okay. So lets say you had a router and didnt have the manual...

[12:17] <cfedde> Lovloss:  maybe you can describe your situation a bit more.

[12:18] <Spee_Der> antoine, welcome.
[12:18] <cfedde> Orkie_: welcome to the wonderful world of opensource.  BTW when was the last time you rolled back a windows install?
[12:18] <Orkie_> cfedde: i don't really need welcoming, i've been using linux for about 5 years now ;)
[12:19] <Lovloss> only the basic gnutella server shows stuff
[12:19] <Lovloss> and its not much
[12:19] <Orkie_> and in that time, i've written my own kernel, dpkg replacement, ported an x server, but i've never had a problem like this :D
[12:19] <bigfuzzyjesus> tjb891, try googling it, i know there is a linux port
[12:19] <tjb891> yeah, if its not in synaptic i guess i have to do it the old fashioned way
[12:20] <cfedde> Lovloss: I'm guessing that the firewall is on your cable dsl box?  (aka the router)
[12:20] <synjet> tjb891: dload from google's site, I guess they have a deb
[12:20] <Phuzion> Is there a program similar to Mac OSX's dock for Linux?
[12:20] <Spee_Der> tjb891: Try apt-cache search <target>
[12:20] <Lovloss> I know a lot of things about compuers cfedde.... this router thingy isnt one of them
[12:20] <tjb891> yeah doing that rigth now

[12:21] <Phuzion> synjet:  thanks
[12:21] <bigfuzzyjesus> Orkie_, i havent the slightest idea what happened, sorry
[12:21] <cfedde> Lovloss: so the router /firewall is usualy on the internet access box. sometimes called a cable modem.
[12:21] <lufis> synjet: Oh god, what have I done. Still not working
[12:21] <Lovloss> right im using cable
[12:21] <mc44> Orkie_: so what exactly is the problem?

[12:23] <Lovloss> no c.c
[12:23] <Beep> same * different minute.   while I was at the multiple reboots, I did a memtest too.. it goes nice n fast with ddr2 800.  :)    all's good hardware, ubuntu install locks up still.  with various usb/ps2/none  mices it locks up either at adding mouse info, or adding ieeewhatever firewire.
[12:23] <shape> anyone coul d helpme to install frostwire?
[12:23] <mc44> Orkie_: damn that was wher I was going to make this your fault :p. Ok so where do you get that message? when you are booting up?
[12:23] <shape> i have problems installing java lib

[12:24] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: In a web browser, type the address 192.168.1.1
[12:24] <mc44> Orkie_: well killing it and trying again probably wont do any harm
[12:24] <wraithsoul> I was here last night, and I still need help
[12:24] <fryfrog> Is there any reason an NFS mount setup in /etc/fstab would *not* show in in 'mount' but does show up in /proc/mounts and is definatly mounted?
[12:24] <cfedde> Lovloss: or maybe 192.168.0.1
[12:24] <fryfrog> I'm using 6.10 if it makes any diff
[12:24] <Orkie_> well, i've nothing to lose i guess :)
[12:24] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: It will ask for user name and password....
[12:24] <eetfunk> im trying to forward port 2525 to 25 with iptables but i can't get it to work.  here's what i have so far in iptables.up.rules:  http://pastie.caboo.se/23351
[12:25] <Beep> yea well.. I really wanted to try ubuntu..  I guess slamd64 it is.
[12:25] <Lovloss> hold on, im not getting anything
[12:25] <Lovloss> AH! okay
[12:25] <wraithsoul> How do I make panels go behind applications?
[12:25] <Lovloss> username/PW
[12:25] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: Tab first, then for password, use admin
[12:26] <Spee_Der> No user name;
[12:26] <mc44> Beep: hmm you were trying with edgy right?>
[12:26] <Lovloss> woaaah
[12:26] <Lovloss> whats this do
[12:26] <lufis> synjet: I'll give it a go. One sec
[12:26] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: Now to the advanced tab.
[12:26] <Beep> 6.10 latest.  I never figured out the deal with ubuntu naming. :)
[12:26] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: Then to the forwarding tab
[12:26] <bigfuzzyjesus> does anyone here use wireless?
[12:26] <Phuzion> Alright, so I went to the restricted formats page on the Wiki, entered in all of the "make it work in a hurry" one line thing, and it says it can't find half of the packages on the repositories, and yes, I have turned on universe and multiverse
[12:27] <LjL> !anyone
[12:27] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:27] <Lovloss> hmmm im looking for tabs
[12:27] <synjet> wraithsoul: right-click the top panel and properties: hide
[12:27] <wraithsoul> thanks
[12:27] <mc44> Beep: sorry, edgy was the codename, 6.10 is based on 6 from 2006 and 10 from the month of release
[12:27] <Lovloss> lagging
[12:27] <Spee_Der> np
[12:28] <Lovloss> im under "advanced routing" but i dont see forwarding
[12:28] <Spee_Der> tab = boxes at top of window
[12:28] <Spee_Der> Ok....
[12:28] <Orkie_> nope, i am completely stuffed
[12:28] <Orkie_> it won't relaunch the installer
[12:28] <Spee_Der> Depends on which router you have perhaps, that is the way mine works and it is older.....
[12:28] <wraithsoul> synjet, that just causes the panel to fly off screen.
[12:28] <Orkie_> what is the command line method of doing it (i.e. the 'wrong' one)?
[12:29] <mc44> Orkie_: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:29] <Beep> K..  amd64 desktop.. locks up with the orange ubuntu and progress bar going nowhere,  amd64-alternate,text install locks up either at adding ps2mouse, or ieewhatever/firewire.   handy memtest says hardware is grand..   maybe ubuntu cant handle Athlon X2?  I havent found any posts in the forums claiming anyone has a dual core athlon working
[12:29] <Orkie_> ok, thanks
[12:29] <Lovloss> im looking around for a 'forwarding' option
[12:29] <Lovloss> could it be called anything else?
[12:29] <mc44> Beep: have you tried an i386 install?
[12:29] <fryfrog> Beep: I can promise you it isn't due to X2 cpu :)
[12:29] <fryfrog> Beep: and... yeah, that
[12:30] <Beep> nope.. the point of my trying ubuntu is for 64 bit. :)
[12:30] <synjet> wraithsoul: if you want the active window to be over a panel, I guess full-screen is the easiest option, as in a browser: F-11
[12:30] <Lovloss> Is it Upnp forwarding?
[12:30] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: Possibly, like I said mine is older, yours may be newer and called something else.....
[12:30] <Spee_Der> No
[12:30] <wraithsoul> is that really the best that can be done?
[12:30] <fryfrog> Beep: Try the i386 install, see if it boots at least.
[12:30] <wraithsoul> Does Beep not know what architexture beep has?
[12:30] <Lovloss> whats UPnp?
[12:31] <Lovloss> its disabled
[12:31] <Beep> next 2 steps. slamd64, then 32bit ubuntu.  then back to good old slackware.   have a bloody international business of 100+people running on it, I know I can make that work at least.
[12:31] <synjet> wraithsoul: atleast the one that I use/think of..
[12:31] <Spee_Der> !upnp
[12:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about upnp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:31] <fryfrog> Beep: is the *boot* cd locking up, or is it locking up after install?
[12:31] <orion2012> !upnp
[12:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about upnp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:31] <wraithsoul> xchat does not do it.

[12:31] <orion2012> Lovloss: well, its universal plug n play
[12:31] <Lovloss> is it good?
[12:31] <Spee_Der> yes
[12:32] <globe> how can I reload all modules? gnome freezes when i logout/login...dont want to restart
[12:32] <Beep> Beep has an Athlon X2 5000+, 2 gigs of DDR2 800, gigabyte M57SLI mobo, 2 nvidia 7900GS's SLI'd.  yup, he knows
[12:32] <Lovloss> Well anyway there is no forwarding option, so what am i looking for?
[12:32] <Spee_Der> Lovloss: Back to your original question please.....
[12:32] <Spee_Der> That may help us to help you
[12:32] <eetfunk> kaot: i'll try that thanks!
[12:32] <highneko> Any ideas for a caption? http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f295/numbers6554/highneko_v011.gif
[12:32] <Beep> fry:  the boot CD.. the install is what's locking up
[12:32] <Lovloss> well what next
[12:32] <wraithsoul> basically I have a starcraft screen shot, and am using it as a background. I want the part of the screen shot that says "menu" to open the menu. But I cannot find either a command to do it with gDesklets or a way to make the panel it is on go under the application.
[12:32] <lullabud> globe:  you mean like /etc/init.d/gdm restart ?
[12:33] <globe> lullabud: um...sort of.  when I do that, I can login then nothing
[12:33] <Orkie_> even LFS isn't this much trouble :D
[12:33] <globe> lullabud: all I get is a cursor....
[12:34] <eetfunk> kaot: it fails with that error:  iptables-restore v1.3.5: Line 86 seems to have a -t table option.
[12:34] <Lovloss> interesting idea wraithsoul
[12:34] <lullabud> globe:  you might try doing `init 3 ; init 5 ;` from a shell.... er... assuming you're using dapper.
[12:34] <lullabud> globe:  not sure how it works in edgy.
[12:34] <synjet> wraithsoul: why does the screenshot have the "menu" part on it? if you want just the screenshot, then press alt-printscreen
[12:34] <mc44> Orkie_: can you just less your /etc/apt/sources.list to make sure you're not upgrading to fiesty :)
[12:34] <wraithsoul> :/
[12:34] <wraithsoul> starcraft has a panel for commanding troops and such.
[12:34] <synjet> wraithsoul: that would get the screenshot of the active window
[12:34] <kaot> eetfunk: oh you're using iptables-restore... I just gave you the straight command-line
[12:35] <lullabud> globe:  actually, that might not be right.  check your runlevel by doing `runlevel` at a prompt.
[12:35] <wraithsoul> synjet, have you played the game?
[12:35] <synjet> wraithsoul: nope :) thats where I misunderstood you, my wrong
[12:35] <eetfunk> Kaot: yeah, everything i find is for the command line i think... i dont know jack about iptables :)
[12:35] <tomkelleher> hi, I'm having issues in Edgy. Every time Firefox loads a page with a flash object it crashes.
[12:35] <Orkie_> mc44: http://rafb.net/paste/results/rKsuGM84.html doesn't look like it
[12:35] <wraithsoul> synjet, it is fine
[12:36] <wraithsoul> also, what directory is the dist-logo.png in?
[12:36] <yalu> anyone tried to upgrade from warty to edgy? as far as I can tell, it's *impossible*.
[12:36] <Orkie_> i'm running dpkg --configure -a right now
[12:36] <mc44> Orkie_: nah looks fine, but at least I can blame your broken upgrade on beryl and easyubuntu. hah :)
[12:36] <globe> lullabud: lol...I think I botched something!  now my enter key prints ^M....
[12:36] <Lovloss> I found forwarding! yayq!
[12:36] <kaot> eetfunk: you should be able to just load your tables as normal, minus the port-forward, then run the command I gave you, then iptables-save >iptables.rules
[12:36] <wraithsoul> w00t
[12:36] <lullabud> globe:  oi.  not sure how to go about fixing that...  you might try restarting everything in your current runlevel
[12:36] <hoehaver> does anyone know how to mount a ntfs partition for ubuntu 6.06
[12:37] <lullabud> !ntfs
[12:37] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[12:37] <hoehaver> i have my hards drive in three partitions...one for windows xp( with ubuntu already sees and i can access) one for ubuntu and another for all my files ( movies music ect ect)
[12:37] <andreina> hi
[12:37] <tomkelleher> could anybody please help me with this issue, I'm not sure what to do.
[12:37] <atzar> hi
[12:37] <lullabud> !ask
[12:37] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:37] <eegore> How does one check gateway address when running DHCP
[12:38] <hoehaver> but the partiton with the movies and such...i cant access it...it sees it but its not mounted
[12:38] <andreina> quiero compilar en c y no me deja
[12:38] <andreina> como hago?
[12:38] <tomkelleher> Like I said before, every time firefox loads a page with a flash object it crashes.
[12:38] <lullabud> eegore:  `route` will print your routing table.
[12:38] <synjet> andreina: #ubuntu-es
[12:38] <eegore> lullabud: tnx
[12:38] <andreina> what can i do?

[12:39] <lufis> What happens when a file is mv'd to ./ ?
[12:39] <atzar> when i run linux-libc-dev after having installed linux-libc-dev package, I get this error messag: "bash: linux-libc-dev: command not found". Why ?
[12:39] <andreina> S.O.S.
[12:39] <synjet> andreina: espanol? join: #ubuntu-es
[12:39] <bruenig> atzar, I don't think you run development packages, they are just used in aid of compilations
[12:40] <jatt> atzar: what are you trying to do?
[12:40] <lullabud> lufis:  the file is in whatever directory you're currently in.
[12:40] <Phuzion> Alright, so I went to the restricted formats page on the Wiki, entered in all of the "make it work in a hurry" one line thing, and it says it can't find half of the packages on the repositories, and yes, I have turned on universe and multiverse, anyone know what's up?
[12:40] <jatt> AFAIK linux-libc-dev is no an executable but a package
[12:40] <eetfunk> kaot: thanks!
[12:40] <lufis> lullabud: I ran that command accidentally and now Gnome is messed up.
[12:40] <bruenig> Phuzion, pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:40] <sethk> Phuzion, I'm sure you have, but you ran apt-get update after turning on the repositories?
[12:40] <bruenig> !paste
[12:40] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[12:40] <lullabud> lufis:  you can move the file back to wherever it was originally.
[12:40] <graulich> I have some wmv files and an avi file I want to play on Xubuntu Edgy. I did the quick stuff from RestrictedFormats and got w32codecs as well. the media players all think the wmv files are encrypted and totem won't play anything but a visualizer on the avi file. what do I do?
[12:41] <lufis> lullabud: It disappeared :(
[12:41] <atzar> bruenig, jatt: I'm trying to make the intel macbook webcam work, by following this doc: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacBook (it's at the end)
[12:41] <orion2012> graulich: are the wmv's DRMed?
[12:41] <bruenig> graulich, did you get totem-xine?
[12:41] <lullabud> lufis do you know what the filename was?
[12:41] <graulich> orion2012, no
[12:41] <Phuzion> sethk:  Yes, I ran apt-get update
[12:41] <lullabud> lufis:  and do you know where it was originally?
[12:41] <synjet> lufis: check your .Trash, just incase..
[12:41] <bruenig> Phuzion, pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:41] <sethk> Phuzion, figured, but it doesn't hurt to confirm it.
[12:41] <Phuzion> I'm working on it
=== willow is now known as Willow_fr
[12:42] <sethk> Phuzion, do what bruenig suggested, then tell us the name of one or two specific ones that you can't find.
[12:42] <lufis> lullabud: Yes, sorry for not being specific. sudo mv /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/%gconf-tree-de.xml ./
[12:42] <graulich> bruenig: no, but I have totem-gstreamer et al
[12:42] <Willow_fr> hello every one
[12:42] <atzar> bruenig, jatt: I've seen my mistake...
[12:42] <lullabud> lufis %gconf-tree-de.xml ?
[12:42] <Phuzion> Working on the paste right now, one sec
[12:42] <lufis> lullabud: Yes
[12:42] <lullabud> ...interesting.  i'm not familiar with any % filenames...
[12:42] <bruenig> graulich, totem-xine is needed, I believe, if you want all the files to play, a quick sudo apt-get install totem-xine ought to fix the problem. It did for me when I had that problem.
[12:42] <Phuzion> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32437/
[12:43] <lullabud> lufis:  you might try dpkg-reconfigure gconf
[12:43] <graulich> okay bruenig I'm trying it now
[12:43] <bruenig> Phuzion, there is no multiverse
[12:43] <lufis> lullabud: Thank you so much. I'll give that a go
[12:43] <jatt> graulich: totem-gstreamer is useless. Try totem-xine instead.
[12:43] <k6rfm> lufis: if you did the mv as root, and you're looking for the file as you, perhaps you're not allowed to read/search the directory or file?
[12:43] <Phuzion> bruenig:  I don't have multiverse in there?
[12:44] <jatt> atzar: fine. In the wiki you mentioned I didn't find any reference about executing linux-libc-dev though.
[12:44] <sethk> Phuzion, bruenig I think there's an echo in here.
[12:44] <bruenig> Phuzion, no, change deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe to deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe multiverse
[12:44] <Phuzion> alright
[12:44] <Willow_fr> can someone help me ? i have some probleme with downloading with ktorrent
[12:44] <k6rfm> lufis: now that I think about it, i'm not sure *what* the working directory is under sudo.  just a sec
[12:44] <bruenig> Phuzion, and the deb-src after it
[12:44] <Orkie_> mc44: you can blame the upgrade on them, but you know that isn't the reason ;)
[12:44] <lufis> k6rfm: I don't know. I moved a file into itself, pretty much, and the file went *poof*
[12:44] <bruenig> Phuzion, not that the deb-src matters unless you are getting the source, but whatever, looks more coherent
[12:44] <mc44> ORwell possuiblky not, but a lot of problem have been caused by that. anyway hows it looking now?
[12:45] <Phuzion> bruenig:  I planned to add it in anyways
[12:45] <mc44> Orkie_: ^
[12:45] <Phuzion> I always make things match
[12:45] <sethk> k6rfm, all other things being equal, sudo does not change the current directory
[12:45] <k6rfm> lufis: normally if you try to move the file into itself mv just complains "same file" and does nothing
[12:45] <Orkie_> mc44: i can believe that
[12:45] <lufis> k6rfm: Hm. I don't know. what would cp do? I might have ran that too
[12:45] <Orkie_> i've seen my problem mentioned elsewhere, but no solutions :S
[12:45] <graulich> bruenig, jatt, orion2012: installed totem-xine and now the avi file plays but the wmvs still don't work. any other packages I should make sure I have?
[12:46] <Orkie_> it is still configuring all the packages
[12:46] <lullabud> k6rfm lufis: sudo uses your current environment variables.
[12:46] <atzar> jatt: it works fine now, it's because some commands where written on two lines... it made me confused
[12:46] <eetfunk> kaot: For whhatever reason, the port is not forwarded... any idea?
[12:46] <Phuzion> bruenig:  thanks, it works now
[12:46] <Orkie_> if that fails, i'm going to uninstall bluez-utils using whatever means neccessary and try upgrading again
[12:46] <matroblend> HI all
[12:47] <mc44> Orkie_: sweet
[12:47] <k6rfm> lufis: cp  should just copy it .  I just checked, sudo does inherit the working directory.
[12:47] <kaot> eetfunk: paste your current iptables rules please
[12:47] <Orkie_> i'm confident i could at least boot back up to bash
[12:47] <bruenig> graulich, not certain if it works always on wmv. The guide I used specifically says "All known codecs work except for wmv" so not sure if that is a universal problem or if that guide just happened to omit it
[12:48] <Orkie_> setting up gnome-utils (if that gives any indication of progress, which i doubt it does)
[12:48] <lufis> k6rfm: Alright. I have no idea what I did to mess things up. I accidentally hit enter before i finished typing the command and sudo had already been used so it didn't prompt for a password. The command ran, the file disappeared, and then gnome-panel started crashing repeatedly
[12:48] <deema> anybody here use prism54 islsm??
[12:48] <kaot> window 2
[12:48] <graulich> well bruenig on my other system (which I don't have here and configured too long ago to remember) I can play wmv files just fine... there has to be a way. =
[12:48] <graulich> =\
[12:48] <matroblend> Is there a ISO that is small enough for a floppy?
[12:48] <botxj> does ubuntu read FAT32 partitions?
[12:48] <deema> ya
[12:48] <lufis> botxj: Yes
[12:48] <eetfunk> kaot: http://pastie.caboo.se/23357  i don't even see 2525 in there although i ran the line you sent me
[12:49] <botxj> lufis how?
[12:49] <sethk> matroblend, not an iso, because ISO is a format, but it's possible to create an image that can fit on a floppy
[12:49] <lufis> botxj: Magic :P
[12:49] <Orkie_> matroblend: you have .img files for floppies normally
[12:49] <eetfunk> kaot: huh... its at the top, sorry :)
[12:49] <kaot> \
[12:49] <botxj> how do you mount a fat32 partitions?
[12:49] <Orkie_> you just dd the img over
[12:49] <k6rfm> lullabud: but the current working directory isn't an environment variable... most shells set $PWD to it, but setting $PWD doesn't change it
[12:49] <lufis> botxj: is it a removable drive?
[12:49] <sethk> matroblend, iso here is short for ISO9660, which is an IEEE standard.
[12:49] <ph8> hi guys! I'm trying to setup apache with SSL, and i'm getting this weird error - has anyone got any insight? https://www.netlamers.org
[12:49] <sethk> botxj, in general with -t vfat
[12:50] <botxj> lufis: no the partition is on a harddrive
[12:50] <bruenig> graulich, you got libxine-extracodecs
[12:50] <Orkie_> mc44: would i be right in assuming that it sets the non-essential things up after the important stuff?
[12:50] <graulich> bruenig: yup, just checked that
[12:50] <mc44> Orkie_: theoretically I think so
[12:50] <botxj> sethk: mount -t vfat ?
[12:50] <sethk> botxj, mount is somewhat intelligent and you can usually say   -t msdos   and it will figure out the FAT varient.
[12:50] <sethk> botxj, yes, as in   mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/something
[12:50] <Orkie_> because i'm on apache now, which is very unessential
[12:50] <amicke> where can i find ubuntu themes?
[12:50] <clemyeats> gnome-loo.org amicke
[12:50] <icheyne> In www.ubuntuguide.org they mention two ways to get java - "How to install J2SE Runtime Environment (JRE)" and "How to install JRE v5.0 Update 9". What is the difference?
[12:50] <jrib> !themes | amicke
[12:50] <ubotu> amicke: Find your themes at: http://www.gnome-look.org - http://kdelook.org - http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/58/ - http://www.guistyles.com - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/ - Also see !changethemes and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
[12:50] <botxj> ok, i'll try that sethk and get back to you
[12:51] <bruenig> graulich, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Multimedia_Codecs I used that and everything worked, maybe see if you missed anything. (I may not have used all types of media but have used many and all worked flawlessly)
[12:51] <clemyeats> gnome-look.org sorry..
[12:51] <kaot> eetfunk: erm.  that's wayyyy to many lines.  edit that file to remove all the prerouting rules except the middle one, and then iptables-restore your ruleset
[12:51] <graulich> okay bruenig thanks I'll try that
[12:51] <matroblend> sethk: How do I find a image that will fit on a floppy
[12:51] <jmichaelx> has anyone here been successful in getting embedded video (Yahoo! news clips, for example) working using FF2.0 and mplayer plugin? i have not been able to get them to work in k/ubuntu edgy, though they worked fine in dapper, with FF1.5. i also just noticed that such videos work fine in mepis 6.0 & FF2.0. if anyone has a solution, please let me know.
[12:51] <amicke> thanks jrib
[12:51] <sethk> botxj, of course, hda1 is just an example and /mnt/something is an arbitrary mount point.
[12:52] <botxj> yes i know
[12:52] <sethk> matroblend, I don't know if they are available for ubuntu.  They are available for slackware, which tells us that it is possible to do.
[12:52] <sethk> matroblend, what are you trying to do?  there may be another way to get it done.
[12:52] <lufis>  k6rfm: When i ran dpkg-reconfigure gconf, it said gconf isn't a package
[12:52] <lullabud> k6rfm:  that's not true.  do `PWD=asdf ; echo $PWD`
[12:53] <matroblend> sethk: really?
[12:53] <bruenig> !gconf2
[12:53] <ubotu> gconf2: GNOME configuration database system (support tools). In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.0-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 127 kB, installed size 276 kB
[12:53] <Orkie_> mc44: dpkg --configure has finished and when i do dist-upgrade it gets stuck in the same place, but i can see that only a few upgrades are left (and none of them are to do with beryl by the way ;))
[12:53] <bruenig> !gconf-editor
[12:53] <ubotu> gconf-editor: An editor for the GConf configuration system. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.0-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 131 kB, installed size 1684 kB
[12:53] <bruenig> there is no gconf
[12:53] <wraithsoul> :(
[12:53] <sethk> matroblend, possibly.  what are you trying to do, exactly?
[12:53] <lullabud> bruenig:  what is this, the matrix?
[12:53] <k6rfm> lullabud, ah but echo $PWD prints the value of the environment variable, not the current directory. try the command "pwd" instead of the echo!
[12:53] <mc44> Orkie_: kill that bluetooth sucker
[12:53] <botxj> lullabud, lol?
[12:54] <eetfunk> kaot: ok thats what i have now (but still doesnt work):  http://pastie.caboo.se/23358
[12:54] <bruenig> lullabud, just giving him some options that could be what he was looking for
[12:54] <Orkie_> mc44: if i kill it, dpkg exits
[12:54] <k6rfm> lullabud, normally you never see a difference because the shell "cd" command both changes the directory and sets PWD to track.
[12:54] <lullabud> k6rfm:  interesting...
[12:54] <graulich> bruenig: only one package suggested there was missing but I did what they said anyhow and no change
[12:54] <matroblend> sethk, I have a old laptop I want linux on it but it does not have a cd drive
[12:54] <Orkie_> i may need to edit my init file to temporarily not stop anything
[12:54] <mc44> Orkie_: sorry i meant apt-get remove :p
[12:54] <sethk> matroblend, so you need to install, once you've installed, then you no longer will care.
[12:54] <el_jay> Help me please.. my ubuntu crashed... when i load it only starts in terminal mode saying that it cant load x server..
[12:54] <bruenig> graulich, odd, you are certain you have and are using totem-xine
[12:55] <el_jay> can sombody help me fix it
[12:55] <savvas> is there a k7 kernel for edgy?
[12:55] <Orkie_> mc44: gets stuck on the ending the bluetooth service again :)
[12:55] <sethk> el_jay, run    sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:55] <graulich> bruenig: wouldn't that just be using totem in general? or is it separate? I just use what the system calls "Movie Player" and the title of the windows is Totem Movie Player...
[12:55] <matroblend> sethk, true. I just want to use it as a linux laptop
[12:55] <jatt> el_jay: maybe can you check if you have a .xsession-errors file in your $HOME directory?
[12:56] <sethk> matroblend, I'd probably use a different distro for that case.
[12:56] <bruenig> graulich, yes, but there is totem-gstreamer and totem-xine. When you installed totem-xine, it should have removed totem-gstreamer. Did it do that?
[12:56] <graulich> yes it did bruenig
[12:56] <bruenig> graulich, beyond me then. Maybe the wmv is corrupt
[12:56] <mc44> Orkie_: even after removing bluetooth packages?
[12:56] <savvas> is there a k7 kernel for edgy eft?
[12:56] <Orkie_> it gets stuck *on* removing the bluetooth packages
[12:56] <graulich> bruenig: thing is there are a few different ones and not all from the same place... and none work.
[12:56] <matroblend> sethk, Ok which and where if you don't mind
[12:57] <Orkie_> there, sorted :) i edited my init file so it didn't try to stop anything.
[12:57] <bruenig> graulich, maybe you could link me to the wmv's and I can see if they work for me?
[12:57] <Orkie_> when i reboot, it will kill them anyway
[12:57] <mc44> Orkie_: ah cunning like a fox
[12:57] <sethk> matroblend, Debian or Slackware.
[12:57] <Orkie_> heh :)
[12:57] <sethk> matroblend, debian is closer to ubuntu in administration.  slackware is a bit easier to install.
[12:57] <graulich> no bruenig, I can't, they're not on a server, they're from p2p
[12:58] <kaot> eetfunk: looks like you've got a DROP rule for all traffic destined for 127.0.0.0/8....
[12:58] <matroblend> sethk, easy is best in this matter I think
[12:58] <kaot> eetfunk: but aprior rule to accept all on loopback... guh.  what generated these rules?
[12:58] <bruenig> graulich, ah. I have gotten some from p2p before that when I run give me some green screen and doesn't work but that was on dapper. Yet to have that happen on my newest install
[12:58] <eetfunk> Kaot: a wizard i found online...
[12:59] <sethk> matroblend, slackware doesn't have a package manager (well, doesn't have an acceptable one, IMO) so in the long run Debian is probably easier.  But it's arguable
[12:59] <Zambezi> Is it possible to burn mds-mdf-files in Ubuntu? K3B and Gnomebaker doesn't seem to recognize  it.
[12:59] <mdious> I actually loved the package management options on slackware...I like how you had so many different choices
[12:59] <jmichaelx> could anyone who is able to view the news clips from Yahoo! in edgy with FF2.0 please tell me how you got it to work? (if anyone has it working at all)
[12:59] <Orkie_> ok, i'm going to reboot. wish me luck :D
[12:59] <bruenig> jmichaelx, link?
[01:00] <jmichaelx> www.yahoo.com
[01:00] <Spee_Der> gl ork
[01:00] <kaot> eetfunk: experimental telnetting to your 63.99.9.66 suggests that traffic is in fact getting DROP'd for some reason, I suspect the LINWIZ-INPUT ruleset...
[01:00] <sethk> mdious, If they all worked, I might agree.  Although I have to admit I've not tried them all.
[01:00] <mc44> Orkie_: please file a bug with the contents of /var/log/dist-upgrade wen youve finished
[01:00] <el_jay> ok i tryed dpkg.reconfigure x.server.xorg and it toldme that  canot se l:all to default loal: dosnt exist file a directory /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: xserver-xorg is borken or not fully installed
[01:00] <matroblend> sethk, OK so Debian it is now what?
[01:00] <jmichaelx> bruenig: just click video, and select o ne
[01:00] <kaot> eetfunk: you might try something like iptables -I INPUT -d 127.0.0.1 -p tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT
[01:00] <sethk> matroblend, go to their site, read their install docs for a network install
[01:00] <tonyyarusso> How to install Ubuntu with an old world Mac processor, but if you don't have a Mac OS for the bootloader?
[01:00] <mc44> Orkie_: and good luck
[01:00] <Orkie_> mc44: ok
[01:00] <Orkie_> thanks :)
[01:00] <mdious> sethk>I haven't tried slapt-get...but i hear it has a bad habbit of screwing up your system...not that I know from experience though
[01:01] <bruenig> jmichaelx, hangs at initializing
[01:01] <lullabud> tonyyarusso:  can't you hold option on boot to select the boot device?
[01:01] <sethk> mdious, mixing a distro with a sort of generic package manager doesn't usually work terribly well.
[01:01] <matroblend> sethk, network install?
[01:01] <tonyyarusso> lullabud: But what will load the kernel, etc?
[01:01] <jmichaelx> bruenig: yes.... and it seems to do that with a lot of other embedded video. this all worked fine in dapper
[01:01] <sethk> matroblend, right, it installs almost everything from the network and therefore doesn't need a CD.
[01:01] <lullabud> tonyyarusso:  there's something called yaboot that i've seen mac folks talk about.  i've never done it personally.
[01:02] <tonyyarusso> lullabud: All right, might be a start
[01:02] <matroblend> sethk, Ahh ok thankyou bye
[01:02] <jmichaelx> bruenig: i have tried everything i can think of in edgy. i do have one box with mepis on it, and FF2.0.... and these videos work fine on it
[01:02] <bruenig> jmichaelx, not sure that it worked in dapper. I remembered these retarded embedded things having problems too. But I don't view them enough to really have noticed too much difference
[01:02] <graulich> wait bruenig I may have missed something, I didn't have some of the extra repos enabled when I did the ubuntuguide thing
[01:02] <easytiger> best bond ever!
[01:02] <jmichaelx> bruenig: no, they worked/work fine in dapper
[01:03] <bruenig> graulich, it would have returned an error if you didn't? Did it not return an error?
[01:03] <jmichaelx> i still have dapper on my laptop, and all of these videoa work perfectly on it
[01:03] <graulich> bruenig: not that I noticed but I'll try again now with the extra repos anyhow
[01:03] <jmichaelx> videos*
[01:04] <mdious> has anyone brought openbsd 4.0 yet?
[01:04] <JasonMog> how do i list users in bash?
[01:05] <TheDebugger> who ?
=== Orkie is now known as Orkie_
[01:05] <Orkie_> mc44: it worked :)
[01:05] <sethk> JasonMog, you mean users defined on the system?  users connected?     who     will show you currently connected users
[01:05] <Orkie_> there is a minor problem though
[01:05] <mc44> Orkie_: score :)
[01:06] <Orkie_> the bar at the bottom on the screen on gnome hasn't appeared
[01:06] <Orkie_> any idea how to get it back?
[01:06] <JasonMog> the first SeanTater
[01:06] <JasonMog> er
[01:06] <JasonMog> sethk
[01:06] <sethk> JasonMog, what?
[01:06] <mc44> Orkie_: right click on another panel and click new panel and drag it around
[01:07] <graulich> well bruenig, it found some updates to xorg so I upgraded and restarted x but nothing has changed... blah... is there any point going and removing all the packages that should have fixed this and then starting afresh?
[01:07] <mc44> Orkie_: or killall gnome-panel may work
[01:07] <eetfunk> kaot: I got it.  I forward 2525 to  externalip:25 instead.  is there a reason why i would NOT want to do that?
[01:07] <Orkie_> mc44: thanks, killall did it
[01:07] <bruenig> graulich, don't know. If you have time and want to go ahead. Won't hurt anything
[01:07] <Orkie_> mc44: thanks for your help. what was that log file again?
[01:08] <mc44> Orkie_: /var/log/dist-upgrade, file it against upgrade-manager. thatks :)
[01:08] <tjb891> i just installed linux picasa and now its adding ALL the images on my computer, there are thousands that come with linux, how do i stop it from adding more and remove everthing except for the pictures in my home folder?
[01:08] <kaot> eetfunk: eetfunk not really.  I imagine the idea here is to get around a port 25 block by your isp or similar.  Either way should work.
[01:08] <eetfunk> kaot: thanks! it sure did the trick :)
[01:08] <Orkie_> mc44: ok, i'll make a note. it'll have to wait until tomorrow now, i was hoping for a early night and now it's 12:10AM :D
[01:08] <kaot> eetfunk: I just noticed it working, I tried to drop you a line but your anti-spam blacklist doenst' like my IP  :\
[01:09] <mc44> Orkie_: no worriesm gnight
[01:09] <Orkie_> bye all!
[01:09] <eetfunk> kaot: that's how you know i'm doing it right :D
[01:09] <kaot> eetfunk: lol... I'm bummed by that sort of thing, I used to run my own mailserver, then of course spammers wrecked it for everybody.  Oh well.
[01:09] <Homelss> guys, i want to install ubuntu, but i want to ask, my windows partition is NTFS so does grub recognize it, and i will not have a problem in booting?
[01:10] <mdious> you shouldn't have a problem
[01:10] <tjb891> ok
[01:10] <mdious> shouldn't being the key word...
[01:10] <sethk> Homelss, it will find it.   BUT ... ALWAYS  back up.
[01:10] <sethk> Homelss, always, always, always back up.  if something bad happens and you didn't back up, you have no one but yourself to blame.
[01:11] <ph8> hi guys! I'm trying to setup apache with SSL, and i'm getting this weird error - has anyone got any insight? https://www.netlamers.org
[01:12] <Homelss> sethk, thank you i tried to install ubuntu before, and i had aproblems in booting and MBR but every thing solved thanks god, but now my windows partition is NTFS so i think i have to ask before installing
[01:13] <sethk> Homelss, as several people said, you should not have a problem.  I've done what you are doing many times, without problems.  Occasionally, though, things happen.  The power goes off in the middle of the install, or other similarly unlikely but not impossible situations
[01:13] <sethk> ph8, that sight doesn't come up.
[01:13] <mdious> ph8>what is the error
[01:13] <sethk> ph8, of course, if you are having ssl problems, giving us an https:// url on the machine with problems isn't going to help very much.
[01:14] <ph8> sethk: that's the only error i see
[01:14] <Homelss> sethk, so i can install ubuntu and grub will not find any problem in booting windows NTFS partition, now i can install in a brave heart
[01:15] <ph8> there's nothing in the error log
[01:15] <sethk> ph8, I see nothing at the URL you posted, is my point.
[01:15] <sethk> Homelss, correct.
[01:15] <ph8> when i view that netlamers link, i get a 'server has sent an incorrect or unexpected message'

[01:16] <ph8> no :s :/
[01:16] <ph8> i set it up using the howto on the forums
[01:16] <ph8> any ideas where to start debugging? if the error logs empty?

[01:19] <jml> hello. I'm setting up edgy on my powerbook. I've followed some instructions in the forum and got my wireless card noticed by the system.
[01:19] <attah> anyone?
[01:19] <jml> however, it will not seem to actually connect to my AP
[01:20] <mdious> ph8>sorry if i sounded rude or thought you were stupid and haven't done it...not sure if it will help.  The first link just mentioned something about changing browsers lol
[01:21] <jml> a _lot_ of people seem to have this issue.
[01:21] <jml> but I can't find any concrete solution on the forums
[01:22] <JoshJ> /home/lappy/gtk-gnutella-downloads/complete/Ubuntu-6 10-desktop-i386 iso.zip: Trojan.VB-105   <-- i love how clamscan thinks the ubuntu .iso is a trojan
[01:22] <sethk> jml, first thing to look at is encrpytion and keys.
[01:22] <FatherTyme> How can I save my iptables config in Ubuntu?
[01:22] <mdious> jml>stupid suggestion but I always found it helps troubleshooting if you turn off all security on wap and just try connecting with everything as basic as possible....
[01:22] <jml> sethk: I've disabled all my router security
[01:22] <jml> (wireless, that is)
[01:22] <attah> any ideas on that gksu doesn't work?
[01:22] <amicke> damn ubuntu! I can't find any nice theme
[01:22] <mdious> FatherTyme>you can put it in a script that runs at startup or there is a command....i can't remember but it isn't perfect, i'll try to find it
[01:22] <sethk> jml, ok.  is the workstation set up to use dhcp?
[01:23] <jml> sethk: yep.
[01:23] <attah> amicke, think i've got one..
[01:23] <sethk> jml, sounds like you already checked the easy stuff
[01:23] <jml> sethk: :)
[01:23] <mdious> check out iptables-save and iptables-restore
[01:23] <amicke> attah: would you like to take a printscreen and show me?
[01:23] <ph8> hmm
[01:23] <ph8> can't find any decent solutions
[01:23] <mdious> FatherTyme>I heard there is some problems using those commands though...check your rules all load up properly if you are going to use it...
[01:24] <mdious> ph8>where is the guide you followed to set it up?
[01:24] <jml> sethk: I've also tried using wifi-radar (again, it gets a list of networks but can't connect, just like network-manager)
[01:24] <attah> amicke, getting on it.. have got a laggy computer..
[01:25] <amicke> attah:  ok ok, thanks

[01:31] <jml> mdious: _apache_ error logs?
[01:32] <jml> mdious: why would anything appear there?
[01:32] <mdious> because your stuff isn't working
[01:32] <mdious> and you said you were using apache server
[01:32] <attah> amicke, tried just 10 mins ago ^ must have been my screwup then

[01:47] <attah> tw amicke; swe?
[01:47] <ademan_> ex-parrot: maybe it is wired? my wlan0 is wired and my wlan1 is wireless
[01:47] <ademan_> er rather eth0 and eth1
[01:47] <amicke> attah: yes i'm swedish.. you too?
[01:47] <ex-parrot> ademan_, both my ethernet interfaces are showing as wired and neither have wireless extensions
[01:48] <attah> amicke, yep..
[01:48] <ex-parrot> despite me having a wireless card and wired ethernet

[01:48] <Eeyore-Jr> does ubuntu have a remote desktop invatation ?
[01:48] <amicke> attah: no idea but maybe we should talk private for not risking
[01:49] <mdious> ph8>i think i found something are you still around?
[01:49] <ex-parrot> ademan_, me either. it seems like a common complaint but I can only find references to people using ndiswrapper
[01:49] <attah> amicke sure
[01:49] <Pelo> Eeyore-Jr,  yes, check in the system menu
[01:49] <ademan_> ex-parrot: well ndiswrapper is installed by default in edgy afaik
[01:49] <Pelo> Eeyore-Jr,  forget what I just said,  I missread you,  I don'T know
[01:50] <ex-parrot> right, but I haven't used it in the past, so unles it's loading and forcing out the proper driver (very unlikely) it shouldn't be involved
[01:50] <ademan_> ex-parrot: but it is a difference between edgy and dapper
[01:50] <fredJones840> beautiful .. the smart boot manager disk worked
[01:51] <ademan_> and things that have changed between when it worked and when it didnt are a good place to start when something breaks :-)
[01:51] <ex-parrot> yeah... I think I've found someone else with the same problem ademan_ .... looks like it's specific to the prism chipset
[01:51] <ademan_> ouch
[01:51] <fredJones840> pain the ass to find a disk imaging prog that worked
[01:51] <ademan_> but report time i guess

[01:52] <lifepositive> how can I check what services are loading as my system boots?

[01:58] <ubotu> Please don't play with the bots, or else... Also see !behaviour and !msgthebot
[01:58] <Pelo> amicke,  splash screen is the screen image you see while ubuntu is booting or quitting
[01:58] <attah> amicke, depending on.. loading scrn of entire os or just desktop..
[01:58] <prestosd> !what bot abuse is
[01:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about what bot abuse is - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:58] <amicke> ah ok
[01:58] <amicke> so anyone got kismet or airsnort working?
[01:59] <zircx> what is the command that restarts the inetd daemon, or xinetd daemon?
[01:59] <ademan_> zircx: /etc/init.d/inetd restart ?
[01:59] <g333k_work> Hi, how to avoid to check the filesystem every boot?
[02:00] <ademan_> most daemons are /etc/init.d/daemon-name command
[02:00] <g333k_work> boot*
[02:00] <ademan_> commands usually start stop restart
[02:00] <zircx> yeah nah they're different in ubuntu
[02:00] <zircx> lol
[02:00] <mdious> I'm off, seeya everyone, thanks for the company, if someone could mention http://forum.ensim.com/showthread.php?t=10092 to ph8 when they are back around I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks again
[02:00] <zircx> it's like their own names to the daemons being run
[02:01] <amicke> attah: have you used ubuntu for a long time?
[02:01] <ademan_> i've always started and stopped apache via what i just showed you
[02:01] <attah> amicke  a year maybe
[02:02] <air0day> is there an rss reader for linux that lets me subscribe to an rss feed of downloadable files and match on certain patterns, then download those files to a specific location? my bittorrent client doesnt have rss, but it can pick up files from a certain directory
[02:02] <ademan_> zircx: yeah but i see there's no inetd in /etc/init.d ...
[02:02] <_Raptor_> is it just me, or is winetools nowhere to find in the repositories? Not in universe, and I don't even have any luck when adding wine.sourceforge.org/apt/ binary/. Anyone got an idea?
[02:02] <amicke> attah:  ah ok, so for awhile.. are you satisfied with it?
[02:02] <ademan_> _Raptor_: winetools are evil
[02:02] <ademan_> what are you trying to do with them?] 
[02:02] <g333k_work> !madwifi
[02:02] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:03] <zircx> maybe it's the networking daemon
[02:03] <zircx> I'll have a nosey
[02:03] <attah> amicke, yes, i would say it's the best linux i've used ever
[02:03] <amicke> attah: ok, nice
[02:03] <_Raptor_> ademan_, the only reason I use WinXp is for TWO onlinegaes. By getting wine and winetools, I can remove my need for Xp all together.
[02:04] <amicke> attah:  did you like the theme i posted before?
[02:04] <attah> amicke, and you
[02:04] <air0day> nobody? no ideas for an rss reader that downloads files?
[02:04] <amicke> attah:  3 weeks
[02:04] <_Raptor_> ademan_, the exact reason for winetools (not just wine) is that I'm following a tutorial, as I've never used wine before.
[02:04] <ademan_> _Raptor_: ah, what games specifically?
[02:04] <attah> amicke, did unfortunately not even get there
[02:04] <lifepositive> whats the latest Firefox?
[02:04] <attah> amicke, just repaired the laptop now..
[02:05] <Pelo> _Raptor_,  what are you trhing to install ?
[02:05] <Aldoliel> lifepositive, 2.0
[02:05] <ademan_> lifepositive: 2.0?
[02:05] <fredJones840> ive got 1.5.0.8
[02:05] <_Raptor_> ademan_, Starchamber and AutoassaultTCG.
[02:05] <amicke> attah: ok, should i post the link again?
[02:05] <ademan_> i prefer 1.5, 2.0 has been unstable as hell
[02:05] <_Raptor_> Pelo, as for now, I'm just trying to get winetools via apt.
[02:05] <attah> amicke, yes thx
[02:05] <lifepositive> how can I install Firefox 2.0?
[02:05] <fredJones840> ?
[02:05] <ademan_> lifepositive: you don't want it lol, its so unstable for me
[02:06] <ph8> thanks to mdious
[02:06] <ademan_> but it should be in dapper-backports
[02:06] <air0day> doesnt the official bittorent client have a terminal version that uses curses?
[02:06] <attah> amicke, at least i thought the laptop got ok, but noo
[02:06] <ademan_> _Raptor_: oh, unfortunately i'm totally unfamiliar with them, so maybe winetools is the best way to go, but generally you just run "wine NameOfInstallerExecutable" and the rest should be a breeze
[02:06] <easytiger> lifepositive: its on ubuntu 6.10
[02:06] <amicke> attah: maybe it's time for a new one? :)
[02:07] <amicke> attah:  this is what i would like it to look lie: http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot07np2.png
[02:07] <lifepositive> easytiger: I dont have 6.10
[02:07] <lifepositive> ademan_: unstable how?
[02:07] <attah> amicke, more then definitely..
[02:07] <easytiger> lifepositive, then just download it
[02:07] <ademan_> that reminds me, is there a way to wrap up a *.run executable installer in a deb?
[02:07] <ademan_> lifepositive: it just crashes a lot for me
[02:07] <lifepositive> easytiger: is it secure?
[02:07] <_Raptor_> ademan_, ok, thanks :) I'll try that before continuing my hunt for winetools :)
[02:07] <easytiger> lifepositive, its grand.
[02:07] <lifepositive> ademan_: ok!  if it does that for me, ill remove it
[02:07] <attah> amicke, looks nice, not far from the one i suggested :)
[02:07] <lifepositive> easytiger: define grand?
[02:08] <easytiger> lifepositive, i've had no issues with stability or anything
[02:08] <tonyyarusso> If you try to boot the Live CD on a system that doesn't have sufficient memory, will it just fail to load X and drop you to a console, or fail out completely?
[02:08] <amicke> attah: i installed the one you gave me but didn't notice much difference
[02:08] <Aldoliel> tonyyarusso, It just runs really, really slowly
[02:09] <attah> amicke, applied it? :P but yes it so happens to get orange under ubuntu
[02:09] <tonyyarusso> Aldoliel: Good 'nough
[02:09] <lifepositive> easytiger: ok! so from backports?
[02:10] <easytiger> lifepositive, can't you do dist-upgrade?
[02:10] <lifepositive> ademan_: others dont seem to have probs with Firefox 2.0
[02:10] <ademan_> lifepositive: well if they don't great, i do lol
[02:10] <Aldoliel> By really, really slow, I mean like half hour boot times
[02:10] <lifepositive> easytiger: when I type sudo apt-get install dist-upgrade it says nothing to upgrade
[02:10] <ademan_> i know there are some flash related problems, but i don't have those
[02:10] <amicke> attah:  gets blur for me
[02:10] <ademan_> i think my problem is related to the stupid ass totem embedded video player
[02:11] <amicke> attah:  this is very strange.. i think i bette sleep instead :)
[02:11] <attah> amicke, oh, depends on the enegine, select under prefs..
[02:11] <attah> try "human"
[02:12] <easytiger> lifepositive, sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade
[02:13] <easytiger> make sure you have latest lists etc
[02:13] <amicke> attah: think i have changed something everything looks strange now :P
[02:13] <amicke> attah:  got to sleep thanks for the help anyway.. and good luck with your computer...
[02:13] <attah> amicke, play around ^^
[02:14] <attah> amicke, thanks, same to u, works now
[02:14] <lifepositive> what does "sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade" do?
[02:15] <lifepositive> easytiger: i cant, as im using a modem
[02:15] <easytiger> lifepositive, ahh
[02:15] <g333k_work> what version of gcc was used to compile ubuntu 6.10?
[02:15] <easytiger> lifepositive, then just download it from mozilla
[02:16] <g333k_work> I need to compile madwifi.. what version do I have to use if I have ubuntu 6.10?

=== Satan_1 is now known as Shadowline

[02:29] <mike_> Pelo,  i didnt compile from source
[02:29] <qc_> What is the default keyboard shortcut to log out of the current X session, so you can login with another?
[02:30] <lifepositive> ademan_: you there?
[02:30] <lifepositive> ademan_: To get the flash plugin working properly you may have to add "export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" to the firefox launching script.
[02:30] <Pelo> qc_,  no one seems to know, check the man pages
[02:30] <mckinnoj> guys do u know how to apply global keybindings for certain applications

[02:35] <Riyonuk> Hi
[02:37] <air0day> is there an rss reader for linux that lets me subscribe to an rss feed of downloadable files and match on certain patterns, then download those files to a specific location? my bittorrent client doesnt have rss, but it can pick up files from a certain directory
[02:37] <Pelo> hello Riyonuk
[02:38] <Pelo> air0day,   I use utorrent on wine, it has an rss downloader built in
[02:38] <ademan_> air0day: i think there's a fairly popular KDE rss reader, unfortunately i forgot what its called, gimme a second
[02:38] <Riyonuk> I would be in linux, but I cant get internet to work
[02:38] <Daehlie> anyone used a good system for standardizing and automating the deployment of linux desktops in a business environment, preferably free, but i'll take anything at this point
[02:38] <Pelo> wait, I told you about this yesterday
[02:38] <air0day> pelo: utorrent on wine runs like ass :)
[02:38] <Riyonuk> I go to network connections, and it shows dial-up, and ethernet, but not my wireless card
[02:38] <Riyonuk> what gives?
[02:38] <air0day> it eats 45% of my cpu when torrenting 5 files
[02:38] <fryfrog> okay, stupid ubuntu question:  how do i edit menu entries?
[02:38] <Pelo> air0day,  what did you do to it ? it works fine
[02:38] <ademan_> fryfrog: right click on the menu
[02:39] <ademan_> edit menus :-)
[02:39] <fryfrog> oh, duh :)
[02:39] <Pelo> !wireless  | Riyonuk
[02:39] <ubotu> Riyonuk: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:39] <fryfrog> thanks :)
[02:39] <fryfrog> i was right clicking on the entry :)
[02:39] <kuja> fryfrog: System -> Preferences -> Menu Layout
[02:39] <Daehlie> Riyonuk: does the card show up under lspci and does the module for it appear under lsmod?
[02:39] <air0day> Pelo: i used it. and then it used 45% of my cpu. it also paints the screen slowly and is difficult to work with. plus the rss doesnt work at all. it highlights matches like it did in windows, but then doesnt download them.
[02:39] <kuja> Or from the console, type: alacarte
[02:39] <Pelo> air0day,  I don't have this problem it never ever takes more then 3%cpu on mine
[02:39] <ademan_> air0day: akregator   is the name of it, you can check its project page and see if it has the features you want
[02:39] <air0day> okay, well i do. so, is there a way to get a good rss downloader?
[02:39] <air0day> thanks ademan
[02:40] <Riyonuk> woah woah, you lost me :p
[02:41] <Riyonuk> lspci?
[02:41] <Pelo> Riyonuk,  type the nick of the person you are talking to at the begining of the line so they know you are talking to them
[02:42] <Jimb1> test
[02:42] <Riyonuk> Oh
[02:42] <Riyonuk> Pelo, Oh
[02:42] <Riyonuk> Pelo, Ok
[02:42] <Pelo> Riyonuk,  use sparcely
[02:42] <Jimb1> has anyone had any problems using a flat panel monitor after loading the Nvidia drivers available in Synaptic?
[02:42] <Jimb1> considering loading them
[02:43] <Daehlie> Riyonuk: lspci and lsmod are commands that will list the current pci devices and current loaded modules
[02:43] <Riyonuk> Daehlie: Whats lspci
[02:43] <Riyonuk> Ahh
[02:43] <Daehlie> respectively
[02:43] <Riyonuk> I remmber someone telling me that, and they said I needed drivers
[02:44] <Daehlie> if your card does not appear you may need to load a module for it or end up loading the windows drier in ndiswrapper
[02:44] <Riyonuk> well I have the windows driver on my desktop in windows
[02:44] <Jimb1> I previously loaded some Nvidia drivers through automatrix ( I know...bad) and lost the display and had to re install Ubuntu...wondering if the Nvidia drivers in Synaptic are any better.
[02:46] <Jimb1> Are the Nvidia drivers in Synaptic safe to use with a flat panel?
[02:47] <Pelo> Jimb1,  try it and let us know
[02:47] <Jimb1> Pelo, have you heard anything about them?
[02:48] <Pelo> Jimb1,  nope,  but I am guessing that the nvidia drivers from the repos are "endorced" by ubu
[02:48] <Jimb1> so most likely will not kill the display like the ones from automtrix did
[02:48] <Jimb1> I found out about automatrix the hard way
[02:49] <Pelo> I've never had problems with automatix but then I only realy use it for the codec stuff
[02:49] <yaaar> word
[02:49] <Pelo> yep that is a word
[02:50] <Jimb1> Pelo: is there any way to increase the screen resolution without installing the Nvidia stuff?
[02:50] <Jimb1> that you know of
[02:50] <Pelo> Jimb1,  edit xorg.conf
[02:50] <Jimb1> k
[02:50] <Maurox> Jimb1: and why you dont want to install nvidia and stuff ?
[02:50] <Pelo> Jimb1,  you need to add the resolution for choice and adjust the horizontal refresh rate
[02:51] <Jimb1> Mauriox: I installed the Nvidia drivers from automatrix and lost my display. Had to re load ubuntu
[02:51] <Pelo> Jimb1,   stupid queistion do you actualy have an nvidia video card ?
[02:51] <prestosd> kdefrysk? You here?
[02:51] <Maurox> mmmmmm
[02:51] <Jimb1> Yes, Nvidia 4600 on this one
[02:52] <Jimb1> geforce 7600 gt/oc on my windows box
[02:52] <Maurox> Jimb1: did you do some other instalations or upgrading ????
[02:52] <Pelo> Jimb1,   installing ubuntu takes  30 minutes,   install the nvidia drivers from synaptic and if it doesn't work well you'll only have a 30 minute installation to do , I am guessing you've already waisted more time wondering
[02:52] <michaelwilson> my swap isn't working and my memory is constantly showing its almost all being used...
[02:53] <Jimb1> Maurox..probably..this is my 5th day with linux
[02:53] <Jimb1> I was installing all kinds of stuff but those drivers from automatrix was what broke it
[02:53] <Maurox> that could happen if you update your kernel, and you don install linux-headers for  the new kernel
[02:54] <Jimb1> pelo: ubuntu install is only 20 minutes on this machine, but last time I had problems getting second hd to show up
[02:54] <Pelo> Jimb1,   relax then, this isn'T like windows, just backup your /home/user/ folder (including hiddent folder and files) and you'll be fine
[02:54] <Pelo> Jimb1,  but now you know what to do so you'll know how to solve it
[02:55] <Jimb1> Pelo, true
[02:55] <Jimb1> ill install em and see what happens
[02:55] <Jimb1> brb..most likely
[02:55] <Pelo> you'll be fine
[02:55] <michaelwilson> how do youo know if you swap is working?
[02:55] <VigoFusio1> Greetings
[02:55] <Pelo> relax , enjoy the linux experience
[02:56] <Allz> ljl are you alive?
[02:56] <michaelwilson> isnt the swap supposed to kindof belike backuup memory?
[02:56] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: look at top
[02:56] <Eeyore-Jr> swap is used if you are low on memory
[02:56] <Pelo> michaelwilson,   system > admin > system monitor,  second tab  you'll see your virtual memory there which is your swap I beleive
[02:56] <michaelwilson> ok my memory is at full almost all the time... and it shows my swap not even being used
[02:56] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: if you have enogh ram in your system, very little swap will be used.  if you need more ram, you'll know because you'll be using 100's of mb of swap :)
[02:56] <Maurox> yes but you can configure  iit
[02:56] <Pelo> michaelwilson,  swapp is mor like memory extension
[02:56] <Linuturk> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301380 help?
[02:56] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: thats because linux is good about using memory to cache disk info
[02:57] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: as long as you *aren't* using swap, your system is a-okay
[02:57] <michaelwilson> so what does it mean to cache disk info?
[02:57] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: well, aren't using more than a few meg of swap that is
[02:57] <michaelwilson> the whole memory bar is full
[02:57] <ompaul> michaelwilson, that is because your ram is grabbed and made available should the system want it try "free" to have look at swap
[02:57] <lifepositive> michaelwilson: hello
[02:57] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: every time linux reads from the hard drive, it caches as much of the data as possible
[02:57] <fryfrog> michaelwilson: in case you need it again
[02:57] <lifepositive> ademan_: what doesnt work in firefox 2.0?
[02:58] <lifepositive> OmniD: hur mor du? :)

[02:59] <lifepositive> ompaul: ok
[02:59] <michaelwilson> well... the last of the 4 that i cant hide says that Azureus did not shut down tidily.. blah blah blah.
[02:59] <ivx> hello, what command is it to list the processors?
[02:59] <fryfrog> ivx: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[03:00] <ivx> fryfrog thank you
[03:00] <UKMatt> my digital camera used to connect to Ub and not it doesnt, are there any packages I should try install/reinstalling?
[03:00] <Pelo> michaelwilson, those are az warning  ,  you need to quit az before rebooting,  other wise it needs to recheck the downloading files
[03:00] <michaelwilson> how come i cand hide them?
[03:00] <Pelo> michaelwilson,  most  bittorrrent clients do that
[03:01] <Pelo> michaelwilson,  don'T know  maybe an option in az , ask them about it #azureus-support

[03:06] <FantasticFoo> hi. when i try and remove the xorg-driver-fglrx package, it says that it was automatically installed and it suggests i use "apt-get autoremove" to remove it. what's that about? should i use autoremove or what?
[03:06] <dibblego> Aldoliel, what group?
[03:06] <Jimbo> Will this os run at a screen resolution higher than 1024/768 ?
[03:06] <Jadedwolf> No one uses linux to play games?
[03:06] <ivx> harry why not 6.10?
[03:06] <wraithsoul> go into terminal, and type in sudo apt-get remove gnome
[03:06] <wraithsoul> ^.^
[03:07] <wraithsoul> that is a joke.

[03:08] <tklich> it keeps kicking my connection at variable times
[03:08] <X5-452> Uhm... every time I close the screen of my laptop (and the screen blanks) when I open it again the screen resolution has changed to... I don't know how to describe it, I have uploaded a photo here ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/90588480@N00/299765695/ ) Any idea? I am using Ubuntu 6.10
[03:08] <Aldoliel> dibblego, admin
[03:08] <fredJones840> 
[03:08] <ivx> well harry i don't know what vmware workstation is. do you have your ubuntu disk?
[03:09] <Harry> ivx if u dont have vmware then no point of you helping me
[03:09] <Aldoliel> tklich, Why would you want to do that?
[03:09] <Harry> but thanks for the help anyways
[03:09] <dibblego> Aldoliel, probably easier, yes, how does one do that?
[03:09] <Pelo> Harry,  look it up in the forum you'll have a better chance there I think
[03:09] <ivx> yeah harry lets not be mean :(
[03:09] <FantasticFoo> what does it mean if apt bugs me about "autoremove"? anyone know?
[03:09] <Staz> in ubunto how can I release my ip and then request a new one from teh dhcp server?
[03:10] <Aldoliel> System Menu > Administration > Users and Groups
[03:10] <Harry> ivx iw asnt beign mean just that if you didnt know what vmware was then i dont how u could help me
[03:10] <dibblego> Aldoliel, I am not running X - I'll figure it out if you don't know, thanks
[03:10] <hokatichenci> Is there a problem with the dapper portmap?
[03:10] <tklich> Staz, ifconfig yourwirelessadapter down
[03:10] <tklich> then
[03:10] <hokatichenci> Portmap is failing to function and NFS is not working
[03:10] <AngryElf> what path/file does vim load automatically by default?
[03:11] <tklich> Staz, iwconfig your wirelessadapter yourssid key yourkey
[03:11] <AngryElf> i.e. something equivolent to ~/.gnomerc
[03:11] <Staz> cheers
[03:11] <tklich> Staz, dhclient yourwireless adapter
[03:11] <Pelo> X5-452,  try looking up your laptop model in the forum , maybe your problem is covered there
[03:11] <tklich> anybody know how to prevent the computer from looking for an ip every so often?
[03:12] <X5-452> Ok, thanks
[03:12] <tklich> it keeps disconnecting me
[03:12] <Pelo> tklich,   try the forum
[03:13] <dibblego> tklich, I have a USB wireless NIC that disconnects every so often too and it fails to reconnect - I have never figured out why
[03:13] <tklich> dibblego, yeah mine is usb also
[03:13] <dibblego> tklich, it is RT2500 (rausb0) I think
[03:13] <dibblego> the Asus WL-167G to be exact
[03:13] <tklich> dibblego, exactly what i have
[03:13] <tklich> um
[03:14] <tklich> mine is a linksys though
[03:14] <tklich> same chipset though
[03:14] <dibblego> ok
[03:14] <tklich> dibblego, i think it has something to do with trying to pull an IP every so often
[03:14] <dibblego> tklich, well I'm one step closer to a solution - let me know how you go :)
[03:15] <Jadedwolf>  Does anyone know a way to test FPS in linux? just to see if I have a problem with graphics or with game

[03:20] <Pelo> lifepositive, http://doc.vic.computerbank.org.au/tutorials/linuxdirectorystructure/
[03:21] <Aldoliel> Use sudo?

[03:22] <dibblego> according to http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_allow_more_sudoers it is adduser username admin, but this fails with "adduser: The group `admin' does not exist."
[03:22] <Pelo> ...
[03:22] <Harry> it only shows how to isntall vmware on ubuntu
[03:22] <Harry> but i want to install ubuntu with vmware

[03:22] <Pelo> dibblego,  system > admin > user & groups
[03:22] <dibblego> Harry, that is pretty simple - put the CD in and press go
[03:22] <dibblego> Pelo, I am not running X
[03:23] <Pelo> dibblego,  I can'T help then
[03:23] <Aldoliel> dibblego, addgroup admin ?
[03:23] <lifepositive> why doesnt firefox download support resume?
[03:23] <Pelo> lifepositive,  ask the ff ppl
[03:24] <Aldoliel> Then adduser username admin
[03:24] <lifepositive> Pelo: ff?
[03:25] <Pelo> FireFox
[03:25] <dibblego> Aldoliel, that worked thanks - new problems now $ sudo su - sudo: unable to lookup none via gethostbyname()
[03:26] <dibblego> gah, there is no admin group in /etc/sudoers
[03:26] <Aldoliel> dibblego, You sure? There should be
[03:26] <dibblego> not on this machine for some reason
[03:27] <lifepositive> Pelo: ok thanks
[03:27] <cari_tmen_ce> hi....
[03:29] <deema> anybody here use prism54?
[03:29] <Aldoliel> Erm, add it then, with visudo ?
[03:29] <dibblego> I am doing that
[03:29] <Aldoliel> Fair enough
[03:30] <dibblego> it doesn't like the fact that it can't look up its hostname
[03:30] <trappist> if I type 'excel' in the console I get told about gnumeric.  that's pretty awesome.  what does that?  does the same thing for 'traceroute' if I don't have it installed.
[03:30] <Aldoliel> Erm, /etc/hosts ?
[03:31] <Pelo> trappist,  might be part of gnumeric,  I don'T have it installed and I don't get the result you get
[03:32] <trappist> Pelo: I get it on one machine and not another, and they both have gnumeric installed.  And, it also does it for traceroute, with no traceroute installed.  and there's no excel in my $PATH and no shell alias for it.
[03:32] <Aldoliel> I have gnumeric and it doesn't work for me
[03:32] <trappist> Aldoliel: yeah I think there's some other package with like a database of stuff that it'll give you tips about, that I have installed on one box and not another
[03:34] <trappist> oh! the command-not-found package :)
[03:35] <rexbron> I have a question, how would I have my server at home ssh into my webserver and do an rsync backup and automate the whole process?
[03:35] <trappist> rexbron: rsync uses ssh by default - set up your keys (so you don't need a password) and make a cron job for the rsync
[03:36] <rexbron> trappist: could you point me to a sane cron howto?
[03:36] <Kingsqueak> 'man crontab' should tell the tale pretty well
[03:37] <Pelo> what a lovely way of putting it
[03:37] <trappist> rexbron: there's not much to it.  you just make a line like '30 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/myrsyncscript (for one that runs every night at 3:30_
[03:37] <trappist> )
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> sorry, more accurately  'man 5 crontab'
[03:38] <trappist> rexbron: that is, you put that line in your crontab by saying 'crontab -e'
[03:38] <rexbron> can it be in the home dir or must it be in usr/local/bin?
[03:38] <deema> anybody here use islsm?
[03:38] <trappist> rexbron: it can be anywhere, or you can put the rsync command itself in the crontab
[03:38] <rexbron> ok

[03:42] <_allz> hello .i need help .i cant play any movies or stuff .can someone tell me .what i need to unpack from synaptic !.

[03:49] <VigoFuse> Greetings
[03:50] <Pelo> wb VigoFuse
[03:50] <jamesbrink> how can i install linux sources 2.6.17
[03:51] <VigoFuse> Thank you Pello, had to revert to XP to get back, EE froze up.
[03:51] <crimsun> jamesbrink: apt-get install linux-source-2.6.17
[03:51] <crimsun> jamesbrink: why do you need it?
[03:51] <jamesbrink> i need the newer version for bcm43xx
[03:51] <jamesbrink> im currently running 2.6.15
[03:52] <jamesbrink> i need to patch the bcm43xx driver for packet injection
[03:52] <crimsun> many people report that 2.6.17 is no better.
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> interesting if LANG=C manpages are fine but with en_US.utf8 they have mangled characters
=== lastnode__ is now known as lastnode
[03:53] <jamesbrink> crimsun: that did not work, is there a way to search through the list of packages
[03:53] <eegore> I get an error loading vncviewer; channel 3: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed
[03:53] <eegore> ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::EndOfStream
[03:53] <VigoFuse> Some of this is comeing back, been a few years, but the mind stilll works,,,,,,sorta
[03:54] <teledyn> Kingsqueak: that's my LANG setting and man pages display fine
[03:54] <crimsun> jamesbrink: you have to download it manually if you're using dapper.
[03:54] <teledyn> Kingsqueak: it could just be the font you're using in your terminal app
[03:54] <jamesbrink> oh ok
[03:55] <jamesbrink> any particular place i can grab it from
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> teledyn: ah, yeah possibly
[03:55] <jamesbrink> im so use to gentoo i dont know where to find things lol
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> teledyn: ayup, thnx, hadn't thought about that, using an old ansi font
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> actually aterm and rxvt don't like LANG set to en_US.utf8 either with whatever their default font is, maybe it's my fontpath
[03:58] <VigoFuse> aha! the drivers are available, ciao
[03:58] <botxj> awww, i love UTF-8
[03:59] <teledyn> Kingsqueak: try this:  rxvt -fn "-xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--1
[03:59] <teledyn> 2-120-72-72-c-60-iso10646-1"
[03:59] <teledyn> or rxvt -fn "xft:Terminus:pixelsize=15"     you need to install the terminus font for these
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> urxvt: unable to load base fontset, please specify a valid one
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> k
[04:00] <teledyn> rxvt -fn "xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:style=Roman:pixelsize=14"
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> second one worked
[04:00] <nick`> Whats the default root password?
[04:01] <sethk> nick`, with the desktop install, it is set to disable root login.  You can set the root password, or you can use sudo
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> teledyn: thnx, that was pretty annoying, I totally forgot xft works too
=== banned-reload is now known as Tiger_IT
[04:01] <nick`> sethk:  My friend is at my house and im not there, he needs to login and im not giving him my password.  How can he get in?
[04:01] <Pelo> make a new account ?
[04:01] <sethk> nick`, if you can log in remotely, create a new user for him
[04:02] <nick`> sethk, how?
[04:02] <lifepositive> sethk: hello
[04:02] <nick`> i dont have vnc installed on it.
[04:02] <sethk> nick`, with ssh
[04:02] <sethk> nick`, although if you didn't install the ssh server, you can't do that
[04:02] <nick`> sethk: pray tell
[04:02] <lifepositive> sethk: how you been?
[04:02] <nick`> sethk: guess not
[04:02] <sethk> nick`, I'm a bit confused.  You want to give him the root password, but not your own?
[04:02] <nick`> sethk: so is there no way?
[04:02] <lifepositive> LinuxRush: welcome
[04:02] <sethk> lifepositive, fine, thanks.
[04:02] <lifepositive> sethk: :)
[04:03] <nick`> sethk: yep
[04:03] <LinuxRush> hi guys
[04:03] <sethk> nick`, if you did the default install, I think there is no way.
[04:03] <nick`> ><
[04:03] <sethk> nick`, if he has the root password, he can become any user on the system, including you.
[04:03] <lifepositive> if someone stole my system, can they find my Dapper login password and enter my system?
[04:03] <sethk> lifepositive, they can boot a cd and change the password
[04:03] <nick`> sethk: Thats fine and dandy, I just need him on the computer without knowing my password, being as its the same for everything.
[04:03] <psusi> lifepositive: given physical access to the system they don't NEED your password to get in
[04:03] <lifepositive> sethk: what CD?
[04:03] <sethk> lifepositive, which is just as good.  but, technically, no, the password is not reversible.
[04:04] <lifepositive> psusi: so what good is the password if someone can easily get access?
[04:04] <vook> I'm compiling a kernel, and it seems I once again made the mistake of obtaining the source through kernel.org rather than via aptitude.  For those in the know, if I obtain my kernel source via ubuntu sources, will that be enough to allow me to compile in broadcom wifi support? (I hate to waste anymore bandwidth)  -or- is there a way I can download just the Ubuntu patches and use the sources I received from kernel.org??
[04:04] <psusi> technically it is.. it just takes a long time
[04:04] <sethk> lifepositive, any bootable linux cd.  ubuntu install, fedora install, fedora rescue, etc.
[04:04] <lifepositive> sethk: so what good is the password if someone can easily get access?
[04:04] <ale[x] > i'm trying to pxeboot ubuntu and use a local mirror but i seem to be missing a file
[04:04] <ale[x] > nic-restricted-firmware-2.6.17-10-386-di_2.6.17.6-1_i386.udeb
[04:04] <psusi> and you don't even need a cd... you can just ask grub to pass the proper parameters to the kernel and you're at a root shell
[04:04] <sethk> psusi, well, by brute force, trying every possible password, but that's not what he was asking.  :)
[04:04] <lifepositive> sethk: so why bother having a login password then?
[04:04] <teledyn> lifepositive: just su to root than run passwd and set it
[04:04] <ale[x] > the iso only seems to bring nic-restricted-firmware-2.6.17-10-386-di_2.6.17.5-1_i386.udeb
[04:04] <nick`> sethk: If I have a ubuntu live cd, would he be able to get on?
[04:04] <sethk> psusi, that's true, if there is a delay set at the grub prompt.  I take that delay out on sensitive systems.
[04:05] <sethk> nick`, yes, sure.
[04:05] <psusi> lifepositive: because it keeps casual people with physical access out, and keeps those without physical access out
[04:05] <nick`> sethk: what would he have to do?
[04:05] <lifepositive> teledyn: so you mean anyone can easily get access to my system? if so, why bother having a login password?
[04:05] <sethk> nick`, as root, and he'll be able to do whatever you don't want him to do as you.
[04:05] <lifepositive> psusi: ok
[04:05] <teledyn> lifepositive: how could they?
[04:05] <sethk> lifepositive, the assumption is that nobody physically walks away with your machine.
[04:05] <LinuxRush> i would like to know why my ubuntu system acts up, if I start my laptop with the power cable plugged in? This is what happens: I start my laptop, select ubuntu - generic mode, then the splash screen comes up, and I enter my username and password at the login screen, then gnome's dialog box starts (specifying what it's currently doing) and then i see the wallpaper. NOTHING ELSE though :(
[04:05] <psusi> sethk: taking the delay out does nothing, you can still stop it and enter parameters... you need to make it require a password
[04:05] <teledyn> lifepositive: do they have a logon?
[04:05] <lifepositive> psusi: wellI better encrypt everthing then
[04:05] <nick`> sethk: I mean, he puts the ubuntu live cd in the drive, then what does he do
[04:06] <conreyt> where can i get some cool skydomes for compiz?
[04:06] <LinuxRush> but, if i start my laptop without the power cable, everything works fine, gnome loads just fine!
[04:06] <lifepositive> sethk: lucky then I use pgp to encrypt files if its that easy to enter the system
[04:06] <psusi> lifepositive: if you are worried about someone stealing the machine to get to your data, then yea... encrypt it
[04:06] <e3> Crap I was banned at #ubuntu-offtopic for no reason at all. -_-;;
[04:06] <sethk> nick`, he turns the machine on, at least that's what I would do next.  :)
[04:06] <LjL> e3: this is no place to discuss that
[04:06] <sethk> e3, hard to be banned at off topic
[04:07] <reZo> Does anyone know where I could find a binary download of resolveip? My MySQL ./configure is complaining I don't have it.
[04:07] <sethk> LjL, you want him to take it to off topic?  :)
[04:07] <LjL> no... to #ubuntu-ops if he really wants
[04:07] <psusi> lifepositive: more specifically, someone stealing the machine who knows what they are doing and actually cares about your data
[04:07] <e3> And I shall.
[04:07] <Pelo> reZo,  google
[04:07] <nick`> sethk: Please, he has to leave soon, just get this one file and hes gone..  What does he do with the livecd after he puts it in?  Does he have to login?  I've never dealt with livecd's before
[04:07] <lifepositive> psusi: ok cheers
[04:08] <the_ben> what's a good pgp program then?
[04:08] <reZo> Pelo, I'v tried. I can't find it.
[04:08] <psusi> umm.... pgp
[04:08] <nick`> !pgp
[04:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pgp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:08] <nick`> lol
[04:08] <psusi> or gpg
[04:08] <the_ben> straight up pgp, makes since
[04:08] <sethk> nick`, I don't know the ubuntu live cd very well.  I assume that he can just do control-alt-f1 and get a console.
[04:08] <teledyn> the_ben: gnupg
[04:08] <lifepositive> in Firefox, I can save websites in the tool bar! where is this stored as when I upgraded to Firefox 2.0. the websites didnt get copied across!  any ideas?
[04:08] <LinuxRush> guys, help please?
[04:08] <LinuxRush> or point me to the right direction :)
[04:09] <sethk> LinuxRush, I've seen them fail with the battery, but never seen one work with battery and fail with house power.  very odd.
[04:09] <Pelo> LinuxRush,  try the forum
[04:09] <sethk> LinuxRush, I would make my power control settings for both situations identical.
[04:09] <teledyn> Linuturk: maybe turn off gdm and start it
[04:10] <LinuxRush> sethk, i know. this was very weird. and that's not the only problem.... the wireless is not working either... but I have a good feeling that, that problem is very solvable
[04:10] <Jimbo> whats a command to run an installed program ?
[04:10] <LinuxRush> sethk, ok. how do i go about that?
[04:10] <Pelo> Jimbo,  whatever the name of the program is
[04:10] <Jimbo> just type the name in terminal ?
[04:10] <sethk> LinuxRush, I'm not sure, I use kde and gnome does it slightly differently.
[04:10] <LinuxRush> hmm. ok
[04:10] <lifepositive> psusi: I use PGP with an 2048 key!  Can they ever decrypt these files without my  password?
[04:10] <Pelo> Jimbo,  that should do it
[04:10] <sethk> LinuxRush, but look in the screen/desktop configuration, you'll find it.
[04:10] <Jimbo> k thanx
[04:11] <taryn> hi all. trying to install gatos but getting errors compiling about a few __proto packages not found. did a search in synaptic but found nothing.
[04:11] <sethk> lifepositive, well, you can decrypt anything by brute force with enough time.  but theoretically, it's not practical to do so
[04:11] <sethk> lifepositive, anything that uses a key is vulnerable to an attack that tries every possible password
[04:11] <JoshJ> "but theoretically, it's not practical" <-- head explodes
[04:11] <Pelo> taryn,  try looking up shortened version of the names or look them up on google
[04:12] <LinuxRush> sethk, ok. so your suggestion is to keep the power control settings for "plugged in" and "on-battery" same? i am on it! thanks sethk
[04:12] <sethk> LinuxRush, the only thing I can think of that changes.
[04:12] <lifepositive> sethk: ok!
[04:13] <nick`> off topic, but does anyone know a good brute forcer for basic http auth?
[04:13] <lifepositive> in firefox, the search for upgrade option is ghosted!  so how do you check for firefox upgrades?
[04:13] <Pelo>  /ban nick`   no off topic
[04:13] <nick`> =o
[04:13] <Pelo> oh, right, I don'T have ops here
[04:14] <ArrenLex> xD
[04:14] <Somniis>  hi all

[04:15] <SperMite> I have a question! Where do you all go to learn linux commands?
[04:15] <Pelo> PGT2_turbo,  there should be an INSTALL icon on the desktop
[04:16] <Somniis>  learn by doing :)
[04:16] <ale[x] > anyone installing ubuntu using a pxeboot/locally?

[04:19] <jml> so, I'm still trying to get wifi working
[04:19] <dr34mc0d3r> oops.....
[04:19] <PGT2_turbo> so can anyone who has vmware help me
[04:19] <Somniis>  i agree with Dae!
[04:19] <jml> here's a forum post with some info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1773683
[04:19] <conreyt> PGT2_turbo: what do you need?
[04:19] <PGT2_turbo> how do i install ubuntu with vmware
[04:19] <PGT2_turbo> i have to live cd booted
[04:19] <jml> I honestly can't proceed any further without help.
[04:19] <PGT2_turbo> i seee install but i cant click it
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> teledyn: thx, I'd never used that font before, it's nice
[04:20] <LinuxRush> sethk, ok. i found "Power Management Preferences" from "system --> preferences -->" menu and it has three tabs. "Running on AC" "Running on Battery" and "General" and none of the options lead me to belive that they are the culprit. what to do?
[04:20] <omega21> hi there, im trying to get wireless working on a friend's Presario V2000. It supposedly works fine from the wiki. the issue is that it internet doesn't work. Im on another laptop on the same network here.
[04:20] <LinuxRush> it's basic questions as: when lid is closed.... and the answer is the same for both
[04:21] <Somniis>  /msg NickServ IDENTIFY markup101
[04:21] <PGT2_turbo> hello

[04:21] <Maurox> ???
[04:21] <PGT2_turbo> conreyt
[04:21] <Pelo> e3 just back up your home folder and have at it
[04:21] <Maurox> Somniis: nice password :P
[04:21] <Madpilot> Somniis, time for a new freenode password :)
[04:21] <bruenig> e3, how hard should it be. Manually edit the partition table. delete it remake it and then install
[04:21] <psusi> lifepositive: if your key is stored on the computer and they get ahold of it, given enough time they can crack the password.... the more complex your password, the longer it will take
[04:21] <omega21> anyone?
[04:22] <Somniis>  not my fault. :P this client is not recognizing the /msg command for some reason
[04:22] <Somniis>  but ty
[04:22] <cfedde> leading space
[04:22] <Somniis>  i had no leading space
[04:22] <cfedde> cool!
[04:22] <TiG4> *** how do i extract an archive with a password? Whenever I try opening it in archive manager I get an error saying incorrect password and cant even extract it?
[04:22] <LjL> that's why messages to nickserv should always be typed in the status window :)
[04:23] <lifepositive> psusi: my PGP password is 18 cjaracters
[04:23] <psusi> lifepositive: with a decently complex password though, it would likely take someone months or years to crack it... a simple password could be cracked in minutes though
[04:23] <omega21> like, it seems to connect, then it deactivates.
[04:23] <Pelo> TiG4,  do you have the password ?
[04:23] <TiG4> pelo yes
[04:23] <psusi> lifepositive: letters, numbers, and symbols?
[04:23] <lifepositive> psusi: both! spaces too
[04:23] <keegan_> Hello Everyone, I am using Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft.  I am trying to watch a movie on the internet using Firefox + Mplayer.  The format of the movie its streaming is .mov which I believe I need the quicktime codec which I have,  I also have the win32codecs.  My problem is when it finished loading it just stops and won't play it.  Does anyone have a fix for this problem?
[04:23] <Pelo> TiG4,  instead of extracting the file open it with the archive manager and look in the options for where to put the password
[04:23] <TiG4> i cant
[04:24] <TiG4> it wont open
[04:24] <TiG4> says incorrect password
[04:24] <Somniis>  keegan_: yes, don't use quicktime :)
[04:24] <Somniis>  lol if you can
[04:24] <PGT2_turbo> do any of you have vmware?
[04:24] <Pelo> TiG4,   caps ?
[04:24] <keegan_> How am I suppose to watch it then?
[04:24] <TiG4> nm pelo
[04:24] <lifepositive> psusi: how long would breaking a 2048 key with an 18 character password take?
[04:24] <omega21> can someone please help me? i really need internet on this notebook
[04:24] <psusi> lifepositive: then I'd say you are prety damn safe
[04:24] <psusi> lifepositive: key length is meaningles if they have your certificate
[04:25] <Pelo> g'night folks
[04:25] <psusi> lifepositive: given the key file the only thing they have to break is your password
[04:25] <lifepositive> psusi: whats my cretificate?
[04:25] <workbean> guys, is it normal for the "menubar" font of firefox to look different from the other apps?
[04:25] <psusi> lifepositive: but even 18 characters of letters, numbers, and other symbols, that's prety damn safe
[04:25] <omega21> workbean: yes.
[04:25] <psusi> lifepositive: the file that contains your private/public keypair
[04:25] <omega21> workbean: its a gtk application
[04:25] <LinuxRush> omega21, did you search for the drivers? i have the same problem and I searched the ubuntu forums and found a good walk through for enabling the wireless internet access
[04:25] <psusi> lifepositive: aka 'keyring'
[04:25] <workbean> omega21: so nautilus isn't?
[04:26] <conreyt> PGT2_turbo: what's up
[04:26] <workbean> or are you talking about the different versions of GTK?
[04:26] <coolsax98> my install keeps freezing during install, I've tried manually partitioning the drives and that gets it to about 82% before it freezes
[04:26] <omega21> linuxrush: could you link me?
[04:26] <LjL> lifepositive, you should be more worried about side attacks - like your machine being trojaned and the passphrase sniffed. 18 characters in a strong passphrase, itself, should be good. although you shouldn't have told us it's 18 chars, that's an important information to start with
[04:26] <LinuxRush> k
[04:26] <LinuxRush> holdup
[04:26] <omega21> linuxrush: i thought it wold work out of the box
[04:26] <lifepositive> psusi: ah ok!  so if they got the secret keyring, they can break password easier?
[04:26] <omega21> linuxrush: thanks!! :)
[04:27] <Somniis>  the key is everything
[04:27] <coolsax98> any ideas?
[04:27] <lifepositive> LjL: its not 18 characters ;)  its more I counted ;)
[04:27] <LjL> lifepositive, if they don't get to the secret keyring, your password is useless (and they can't break it since they can't check it against something)
[04:27] <lifepositive> LjL: how can I check for trojans?
[04:27] <_allz> please help .i have installd many stuff codecs but i cant play anything .yeah i can play movies in my computer but nothing on a website !!!
[04:27] <_allz> what could be wrong
[04:27] <psusi> lifepositive: the password protects the keyring... without the keyring, it is virtually impossible to decrypt your file
[04:27] <lifepositive> LjL: how can I check for trojans that can side attack my sys?
[04:28] <Kingsqueak> _allz: got the mozilla-mplayer plugin installed?
[04:28] <LjL> lifepositive, you stay up with security updates, avoid running untrusted executables (like stuff not from the repos), and perhaps periodically check with programs like rkhunter or chkrootkit
[04:28] <lifepositive> psusi: ok!  but that means I must enrypt the keyring
[04:28] <Somniis>  _allz: does the website require flash?
[04:28] <workbean> I must say, firefox 2.0 is much snappier than previous versions
[04:28] <keegan_> Could someone help me with a mplayer plugin problem
[04:28] <keegan_> please
[04:28] <ivx> what would the easiest way to use a printer connected to another computer connected to my router be?
[04:28] <lifepositive> LjL: ok thanks
[04:28] <LinuxRush> omega21, : ya.. life would be great if Everything worked out of the box... but the reality is, the GIANT in computer op. sys is MS ;( therefore, the majorly all companies develop drivers for it and very few develop it for other OS's. the rest of the work is done by the great people of the linux community
[04:28] <lifepositive> LjL: every day I type sudp apt-get update and upgrade
[04:28] <_allz> somniis no
[04:28] <Kingsqueak> ivx: what OS is on the computer where the printer is attached?
[04:28] <lifepositive> LjL: and i run rootkithunter
[04:28] <omega21> linuxrush: i know, but the laptoptestingteam wiki page just said it "works"
[04:29] <psusi> lifepositive: it is encrypted... that's what the password is for
[04:29] <ivx> kingsqueak ubuntu on both.
[04:29] <jvai> keegan: try this..
[04:29] <_allz> kingsqueak yeah i just installd mozilla mplayer should it work now?
[04:29] <Kingsqueak> ivx: setup cups to allow sharing on the network, on the machine with the printer, setup cups for a 'network printer' using 'ipp' as the type on the other one, should be good to go
[04:29] <psusi> lifepositive: your public/private keypair is used to encrypt a random key... the random key is used to encrypt your file.... your password is used to encrypt your private key
[04:30] <keegan_> jvai: try what?
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> _allz: if you put in 'about:plugins' does it show up, in the URL box
[04:30] <jvai> in firefox.. go to tools-page info, then try to save the movie to harddrive.. then point it to mplayer
[04:30] <ivx> kingsqueak all try to swing that if not i'll try to hit you up will you be here for a while
[04:30] <lifepositive> psusi: ok
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> ivx: sure, if not, others should be able to help
[04:31] <psusi> lifepositive: so to decrypt the file you need the random key.. only way to decrypt the random key is with your private 2048 bit key ( the random key is much shorter ), and the only way you can decrypt the private key stored in your keyring file is with your password, make sense?
[04:31] <keegan_> jvai: Thats how I am going to have to do it everytime?
[04:31] <lifepositive> psusi: are you a secruity expert?
[04:31] <lifepositive> psusi: makes sense after I read it 3 times :)
[04:31] <lifepositive> psusi: hehe ;)
[04:31] <jvai> well. maybe for the 1's that wont play
[04:31] <_allz> kingsqueak what do you mean :S
[04:31] <psusi> lifepositive: not sure what makes someone an 'expert' but I an quite knowlegable
[04:31] <lifepositive> psusi: i can tell :)
[04:31] <jvai> it's a shot in the dark keegan
[04:31] <_allz> kingsqueak okei i am gonna tell you the secret :S i am trying to play porn movie on the website
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> _allz: in the browser, enter in 'about:config' as a URL, no http, nothing else
[04:31] <_allz> i am bad boy :S
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> _allz: see if it shows mplayer plugin listed
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> and if you get it working stileproject works just fine with it ;-)
[04:32] <bruenig> kingrayray, about:plugins
[04:32] <bruenig> Kingsqueak, about:plugins
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> bruenig: doh, thnx
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> _allz: about:plugins   not config
[04:32] <bruenig> stupid tab completion
[04:32] <kingrayray> lol
[04:33] <kingrayray> too many kings :)
[04:33] <_allz> kingsqueak what do you mean like this about:plugins/www.blalvlabla.com?
[04:33] <ivx> kingsqueak, i went into the properties for the printer, and went to the connection tab and selected network printer for the type. what goes into the URL box? The ip of that computer from dhcp?
[04:33] <Kingsqueak> _allz: just 'about:plugins'
[04:33] <aj__> ok something broke wireless with edgy
[04:34] <aj__> some update
[04:34] <Kingsqueak> _allz: nothing else
[04:34] <aj__> anyone else seeing this?
[04:34] <bruenig> aj__, what was the update
[04:34] <aj__> i'm thinking either xorg or nvidia
[04:34] <keegan_> jvai: I get "Error opening/initializing the slected video_out (-vo) device"
[04:34] <aj__> i saw someone mention this on the forums
[04:34] <kingrayray> xorg or nvidia wouldn't break wireless would it? O.o
[04:34] <aj__> you wouldn't think so
[04:34] <kingrayray> like, does that even make sense
[04:34] <bruenig> odd none of those have anything to do with networking
[04:34] <aj__> but thats the only update i've had
[04:34] <Kingsqueak> nvidia can if you remove restricted-modules in the process
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> you need to blacklist modules rather than remove all the restricted-modules package
[04:35] <aj__> well i had an update kernel recently from updates i think
[04:35] <lifepositive> Kingsqueak: hey hey
[04:35] <bruenig> aj__, correlation is not = to causation
[04:35] <_allz> kingsqueak okei i dont see .S this player that i installd there
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> _allz: do you see at least some plugins?
[04:35] <_allz> yeah
[04:35] <aj__> i'm not sure what broke exactly but something changed all of a sudden
[04:36] <_allz> i see applicatioon/x-mplayer2
[04:36] <_allz> is it installd?
[04:36] <Kingsqueak> _allz: you will see a bunch of entries mentioning it if it is installed
[04:36] <aj__> but i was using the bcm43xx module and even tried the ndiswrapper and they both do the same thing
[04:37] <_allz> i see many stuff
[04:37] <_allz> kingsqueak in there
[04:37] <aj__> basically linux finds my device but i can't set it to a essid or anything and it can't find any essid's by scanning
[04:37] <jamesbrink> is there a quick howto on compiling a new kernel in ubuntu
[04:37] <_allz> kingsqueak you want screen shoot?
[04:38] <Kingsqueak> _allz: that would be good yeah
[04:38] <LinuxRush> omega: i gonna go login into my windows, and get the bookmark. apparently, i cannot find it on the forums
[04:38] <LinuxRush> eh
[04:38] <ivx> can anyone tell me what to put in the text box that says url when i go to the printer properties, select connection, and change type to network printer?
[04:38] <LinuxRush> thanks all for the help ;) be back in a few mins.
[04:38] <ivx> do i make something up or what?
[04:38] <JoshJ> the printer's IP address i'd assume
[04:38] <jamesbrink> lol
[04:38] <jamesbrink> yeah
[04:39] <ivx> yeah it doesn't have one it is connected to the computer
[04:39] <jamesbrink> you can make one up if you want
[04:39] <Harry> how do i install ubuntu in vmware
[04:39] <Harry> ?
[04:39] <Harry> i need help bad
[04:39] <Daehlie> Harry: i would suggest using the install disc
[04:39] <sethk> ivx, you mean for the name?  you can use any name, yes
[04:39] <sethk> Harry, badly
[04:39] <ivx> jamesbrink do you know how to do printer sharring with cups, that is basically what i need
[04:39] <Harry> i ahve th einstall disc
[04:40] <Harry> okay i get th elive cd to boot in vmware
[04:40] <ivx> sethk then i just use that name on the other somputer and it will find it?
[04:40] <Harry> but then my mouse idsappears once i lcik somehting in ubuntu
[04:40] <Harry> disappears*
[04:40] <sethk> ivx, I'm not sure I know where you are.  for scanning you don't need to put anything
[04:40] <Harry> click*
[04:40] <Daehlie> Harry: use the alternate cd, it will allow a more standard text install that will be more vmware friendly i think
[04:40] <_allz> kingsqueak what is the site agein to post image
[04:40] <_allz> !image
[04:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about image - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:40] <sethk> ivx, are you trying to get to a printer attached to a windows box?
[04:41] <ivx> sethk no another ubuntu box
[04:41] <Daehlie> look on the ubuntu website for the alternate install image, it should be after the desktop and server images
[04:41] <sethk> ivx, then just edit your cups client configuration and put the server ip in it
[04:41] <NChief> which port does remote desktop run on?
[04:42] <eegore> exit
[04:42] <_allz> kingsqueak what is the site agein to post image

[04:43] <Kingsqueak> _allz: is there a 'plugins' directory there?
[04:43] <NChief> which port does remote desktop usw?
[04:43] <NChief> which port does remote desktop use?
[04:43] <NChief> :p
[04:43] <Blue-Steel> 3389
[04:43] <Blue-Steel> or something like that
[04:43] <NChief> ok, can use remote desktop between windows and ubuntu?
[04:44] <Slyth100> Can somebody help me with a problem I keep getting while trying to compile the kernel source??? THis is the error I keep getting - gcc-3.3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o scripts/mkdep scripts/mkdep.c
[04:44] <Slyth100> make: gcc-3.3: Command not found
[04:44] <Slyth100> make: *** [scripts/mkdep]  Error 127
[04:44] <JoshJ> !vnc
[04:44] <ubotu> vnc is a way of doing remote desktop.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !freenx.
[04:44] <_allz> no such a file drioctory :S
[04:44] <jrib> NChief: 5900 iirc
[04:44] <_allz> kingsqueak
[04:44] <ivx> sethk, i don't know anything about cups, can you walk me trought it maby?
[04:44] <Kingsqueak> _allz: so you are in .mozilla now right?
[04:44] <kitche> Slyth100: did you install build-essential?
[04:44] <bruenig> Slyth100, have you install build-essential?
[04:44] <Slyth100> Yes
[04:44] <NChief> jrib: iirc?
[04:44] <jrib> NChief: if I recall correctly
[04:44] <_allz> no i am not in mozzilla
[04:44] <_allz> kingsqueak
[04:44] <NChief> jrib: ok, thnx :)
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> _allz: do   cd ~/.mozilla
[04:45] <_allz> kingsqueak  i dont even know where the heck is mozilla in my computer :S
[04:45] <Slyth100> Any ideas?
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> _allz: this is a directory I'm telling you to go ti
[04:45] <bruenig> !info gcc
[04:45] <ubotu> gcc: The GNU C compiler. In component main, is optional. Version 4:4.1.1-6ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 5 kB, installed size 64 kB
[04:45] <Zirjoker> what are the most useful terminal based applications (like wget) i want to get the ports for windows
[04:45] <_allz> nope
[04:45] <_allz> kingsqueak  not found
[04:45] <_allz> it says
[04:45] <jrib> NChief: I think we are both right, 5900 for ubuntu's remote desktop and 3389 for window's
[04:45] <bruenig> Slyth100, perhaps version number problems?
[04:45] <bruenig> just a guess
[04:45] <NChief> jrib: ok :)
[04:46] <aj__> i'm giving up on wireless for now but i wonder if others are having same problems i've only seen one post so far
[04:46] <aj__> i have a broadcom 4306 btw
[04:46] <Kingsqueak> _allz: try this      cd && cd .mozilla
[04:46] <kitche> Slyth100: which version of ubuntu do you use?
[04:46] <sethk> aj__, there are tons of posts about wireless problems, and this doesn't sound dissimilar
[04:46] <aj__> oh i see
[04:46] <aj__> sometimes i hate wireless horribly
[04:46] <Slyth100> bruenig and kitche - I use ubuntu 6.06
[04:47] <bruenig> Slyth100, I meant for gcc
[04:47] <Kingsqueak> _allz: you there now?

[04:47] <_allz> bash: cd: .mozilla: No such file or directory
[04:48] <bruenig> Slyth100, the error message was complaining about 3.something or other
[04:48] <Kingsqueak> _allz: you are running an installed Ubuntu right?
[04:48] <kitche> Slyth100: for some reason your linux is looking for gcc-3.3 which is usually a symlink to gcc
[04:48] <Slyth100> OK
[04:48] <bruenig> hmmm

[04:50] <ivx> jrib thanks, community support is way fast!
[04:51] <zarul> I wonder why anybody wants to flood this channel
[04:51] <VigoFusion> That was wildly unkool, thank you whomever handled the goofs
[04:51] <_allz> kingsqueak if you mean  .the sudo stufff no
[04:51] <_allz> kingsqueak if you mean .i am in my usr drioctory then yes
[04:51] <zarul> should be someone from Mircosoft or Apple

[04:51] <jtf0518> and they were from Brazil
[04:51] <Mez> zarul because we have people in here and some people are **************
[04:52] <zarul> yeah..
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> _allz: you are doing something funny here, you *have* to have a .mozilla directory there
[04:52] <Slyth100> bruenig
[04:52] <bruenig> Slyth100,
[04:52] <_allz> okei
[04:52] <_allz> kingsqueak so i should creat mozilla dricotroy?
[04:52] <Slyth100> bruenig - should I edit the top of the make file???
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> _allz: what does   'pwd'  output?
[04:53] <sethk> that looked more like a mistake than a spam, but it's just as annoying
[04:53] <bruenig> Slyth100, no idea, don't compile much myself, not since I began using ubuntu at least
[04:53] <_allz> allz@Allz:~$ pwd
[04:53] <_allz> /home/allz
[04:53] <_allz> kingsqueak
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> _allz: now   cd .mozilla
[04:53] <sethk> Kingsqueak, print working directory.    the current directory   ?  (I know, that wasn't a question, but I couldn't resist.)
[04:53] <boris55> wow. have to register now for ubuntu..
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> sethk: heh
[04:53] <_allz> kingsqueak i dont understand you ! .should i creat mozilla folder ?
[04:53] <VigoFusion> Ok, I am stuck in 650x800 mode? Total newb to Linux/Debian, the autodetect or get-apt or sumo ati is ?
[04:53] <_allz> cause there is no folder called mozilla
[04:54] <_allz> in my /Home/allz/
[04:54] <Kingsqueak> _allz: no, it should be there, not 'mozilla' but '.mozilla'
[04:54] <kitche> _allz: it's a hidden folder
[04:54] <Kingsqueak> _allz: cd '.mozilla'
[04:54] <bruenig> _allz, there is a period in front of the mozilla .mozilla
[04:54] <thrice`> _allz: cd ~/.mozilla

[04:57] <boris55> is #ubuntu+1 channel up and running, yet?

[04:58] <ashzilla> Hi. How can I completel uninstall azureus.
[04:59] <kitche> LGKeiz: Glined you wouldn't have gotten back on
[04:59] <_allz> kingsqueak i know what you are trying to say .but i cant find the drioctory .sorry :S i have done allt he stuff go to the folder and do /home/allz/.m but cant anything with mozilla
[04:59] <bruenig> ashzilla, sudo apt-get remove azureus
[04:59] <LGKeiz> Kitche - I envaded
[04:59] <stiffme1983> apt-get remove --purge?
[04:59] <jrib> heh collateral damage
[04:59] <bruenig> ashzilla, did you install it another way like through automatix which gets the beta?
[04:59] <ivx> oh yeah thanks it worked that time
[04:59] <Kingsqueak> _allz: I don't know what to say, it should be there, there may be something off with your install but I'm not sure
[05:00] <nalioth> LGKeiz: you may resume your regular connection
[05:00] <HLM> bbl
[05:00] <Kingsqueak> _allz: try this   'cd ; mkdir .mozilla'
[05:00] <Kingsqueak> _allz: type that but without the quotes ''s
[05:00] <_allz> then?
[05:00] <Kingsqueak> _allz: k, one sec
[05:00] <bruenig> firefox makes a .mozilla directory if you run it and there isn't one
[05:00] <thrice`> _allz: ls -a ~ | grep -i moz
[05:00] <thrice`> does that give anything ?
[05:01] <_allz> is he right ?
[05:01] <_allz> kingsqueak
[05:01] <Kingsqueak> _allz: yeah, it should have just made the dir when you run it
[05:01] <thrice`> you will not have a .mozilla unless you've ran firefox
[05:01] <Kingsqueak> _allz: that's why I don't understand why it isn't there
[05:01] <_allz> okei it worked
[05:01] <_allz> now what?
[05:01] <_allz> allz@Allz:~$  ls -a ~ | grep -i moz
[05:01] <_allz> mozcontrol.tgz

[05:01] <thrice`> :-\
[05:02] <Kingsqueak> _allz:  mkdir .mozilla/plugins
[05:02] <_allz> then?
[05:02] <iCod> Hey, is anyone really knowledgable on alsa? or has a Createive SB 24 bit?
[05:02] <Kingsqueak> _allz: now, cd .mozilla/plugins
[05:02] <jamesbrink> where is the doc on compiling a new kernel?
[05:02] <Kingsqueak> _allz: type 'pwd' and be sure you are in that directory
[05:02] <_allz> then :P
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> _allz: what does 'pwd' output?
[05:03] <_allz> -> /home/allz/.mozilla/plugins
[05:03] <e3> Anyone Know....     What.... is the terminal command... to switch from Ubuntu 6.10..... to Kubuntu 6.10 DVD for AMD64 processors....??
[05:03] <jrib> !kde | e3
[05:03] <ubotu> e3: KDE (http://kde.org) is the K Desktop Environment. To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop", or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE for other ways to get KDE
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> _allz: cut and paste this exactly       for i in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug-in* ; do ln -s $i . ; done
[05:04] <Kingsqueak> for i in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug-in* ; do ln -s $i . ; done
[05:04] <Kingsqueak> might be easier to paste that second line
[05:04] <_allz> okei now i dont understand :S
[05:04] <_allz> cut and paste
[05:04] <Kingsqueak> _allz: or type it, but it has to be exactly as I just showed it
[05:04] <ivx> if i don't remember what i neamed my computer how do i check
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> ivx: 'hostname'
[05:05] <ivx> thanks
[05:05] <thrice`> Kingsqueak: why are you having him symlink?  FF will look there natively
[05:05] <_allz> "/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug-in* ; do ln -s $i ." <- is this a command
[05:05] <bruenig> thrice`, what else, copy it over?
[05:05] <_allz> :) i am new to linux .kingasqueak
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> _allz: yes, the *whole* line
[05:06] <jrib> thrice`: ff2.0 in edgy doesn't seem to look in /usr/lib/mozilla
[05:06] <Kingsqueak> all the way to 'done'
[05:06] <VigoFusion> I am useing Gnome desktop, is that why I screen is 600x800?
[05:06] <thrice`> really?  that's odd =\
[05:06] <thrice`> sorry :)
[05:06] <Kingsqueak> thrice`: I had to manually link mine for mozilla-mplayer
[05:06] <bruenig> I think it may look in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins

[05:08] <thrice`> _allz: you need the first part:  for i in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug-in*; do ln -s $i .; done
[05:08] <iCod> anyone? sorry to be impatient
[05:08] <LinuxRush> did omega return?
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> lifepositive: that's a server error
[05:09] <_allz> kingsqueak -> ; do ln -s $i . ; done
[05:09] <Kingsqueak> lifepositive: coming from wherever you pointed the browser
[05:09] <_allz> this the output :S
[05:09] <rickyfingers> iCod, I think the driver for that was compiled in to the kernel a long time ago
[05:09] <lifepositive> Kingsqueak: whats causing it and whats the solution?
[05:09] <rickyfingers> what's your problem, no sound?
[05:09] <CPrgmSwR2> I sent my friend a ubuntu cd that I burnt but his computer won't boot off of it
[05:09] <CPrgmSwR2> is there a reason for this
[05:09] <CPrgmSwR2> It worked on my computer
[05:09] <CPrgmSwR2> and his computer can boot from a windows cd
[05:09] <iCod> rickyfingers, i thought so too, yet I have no input
[05:09] <Kingsqueak> bruenig: doesn't need to be root for that btw
[05:09] <LinuxRush> if he does, here's the link: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25683 <===for the wireless config. ;)
[05:09] <rickyfingers> iCod: ok, so you can hear sound, but not record it?
[05:10] <LinuxRush> for broadcom chipset
[05:10] <Kingsqueak> bruenig: and I was just trying to setup the mplayer plugin, the rest should be o.k.
[05:10] <lifepositive> my DVD drive wont read DVD but it still reads Audio CD! Do DVD drives come with 2 lasers, one for reading DVD and the other for reading CD?
[05:10] <iCod> correct
[05:10] <Kingsqueak> lifepositive: I forget what a 550 is
[05:10] <bruenig> I thought you did, maybe because I have never symlinked to the home folder
[05:10] <_allz> kingsqueak -> ; do ln -s $i . ; done            what is next?
[05:11] <Kingsqueak> lifepositive: what is the URL?
[05:11] <rickyfingers> iCod: do you know if you're using ALSA or OSS?
[05:11] <ivx> i am having trouble getting cups working, what else do i have to do besides modify my conf file to what's on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=163882, add the proper adress on both ends, and restart cups? could my router be blocking port 631 internally?
[05:11] <iCod> alsa
[05:11] <Kingsqueak> _allz: scroll back, you aren't running the full command I told you to run

[05:13] <ArrenLex> Kingsqueak: won't it work to just ln -s /usr/lib/...whatever.../mplayerplugin-in* ~/.mozilla/plugins ?
[05:13] <Kingsqueak> lifepositive: well it's the server
[05:13] <ashzilla> Hi
[05:13] <_allz> kingsqueak -> what do you mean you give me -> for i in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug-in* ; do ln -s $i . ; done
[05:13] <Kingsqueak> ArrenLex: dunno, my command will do it for sure
[05:13] <_allz> and i did it
[05:13] <ArrenLex> Kingsqueak: yes it will. Just tested it.
[05:13] <ArrenLex> Kignsqueak: sure is easier.
[05:14] <Kingsqueak> _allz: close firefox and start it again and enter 'about:plugins' in it again
[05:14] <lifepositive> Kingsqueak: my DVD drive, it reads audio CD but no longer reads DVD's!  any ideas whats happened?  Do DVD drives come with 2 lasers, one for reading DVD and the other for reading CD?

[05:14] <rickyfingers> iCod: I'm not too much of an expert on alsa, but I was just checking out a page I googled:  http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=438831
[05:15] <Kingsqueak> wildcards tend to go wild
[05:15] <ArrenLex> Kingsqueak: you used one!!!!
[05:15] <rickyfingers> iCod: there's some good info there.
[05:15] <iCod> rickyfingers, I'll look at it
[05:15] <ArrenLex> Kingsqueak: I took YOUR OWN wildcard, and took it out of a loop! That's it!
[05:15] <Kingsqueak> yeah I guess it's similar
[05:15] <Kingsqueak> I like 'for' heh
[05:15] <ArrenLex> George Bush likes the look and feel of paper? =P

[05:49] <Mez> sorry Clin1 had to mute you there a sec ;)
[05:49] <Mez> spam ;)
[05:49] <Clin1> why does this channel hate me some much
[05:49] <crimsun> I think it's pretty obvious that Mez has sufficient chanserv privs to have ops in this channel.
[05:49] <Clin1> what ever
[05:50] <Mez> Clin1, it doesnt hate you - just had to stop the spam ;)
[05:50] <Clin1> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32467/
[05:51] <crimsun> if you have any doubt as to why he should have such privs, please refer to his Launchpad page. This topic does not need to be discussed further.
[05:51] <Clin1> Wo, mez whaat is that
[05:53] <Kingsqueak> what's a launchpad page?
[05:53] <Mez> !launchpad > Kingsqueak
[05:53] <kitche> !launchpad|Kingsqueak
[05:53] <ubotu> Kingsqueak: launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's Bounty and Bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/
[05:53] <Kingsqueak> well I see that, you host that site Mez?  I didn't get the odd reference
[05:54] <Mez> kitche, great minds think alike, whats the excuse
[05:54] <meheren> can someone point me in the right direction of how to find out what type of graphics card i have and te install and set up the apporpriate driver?
[05:54] <meheren> it's an ati radeon i beleive... but not sure
[05:54] <Mez> Kingsqueak, all ubuntu people have pages on launchpad - mine, for example is http://www.launchpad.net/people/mez/
[05:54] <Clin1> not me hehe
[05:54] <Kingsqueak> ah o.k.
[05:54] <Mez> Kingsqueak, it shows who I am, what I'm part of etc etc
[05:54] <crimsun> Kingsqueak: he's respected enough in the community to have sufficient chanserv privileges. It was a reference for Clin1 to follow.
[05:55] <JoshJ> that page doesn't show everyone that's an op
[05:55] <JoshJ> i think that page only shows admins
[05:55] <Mez> JoshJ, https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-irc
[05:55] <JoshJ> i was referring to what Clin1 linked
[05:56] <Mez> JoshJ, no  thats cs info i do believe ;) /cs access #ubuntu lists is what tyou should see
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> ah interesting
[05:56] <JoshJ> ah, nice
[05:56] <meheren> how can i find out what type of video card im running?
[05:57] <Kingsqueak> with Ubuntu, can people submit some way, patches to package builds etc. without having to actually own the packages...meaning will they be accepted or is it ultra closed like Debian was
[05:57] <crimsun> Kingsqueak: yes, see #ubuntu-motu
[05:57] <Mez> Kingsqueak, we accept patches - see #ubuntu-motu
[05:57] <Clin1> Hey i do have a launchpaad https://launchpad.net/people/clintchance
[05:57] <Kingsqueak> I do a ton of packaging etc. for the job, don't have a ton of spare cycles to really be on the 'team' as it were but I could likely help when I see things etc.
[05:57] <Mez> !motu > Kingsqueak
[05:57] <Clin1> but not on any teams
[05:58] <Kingsqueak> cool
[05:58] <Kingsqueak> thnx for the info
[05:58] <Kingsqueak> like this distro quite a lot, have spread it all over the building at work...got Dapper on our PXE server now too
[05:59] <crimsun> excellent
[05:59] <shorthorns> Hi
[05:59] <Mez> Kingsqueak, PXE is evil
[06:01] <Kingsqueak> PXE is handy though ;-)
[06:01] <Kingsqueak> we jump a lot of things, even BIOS updates off that
[06:01] <Mez> Kingsqueak, not if you're using netrunner it's not - it's evil
[06:05] <emilia> does anyone know how to change the layout of gaim so that the msn icon for someones contact becomes their display pic instead of having the display pic on the right hand side of their name?
[06:06] <shorthorns> Has someone experienced tearing at video-playback? I'm using working ati-drivers.
[06:06] <fgeller> hi, i'm having problems with running a jar file I exported from an eclipse project, I get: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
[06:06] <fgeller> anyone an idea what this is?
[06:06] <kitche> shorthorns: what kind of video is it could be dealing with codecs
[06:07] <SurfnKid> how come when new apps are installed, not all come out on the APPS menu?
[06:07] <hokatichenci> Hm, is there a built in script to handle saving/restoring iptables rules?
[06:09] <barrett9h> SurfnKid: it's a per-package setting to be included or not. It will only happen if the package maker configured it to do so.
[06:09] <ArrenLex> Does anyone know where I would ask if I want to configure how long my router keeps ARP tables?
[06:09] <SurfnKid> barrett9h, yeah i thought so too but not even one package i install goes ont he menu
[06:09] <SurfnKid> must all be cli then
[06:10] <kitche> SurfnKid: what package?
[06:10] <Mez> ArrenLex, look up iptables/ipchains
[06:10] <ArrenLex> Mez: not software -- hardware router.
[06:10] <hokatichenci> ArrenLex, if its not a homebrewed solution I doubt you'll be able to
[06:10] <Mez> ArrenLex, look up your manualthen ;)
[06:10] <SurfnKid> a bunch of calendar packagees
[06:11] <kitche> SurfnKid: did you check under Office?
[06:11] <lufis> I notice that Ubuntu edgy is for 386, but my hardware is 686. There are no alternative 686 kernels in the repos though. Is it already for my hardware?
[06:11] <ArrenLex> hok\Mez: Okay. Thanks.
[06:11] <hokatichenci> ARP isn't exactly a performance killer though so I don't see why'd you need to change it unless you're running into some weird problem
[06:11] <ArrenLex> lufis: the kernel is "generic" and works for everything.

[06:13] <hokatichenci> WoL used mac addresses, and arp is for mac/ip resolution i thought
[06:13] <SurfnKid> Mez, yeah, not a good business :P
[06:13] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: what's the prob?
[06:13] <Onwlyix> Well, I downloaded Ubuntu and burned it to a CD wish Imgburn, but it won't boot. It doesn't recognize it as bootable, or it can;t find an OS, or something.
[06:13] <Mez> SurfnKid, the ubuntu-calendar packages are just wallpapers really IIRC
[06:14] <SurfnKid> i see
[06:14] <ArrenLex> Onwlyix: your BIOS is configured to boot from CD first?
[06:14] <Onwlyix> Yeah, I tried that
[06:14] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: you probably burned the image as a fie
[06:14] <Onwlyix> it booted from the hard drive anyway
[06:14] <rickyfingers> *file
[06:14] <Onwlyix> so I disabled the hard drive
[06:14] <Onwlyix> and it said it didn't find anything on the CD
[06:14] <rickyfingers> not as an image
[06:14] <Onwlyix> It works running it from windows
[06:14] <Onwlyix> I get the browser thing
[06:15] <Onwlyix> plus, there's all the folders and stuff
[06:15] <barrett9h> SurfnKid: you should know what a package does. if it is really a gui app that should be included in the menu, and it's not, discover the executable name (try running it from a terminal), and add it manually to the menu.
[06:15] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: ok I'm wrong
[06:15] <_3fg> Hey, I installed EasyUbuntu to get mp3s working, but I can't run it.
[06:15] <SurfnKid> barrett9h, yep thats what ive been doing since
[06:15] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: most defintely a bios setting problem
[06:16] <Onwlyix> How do I fix it?

[06:16] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: it's a very bios specific problem
[06:16] <_3fg> kitche: I've done both, they don't help
[06:16] <_3fg> the 11 members of the channel are inactive
[06:16] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: your best bet is just to google for the manufacturer/version of the bios that you have
[06:17] <Onwlyix> k. I have a Dell.
[06:17] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: you should see what version the bios is the very beginning of the boot.
[06:17] <Onwlyix> Ok, I'll do that
[06:17] <Onwlyix> Then just google that along with CD boot or something?
[06:18] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: yes, I think that'd be a good search string.
[06:18] <Onwlyix> k. I'll go ahead and restart.
[06:19] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: one more thing, did you check a setting like "boot device priority" or something like that?
[06:19] <Onwlyix> There were two settings I think that I checked
[06:19] <Onwlyix> that had to do with which boots first
[06:19] <Onwlyix> but it;s definantly a problem with it not reading the CD right
[06:20] <Onwlyix> because I disabled a harddrive boot
[06:20] <Onwlyix> leaving only a CD boot

[06:20] <Onwlyix> and I got an error
[06:20] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: there might be a setting where you actually specify a device as bootable.
[06:20] <Onwlyix> Really?
[06:21] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: yes. A few months ago I was booting dells off cd's all day long for work, so I know it's possible.
[06:21] <rickyfingers> Onwlyix: my memory's just a bit rusty because I haven't touched a dell since.
[06:21] <Onwlyix> WHat should I look for?
[06:25] <blind> Do the beta nvidia drivers support twinview?
[06:25] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: are you in china?
[06:26] <cuijinli> rickyfingers, yes
[06:26] <kitche> blind: use the official drivers since the beta are no longer beta
[06:26] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: I lived in Beijing during the summer of 96
[06:27] <blind> kitche: good call! they in the repos?
[06:27] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: wan't much internet there back then.  What part of the middle kingdom are you in?
[06:28] <blind> how do i know if my (nvidia) card is  legacy or not?
[06:29] <cuijinli> rickyfingers, Nanjing in China
[06:29] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: wan't much internet there back then.  What part of the middle kingdom are you in?
[06:29] <blind> kitche: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx tells me i have the newest versoin..
[06:29] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: oops, I didn't mean to ask that question twice.  That's excellent. I'm glad you're here.
[06:30] <kitche> blind:; there is no package for it
[06:30] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: Are you using Ubuntu?
[06:30] <blind> kitche: oh.. where do i get them?
[06:30] <cuijinli> richiefrich, yes, I am newer.
[06:31] <kitche> blind: from the official site
[06:31] <Clin1> Does any one in the room know where the apache CGI-BIN is? i need it a little.....
[06:31] <blind> kitche: that's a lot of help
[06:31] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: Well, do you need help with something?
[06:32] <barrett9h> blind: well, do you expect him to go to the site to see and tell you?
[06:32] <blind> barrett9h: what site?!
[06:32] <barrett9h> nvidia.com
[06:32] <kitche> blind: it's on the official site there might be a 3rd party repo that has them
[06:33] <Clin1> Does any one reading use apache?
[06:33] <rickyfingers> Clinl: I do.
[06:33] <nomasteryoda> me too
[06:33] <Clin1> Have you used the cgi-bin...
[06:33] <rickyfingers> Clinl: just used synaptic to install it.
[06:34] <Clin1> yep thats whaat i did to and i cant find the cgi
[06:34] <cuijinli> richiefrich, thanks,I can learn it slowly, but my english is poor.
[06:34] <Clin1> cgi-bin*
[06:34] <nomasteryoda> wow... kubuntu on powerpc looks nicer now
[06:34] <nomasteryoda> just upgraded to edgy
[06:34] <ArrenLex> kubuntu owns all.
[06:34] <nomasteryoda> oh yea
[06:34] <kitche> Clin1: you have perl installed?
[06:35] <Clin1> It doesnt come with apache..... oh then thaat may be the reason, whats the package naame if you remember
[06:35] <cuijinli> richiefrich, where are you from?
[06:35] <rickyfingers> cuijinli: I'm from the U.S., but I live in Germany now.
=== quux is now known as quuxo
[06:37] <Clin1> my synaptic wont start......
[06:39] <bjv> i have dist upgraded to edgy, my xorg will not start.  nvidia, obviously but nv neither
=== quuxo is now known as quux
[06:39] <dibblego> which package is mod_http_proxy in?
[06:39] <bjv> dpkg-reconfig says broken or not fully installed xorg
[06:39] <dibblego> er, mod_proxy_http
[06:40] <bjv> xserver-xorg package includes alot of S3, etc stuff i dont need though?
[06:40] <Clin1> Sorry my people i got to restart
[06:41] <scorp007> which package contains OpenGL headers?
[06:41] <Healot> !find libgl
[06:41] <ubotu> Found: freeglut3, freeglut3-dev, gle-doc, libgl1-mesa-dev, libgl1-mesa-dri (and 76 others)
[06:42] <dibblego> !find mod_proxy_http
[06:42] <ubotu> Package/file mod_proxy_http does not exist in edgy
[06:43] <HL-Onwlyix> I'm back
[06:43] <bjv> xserver-xorg isnt installed because it includes more then i need
[06:43] <HL-Onwlyix> had some nick troubles though
[06:43] <bjv> right ?
=== Daylighter is now known as Daylighter_
[06:44] <scorp007> Healot: do you know the specific package? I'm looking in adept, but can't seem to find it
[06:44] <rcmiv> if I am using nxclient fullscreen, how do I switch back to my native desktop?
[06:44] <Mez> scorp007, what opengl headers (aka what for)
[06:44] <scorp007> Mez: for developing OpenGl applications.
[06:44] <Mez> rcmiv, ctrl + alt + left shift + right shift IIRC
[06:45] <rcmiv> Mez, I'll try it
[06:45] <bjv> should xserver-xorg be installed on most machines ?
[06:46] <Healot> libgl1-mesa-dev >> this prolly the one you need, i build games with this package too
[06:46] <eduhat> is ubuntu any good for security purposes?
[06:46] <tonquin> hi all, can anyone help me configure my network settings?
=== tom48 is now known as tom47
[06:47] <Whity-> eduhat: yes
[06:47] <HL-Onwlyix> According to google, it should just boot from the CD
[06:47] <Whity-> tonquin: what kind of network?
[06:47] <eduhat> Whity-: allright, awesome!! what about wireless hacking, and WEP cracking?
[06:48] <Clin1> This should be my last q for the night.... What is the package name for perl
[06:48] <Whity-> can't see why not, i've done it on other dist so it should be fine on ubuntu
=== PacketScan is now known as packetsc
[06:48] <bjv> ubuntu can run wep cracking tools...
[06:48] <tonquin> Whity:  its just the settings on my laptop... they worked before but they're scrambled now.
[06:48] <Whity-> tonquin: using a router, switch, hub, p2p, what?
[06:48] <HL-Onwlyix> Hmm
[06:49] <e3> Ok this is strange... I installed KDE....and restarted and chose KDE...but it still started in GNOME..
[06:49] <HL-Onwlyix> I have a question
=== packetsc is now known as packetscan
[06:49] <tonquin> in particular, in network settings i have "wireless connection" and a "wired connection"
[06:49] <bjv> but, to ask again,  should most machines have package: xserver-xorg installed ??
[06:49] <Clin1> Please aay one i need to download that then start my upgrafe to 6.10
[06:49] <Whity-> oh I don't know about wireless on ubuntu
[06:49] <Whity-> never used it
[06:49] <Clin1> which should take all night
[06:49] <bjv> because mine was not after edgy dist-upgrade
[06:50] <tonquin> when it worked before wireless was eth0 and wired was eth1.
[06:50] <e3> Whyy....gnome...i dont want gnome....
[06:50] <jsjc> good afternoon guys, I am struggling to configure my new minipci express card that it works easily in backtrack but not ubuntu , do the madwifi dirvers work well on edgy?
[06:50] <tonquin> now there are reversed and wireless doesn't work any more though wired still works and worked before too.
[06:51] <e3> anyone know how to kick this machine into kde and not gnome
[06:51] <HL-Onwlyix> I hear if I doanload a big file normally it can be messed up
[06:51] <ArrenLex> bjv: if you want a gui, you need xserver-xorg installed. If it got lost during the upgrade, install it manually: apt-get install x-window-system-core
[06:51] <tonquin> Whity: so somehow I need to reassign eth0 and eth1 designation for the adaptors.
[06:51] <HL-Onwlyix> but torrenting it keeps it intact
[06:51] <HL-Onwlyix> Is that true?
[06:51] <rickyfingers> e3: think you need kubuntu
[06:51] <HL-Onwlyix> Because it might be the source of my problems
[06:51] <tonquin> Whity: i've tried a few things but so far no go.
[06:51] <ArrenLex> HL_Onwlyix: No. Torrenting avoids strain on a single download server, which can go down and end your download.
[06:51] <e3> i did the kubuntu upgrade via the terminal...but kde didnt load!
[06:51] <ArrenLex> But you can always continue.
[06:52] <ArrenLex> e3: define "didn't load". How far did you get?
[06:52] <bjv> ArrenLex: ok.  doing that now.
[06:52] <eduhat> do i have to have kubuntu to have kde on ubuntu? or can i install kde onto ubuntu?
[06:52] <e3> i started with ubuntu 6.10, then i put some code into terminal as told by some random fellow...and kde seemed to install sucessfully, so i restarted and it asked KDE or GNOME. i selected KDE. it started gnome.
[06:52] <ArrenLex> eduhat: apt-get install kde-core kdebase will get you set up.
[06:52] <HL-Onwlyix> Hmm... Does anyone know why my computer won't boot to the Live CD I burned?
[06:53] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, you can install kde onto ubuntu
[06:53] <eduhat> ArrenLex: allright, and apt-get remove gnome will delete gnome?
[06:53] <ArrenLex> eduhat: the ubuntu "kde" package is really a metapackage that contains lots and lots and lots of total crap applications.
[06:53] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, do you have your cd drive first in boot order
[06:53] <e3> hmm i would like to delete gnome....
[06:53] <ArrenLex> eduhat: No. Unless I miss my guess, gnome is a metapackage. So apt-get remove gnome won't actually remove anything.
[06:53] <tonquin> Whity:  before the "wireless" adaptor was not enabled but the wireless still worked.
[06:53] <ArrenLex> e3: That can be arranged. Hold on...
[06:53] <nekostar> what the f3w4t53w45WQ#$%#@ is wrong with xorg
[06:53] <Clin1> Caan any one tell me where the CGI-Bin is located?
[06:54] <ArrenLex> e3: do what it says. http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde
[06:54] <nekostar> my compy says i have no nvidia module
[06:54] <nekostar> ~_________________________~
[06:54] <HL-Onwlyix> Yes, I've tried all that. From changing the boot order, to disabling the C: drive. It's not recognizing it as a bootable CD.
[06:54] <eduhat> ArrenLex: well then how could i remove gnome?
[06:54] <ArrenLex> eduhat: if you want to remove gnome completely, go to http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde
[06:54] <HL-Onwlyix> It works from windows
[06:54] <nekostar> i am currently in irssi and very pissed ~_~
[06:54] <HL-Onwlyix> I get the browser thing
[06:54] <HL-Onwlyix> so the ISO was burned right
[06:55] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, I have no clue, have you booted other live cds before
[06:55] <ArrenLex> HL_Onwlyix: I noticed that my ancient pentium II computer I have sitting in the corner of my room for some reason refuses to boot from some CDs but will boot from others.
[06:55] <nekostar> so very very angry
[06:55] <HL-Onwlyix> No, I haven't. This is my first,
[06:55] <e3> Ok i inserted the line from sudo aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop do i need to do anything else. it seemed to work. will it boot in kde now????
[06:55] <nekostar> nv driver w2orks so is there some new nvidia-glx bug?
[06:55] <asdx> hi, where can i get 6.10 cds?
[06:55] <nekostar> !nvidia
[06:55] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:55] <HL-Onwlyix> Mine is a Pentium 4
[06:55] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, try burning a xubuntu live cd
[06:55] <rcmiv> Mez, repeat that?
[06:55] <ArrenLex> e3: you can boot KDE without removing anything =P Just change the session in gdm.
[06:55] <ArrenLex> Or whatever dm you use.
[06:56] <HL-Onwlyix> Ok, I'll try that then.
[06:56] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, or order one of the free cds
[06:56] <e3> Session in GDM?! lol... how.
[06:56] <ArrenLex> HL_Onwlyix: do you have any Windows XP cds lying around?
[06:56] <Mez> rcmiv if i remember correctly - its ctrl + alt _ both shifts
[06:56] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, but it takes a while
[06:56] <ArrenLex> e3: what are you in right now?
[06:56] <e3> gnome
[06:56] <e3> ubuntu
[06:56] <HL-Onwlyix> Hmm I think I might have them in a box in the closet.
[06:56] <ArrenLex> e3: log out of gnome. Then, in the screen where it asks for you for a username and password, find some option that say 'setting' or whatever and change it to KDE. And log in.
[06:57] <Pupeno> Hello.
[06:57] <e3> cool!
[06:57] <rcmiv> Mez, thanks
[06:57] <Mez> e3 - you want to run kubuntu ?
[06:57] <ArrenLex> HL_Onwlyix: try one of those. If your computer refuses to boot one of those, chances are the problem is in the computer. If it does, the problem is in the CD.
[06:57] <e3> yeah i wana run kubuntu
[06:57] <bigfuzzyjesus> e3, find session settings
[06:57] <Pupeno> How much space would you give to / (root, all but home) to have Ubuntu installed (including kubuntu-desktop as well).
[06:57] <Mez> e3 - join #kubuntu and i'll talk youn through
[06:57] <e3> k
[06:58] <Mez> Pupeno, one sec lemme, msg you
[06:58] <rickyfingers> Pupeno: i give it 30 gb so formatting doesn't take 4ever
[06:58] <HL-Onwlyix> Ok! I'll try that. AFter that, I'll download and try Xubuntu

[07:00] <ArrenLex> I remember the good old days, when I installed Woody in 100MB...
[07:00] <ArrenLex> Now this brand-new etch install takes 1.8GB. = /
[07:00] <ArrenLex> *sigh*
[07:01] <Pupeno> Thank you.
[07:01] <rickyfingers> ArrenLex: I did a full install of slackware 10.1 on an old old pentium 1 dell laptop with a 1gb hd about 6 months ago.
[07:02] <rickyfingers> ArrenLex: scratch the full - I left out any gui stuff
[07:02] <ArrenLex> rickyfingers: with or without a gui?
[07:02] <ArrenLex> Oh.
[07:02] <jsjc> anything to solve madwifi problems on edgy?/ anyone had any problems before??
[07:02] <ArrenLex> rickyfingers: ah, but I had x, twm, and mozilla on my woody.
[07:02] <rickyfingers> ArrenLex: touche'
[07:03] <tonquin> any help on resetting my eth) and eth1 designations?
[07:03] <fooshang> Are there any complications with having more than one desktop? I have always used Gnome, but am curious in KDE.
[07:03] <Healot> no complication :)
[07:03] <fooshang> or about KDE i should say
[07:04] <Healot> just increasing disk usage :)
[07:04] <ArrenLex> fooshang: none whatsoever. Be sure to use aptitude when you install KDE so you can remove it easily. aptitude install kdebase kde-core will set you up, then just logout and log into KDE!
[07:04] <fooshang> Ok...thanks!
[07:04] <ArrenLex> Can someone recommend a command which will give me the absolute path to a file?
[07:05] <nomasteryoda> which
[07:05] <nomasteryoda> ArrenLex, try that
[07:05] <nomasteryoda> which mplayer
[07:05] <ArrenLex> nomasteryoda: no, that's only for that which is in my PATH.
[07:05] <HL-Onwlyix> damn
[07:05] <nomasteryoda> ah
[07:05] <HL-Onwlyix> makes me wish dell put a floppy drive in this piece of crap
[07:06] <HL-Onwlyix> I could boot from it to the CD
[07:06] <ArrenLex> nomasteryoda: I meant any file. Like, "command ../../foobar" = "/home/em/afolder/evil/foobar"
[07:06] <rickyfingers> tonquin: check out this wiki: http://www.science.uva.nl/research/air/wiki/LogicalInterfaceNames
[07:06] <barrett9h> ArrenLex: which file is it?
[07:06] <rickyfingers> tonquin: looks to be possible, but a little tricky.
[07:06] <ArrenLex> barrett9h: any arbitrary file which exists.
[07:06] <barrett9h> but where is it?
[07:06] <HL-Onwlyix> Ok, I have six more CDs
[07:07] <barrett9h> do you want to find it?
[07:07] <ArrenLex> barrett9h: This one appears to be in /home/em/afolder/evil/foobar
[07:07] <Clin1> Has any one successfully installed image::magic on ubuntu???
[07:07] <ArrenLex> barretth9h: I know where it is... I want to pass it to ln -s in a script.
[07:07] <HL-Onwlyix> hmm
[07:07] <tonquin> rickyfingers: i'll check that now.... thx
[07:07] <ArrenLex> Clin1: imagemagick? apt-get install imagemagick.
[07:07] <rickyfingers> HL-Onwlyix: can you boot off any of them?
[07:07] <barrett9h> well, if you know where it is, just pass the full path
[07:07] <HL-Onwlyix> I'm gonna go screw with the BIOS settings
[07:07] <Clin1> Its not in synaptic
[07:07] <HL-Onwlyix> Well
[07:07] <HL-Onwlyix> I can't find my XP cd
[07:07] <Clin1> nut il try thanks
[07:08] <HL-Onwlyix> and I only burned 1 CCD
[07:08] <HL-Onwlyix> I have 6 empty ones left
[07:08] <HL-Onwlyix> should I try again and burn ubuntu to another one?
[07:08] <Clin1> It says its aalready instaalled but the program im using says otherwise
[07:09] <nekostar> eh
[07:09] <rickyfingers> HL-Onwlyix: do you only have one computer? I would try booting the cd in another computer first.
[07:09] <nekostar> omg eh
[07:09] <nekostar> so now i have an api error
[07:09] <HL-Onwlyix> I have one computer
[07:09] <HL-Onwlyix> That's it :/
[07:09] <nekostar> nvidia version and api version are different/????????????????????????????????????????
[07:09] <nekostar> how do i fix this already ~_~
[07:09] <nekostar> !nvidia
[07:10] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:10] <rickyfingers> HL-Onwlyix: bummer.  No, I wouldn't try burning the same cd image again, if you're low on disks.  But cd's are so cheap these days.  I just bought a spindle of 100 for $35
[07:10] <nekostar> eh that didnt do the trick ~_~
[07:10] <rbil> HL-Onwlyix: have you run md5sum against that ISO and confirmed it matches what is posted on the server you downloaded it from?
[07:10] <nekostar> tried that..........
[07:10] <nekostar> rickyfingers:  thats a lot for cdroms but about right for dvd's
[07:10] <nekostar> HL-Onwlyix: try burning at no faster than 16x and with verification
[07:10] <nekostar> great.
[07:11] <nekostar> now SOMEONE please tell me youve solved this bu11sh1t with the nvidia / api drivers not matching!!! !_!
[07:11] <rickyfingers> neko: What do you pay?
[07:11] <ArrenLex> nekostar: what pullshit is this?
[07:11] <nekostar> about 15 or so for cds
[07:11] <ArrenLex> p -> b
[07:11] <barrett9h> SurfnKid: try the menu editor.  I installed gvim (a text editor), and it didn't show up on the menu.  on the menu editor i found out it was just unchecked
[07:11] <HL-Onwlyix> rbil: I tried doing that hash matching thing. I only found a match with one line which was MD4, I think.
[07:12] <HL-Onwlyix> Nekostar, I'm not sure the speed, but I did do verification and it worked.
[07:12] <nekostar> ArrenLex: my nvidia module is version 1.0-8762 my X module is version 1.0.8776
[07:12] <nekostar> super crap
[07:12] <SurfnKid> barrett9h, um yeah i know i could install it i just dont know why i have to every time :(
[07:12] <nekostar> HL-Onwlyix:  u trying to install to a dell by chance?
[07:12] <ArrenLex> nekostar: build a new module?
[07:12] <nekostar> ArrenLex:  how
[07:12] <HL-Onwlyix> Ricky: I guess it's worth a shot because I know someone with a spindle of like 50 CDs I can borrow =P
[07:12] <ArrenLex> nekostar: is there any reason why the drivers shipped with ubuntu are not good enough for you?
[07:12] <HL-Onwlyix> Neko, Yes, it's a dell
[07:12] <nekostar> ArrenLex:
[07:12] <nekostar> BECAUSE THOSE ARE FUCKING FAILING
[07:12] <nekostar> ~_~
[07:13] <barrett9h> right click on applications, choose edit menus
[07:13] <ArrenLex> xD
[07:13] <nekostar> i would just use friggan nv but i need my dual mons asap
[07:13] <nekostar> and im NOT happy
[07:13] <nekostar> im very mad.
[07:13] <ArrenLex> I totally just got smacked at the same time in both #debian and #ubuntu.
[07:13] <ArrenLex> nekostar: "failing"?
[07:13] <HL-Onwlyix> Nekostar: Yes, this is a dell.
[07:13] <nekostar> this is the third time that X has been broken
[07:13] <nekostar> HL-Onwlyix:
[07:13] <nekostar> get the alternate install cd
[07:13] <rickyfingers> neko: I've got dual mons with two nvidia cards working with default drivers.
[07:13] <nekostar> and install while not hooked up to the net
[07:13] <HL-Onwlyix> The windows CD?
[07:13] <rickyfingers> neko: you want my xorg.conf?
[07:13] <nekostar> and you might have to install more than once
[07:13] <nekostar> rickyfingers: www.inuyasha-lives.org/linux/xorg.conf
[07:14] <nekostar> great
[07:14] <nekostar> now
[07:14] <nekostar> get my nvidia drivers working
[07:14] <nekostar> or tell me how to build a new module b/c the one they shipped is shit and i'll be happy
[07:14] <bjv> xorg runs now with x-win-sys-core,      now i just need my wm.  T_T
[07:14] <nekostar> ~_~
[07:14] <HL-Onwlyix> You mean the CD that came with my computer?
[07:14] <fooshang> Is automatix still around? Or is EasyUbuntu a better alternative? I just want a quick and easy way to get my multimedia codecs.
[07:14] <nekostar> HL-Onwlyix:
[07:14] <nekostar> i mean the alternate ubuntu install cd
[07:14] <HL-Onwlyix> I can't find it. I can only find CDs of the pre-installed crap they shipped with it
[07:14] <rickyfingers> nekostar: I don't follow.  What's the URL you sent.
[07:14] <nekostar> install in text mode
[07:14] <HL-Onwlyix> Oh
[07:14] <HL-Onwlyix> So order a CD from Ubuntu
[07:14] <nekostar> rickyfingers: my website with my xorg backup

[07:15] <nekostar> no
[07:15] <nekostar> no no no no no

[07:15] <HL-Onwlyix> One more thing
[07:15] <nekostar> i just fought with one yesterday
[07:15] <nekostar> repeatedly
[07:15] <Clin1> Whaat is the chmod level for images?
[07:15] <nekostar> well day before
[07:16] <nekostar> try 777
[07:16] <ArrenLex> Clin1: what do you mean, for images?
[07:16] <Clin1> i did and it wont show up
[07:16] <nekostar> what wont show up
[07:16] <HL-Onwlyix> How would I set up a dual boot so I don't lose windows?
[07:16] <nekostar> sigh.
[07:16] <nekostar> www.utorrent.com
[07:16] <Clin1> hold on aand il give the error
[07:16] <nekostar> install that in windows
[07:16] <rickyfingers> Clinl: you want to make an image available via http? 644 should be fine
[07:16] <nekostar> then defrag
[07:16] <ArrenLex> HL-Onwlyix: just make sure to install ubuntu second. It will set you up.
=== RobNyc[ET] TC is now known as RobNyc[] 
[07:16] <Clin1>  The requested URL /images/a_logo.gif was not found on this server
[07:16] <Clin1> But it is their
[07:16] <nekostar> then search for ' the ultimate boot cd ' or hiran's toos
[07:16] <nekostar> tools
[07:16] <HL-Onwlyix> Ok...
[07:16] <nekostar> and resize your partition
[07:17] <HL-Onwlyix> Me?
[07:17] <nekostar> then make 3 new partitions in extended type
[07:17] <HL-Onwlyix> I have no idea how to do that.
[07:17] <nekostar> 1. swap 2. boot 3. home
[07:17] <Clin1> 644 ok one min
[07:17] <nekostar> you will during install
[07:17] <HL-Onwlyix> Oh, ok.
[07:17] <nekostar> when it gets to partitions just select your area
[07:17] <nekostar> look
[07:17] <rickyfingers> Clinl: try moving image to <document root> and see if you can view it from there
[07:17] <nekostar> just go to the forums
[07:17] <nekostar> www.ubuntuforums.org
[07:17] <nekostar> extensive documentation there
[07:17] <HL-Onwlyix> Ok.
[07:17] <nekostar> great.
[07:17] <HL-Onwlyix> Thanks for all your help!!
[07:17] <nekostar> now
[07:17] <nekostar> I DONT WANNA REINSTALL
[07:17] <bigfuzzyjesus> nekostar, quit going crazy
[07:17] <nekostar> IM FRIGGAN TIRED
[07:17] <rickyfingers> Clinl: if you can, then it's a problem with the permissions on the parent directory.
[07:18] <nekostar> bigfuzzyjesus: first
[07:18] <bigfuzzyjesus> nekostar, really you dont seem tired at al
[07:18] <nekostar> there is no god and i take offence to anyone who thinks some guy named christ has anything to do with my life
[07:18] <Clin1> wo, some strang crap... Im going to recopy them all
[07:18] <nekostar> i slept
[07:18] <nekostar> im fine
[07:18] <eduhat> hey guys, im using 99% disk space, how can i delete some stuff that i dont need such as gnome, i would rather have kde, or xfce
[07:18] <nekostar> im pissed
[07:18] <Clin1> that should do it but if not
[07:18] <nekostar> ubuntu keeps breaking and im tired of it.
[07:18] <nekostar> eh
[07:18] <eduhat> also, what is the default root password?
[07:18] <nekostar> eduhat: look in forums
[07:18] <nekostar> default root?
[07:18] <bigfuzzyjesus> nekostar, i dont beleive in christ either
[07:18] <ArrenLex> eduhat: there is none. use sudo.
[07:18] <nekostar> there isnt one eduhat
[07:18] <nekostar> sudo su
[07:19] <nekostar> passwd
[07:19] <nekostar> that sets it
[07:19] <nekostar> sudo is used for stuff
[07:19] <ArrenLex> eduhat: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde will help you delete gnome. Didn't I give you this link before?
[07:19] <nekostar> that lets you run stuff that root has to do as your user
[07:19] <bjv> eduhat: i make sure to run 'apt-get autoclean -y' every once and a while
[07:19] <nekostar> supposedly more secure
[07:19] <bjv> my root partition is pretty small, and runs out alot.
[07:19] <nekostar> ArrenLex: yes you did
[07:19] <rickyfingers> eduhat: you can also cheat and do sudo bash
[07:19] <nekostar> in the last few minutes even
[07:19] <nekostar> bjv: i recommend just giving it 9 gigs or so
[07:19] <eduhat> how do i get root?
[07:19] <nekostar> backup /home
[07:19] <nekostar> eduhat: read up
[07:19] <nekostar> kgreat
[07:19] <Clin1> .jex they are all corupt.... For some odd reason i think i got a virus
[07:20] <rickyfingers> eduhat: I just told you: sudo bash
[07:20] <nekostar> ~_~
[07:20] <nekostar> Clin1: are u dual booting?
[07:20] <eduhat> okay
[07:20] <Clin1> no
[07:20] <bjv> nekostar: it's 5gigs. T_T
[07:20] <nekostar> bjv: wtf are you doing that its running out
[07:20] <nekostar> thats a LOT of installed packages
[07:20] <eduhat> rickyfingers: it asks for a password
[07:20] <rickyfingers> eduhat: but the Ubuntu gurus here are probably cringing that I told you that
[07:20] <nekostar> even i only go to about 4 gigs
[07:20] <nekostar> rickyfingers: who cares
[07:20] <nekostar> its there to be used
[07:20] <HL-Onwlyix> Sorry, I'm an idiot. Where can I find the alternate install?
[07:20] <rickyfingers> eduhat: just type in the password for the user you created
[07:20] <nekostar> HL-Onwlyix: um thats a bit harder
[07:20] <bjv> nekostar: alot of packages? oh i guess i do have both kde and gnome
[07:21] <nekostar> look at the install pages
[07:21] <scorp007> which package contains the manpages for OpenGL?
[07:21] <Clin1> i cant even delete them, what in the world is going on..
[07:21] <nekostar> bjv: ~_~
[07:21] <ArrenLex> eduhat: it's asking for your user password.
[07:21] <rickyfingers> eduhat: you created a user when you installed ubuntu, right?
[07:21] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, forums
[07:21] <eduhat> yes, im root now
[07:21] <nekostar> HL-Onwlyix: try googleing it
[07:21] <nekostar> awe fuck
[07:21] <nekostar> im just gonna reinstall
[07:21] <nekostar> its GOT TO BE FASTER THAN LISTENING TO BULLSH1T
[07:21] <nekostar> l8
[07:22] <HL-Onwlyix> Ok, I found it
[07:22] <rickyfingers> Can anyone here reccomend a good music package?
[07:22] <HL-Onwlyix> thanks
[07:22] <bjv> oh my god. apt, i NEED my window manager back  T_T
[07:22] <HL-Onwlyix> I really appreciate y'alls help
[07:22] <eduhat> what window managers are installed with ubuntu, all i need is kde and xfce
[07:22] <bjv> it says package lwm has unmet dependancies: x-terminal-emulator
[07:22] <nalioth> eduhat: most of them
[07:22] <ArrenLex> eduhat: With ubuntu? Metacity. Kde uses kwin.
[07:23] <nalioth> eduhat: are available
[07:23] <bigfuzzyjesus> HL-Onwlyix, any time come back with more ?'s
[07:23] <bjv> i have xterm installed, that should give me x-terminal-emulator
[07:23] <bjv> but..
[07:23] <eduhat> i need to free alot of disk space, what takes more? gnome or kde?
[07:23] <bjv> if i remove x-terminal-emulator it says: cannot, not installed
[07:23] <bjv> kde takes more, iirc
[07:23] <bjv> i should really remove both, since i use neither.
[07:23] <ArrenLex> eduhat: no one really needs the full suites of either. Remove the applications you don't need.
[07:30] <Clin1> LOL
[07:30] <Clin1> funnny
[07:30] <Clin1> any way WWW is 777
[07:30] <Clin1> :p
[07:30] <nekostar> !upgrade
[07:30] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[07:30] <nekostar> !etchy
[07:30] <nekostar> eh
[07:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about etchy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:30] <eduhat> i have like no disk space, so i need to delete a whole bunch of stuff, i think i made a problem in installing ubuntu, because i only have 2.1gb of space on hda3, and there are like 3 other partitions that are random
[07:30] <nekostar> how do u upgrade from dapper up
[07:30] <bjv> x11-common: Conflicts: lwm (<= 1.2.1-1)   .... ~_~
[07:30] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, just go do synaptic and mark for uninstall
[07:30] <rickyfingers> Clinl: i don't think that's wise to have www as 777
[07:31] <cherubiel> !edgy
[07:31] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[07:31] <Clin1> what should it be at
[07:31] <bjv> and it just so happens that v1.2.1-1  is the one in the repo...
[07:31] <nekostar> bjv: can i  just replace dapper with edgy ?
[07:31] <nekostar> im cli so i cant look at that cherubiel
[07:31] <nekostar> whats the easy way
[07:31] <nekostar> package // sources edit
[07:31] <nekostar> ?????????
[07:31] <bjv> neko: i just did a dist-upgrade to edgy
[07:31] <cherubiel> nekostar: yes, thats very much possible
[07:31] <cherubiel> !upgrade | nekostar
[07:31] <ubotu> nekostar: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[07:31] <rickyfingers> Clinl: that's like a yodel saying: Is there anyone here who wants to hack my box?
[07:31] <HL-Onwlyix> well
[07:31] <HL-Onwlyix> I'm going to bed
[07:31] <HL-Onwlyix> I'm going to let this download
[07:32] <Clin1> OK, then what chmod
[07:32] <HL-Onwlyix> ngiht
[07:32] <bjv> you just open your apt source.list and change every word dapper to edgy
[07:32] <HL-Onwlyix> see y'all tommorow
[07:32] <nekostar> cherubiel: the edit sources?
[07:32] <cherubiel> nekostar: lynx is a cli browser
[07:32] <scorp007> which package contains manpages for OpenGL headers?
[07:32] <cherubiel> nekostar: links is another one too
[07:32] <nekostar> cherubiel: yes yes and i  hate it
[07:32] <bjv> then run apt-get update, then dist-upgrade
[07:32] <nekostar> yes yes that sux too
[07:32] <cherubiel> nekostar: :)
[07:32] <HL-Onwlyix> I'm taking the boot CD with me to school tommorow
[07:32] <nekostar> ;)
[07:32] <HL-Onwlyix> see if it works
[07:32] <nekostar> ok editing sources
[07:32] <rickyfingers> Clinl: 755 for dirs & scripts
[07:32] <Clin1> thank you
[07:32] <cherubiel> nekostar: edit sources.lst, apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade
[07:33] <nalioth> !tell nekostar about upgrade
[07:33] <rickyfingers> Clinl: 644 for pics and plain html files
[07:33] <bjv> scorp007:  i think libgl1-mesa-dev
[07:34] <nekostar> doing
[07:34] <bjv> dont let your machine pass into hibernate halfway through your Dapper -> Edgy upgrade, though
[07:34] <bjv> you'll wind up in my boat.  ~_~
[07:34] <nekostar> yes yes nalioth; i hate cli based browsers
[07:34] <scorp007> bjv: Hmm, i think i have that package, but i dont seem to have the manpages...
[07:34] <Shizukesa> Hey, could someone give me a hand? I'm completely new to Ubuntu and decided to give it a try tonight.
[07:35] <tonyyarusso> cli browsers have their purpose - like when X dies and you need to know why
[07:35] <nekostar> lol bjv
[07:35] <nekostar> that sux
[07:35] <Clin1>  You don't have permission to access /images/ on this server  < the chmod 755 did this
[07:35] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: go ahead and ask your question
[07:35] <nekostar> tonyyarusso: my X has never died before
[07:35] <rickyfingers> Clinl: stick sudo in front of chmod
[07:36] <nekostar> tho ive seen it suck for quite a few
[07:36] <Clin1> im in root
[07:36] <Shizukesa> I got the CD, burned it and booted to it on my machine. I selected teh "Start or Install Ubuntu" option, and the progress bar jumps back and forth for a few moments then the screen just goes black.
[07:36] <tonyyarusso> nekostar: Ah - messing with unstable binary drivers killed mine
[07:36] <nekostar> ah that sux
[07:36] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: are you using a 64 bit processor?
[07:36] <Shizukesa> No
[07:36] <tonquin> calling all ubuntu gurus.  I'm a newbie to ubuntu but .... the interfaces setup system in edgy, on my laptop is seriously flakey, brittle and a disaster waiting to happen
[07:37] <tonquin> the key file is /etc/network/interfaces
[07:37] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: let me take a step back.  Which version of Ubuntu did you burn?
[07:37] <RememberPOL> !update
[07:37] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[07:37] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: just the regular i386 image?
[07:37] <Shizukesa> 6.10 Edgy Desktop x86
[07:37] <Clin1> 777 also denies access wtf
[07:37] <Shizukesa> Yes
[07:37] <nalioth> nekostar: what do console browsers have to do with upgrading?
[07:38] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: anyway it sounds like the livecd isn't compatible with your graphics card.
[07:38] <tonquin> this file is normally locked but... while i was playing around with the settings for the "teminal icon" on the top right of my desktop those changes were being written into this critical file.
[07:38] <Shizukesa> Radeon 9800 Pro?
[07:38] <Clin1> il work on it tomarow, See yawl im upgrading to 6.10
[07:38] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: try installing in text only mode.
[07:38] <Shizukesa> How do I do that?
[07:38] <jsilva> hi all
[07:38] <bigfuzzyjesus> tonquin, how come you dont use dapper LTS
[07:38] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: isn't it an option when you boot off the cd?
[07:39] <Shizukesa> "Safe Graphics mode"?
[07:39] <Shizukesa> I tried that and the same thing happened.
[07:39] <tonquin> bigfuzzyjesus:  well i guess cause edgy is the latest and greatest.
[07:39] <tonquin> i'm not using for anything misson critical
[07:39] <tonquin> just my cheezy laptop.
[07:39] <eduhat> allright, well 88% is used now, what else should i delete? i dont do any sound stuff, no image stuff, all command editors only, no x editors
[07:39] <bjv> man. it would be great if i new how to resize or close a window, with this wm..
[07:39] <eduhat> so anything else?
[07:39] <ArrenLex> How do I make applications look for libraries in an extra folder?
[07:39] <bigfuzzyjesus> tonquin, dapper is most stable... and more support
[07:39] <ArrenLex> Like adding something to PATH, except for libs?
[07:40] <roryy> ArrenLex: set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
[07:40] <tonquin> well anyway i went in a did some heavy pruning on that file .... and all is working now but god knows why.
[07:40] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, if you use no imaging and no fotos/multimedia what do you need all this space for
[07:40] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: I just googled install ubuntu text only mode, and read something that said safe graphics mode is the way to go...
[07:40] <ArrenLex> Nevermind, got it :)
[07:40] <Shizukesa> The same thing happens withe Safe Graphics mode though...
[07:40] <ArrenLex> Added the path to /etc/ld.so.conf
[07:40] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: so if it's still crashing, it's probably not a graphics driver problem like I thought.
[07:41] <Shizukesa> Hrm...
[07:41] <bigfuzzyjesus> rickyfingers, its supposed to be more stable but personally i use text upgrade
[07:41] <eduhat> well, it is nice to have alot of space, plus i need to install nessus, ethereal, etherape, aircrack, kismet, all that stuff
[07:41] <tonquin> in system/administration/networking it currently that NONE of my connections is enabled... even though...
[07:41] <bjv> lwm: Depends: x-terminal-emulator
[07:41] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: I had the same problem, but it was with the 64 bit version of a lot of different install cd's
[07:41] <tonquin> both wired and wireless connections work.
[07:41] <bjv> apt-get remove x-terminal-emulator      -> Package x-terminal-emulator is not installed
[07:41] <tonquin> wow this is all very ...... interesting.
[07:41] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: I had to flash my bios before it would work.
[07:41] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: how come it has a whole bunch of random partitions, like /var/run, /var/lock, /dev, /dev/shm, /lib/modules
[07:42] <Shizukesa> Yeesh...
[07:42] <bjv> package  xterm  is supposed to provide package x-terminal-emulator
[07:42] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: and they all are 128mb
[07:42] <tonquin> there seems to be almost no rhyme or reason to it at all.
[07:42] <bjv> how do i ensure that it is?
[07:42] <nekostar> do te do te dummmmmmmmmm
[07:43] <nekostar> its finishing installing all the new packages ;)
[07:43] <darko3d> well, i'm having some problems intalling AIGLX http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/AiGLX
[07:43] <nekostar> lets hope that nvidia isnt as broken as it was ~_~
[07:43] <roryy> bjv: i think 'x-terminal-emulator' is a capability, not a package
[07:43] <Shizukesa> Just wondering, this may be a "newbie" question, but I don't have to format the drive to any specification first, do I?
[07:43] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, did you do custom partition or automatic, if automatic i would just leave it alone unless you absolutely need the 128 megs, btw what are using this computer
[07:43] <tonquin> Yikes
[07:43] <roryy> bjv: e.g., the 'gnome-terminal' package provides 'x-terminal-emulator'
[07:43] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, for
[07:43] <darko3d> i'm getting E: Couldn't find package linux-dri-modules-2.6.15-27-386
[07:44] <bigfuzzyjesus> Shizukesa, no
[07:44] <rickyfingers> Shizukesa: no the format your hd is in currently has no affect whatsoever on the install process.
[07:44] <bjv> roryy: im seeing that, i have a package that lists it as a dependancy
[07:44] <darko3d> when i try sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-air-core linux-dri-modules-common linux-dri-modules-`uname -r`
[07:44] <bjv> roryy: i have xterm installed, but something is wrong?
[07:44] <nekostar> o.o whats air-core ??
[07:44] <roryy> bjv: what are you trying to do ?
[07:45] <Shizukesa> Hey! I just set my BIOS to the "Optomized Defaults", tried the "Safe Graphics" mode and it works! :D
[07:45] <bjv> apt-get install lwm gets me: The following packages have unmet dependencies.        lwm: Depends: x-terminal-emulator       E: Broken packages
[07:45] <nekostar> ah
[07:45] <bjv> install lwm
[07:45] <Shizukesa> Cool, thanks for the help guys. :)
[07:45] <nekostar> try installing x-terminal-emulator
[07:45] <nekostar> it gives you lots of options
[07:45] <nekostar> like xterm
[07:45] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: i did an automatic partition, and yes, this is the computer im using
[07:45] <nekostar> which is nice and doesnt have a lot of dependancies
[07:46] <ArrenLex> I want to make a screen capture movie. What should I use?
[07:46] <bjv> Reading state information... Done
[07:46] <bjv> xterm is already the newest version.
[07:46] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, what are you using the computer for
[07:46] <roryy> bjv: hmm. what does 'apt-cache show xterm|grep Provides' say?
[07:46] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: wireless stuff, security stuff
[07:46] <bjv> Provides: x-terminal-emulator
[07:46] <bjv> :|
[07:46] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: WEP cracking, the list goes on
[07:46] <tom47> Shizukesa did you run the check cd option to make sure the cd is ok?
[07:47] <bigfuzzyjesus> aer you planning on using it at all for productivity at all
[07:47] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: productivity?
[07:47] <roryy> bjv: hmm, i get an error if i simulate a lwm installation to. let me take a quick look...
[07:47] <sn00p|> Hello Is there microsd reader support in ubuntu?
[07:47] <Shizukesa> Yeah, it's all fine now.
[07:47] <roryy> bjv: what version of ubuntu are you running?
[07:48] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: productivity? what do you mean productivity?
[07:48] <bigfuzzyjesus>  eduhat nvm
[07:48] <Shizukesa> I just had to reset my BIOS to the optomized defaults.
[07:48] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: okay
[07:48] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, like email web browsing norm use
[07:48] <bjv> roryy: just upgraded to edgy
[07:48] <eduhat> well, no email, but yes web browsing with firefox
[07:49] <roryy> bjv: i get that x11-common conflicts lwm when I do 'aptitude -s install lwm'
[07:49] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, have you though about installing server install and putting fluxbox on it, you would get more space, little proc usage, and you would only install what you want.... it wouldnt be easy if your not that familier but probably best for what your using your pc for
[07:50] <cherubiel> eduhat: i prefer windowmaker
[07:50] <roryy> bjv: my guess is either 1) the lwm provided in edgy is out of date or 2) there's a packaging bug in x11-common
[07:51] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: sounds amazing, but server install? what is that??? also, i've tried fluxbox in the past, it was okay, but i had no idea how to customize, but yes i would love to use fluxbox, but what is the server install thing?
[07:51] <bjv> roryy: if install both lwm and xterm at once, i get the x11 versioning error.   installing lwm solo i get the xterm error
[07:51] <e3> Wow KDE is looking nice... I have not ran this version before... Very nice...
[07:51] <sn00p|> Hello Is there microsd reader support in ubuntu?
[07:51] <ArrenLex> e3: KDE owns all.
[07:51] <bjv> roryy: that makes me think the edgy lwm package is borked, but that's just guessing.
[07:52] <e3> I uninstalled all of GNOME and it killed some apps i really liked. ><
[07:52] <roryy> bjv: maybe you can try rxvt instead
[07:53] <ArrenLex> e3: then put them back.
[07:53] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I'm going to take a wild guess here and say that microsd reader shows up like a disk drive
[07:53] <ArrenLex> e3: apt-get install <app>
[07:53] <e3> while Installing KDE and removing GNOME..... somehow... my startmenu says i still have all my GNOME programs installed.....
[07:53] <roryy> bjv: although note that xserver-xorg and lots of other moderately important looking X bits depend on x11-common
[07:53] <e3> I dont know what i really have installed or not....its very confusing.
[07:54] <bjv> simulating a removal of x-terminal-emulator should remove (all) installed terms?
[07:54] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, server install is basically ubuntu with no graphical interface(you pick your own), and no packages (you install them your self), it would not be easy and would probably be alot of learning but it would be the best option for what you want and and a better understanding of linux/ubuntu/fluxbox, so there really isnt a downside
[07:54] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, no it doesn't its internal in a laptop
[07:54] <roryy> bjv: hrm, i don't know; let me try
[07:54] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: allright, that sounds good, but how would i do this server install?
[07:55] <roryy> bjv: no, if I simulate a purge of x-terminal-emulator, aptitude says it would do nothing
[07:55] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: first thing to do is dmesg | less
[07:55] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: and see if it says anything about the microsd:
[07:55] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, you can download it off of the ubuntu servers
[07:55] <eduhat> okay
[07:55] <roryy> bjv: if you're up to compiling etc, maybe it's worth trying to get lwm from source
[07:55] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, just a second
[07:55] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: actually, before that, do lspci and see what the real device name is for the microsd
[07:55] <sn00p|> ok
[07:56] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: and then look through dmesg | less for a match.
[07:56] <roryy> bjv: or, if you're not specifically wanting lwm, using an alternate light-weight wm (I believe there are several)
[07:57] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: how big is this server install?
[07:57] <bjv> roryy: yeah, im using somethign called wm2 because it was roughly the same light-ness
[07:57] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, not very, i dont know the numbers but it is bare bones
[07:57] <darko3d> /dev/hdb1   ?           1        2550    20482843+   7  HPFS/NTFS

[07:58] <darko3d> guys, when i try to mount hdb1
[07:58] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, it just says Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices
[07:58] <e3> KDE's AddRemove says democracy player is not supported.. is it ok to run?
[07:58] <darko3d> i get Failed to mount '/dev/hdb1': No such file or directory
[07:58] <eduhat> bigfuzzyjesus: oh okay, so that lets me install only necesary packages and what ever window manager i want?
[07:58] <e3> btw democracy player is supported by gnome..i think..
[07:58] <roryy> hrm, is it just me, or is search for bugs on launchpad complicated?
[07:59] <darko3d> can anybody help me with this???????
[07:59] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, then it says Ricoh Co SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPRO host adapter
[07:59] <bigfuzzyjesus> eduhat, yes but there is no gui until you install your window manager it is all command line
[07:59] <Flannel> roryy: it's better than bugzilla ;)  but it's the nature of bug trackers
[07:59] <nekostar> sigh
[07:59] <bigfuzzyjesus> !server install
[07:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about server install - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:59] <eduhat> well i g2g, gunna get that server install going :D later
[07:59] <bigfuzzyjesus> !server
[07:59] <ubotu> Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[07:59] <eduhat> thx for the help bigfuzzyjesus
[07:59] <Flannel> eduhat: you might want the alternate CD, rather than server
[07:59] <nekostar> bigfuzzyjesus: whats the q about the server  install ?
[07:59] <nekostar> yeah
[07:59] <nekostar> alternate cd >> server install
[08:00] <eduhat> Flannel: alternate?
[08:00] <nekostar> alternate.
[08:00] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: ok so now we're on to something.
[08:00] <bjv> im interested in how to strip out gnome as well.
[08:00] <nekostar> well
[08:00] <nekostar> start with installing gnome-core
[08:00] <nekostar> and x-window-system-core
[08:00] <nekostar> mm
[08:00] <eduhat> what is the alternate cd install?
[08:00] <Flannel> eduhat: yeah.  If you install the server install, you'll need to switch kernels back to desktop (it hasit's own server kernel, not really suitable for desktop use)
[08:00] <roryy> Flannel: hrm, i take it back; it only returned one (matching) search result this time
[08:00] <darko3d> guys, when i try to mount hdb1, i get Failed to mount '/dev/hdb1': No such file or directory even tho fdisk -l shows me that hdb1 exist
[08:00] <nekostar> Flannel:
[08:00] <darko3d> what should i do
[08:00] <bjv> gnome core will just take down the gui? i thought that knocked down a bunch of the gnome apps too
[08:00] <roryy> darko3d: what is the exact command you're using?
[08:01] <nekostar> actually you also have to remove that kernel for server as well
[08:01] <nekostar> it tends to mess things up a bit
[08:01] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: bad news http://www.leenooks.com/Ricoh+Co+Ltd+R5C8xx+SD%252fMMC%252fMS%252fMSPro%252fxD%252fSC+Card+reader
[08:01] <nekostar> bjv: the whole point is it installs what is really needed for gnome to work
[08:01] <darko3d> i followed the command on here: http://www.debianadmin.com/mount-your-widows-partitions-and-make-it-readwritable-in-ubuntu.html
[08:01] <rickyfingers> the card reader doesn't look to be supported.
[08:01] <nekostar> and you just install app by app what you really use
[08:01] <nekostar> works great
[08:01] <nekostar> can get gnome done in about a gig
[08:01] <Flannel> eduhat: which is why it's usually easier to grab the alternate CD, and install that 'server' (GUI less desktop)
[08:01] <nekostar> or 1.3
[08:01] <nekostar> with a bunch of stuff
[08:01] <nekostar> keeps the bloat down
[08:01] <nekostar> and the speed upwards
[08:01] <eduhat> allright
[08:01] <nekostar> but
[08:01] <eduhat> thx for the help guys
[08:01] <nikosapi> hello, I'm having trouble authoring a dvd that plays in my dvd player. Can someone help (I'm using dvdauthor and growisofs)?
[08:02] <nekostar> why not look at blackbox or fluxbox instead there
[08:02] <nekostar> that runs real fast
[08:02] <nekostar> or even enlightenment
[08:02] <bjv> nekostar: i dont have gnome-core installed...
[08:02] <sn00p|> richiefingers that was like almost 4 months ago
[08:02] <nekostar> what do you have installed atm bjv
[08:02] <bjv> nekostar: kde and gnome.
[08:02] <nekostar> nikosapi:
[08:02] <darko3d> this is the command sudo mount -a
[08:02] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: maybe not, it says it works from kernel 2.6.17 it works
[08:02] <nekostar> search the forums for toram
[08:02] <nekostar> or dvd avi how to
[08:02] <Flannel> nekostar: please stop using the enter key as punctuation.
[08:02] <nekostar> or
[08:02] <nekostar> search for user starscalling
[08:03] <nekostar> and its in the last few threads that ive posted in on the forums
[08:03] <roryy> darko3d: have you created a mount point ? (something like /media/hda1) ?
[08:03] <nekostar> eh
[08:03] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: but I'm running latest edgy for 64 bit and I've got kernel version 2.6.15
[08:03] <nekostar> you know Flannel
[08:03] <nekostar> this channel is mostly useless most of the time
[08:03] <sn00p|> rickfingers yea so am I
[08:03] <darko3d> yes, i made /media/hdb1
[08:03] <nekostar> and there has never been a group of mods so bitchy as ubuntu's
[08:03] <darko3d> width mkdir
[08:04] <nekostar> not even gentoo's ops are that bad ~_~
[08:04] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, it says SD and MMC cards work starting from 2.6.17
[08:04] <darko3d> it's the dev/hdb1 that aprantly doesn't exists
[08:04] <Flannel> nekostar: what's you're point?  You're talking like two or three words a line.  It's annoying and spammy.  Please stop.
[08:04] <roryy> darko3d: great.  What happens when you run 'sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1' ?
[08:04] <bjv> i guess id just install gnome-core then remove it.
[08:04] <nekostar> thats not spammy i type as i talk. kgreatdie
[08:04] <nekostar> bjv: eh? why remove it?
[08:04] <bigfuzzyjesus> nekostar, why are you so pissy
[08:04] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: so looks like you're going to have to recompile a kernel if you want to get it working...
[08:04] <bjv> nekostar: to strip out the gnome desktop
[08:04] <nekostar> if you have regular gnome package in then its got everything from gnome-core........
[08:05] <darko3d> mount: you must specify the filesystem type
[08:05] <ChaosFan> nekostar: you don't have to be here, but when you are, please stop annoying
[08:05] <roryy> darko3d: hrm. I'd have thought it would auto-detect
[08:05] <nekostar> !ops testing
[08:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ops testing - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:05] <bigfuzzyjesus> nekostar, you are just trying to start a flame war
[08:05] <nekostar> no
[08:05] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, I have 2.6.17
[08:05] <darko3d> it's ntfs
[08:05] <nekostar> if i was trying to do that i would start by talking about how ubuntu is fucking up debian
[08:05] <bjv>  apt-get remove gnome-core -s                  Package gnome-core is not installed, so not removed
[08:05] <nekostar> but im not am i ~_)~
[08:05] <roryy> darko3d: ok, let's try   'sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1'
[08:06] <darko3d> mount: special device /dev/hdb1 does not exist
[08:06] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: then try modprobe -l | less and see if it looks like a module's already loaded.
[08:06] <Flannel> !language | nekostar
[08:06] <ubotu> nekostar: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:06] <nikosapi> nekostar: I don't want to use a gui, this is for an automated script.
[08:06] <nekostar> mm you need a mount line for ntfs ?
[08:06] <roryy> darko3d: hmm
[08:06] <nekostar> o sweet nikosapi what kinda script?
[08:06] <roryy> darko3d: how about 'ls -l /dev/hdb1' ?
[08:06] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: doh - never mind it's supposed to be compiled in the kernel, right?
[08:06] <sn00p|> yea
[08:06] <e3> Help.... Democracy Player isnt loading. it's supported by GNOME (im running kde), so should i install some kind of gnome library????
[08:06] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: now just look through dmesg and say if there's anything about the rioch
[08:06] <nikosapi> that burns dvds from files on my laptop/server
[08:07] <darko3d> ls: /dev/hdb1: No such file or directory
[08:07] <nekostar> eh still look at that thread
[08:07] <nekostar> the cli version is really powerful
[08:07] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, I have its already there
[08:07] <nekostar> and it has a lot of info about the stuff your mentioning btw
[08:07] <Flannel> e3: democracy is under package management, which means any dependencies it has are already installed
[08:07] <roryy> darko3d: I'm not sure what's happening here.  Also, I see there's a question mark in the output of fdisk -l you put up earlier
[08:07] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: ok so what node it it attach the device to /dev/sd?
[08:07] <nekostar> good place to start anyway iwould say......
[08:07] <sn00p|> just a second let me check
[08:07] <darko3d> yeah, that's right
[08:07] <e3> So why isnt democracy running? I click it and it flashes and closes.
[08:08] <darko3d> is there something i should do
[08:08] <rickyfingers> e3: maybe your in an authoritarian country?
[08:08] <nekostar> darko3d: are you sure your using ide hard drives and not sata?
[08:09] <bjv> oh, *that* was something else that i thought was really weird when i moved to Edgy..
[08:09] <bjv> "linux-k7 - Obsoleted by: linux-generic"    ???
[08:09] <e3> I use democracy player every day. i just installed Kubuntu from Ubuntu and now democracy wont run.
[08:09] <Flannel> e3: run it from the console, it'll (in theory) give you an error messag
[08:09] <darko3d> lol, i don't know what that means?
[08:09] <roryy> darko3d: sorry, i'm afraid I don't know.  'man fdisk' doesn't say much about the output of fdisk -l
[08:09] <bjv> what's up with that?
[08:09] <Da^Ms7> Hi!
[08:09] <Flannel> bjv: there's only a generic kernel now.  It loads at runtime all the optomizations
[08:09] <nekostar> eh thats wierd indeed ~_~
[08:09] <bjv> mind == blown.
[08:09] <nekostar> kernel == bloat ?
[08:09] <nekostar> and how big is that Flannel ??
[08:10] <Flannel> nekostar: it's same size as the other kernels
[08:10] <Da^Ms7> Ey, guys really need some help here...
[08:10] <Flannel> !ask | Da^Ms7
[08:10] <ubotu> Da^Ms7: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:10] <nekostar> Da^Ms7: just ask instead of asking to ask ;)
[08:10] <bjv> !linux-generic
[08:10] <ubotu> linux-generic: Complete Generic Linux kernel. In component restricted, is optional. Version 2.6.17.10 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[08:10] <darko3d> is there's anything i can do
[08:10] <rickyfingers> Da^Ms7: what's your question?
[08:10] <e3> O
[08:11] <e3> I'm not sure how to run democracy from the console..or where the console hides itself in kde...
[08:11] <bjv> it calls itself konsole in kde
[08:11] <roryy> darko3d: i'm out of ideas; you can try asking here again when different people are on, or try the forums or users' mailing list
[08:11] <rickyfingers> e3: if memory serves it's under system tools, or utilities
[08:11] <nekostar> e3 console is in utilities
[08:11] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, grr I cant find it no more in dmesg|less
[08:11] <nekostar> well its called konsole
[08:11] <e3> k. now to run democracyplayer... eh.. not sure how to do that.
[08:12] <bjv> konsole is shiny, but bloated like all k apps
[08:12] <what_if> :)
[08:12] <nekostar> konsole is not that great... go go xterm
[08:12] <darko3d> thanks roryy, but since u're on, i have some other questions, if you don't mind
[08:12] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: try this type / in less and then something like rioch
[08:12] <Da^Ms7> Tried installing beryl and it got ?&%%" up. Now i cant get gnome to startup. I guess cuz beryl aint working proper and i did put it in startup session. How do i remove it from there?
[08:12] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: then it'll jump to the line that mentions the rioch
[08:12] <what_if> how do I install ubuntu on a computer with an nvidia card ? the display is garbage everytime and I cannot find a fix online
[08:12] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, dmesg / less ricoh?
[08:12] <Flannel> Da^Ms7: try #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl
[08:13] <Da^Ms7> nah just wanna remove the startup
[08:13] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: actually, how about dmesg | grep -i rioch
[08:13] <bjv> what_if: during the install?
[08:13] <chalcedony> i have an hp lazerjet that needs to direct interface to my husband's ubuntu box. What i need is a print share utility to allow other computers on the lan to connect to his box and then to the printer.
[08:13] <nekostar> anyone else have mass locale failings on updating to edgy?
[08:13] <what_if> bjv: yes
[08:13] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, nothing in there
[08:13] <e3> how do i make terminal not go away when i open a program set to load in terminal....
[08:13] <sn00p|> so I have to find drivers for it?
[08:13] <bjv> what_if: what nvidia card?
[08:13] <what_if> bjv: tried amd64 and i386
[08:13] <nekostar> chalcedony: to set up a print server even?
[08:13] <roryy> darko3d: ask away; either I or someone else will try to answer
[08:13] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: no dmesg just tells you if the kernel detects the hardware
[08:14] <what_if> bjv: 6800 gs
[08:14] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, lspci shows it , but dmesg doesn't
[08:14] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: if you do modprobe -l it'll tell you whether or not the module (driver) is already running
[08:14] <bjv> what_if: is it a dell LCD monitor or something?
[08:14] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: but I don't think it runs as a module, I think it's probably compiled into the kernel.
[08:14] <what_if> bjv: also tried vga=770 and xforcevesa
[08:14] <what_if> bjv: no, crt
[08:15] <what_if> bjv: only happens with ubuntu, other distros (suse, knoppix, gentoo) work fine
[08:15] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: the thing is you don't know whether or not support for the hardware was compiled into your kernel, without looking at the .config that was used to build your kernel
[08:15] <nekostar> wow.... lots of modules running.........
[08:15] <bjv> what_if: 6800gs should be supported very well as just a vga card to the ubuntu install
[08:15] <darko3d> how do i get ubuntu to do this, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZtcxHUSDQ
[08:15] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, I'm just using the stock kernel that it came with the installation
[08:15] <darko3d> i was told to use beryl
[08:15] <what_if> bjv: agreed but the installer tries to use the"nv" driver
[08:15] <nekostar> darko3d: what is that a vid of?
[08:15] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: if memory serves, you can get that .config by installing kernel sources
[08:16] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: or kernel headers.
[08:16] <Da^Ms7> So how do I do to remove apps from gnome startup from the terminal? Cant be that hard?
[08:16] <what_if> what_if: can I force the installer to use the "vesa" driver ?
[08:16] <darko3d> a ubuntu user, showing some of the features
[08:16] <nekostar> what_if: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:16] <darko3d> actually this is the vid that made me wanna use ubuntu
[08:16] <Kream> hi all
[08:16] <what_if> nekostar: ok.....
[08:17] <bjv> im pretty sure it's a bitch to configure gnome from the term.
[08:17] <rickyfingers> Da^Ms7: why not just use add/remove applet under applications?
[08:17] <what_if> nekostar: do what ?
[08:17] <skroll> It seems no matter how much spam I train for bogofilter in evolution, it never actually detects junk, even with the plugin turned on.  Any idea what's causing this?
[08:18] <Da^Ms7> rickyfingers: i cant even get in
[08:18] <darko3d> i've been told to download beryl and emerald, how do i do that?
[08:18] <roryy> !beryl | darko3d
[08:18] <ubotu> darko3d: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[08:19] <roryy> darko3d: i think #ubuntu-xgl is where you want to ask about beryl
[08:19] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, where is the .config file
[08:19] <darko3d> 10x
[08:19] <Da^Ms7> rickyfingers: beryl fucked up my boot, cuz i added it for autostart
[08:19] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: give me a second, I'm going to install the sources myself, and then I'll tell you exactly where
[08:19] <Da^Ms7> using only textbased now :(
[08:19] <sn00p|> ok
[08:20] <defrysk> runs great :)
[08:20] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: but if memory serves its in /usr/src/.config
[08:20] <what_if> so... anybody, any ideas on how to install to a GF card ? anyone else having this problem ?
[08:21] <Kream> I'm migrating a gateway that shares a ppp0 connection from Gentoo to Ubuntu. Is there a step by step howto like there is at http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/home-router-howto.xml to get iptables up and running ?
[08:21] <bjv> what_if: i have had no problems on an older geforce, and would expect newer ones to work exactly the same
[08:21] <bjv> same driver, for all of em.
[08:22] <what_if> bjv: yeah, that would've be nice :)
[08:22] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, is there a webpage I can go and see how to build a new kernel I got laptop 64bit
[08:22] <bjv> oh my god, why is this GTK app behaving so *awesome*?!
[08:22] <chalcedony> nekostar: yes to set up a printserver on the box (printer is old, not working as a network printer)
[08:22] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, its in /boot
[08:23] <bjv> they improved the file-select/save dialog in GTK?! :)
[08:23] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic/.config
[08:23] <sn00p|> there wasn't one in there
[08:23] <sn00p|> I looked in the /boot
[08:23] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: did you look there?
[08:24] <rickyfingers> in /usr/src/<your kernel version>/.config
[08:24] <bjv> i can finally jump up the tree more then one level at a time, in GTK when selecting a new file to save to
[08:24] <cypher1> anyone using gmailfs here ?
[08:24] <bjv> man, edgy has great software included. ;p
[08:24] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, yep it says CONFIG_YENTA_RICOH=y
[08:25] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: ok then what node it gets attached to at startup has got to be in dmesg
[08:25] <bingnet922> Hi channel! I'm having a strange problem (edgy): I can't login! At login screen I enter correct credential and I am slowly returned to login screen with NO ERROR! .xsession-errors says "open: permission denied" and I can login to command line console as user or startx as root.
[08:25] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: would you mind pastebining me your dmesg
[08:25] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, its not , i'm worried there is two /usr/src /linux dirs one is for generic and  one is plain
[08:25] <sn00p|> sec
[08:26] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: that's ok, the different directories are there for when you boot off different kernels
[08:26] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, I cant paste very well with my laptop
[08:26] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: every time you make install a new kernel, it'll put another directory tree there
[08:27] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: just do this: dmesg > dmesg-output
[08:27] <sn00p|> ok
[08:27] <sn00p|> I was just going to ask that
[08:27] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: that'll dump everything into a file
[08:28] <sn00p|> you got a email?
[08:28] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: actually, then I think you can just transfer me the file via the irc client.
[08:28] <sn00p|> acutally wait
[08:29] <bjv> how do i doubly ensure that virtual package x-terminal-emulator is present on my system
[08:29] <cypher1> bjv, u can search for it isnt it ?
[08:30] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, http://pastebin.com/827194
[08:30] <bjv> dpkg -l | grep x-terminal-emulator      equals nothing
[08:31] <reklez> i have problems installing.  could it be my motherboard?
[08:31] <reklez> it stalls when looking for video or something like that.
[08:31] <bingnet922> Hi channel! I'm having a strange problem (edgy): I can't login! At login screen I enter correct credential and I am slowly returned to login screen with NO ERROR! .xsession-errors says "open: permission denied" and I can login to command line console as user or startx as root.
[08:32] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, find anything?
[08:32] <bjv> apt-get install x-terminal-emulator, Package x-terminal-emulator is a virtual package provided by: [cut, long list including xterm]  You should explicitly select one to install.
[08:32] <bjv> dpkg -l | grep xterm       returns: ii  xterm
[08:33] <hipitihop> Can someone please tell me how to stop and start the NFS service
[08:33] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: still looking. what is the address on the pci bus for the rioch?
[08:33] <sn00p|> let me check
[08:34] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I'm thinking it might be /dev/sg0
[08:34] <chalcedony> i have an hp lazerjet that needs to direct interface to my husband's ubuntu box. What i need is a print share utility to allow other computers on the lan to connect to his box and then to the printer.
[08:34] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, it really doesn't say what address it just has 03:09.1
[08:34] <chalcedony> he's running dapper
[08:35] <fyrestrtr> chalcedony: cups can provide that, and you can enable it from the printer dialog.
[08:35] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, everytime I put in my microsd sandisk drive ubuntu seems to crash
[08:35] <chalcedony> fyrestrtr: kewl ty :) any pointers?
[08:35] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I've found where in dmesg it detects the hardware.
[08:35] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, yea?
[08:35] <bingnet922> Hi channel! I'm having a strange problem (edgy): I can't login! At login screen I enter correct credential and I am slowly returned to login screen with NO ERROR! .xsession-errors says "open: permission denied" and I can login to command line console as user or startx as root.
[08:35] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: sdhci: SDHCI controller found at 0000:03:09.1 [1180:0822]  (rev 19)
[08:36] <sn00p|> yea I saw that too
[08:36] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: now, right above that, it mentions a generic scsi at /dev/sg0
[08:36] <sn00p|> just as you figured
[08:36] <sn00p|> lol
[08:36] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: so that could be the disk
=== zarul is now known as zarul[brb] 
[08:37] <sn00p|> the question is how to I mount it
[08:37] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: but if ubuntu is crashing when you put the media in, first thing is turn off automounting.
[08:37] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: it should just be mount -t vfat /dev/sd0 /mnt
[08:37] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, how do I turn of automounting?
[08:37] <fyrestrtr> chalcedony: the wiki has some information on it if you get stuck.
[08:38] <bjv> bingnet922: have you ever been able to log in to Edgy?
[08:38] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: give me a sec.
[08:38] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, yea it crashes right away when I turn it on says exact same address you mention
[08:39] <fyrestrtr> chalcedony: samba + cups will help you if you other clients are Windows machines.
[08:39] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, I have hal  installed if that consists part of the problem
[08:39] <loca|host> anyone know a good windows's cain sniffer replacement on ubuntu ?
[08:39] <chalcedony> fyrestrtr: ty much we are almost all ubuntu house :)
[08:40] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: System->Preferences->Removeable Drives And Media
[08:40] <SperMite> Gnight all godbless..
[08:40] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, ok just a sec I had to take battery out of my laptop
[08:40] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: uncheck all the stuff for removeable media
[08:40] <sn00p|> give me a minute
[08:40] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, you running ubuntu 64 on a laptop to?
[08:41] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: nay, I'm running ubuntu 64 on a desktop, athlon am2 w/ a asus m2npv-vm desktop
[08:41] <sn00p|> I want to build a dual am2
[08:42] <bingnet922> bjv: yes, I've been using the last week.
[08:42] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, unmark everyhing?
[08:42] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: that's what I've got here - dual core...not dual socket though...yeah, why not just unmark it all
[08:43] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, reboot or no?
[08:43] <hipitihop> does anyone know how to start and stop NFS ?
[08:43] <sn00p|> i know this isn't windows
[08:43] <sn00p|> you dont have to reboot everytime
[08:43] <luminousnerd> Anyone happen to know the command for UT 2004?
[08:43] <sn00p|> I think yes because its part of the hardware when first start up
[08:43] <sn00p|> so i'll do it anyways
[08:44] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: to tell you the truth I'm not sure.  Why not just put the sd chip in and see what hapens now
[08:44] <sn00p|> I'll reboot
[08:44] <sn00p|> and find out
[08:44] <hipitihop> most linux distro  nfs is started nad stopped via 'service nfs start' what is it in Ubuntu ?
[08:44] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: ok
[08:44] <bjv> bingnet922: well, then id sort of have to ask: what did you change? install any new packages, etc. before you shut it down?
[08:44] <sn00p|> just so I wont have to waste any more time
[08:44] <sn00p|> heh
[08:45] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, it dont crash
[08:45] <hipitihop> Does anyone know about nfslock on Ubuntu ?
[08:46] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, are you sure its sd0 I thought you said it was sg0 earlier
[08:46] <rickyfingers> ok so now let's try mounting.  I think it's /dev/sg0
[08:46] <sn00p|> bleh
[08:46] <sn00p|> my notebook froze
[08:47] <outRider> how do i boot into a console with no x running at all? ive tried runlevel 1 but that doesnt allow me to install nvidia drivers and some other stuff, does anyone know of a better way?
[08:47] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, i'll do sg0
[08:47] <sn00p|> I did sd0 before and that what made it crash
[08:47] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I think sd0 is your sata drive
[08:47] <sn00p|> I think so to
[08:47] <cypher1> arghh jigdo seems not easy as bittorrent
[08:47] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I think sd0 or your laptop's got an internal scsi
[08:47] <RAOF> outRider: You could try the "Recovery Mode" GRUB option
[08:48] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: so are you waiting for reboot now?
[08:48] <sn00p|> yea
[08:49] <RAOF> outRider: Alternatively, Ctrl-Alt-F1 to F4 will switch you to a virtual terminal, where you'll be able to login, run sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop to stop X, install the nvidia drivers, and then run sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start to start X again.
[08:50] <ChrisNiemy> hi
[08:50] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, ok, i'm going to try and mount it again
[08:50] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: crossing my fingers
[08:51] <RAOF> hipitihop: Services can be started/stopped with "sudo /etc/init.d/servicename {stop, start, restart}"
[08:51] <bingnet922> bjv: not that I know of, I did change fstab to change mount points. root partition is not full, and the new mount points are not working for some reason. see output from ken@liteshow$startx > http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32484/
[08:51] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, it froze
[08:51] <sn00p|> well shit
[08:51] <outRider> RAOF, recovery console is runlevel 1, but ill keep that other solution in mind... is there a reason why runlevels 2 and 4 dont seem to exist, or do anything at all?
[08:52] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, it says here#
[08:52] <sn00p|> [17179590.980000]  sdhci: SDHCI controller found at 0000:03:09.1 [1180:0822]  (rev 19)
[08:52] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: cripes. at this point i fear we are dealing with a) a buggy device driver
[08:52] <sn00p|> muhuhuh
[08:52] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: ok b)...we don't have the right node
[08:53] <sn00p|> hrm i'm going to take a look at a log file
[08:53] <cherubiel> bingnet922: you have any stylus devices?
[08:53] <RAOF> outRider: Not that I know of, but then the only runlevels I've really dealt with are 1, 3 & 5.
[08:53] <cherubiel> bingnet922: or else remove the wacom device section from the Xorg.conf file
[08:53] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, what is a good log file to look at
[08:54] <sn00p|> for this kind of thing
[08:54] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: just found a gentoo wiki says /dev/mmcblk0
[08:54] <hipitihop> RAOF, yes after searching around on google I found that out, however when I try this with nfs or nfslock I get an error "ubknown command"
[08:54] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, ok, how do we deal with it
[08:54] <roryy> RAOF and outRider: note that ubuntu (and debian, i believe) uses runlevel 1 for recovery, and 2 for 'normal' use; 3-5 are left for the user to define if he wishes
[08:54] <bingnet922> cherubiel: negative, no wacom...no idea why that's in there
[08:55] <cherubiel> bingnet922: pastebin your xorg.conf
[08:55] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I think we try b) first, what does ls /dev/mmcblk0 say
[08:55] <cherubiel> bingnet922: did yo upgrade to edgy
[08:55] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, join that channel I invited you in #ubuntu64
[08:55] <bingnet922> yup
[08:55] <bingnet922> about a week before this problem started
[08:56] <cherubiel> bingnet922: is this after upgradation?
[08:56] <hipitihop> RAOF, so are these services known under another name in Ubuntu or what am I doing wrong ?
[08:56] <cherubiel> bingnet922: anywyas pastebin it
[08:56] <RAOF> hipitihop: I suppose that you actually have nfs *installed*?  It doesn't seem to be by default.
[08:56] <bingnet922> cherubiel: paste what?
[08:56] <cherubiel> bingnet922: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:57] <bingnet922> I'm having trouble starting x, can you see the problem in the output? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32484/ now pasting xorg.conf
[08:57] <bingnet922> also
[08:57] <sky123> !pastebin
[08:57] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:57] <hipitihop> RAOF, I'll verify that, but I had setup my /etc/exports to include /home and I can mount it from another machine at home so I was assuming that all happened via NFS..anyway checking standby...
[08:58] <sky123> what does ps -ef | grep nfs show??
[08:58] <bingnet922> xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32486/
[08:58] <nevermind> !webcam
[08:58] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[08:59] <nevermind> thanks ubotu
[08:59] <cherubiel> bingnet922: from the section serverlayout
[08:59] <hipitihop> sky123, about 8 processes with nfsd and one with nfsd4
[08:59] <cherubiel> change InputDevice     "stylus" "SendCoreEvents" to #InputDevice     "stylus" "SendCoreEvents"
[08:59] <cherubiel> bingnet922: do the same for the next 2 lines as well, for cursor and eraser
[08:59] <cherubiel> then try to start X again
[09:00] <cherubiel> those are the includes of the stylus drivers in the server config
[09:00] <RAOF> hipitihop: So, I've just installed the nfs stuff, and it seems that what you're after would be either /etc/init.d/nfs-common or ../nfs-kernel-server
[09:01] <probose> hey guys... im trying to "./configure, make, make install" a program named p2kmoto... but look what happens in "make": http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32487/ How do i fix it?
[09:02] <bingnet922> cherubiel: ok edit done and now logging out to try...
[09:03] <sky123> probose: it is very likely that you are missing the kernel-headers....do  a sudo apt-get install build-essential
[09:03] <hipitihop> RAOF, just check and both nfs-common and nfs-kernel-server are already installed
[09:03] <probose> sky123 it says "build-essential is already the newest version" :(
[09:04] <sky123> probose: hmmm.. that is weird.. one sec
[09:04] <RAOF> hipitihop: Um... so what was the problem again?  You should be able to start/stop/restart NFS with "sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server {start,stop,restart}"
[09:04] <roryy> sky123 and probose: try linux-headers-generic (for ubuntu 6.10 i386)
[09:05] <sky123> probose: yep that should do it.. sure looks like the headers are missing
[09:05] <sky123> rorryy: I agree
[09:05] <probose> sky123 newest version too :(
[09:05] <sky123> roryy: sorry about the mispell
[09:05] <cherubiel> bingnet922: any luck?
[09:05] <roryy> sky123: everyone does it ;)
[09:06] <sky123> lol
[09:06] <probose> "p2kmoto.c:26:17: error: usb.h: No such file or directory" well, im pretty noob, but i think that is something related with that line, what do you think?
[09:06] <hipitihop> RAOF, ok I tried '/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start' and seems to work.
[09:06] <bingnet922> cherubiel: ken@liteshow$ > http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32488/
[09:06] <sky123> probose: id try this is as sudo su .... find /  -name usb.h
[09:06] <cherubiel> bingnet922: don;t see any(EE)s there
[09:06] <cherubiel> bingnet922: what do you see?
[09:06] <hipitihop> RAOF, doe you then happen to know what the nfslock service equivalent is also ?
[09:07] <cherubiel> bingnet922: i mean, are you able to run any windowmanagers?
[09:07] <RAOF> hipitihop: I don't know what nfslock *is*.
[09:07] <RAOF> hipitihop: Presumably, it's something about lockfiles on NFS, but I've got nothing, sorry :)
[09:07] <sky123> probose: lets see if it exists at all..
[09:08] <probose> the search result: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32490/
[09:08] <bingnet922> cherubiel: ?
[09:08] <sky123> probose: seems as if ndiswrapper has that...header..
[09:09] <luminousnerd> How can I add something to the applications menu?
[09:09] <hipitihop> RAOF, very confusing. I'm trying to follow this http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch30_:_Configuring_NIS#Table_30-2_NIS_Master_.2F_Slave_.2Fetc.2Fhosts_Files
[09:09] <cherubiel> bingnet922: no errors in the logs, what do you see? is the X crashing right away?
[09:09] <luminousnerd> Something that is already installed, but since it's not a package it's not showing up now?
[09:09] <probose> sky123 so what i must do?
[09:09] <Shaezsche> is it a bad idea to run ubuntu on reiserfs??
[09:09] <sky123> probose: uname -a returns?
[09:10] <probose> Linux lobosque-desktop 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Fri Oct 13 18:41:40 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[09:10] <hipitihop> RAOF, in short I'm trying to setup NIS on Ubuntu so that I can manage logins on one machine and also have all users on all machines host their /home on one NFS server
[09:10] <rickyfingers> luminousnerd: have you already tried applications->add / remove?
[09:10] <bingnet922> cherubiel: ah, yes. I see the nvidia driver splash, then the monochrome X desktop momentarily, then back to command line with tail of afore noted error output.
[09:10] <luminousnerd> rickyfingers: isn't that for installing apps?
[09:10] <luminousnerd> and uninstalling, and all that? But I've already got the app installed (ut2004)
[09:11] <cherubiel> bingnet922: any extra info in /var/log/Xorg,0.log?
[09:11] <rickyfingers> luminousnerd: i think synaptic is for installing apps, then add/remove is for controlling what shows up on the menus
=== zarul[brb]  is now known as zarul
[09:11] <cherubiel> bingnet922: surprisingly, whatever you pasted looks clean

[09:12] <sky123> probose: it seem that it "looks" for the presence of the file in a very specific location in the make file...and based on your paste...the usb.h file is in include...so maybe some sort of symbolic link to that?
[09:12] <Myria> fedora core 6's grub didn't work either, loading grub but just having an empty grub> prompt
[09:12] <sky123> probose: id open up that make file and see where it is trying to look for usb.h
[09:12] <thevenin> Myria:  grub cant recognize the filesystem
[09:12] <sky123> probose: thats my two cents...
[09:12] <thevenin> this might help you
[09:12] <bingnet922> cherubiel: I pasted the output from the command startx
[09:12] <Myria> NTLDR is working fine, of course
[09:12] <thevenin> Myria: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=120802
[09:13] <luminousnerd> rickyfingers: hmm...Add/Remove installs things when you check things you don't have...and uninstalls when you uncheck things you do have...
[09:14] <probose> sky i cant see any reference in makefile... but in p2kmoto.c there is a include to it...
[09:14] <RAOF> hipitihop: Aha!  "aptitude show nfs-common" says that it includes lockd, which is probably what you're after.
[09:14] <cherubiel> bingnet922: same for /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[09:14] <cherubiel> ?
[09:14] <Myria> i suspect that the BIOS can't read past 8 gb with int 0x13
[09:14] <rickyfingers> luminousnerd: ok so we have to find the file that is associated with the applications menu on the task bar
[09:14] <RAOF> hipitihop: So, I'd suggest that nfs-common does everything that the nfslock service would do, and more.
[09:14] <Myria> ...despite there being an "LBA" option in the BIOS setup
[09:14] <rickyfingers> luminousnerd: my guess is that it's a xml file that should be pretty easy to edit
[09:14] <sky123> probose: do you need to do the make all as sudo su or?? im just grasping for ideas now..
[09:15] <sky123> probose: try it as root and see...
[09:15] <probose> i'll try
[09:15] <Myria> and i'm really screwed badly - part of the reason for a linux partition is the ability to reimage an XP 32 partition on demand
[09:15] <Myria> for doing malware research (on direct3d 9 games, which vmware can't handle)
[09:16] <Myria> if i changed the motherboard, i would have to buy 3 new copies of XP
[09:16] <Myria> since they're OEM
[09:16] <probose> sky123 using sudo it gives me the same error :(
[09:17] <hipitihop> RAOF, you have been most helpful. Are you saying I should be starting the nfs-common instead of nfs-kernal=server ?
[09:17] <sky123> probose: hang on...lemme do some checking around...
[09:17] <probose> sky123 ok ;)
[09:17] <RAOF> hipitihop: I think you should be starting *both*.  nfs-kernel-server is the nfs server, and nfs-common seems to start a bunch of related services, like lockd, nfsstat, etc.
[09:18] <RAOF> hipitihop: Also, I thought these services would be on by default if you installed them.  Aren't they?
[09:19] <probose> sky123 i made a test... i moved usb.h to the source directory and replaced include <usb.h> to include "usb.h" and it still not finding usb.h!!!
[09:19] <hipitihop> RAOF, I did not install them, just trying to follow those instructions I gave you the link to...but I see and I also guess that clients probably only need the common
[09:19] <cherubiel> probose: the -I has to be set in the Makefile
[09:20] <probose> cherubiel uh?
[09:20] <cherubiel> the header info location must be specified in the make file, using the -I switch
[09:20] <cherubiel> maybe you should try that.
[09:20] <sky123> ahhh...yes thats it..
[09:20] <sky123> cherubiel:good call
[09:20] <probose> how i do it?
[09:20] <cherubiel> gcc is supplied the header folders using -I
[09:21] <cherubiel> usually that is hardcoded as /usr/src/`uname -r`
[09:21] <hipitihop> RAOF, although the client instruction on that link mention another one 'netfs' ...anyway I think I'm on the right track. Many thanks...going to go and eat some dinner now.
[09:21] <cherubiel> probose: check your makefile
[09:21] <wikityler> does anyone run 6.06 on a system near 1.2Ghz and 512Mb ram? That's what I've got and it hardly manages the drag its lazy ass around.
[09:21] <AndyR> lo all
[09:21] <RAOF> hipitihop: good luck :)
[09:21] <probose> anyway... using usb.h in source directory is a very bad idea... because it includes another headers found in its original directory...
[09:21] <cherubiel> probose: exactly. lots of dependencies
[09:21] <sky123> right
[09:21] <cherubiel> wikityler: try a light weight window manager like windowmaker, fluxbox, xfce
[09:22] <probose> cherubiel im gonna past the makefile, wait
[09:22] <scorp007> probose: if usb.h is in the standard include path, gcc will find it using #include <usb.h>
[09:22] <probose> scorp007 thats the matter... it is not finding :(
[09:22] <scorp007> probose: in which case, no need for -I.
[09:22] <scorp007> probose: then its not in the standard include path.
[09:22] <sky123> this is good info...
[09:22] <cherubiel> scorp007: its part of the kernel headers, doesn't that have to be supplied?
[09:22] <cherubiel> its not in /usr/include
[09:22] <cherubiel> ?
[09:23] <probose> well, it is at all
[09:23] <scorp007> cherubiel: it depends what gcc searches as standard.
[09:23] <probose> see where it is: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32490/
[09:23] <sky123> the question is...why have to pass any flags at all..if build-essential is supposed to take care of paths and such
[09:23] <probose> and here is the makefile: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32491/
[09:25] <cherubiel> INCLUDES = -I$(top_srcdir)/src -I$(top_srcdir)/test is the line
[09:25] <e3> Anyone know why ksayit wont speak? i think im missing something.
[09:25] <sn00p|> where do I get the kernel from kernel.org for the amd64?
[09:25] <scorp007> $(top_srcdir) == .
[09:26] <snowshoefox> !kernel
[09:26] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[09:26] <rickyfingers> sn00p|
[09:26] <probose> cherubiel what is the problem with that line?
[09:26] <No1Viking> Anyone got a tip of a good newsreader?
[09:26] <ChaosFan> slrn
[09:26] <rickyfingers> I'll talk to you in PM
[09:26] <bingnet922> cherubiel: fixed it!
[09:26] <cherubiel> bingnet922: thats beerware :P
[09:26] <bingnet922> it was permissions on /tmp
[09:26] <bingnet922> x couldn't make temp dirs
[09:27] <bingnet922> I changed mount points for tmp...
[09:27] <cherubiel> probose: append -I/usr/src/`uname -r`
[09:27] <snowshoefox> Is it ok to install the SysV IPC stuff to work with Upstart?
[09:27] <bingnet922> BTW: what should /tmp be? 777?
[09:27] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I answered your PM
[09:27] <cherubiel> bingnet922: you should see the errors on ~/,xsession-errors
[09:27] <ar2k7> hi, where can I find an .qtrc example file for default kde plastik look?
[09:28] <bingnet922> ,xsession or .xsession?
[09:28] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, didn't get it are you registered with nickserv?
[09:28] <probose> cherubiel append it and then?
[09:28] <cherubiel> probose: make
[09:28] <probose> cherubiel ok wait a sec
[09:28] <cherubiel> bingnet922: do a chmod +t /tmp as well
[09:28] <dsb> hi
[09:29] <scorp007> probose: what does echo "-I/usr/src/`uname -r`" print?
[09:29] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: oops, I haven't registered
[09:30] <dsb> I'm having some network problems. I have a few comps behind a linksys router that provides my internet. I have set a drupal web server on one computer, but it can't be reached from the outside
[09:30] <igorzolnikov> Is to play Rhythmbox 0.9.6 music in mp3 format?
[09:30] <probose> scorp007 -I/usr/src/2.6.17-10-386
[09:30] <scorp007> probose: is that where your header is located?
[09:31] <sn00p|> rickyfingers, I cant see your msgs then
[09:31] <dsb> I've allowed the router to port forward to the static ip address that I provided to the web server
[09:31] <cherubiel> /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`
[09:31] <probose> scorp007 it is in /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic/include/linux/usb.h
[09:31] <cherubiel> my bad.
[09:31] <scorp007> there you go.
[09:32] <probose> so i must use -I/usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`
[09:32] <scorp007> I'm not 100% sure, does gcc search recursively?
[09:32] <igorzolnikov> Is Rhythmbox to play a music in mp3 format?
[09:32] <scorp007> or does it only search the directory you specify?
[09:32] <rickyfingers> sn00p|: I'm having trouble remembering the commands to register my nic
[09:33] <sn00p|> its /msg nickserv identify password
[09:33] <scorp007> probose: if your file is in the linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic directory, and uname -r returns a different value, what makes you think gcc will find it anyway?
[09:33] <bjv> and by "nickserv" he means "bjv"
[09:34] <scorp007> sn00p|: I'm not aware that's how you register a nick?
[09:34] <probose> so why dont use -I/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic
[09:34] <sky123> dsb: check netstat -ln | more for port 80 to be open...then same on linksys..and make sure you portforward to the box that has drupal on it
[09:34] <probose> ??
[09:34] <cherubiel> probose: you should try those, to see the actual effect :)
[09:35] <sn00p|> oh
[09:35] <cherubiel> probose: anyways it wouldn't hurt anything else
[09:35] <rickyfingers> sn00p| ok i think i did it, i was misspelling nicser
[09:35] <sn00p|> heh
[09:35] <sn00p|> i see your msg
[09:35] <sky123> probose: thats good advice...try...test...and see ...
[09:35] <probose> gives the same error :P
[09:35] <cherubiel> probose: make clean; make
[09:36] <probose> same error
[09:36] <cherubiel> probose: what does the readme say? there was a configure step?
[09:37] <dsb> sky123: I think its a problem with dns or my domain. I had my drupal configured base_url as a private ip net, but then I changed it too the FQDN that I have registered and a no go
[09:37] <probose> it just tells to configure make and make install
[09:37] <probose> and some others advanced things
[09:37] <sky123> dsb: and what happens when you try by ip?
[09:38] <dsb> when I had the raw ip address I could hit my default web directory, but could not go past the drupal form the outside, on the inside I could
[09:38] <scorp007> probose: did you try to follow the instructions in the appropriate INSTALL or README file?
[09:39] <probose> scorp007 sure i did
[09:39] <probose> hey... i must put that line into the makefile inside /src too?
[09:39] <phlasphy> hey all
[09:39] <sky123> dsb: it does sound like what you have stated could be the issue..but more so...id check the configs and make sure none of the internal and external addressing is mixed up..
[09:39] <cherubiel> probose: what did you change??
[09:39] <cherubiel> Makefile,in ??
[09:39] <phlasphy> what is a good program to rip and encode an audio cd to flac?
[09:39] <dsb> I can go to default directory with raw ip, but I click on my drupal directory and it doesn't resolve the domain
[09:39] <cherubiel> hange in Makefile
[09:39] <cherubiel> !audacity
[09:39] <ubotu> audacity: A fast, cross-platform audio editor. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2.4b-2.1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1850 kB, installed size 5444 kB
[09:39] <probose> i changed makefile
[09:39] <probose> but there is also other makefile in /src
[09:40] <probose> the include line in it says
[09:40] <probose> INCLUDES = $(all_includes)
[09:41] <we2by> hi
[09:41] <scorp007> probose: generally, the configure script should generate the correct Makefile. You shouldn't normally tamper with the makefile itself.
[09:41] <dsb> I don't really want to put my raw ip in the conf because it might change, thus I have zoneedit dns service
[09:41] <we2by> what tool do I use to play a dvd from an .iso file??
[09:41] <scorp007> probose: you can usually pass options to ./configure.
[09:41] <RAOF> !sudo
[09:41] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:42] <enquest> I got a VIA graph. chip ... I can't find any where how to install beryl, xgl ... with this VIA graph chip?
[09:42] <we2by> !dvd
[09:42] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[09:42] <bun-bun> !esd
[09:42] <ubotu> esd is the enlightened sound deamon. It's deprecated, use !alsa instead
[09:42] <bjv> hm, i play dvd's by pointing mplayer to something in /dev
[09:42] <bun-bun> !alsa
[09:42] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[09:43] <bjv> you can of course mount the .iso, but that's not really at all how dvd's are played.
[09:44] <we2by> !iso
[09:44] <ubotu> To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[09:45] <bjv> when you play disc media, you dont mount it into your filesystem
[09:46] <dsb> I don't think my dns is working?
[09:47] <dsb> I'm using zoneedit, but is there something I do not have configured correctly on my ubuntu for my domain name to be resolved?
[09:48] <sky123> dsb: when you say dns is not working...maybe a nslookup ip , then nslookup nameofbox...then thatll tell you if you have proper forward and reverse rules setup correctly
[09:48] <sky123> dsb: also check /etc/resolv.conf
[09:50] <xpoint> !raid
[09:50] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[09:50] <sky123> you know..while were sort of on the topic..anybody sucessfully got the tftp/dhcp network install to work out for them?
[09:50] <sky123> someone on here was asking about that yesterday
[09:51] <sky123> and if so...could contribute a write up??
[09:52] <dsb> strange, nslookup first reports a not existing server, then a non-authoritive answer to my isp. My /etc/resolv.conf is not correct. Hmm I better find out my namerserver?
[09:54] <Spee_Der> Good morning everyone.
[09:55] <dsb> what is the correct format for more than one nameserver in resolv.conf?
=== evil-pcweirdo is now known as pcweirdo
[09:55] <dsb> each line begin with nameserver?
[09:55] <dsb> and is there a priority?
[09:56] <bun-bun> dsb# yes, and top to bottom
[09:56] <Spee_Der> domain abc.aus.century.com
[09:56] <Spee_Der> nameserver 192.9.201.1
[09:56] <Spee_Der> nameserver 192.9.201.2
[09:56] <Spee_Der> The example contains entries in the resolv.conf file for a host that is not a name server.
[09:56] <sky123> yep thats it
[09:57] <sky123> but did you mean " that is a name server"
[09:57] <sky123> because it does search against those...
[10:02] <eneried> hello, i need a little help, in dapper i have a disk manager, in edgy there's not such tool. How can i edit my mount points, avoiding the use of the new hellborn edgy fstab?
[10:02] <sky123> dsb: so you made this entry...lets say..for example...on register.com to say " hey root servers" here is the authoritative dns server  and here is the record?
[10:02] <dsb> I think now my /etc/hosts is messed up?
[10:03] <dsb> sky123, indeed it was working a few days ago, before I got crazy enough to try drupal
[10:03] <sky123> dsb: so anyone should be able to hit your domain name from the outside right? what is it?
[10:03] <RAOF> eneried: The UUID stuff in edgy's fstab is strictly optional.  You don't need to use it.  /dev/sda3 or something still works.
[10:03] <luminousnerd> Spee_Der: Eh, I've actually been googling a while with no luck (except some E17 stuff)
[10:03] <dsb> www.ripperscallions.com
[10:03] <sky123> k one sec
[10:04] <Spee_Der> luminousnerd: Hmmmm....
[10:05] <dsb> I can't hit it locally, and I was able to earlier
[10:06] <luminousnerd> Hmm, my firefox is acting strange.  It doesn't wrap text for a looooooooong time
[10:07] <Spee_Der> luminousnerd: One site to try is -->> http://www.bluechillies.com/details/20103.html
[10:07] <Spee_Der> luminousnerd: Yeah, my firefox is acting odd also..... It gets the jitters from time to time......
[10:08] <luminousnerd> Thanks for the link
[10:08] <Spee_Der> luminousnerd: Sometimes it also shrinks instead of staying maximized or full-screen......
[10:08] <luminousnerd> Wtf...windows?
[10:08] <Spee_Der> luminousnerd: Nope, for liunx....
[10:09] <Fletch229> this is probably a stupid question but how do iget the ubuntu live cd to boot without the dang progress bar so i can see the boot messages
[10:09] <luminousnerd> Platform:PC (Windows/DOS)  Operating Systems:Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP
[10:13] <Spee_Der> wow
[10:13] <sky123> yeah..the power of irc...lol
[10:13] <dsb> sky123: ok, but where is my screw up? with zoneedit, my resolv.conf, my /etc/hosts, or something else?
[10:13] <SperMite> can any one please send me a Demonoid registration invitation code
[10:14] <sky123> dsb: i think a good bet would be on zonedit
[10:14] <cypher1> what happened ??
[10:14] <dsb> I was afraid of that, but I didn't change anything with them
[10:14] <timbobsteve> hey all
[10:14] <timbobsteve> anyone use MacOnLinux ?
[10:14] <sky123> dsb: see..the root servers look to the zonedits as authoritative...and if the records are messed up..well then there you have it..
[10:15] <luminousnerd> eneried: I'm sorry what did I help you with? >.<
[10:15] <cypher1> what happened ??
[10:15] <sky123> dsb: id bet you the fields you entered..there for the ip pointing to the domain name and vice versa are somehow messed up
[10:15] <Spee_Der> cypher1: It is called a net-split.....
[10:16] <Spee_Der> cypher1: It happens from time to time.....
[10:16] <Spee_Der> !netsplit
[10:16] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[10:16] <willwork4foo> anyone know what the hell is going on with the xda-dev web server? it would appear that a large percentage of the UK is unable to access any of the http content
[10:16] <dsb> I haven't changed anything with zoneedit
[10:16] <sky123> yep....like i said...the power of irc ...;)
[10:16] <cypher1> Spee_Der, thank you :)
[10:16] <Spee_Der> Yeh sky
[10:16] <dsb> and it worked
[10:17] <dsb> my ip 75.26.182.11
[10:17] <willwork4foo> we can access the FTP site, and can ping the web servers - but browsers are timing out all across the UK when trying to browse to http://forum.xda-developers.com, or http://wiki.xda-developers.com...
[10:17] <luminousnerd> Will some windows games just install without a hitch if I run them normally through Wine?!
[10:17] <luminousnerd> No problems with WCIII so far! it's crazy!
[10:17] <dsb> that ip hits my webserver
[10:17] <sky123> dsb: 75.26.182.11 resolves to adsl-75-26-182-11.dsl.scrm01.sbcglobal.net
[10:18] <willwork4foo> did anyone read what I said? or does nobody here give a crap about the people in the UK
[10:19] <dsb> sky123, that would be my dsl modem, which I use zoneedit
[10:19] <sky123> dsb: the adsl page points me to your box successfully
[10:19] <cypher1> Willow_dodo, do you use any proxy server to connect to web ?
[10:20] <sky123> dsb: the domain name....take a look... ripperscallions.com resolves to ripperscallions.com.
[10:20] <sky123> dsb:you see the issue right??
[10:20] <dsb> no
[10:20] <dsb> I understand, but I don't see where my conf is messed up?
[10:20] <willwork4foo> cypher1, was that me you referred the question to?
[10:20] <Spee_Der> Geeesh
[10:21] <sky123> dsb: well the ip points to the adsl.blah..blah...which the authoritative dns server says cool!
[10:21] <Spee_Der> My opera just went closed for no reason.....
[10:21] <twilight> Hi all. I think I've a problem with hal in edgy. When I try to burn a CD, the system doesn't recognize it, and ask to insert a blank cd, . serpentine doesn't give any error, bonfire: " No property volume.disc.capacity on device with id /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/volume_empty_unknown". Suggestions?
[10:21] <cypher1> willwork4foo, sorry yes it was to u
[10:21] <sky123> dsb: however...the ripperscallions..points to no ip...it points back to the name itself...that is the issue
[10:21] <Spee_Der> willwork4foo: Please, sent those links again, my browser went south just then. Thanks.
[10:21] <willwork4foo> cypher1: I have spoken to around 30 people in the UK, and NONE of us can view the site. across a wide area of the UK, using different ISPs.
[10:21] <apikoros> hi.i want to have a menu option in GRUB which restores a particular partition (not the boot partition) from an image using a small shell script. what's the best way to do that? define a new init level?
[10:22] <willwork4foo> http://forum.xda-developers.com and http://wiki.xda-developers.com
[10:22] <Spee_Der> ty
[10:22] <willwork4foo> oh, and http://www.xda-developers.com
[10:22] <Spee_Der> Got into the first one all okay.....
[10:22] <sky123> dsb: hence the problem is on the zoneedit...which is your record for authoritative dns...once you fix it...it will take time to propogate to the root servers...and then you will need to check for proper forward forward and reverse resolution
[10:22] <willwork4foo> in fact - NONE of the http sites work from xda-developers.com
[10:22] <willwork4foo> Spee_Der, are you in the UK?
[10:23] <Spee_Der> Got into that one also, no problem.....
[10:23] <willwork4foo> Spee_Der, are you in the UK
[10:23] <willwork4foo> ok/
[10:23] <willwork4foo> so - it's working fine outside the UK.
[10:23] <willwork4foo> those links time out for every person I know in the UK
[10:24] <Spee_Der> hmmm
[10:24] <cypher1> willwork4foo, did you ping using the ip address or name ?
[10:24] <willwork4foo> cypher1: ping works fine
[10:24] <dsb> well I clearly have ripperscallions.com and www.ripperscallions.com pointing to 75.26.182.11 on zoneedit and it has been that way for a few days. no changes were made and it worked. I initially waited for the propagation, because I understood that it would take time.
[10:24] <willwork4foo> I can ping the URLs no problems at all
[10:24] <sky123> id do a nice trace route on the http://www.xda-developers.com/ and see where it drops off for you
[10:24] <willwork4foo> sky123, ping works. ping responds.
[10:24] <eneried> luminousnerd, you helped me about fstad
[10:25] <sobersabre> hi guys, I've got an mp3 question. idv1/2 etc.
[10:25] <willwork4foo> some people in the UK can view the pages, it would seem - but most cannot.
[10:25] <SperMite> Anyone in here a registered demonoid user?
[10:25] <dsb> I had generic static html where www.ripperscallions.com was hit. now damn drupal has my panties in a bunch
[10:25] <cypher1> willwork4foo, can you try telnet to port 80 of the server ?
[10:25] <sobersabre> I have mp3 file with meta info. I am fixing it ( I don't remember with which enc. I encoded this CD )
[10:25] <willwork4foo> cypher1: no, that times out.
[10:26] <sobersabre> ( I remember downloading it from Artist's site actually )
[10:26] <dsb> sorry sky123, you have been very helpful and I appreciate very much!
[10:26] <sobersabre> anyway, the meta-info needs to be fixed.
[10:26] <enquest> does easyubuntu work for edgy?
[10:26] <rickyfingers> sobersabre: you try opening the .mp3 file with a hex editor?
[10:26] <sobersabre> rickyfingers moment.
[10:26] <sobersabre> Usually I can edit with amarok.
[10:26] <willwork4foo> cypher: I am fairly sure that some idiot has set some IP block that has affected a large number of UK internet users
[10:26] <rickyfingers> sobersabre: then you can edit the file manually
[10:26] <sky123> dsb: np...you DO in fact have a DNS issue...and by all accounts it is a resolution issue
[10:27] <sky123> dsb: try this from a browser...
[10:27] <sobersabre> rickyfingers, but these 2 files have  CRC checksums in the COMMENT field.
[10:27] <sobersabre> and they simply DON'T GET DELETED.
[10:27] <sky123> dsb: http://adsl-75-26-182-11.dsl.scrm01.sbcglobal.net
[10:27] <Lord_Dicranius> what can I do if the directory "/lib/modules/2.6.15-257-686/build" doesn't exist?  I'm having issues compiling madwifi-ng
[10:27] <sobersabre> Is there a charset field in the mp3 file's meta info ?
[10:27] <cypher1> willwork4foo, yes maybe
[10:28] <willwork4foo> cypher1: I'd say highly probably
[10:28] <dsb> sky123: that worked
[10:28] <willwork4foo> cypher1: know anyone in here who would have admin access to unfuck this?
[10:28] <dsb> it took awhile
[10:29] <davin> I got some files in my trash bin possibly owned by root and I cant delete them, how do I access trash thru terminal?
[10:29] <cypher1> willwork4foo, no sorry
[10:29] <rickyfingers> sobersabere: I'm downloading ghexedit to have a look
[10:29] <sky123> dsb: yep...because the root servers say...the ip...72.56.182.-11 is pointed to that domain name
[10:29] <dsb> could be my isp then possibly?
[10:29] <sky123> dsb: however...the ripperscallions points not to any ip..but to ripperscallions.com.   NOTE the dot at the end
[10:30] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, what do you get from uname -a
[10:30] <sky123> dsb: so im thinking record is incorret
[10:30] <dsb> ok me double checks
[10:30] <sky123> dsb: yep
[10:30] <sky123> dsb: thats a good call
[10:30] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: Linux icarus 2.6.15-27-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Sep 16 02:13:27 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[10:30] <rickyfingers> sobersabere: the header's the first 100 bytes
[10:31] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, did you mean "/lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686/build" rather than "/lib/modules/2.6.15-257-686/build" otherwise there's you're problem
[10:32] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: that first msg I sent, that was supposed to be ...15-27-686..., sorry
[10:32] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: yeah, that's what I meant to type.  fat fingered it hah
[10:33] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, does /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686 exist?
[10:33] <dsb> sky123: im not sure what else to check, because zoneedit automatically defaults to the domainname that you register with, so ripperscallions.com CANNOT be changed. I have to add www.ripperscallions.com and if I wanted green.ripperscallions.com, etc.
[10:33] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: yes, just the build directory is missing
[10:33] <dsb> I try without www and samething
[10:34] <sky123> dsb: the real important question is...where does www.ripperscallions.com point to ?? the ip??
[10:34] <apikoros> where does ubuntu define its inits?
[10:34] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: so when I try to do the "make" command when trying to compile madwifi, it gives me an error saying that it's not a valid file or directory
[10:34] <dsb> at zoneedit, I have it pointing to the raw ip address, but apparently that is not happening?
[10:35] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, are you using module-assistant to build?
[10:35] <sky123> dsb: and when you mean...raw...that is the 72.X address ??
[10:35] <sky123> dsb: so the domain ripperscallions.com should point to that ip
[10:35] <dsb> yes 72.26.182.11
[10:35] <sky123> dsb: and is there a section for reverse resolution or no
[10:36] <Trainstroker> how do i make a video of my desktop... kinda like prntscrn bu a vide
[10:36] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: I'm not sure what module-assistant is, so I'm supposing I'm not.  I'm just simply typing "sudo make" into a terminal while in the "/usr/src/madwifi-ng" directory
[10:36] <dsb> I'll look
[10:36] <sky123> dsb: does it give you the option of pointing ripperscallions to asdl.blah..blah blah??
[10:37] <dsb> the field says "numeric ip address
[10:37] <|thunder> Ill give a dollar to anyone who can get these videos to play on edgy+firefox2. http://www.adultswim.com/adultswimfix/index.html
[10:37] <dsb> "
[10:37] <renlore> hi any idea if any ubuntu repositories have skype in them?
[10:37] <sky123> dsb: I know the issue i think....look at the ip...
[10:38] <sky123> dsb: are you sure its 72 not 75.

[10:40] <sky123> dsb: check the reverse resolution??
[10:40] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, try running "sudo apt-get update" followed by "sudo apt-get install module-assistant build-essential" then try to make again
[10:40] <iLLf8d> Trainstroker, check imagemagick

[10:42] <zoetrope666> Hi all, I'm having troubles finding a program and driver that will run my webcam. It is a really cheap, seemingly obscure one called simply 'digital camera

[10:42] <zoetrope666> Hi all, I'm having troubles finding a program and driver that will run my webcam. It is a really cheap, seemingly obscure one called simply 'digital camera' or 'dual camera', manufactured by sq technology
[10:43] <zoetrope666> any ideas?
[10:43] <dsb> interesting, I found a faq for the reverse. It was the last question. I'll pastebin
[10:44] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: I ran those commands, then ran make again, but received the same error

[10:45] <nuts`> hi
[10:46] <renlore> Thanks all
[10:46] <dsb> it says 'reverse is hard' and 'not required for correct operation of web servers...'
[10:46] <nuts`> anyone uses or got experience with wpa_supplicant?
[10:46] <Spee_Der> zoetrope666: Do you have a model # for that camera please....
[10:47] <dsb> sky123: does yahoo/att not like what I'm doing? is that what I'm led to conclude?
[10:48] <|thunder> zoetrope666; after you plug it in, is there anything referencing it when you do 'dmesg' ?
[10:48] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, did you edit Makefile.inc?
[10:49] <zoetrope666> CD130E2NG .. It says on Windows that the driver version is 905.108.917.3
[10:49] <zoetrope666> sorry, thereisnt a lot of documentation with it
[10:49] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: yes, I deleted the "-Werror" part
[10:50] <mexp> Hi.. got a prob with mounting CDs, I get error "Error: could not execute pmount"
[10:50] <sky123> dsb: it does say though reverse is Not that important..so be it..
[10:50] <zoetrope666> thunder: no, after i plug it in nothing happens. I've tried downloading easycam2 and camorama, but neither recognise it
[10:50] <sky123> dsb: the trick here is to get it to point somehow to the adsl
[10:50] <dsb> I noticed that
[10:50] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, I gather your following http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=105437?
[10:50] <dsb> which it says to ask isp
[10:50] <dsb> no?
[10:51] <sky123> dsb: i wonder....does the it say instead of the ip that you can point it to adsl
[10:51] <sky123> dsb: so your domain would point to adsl..instead of the ip..??
[10:51] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: well, I was following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Madwifi , but looking at them, they're pretty much the same thing
[10:51] <dsb> I think I can do a test, I have another domain on this other machine that doesnt like mysql which is a whole 'nother problem

[10:52] <dsb> the way zoneedit works is for cable/dsl peoples. you just find out what your ...
[10:53] <Jessicatz> hi, I'd like to start a program every time I log in, where do I put the command in?
[10:53] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, try running "sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` gcc-3.4 subversion sharutils" and then make again
[10:53] <Jessicatz> ~/.bash_profile didn't work
[10:53] <dsb> hmm, I think i would have to use the dsl modems hostname, no?
[10:53] <zoetrope666> Itufactured by sq technology. CD130E2NG .. It says on Windows that the driver version is 905.108.917.3
[10:53] <zoetrope666> oooops
[10:54] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: alright, give me one sec...
[10:54] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, that's in the one guide but not in the one you were following
[10:55] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: would I matter if I have gcc 4.x installed, rather than 3.x?
[10:55] <Spee_Der> zoetrope666: Is that a digital camera ?
=== zarul is now known as zarul[brb] 
[10:55] <zoetrope666> yes
[10:55] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: because I've been skipping the install of gcc 3.x because I already had 4.x
[10:56] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: it might've been the linux-headers cuz it's compiling right now...
[10:56] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: I mean the linux-headers are being compiled via apt-get
[10:57] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, gcc 3.x can coexist with 4.x, at least that should be the case
[10:57] <sky123> dsb: thats what im thinking
[10:57] <Spee_Der> zoetrope666: I have the home page for that camera, made in China. Am looking for the drivers. You need for Linux or Windows ?
[10:58] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: ok, it finished compiling gcc 3.x, it's still working on the linux-headers
[10:59] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: sudo make is working now
[10:59] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: thanks eternalswd.  I'll go through the rest of this and check back in if I have any more issues :-)
[10:59] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, okay, you should be able to just finish following the guide from there
[11:00] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: thanks again
[11:00] <eternalswd> Lord_Dicranius, no problem, that's what the linux community is all about :)
[11:00] <icebank> hey guys
[11:01] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: I just switched over to linux permanently not too long ago, and the community is the greatest part of it all I've come to find so far
[11:01] <eternalswd> hey icebank
[11:01] <icebank> i'm trying to compile a kernel module but it's failing because it doesn't have the modpost script. I installed the kernel headers but noticed this scipt wasn't compiled. Is there a common solution to this problem?
[11:01] <zoetrope666> spee_der: i need drivers for Linux
[11:01] <Spee_Der> zoetrope666: Ok, working on it.....
[11:02] <dsb> sky123: unfortunately, I did not read all that fine print from yahoo/att, but I'm starting to think that they don't like me server up some ripperscallions
[11:02] <roryy> icebank: hrm, i see a modpost binary at /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic/scripts/mod/modpost
[11:02] <icebank> odd
[11:03] <sky123> dsb: that could be it..id read up on the whole zonedit thing....who did you purchase the domain name from??
[11:03] <icebank> i installed linux-headers-2.6.15-27, the exact kernel i have running
[11:03] <dsb> I switched webservers and now eipiplus1.com is not hitting
[11:03] <zoetrope666> spee_der: brb - got to switch computers
[11:03] <nuts`> anyone uses or got experience with wpa_supplicant?
[11:04] <roryy> icebank: i think the package name needs an architecture (i386, whatever too)
[11:04] <icebank> roryy, ok
[11:04] <eternalswd> icebank, try "sudo apt-get linux-headers-`uname -r`"
[11:04] <roryy> icebank: try installing 'linux-headers-i386' or 'linux-headers-k7' or whatever instead; that should depend on your current kernel version
[11:04] <icebank> i'm installing -386
[11:04] <dsb> sky123, I've never had problems with zoneedit. I have a few domains with godaddy. I just moved and now using a NEW and DIFFERENT isp, namely yahoo/att, not to drop names or anything, but...
[11:04] <roryy> !linux-headers-i386
[11:04] <Trainstroker> how do i make a vid of my desktop:?
[11:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about linux-headers-i386 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:04] <roryy> !linux-headers-386
[11:04] <ubotu> linux-headers-386: Linux kernel headers on 386. In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.17.10 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[11:05] <icebank> yup
[11:05] <icebank> it's unpacking
[11:05] <windshear> is there a tool for ubuntu to see avaliable wlan's?
[11:05] <roryy> hmm, odd that it still exists in edgy *scratches head*
[11:05] <sky123> dsb: same darn problem... take a look at dnstools.com and you immediately see what i mean
[11:05] <dsb> while I'm at it, CenturyTel works great with zoneedit!
[11:05] <sky123> dsb: lol
[11:06] <icebank> roryy, eternalswd, perfect! module compiles great now
[11:06] <icebank> thanks a lot guys
[11:06] <joachim-n> anyone else getting black lines on their top panel since Edgy?
[11:06] <dsb> so yahoo/att are onto my 'webserving' activities?
[11:06] <zoetrope666> spee_der: sorry, am back now
[11:06] <eternalswd> icebank, no problem
[11:06] <sky123> dsb: when i got mine from register...i just use them..i suppose i could have used m own bind or djbdns server..but it just plain works..
[11:07] <Spee_Der> zoetrope666: np. I am still looking.....  Not finding much more than pix and descriptions for that nice looking unit.
[11:07] <sky123> dsb: you have narrowed down though that it is dns issue. the use of something like dns tools will help to get it right though..or....learn to use dig
[11:07] <zoetrope666> spee_der: yeah i had similar problems. haha@nice looking, it looks weird i reckon  :P
[11:08] <dsb> sky123: indeed and again I appreciate your help!
[11:08] <sky123> dsb: no problem....sharpning my skills while unemployed...lol
[11:08] <Spee_Der> zoetrope666: I am kind'a surprised that linux doesn't just find it, or one of the linux programs that is.....
[11:08] <Spee_Der> zoe it did find all three of myusb cameras on its own....
[11:08] <sky123> dsb: as of yesterday..company i worked for went under...lol
[11:09] <dsb> i can understand that... I'm finally employed but here I am on a friday night tooling around with this crap and not out with some of the ladies
[11:09] <sky123> dsb: and not because of their admin....thank you very much...lol
[11:09] <Spee_Der> sky, sorry to 'ear that
[11:09] <roryy> erk
[11:09] <zoetrope666> spee_der: no idea why either.. other than that its a cheap one
[11:09] <sky123> dsb: chicks dig dns
[11:09] <sky123> lol
[11:09] <dsb> lol
[11:09] <Lord_Dicranius> eternalswd: I got through all of it except the very last step.  When I enter this command "wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta" I receive this error "wlanconfig: ioctl: No such device"  I did a search on the ubuntu forums for wlanconfig, but there were no answers there :-\
[11:10] <Axsuul> does anyone have a good sources.list, im trying to do an apt-get rar par2 but it says the packages aren't found

[11:10] <windshear> is there a tool for ubuntu to see avaliable wlan's?
[11:10] <Axsuul> windshear: networkmanager
[11:11] <sky123> dsb: id see if the domain provider has some tricky way for you to point the dns through themselves.
[11:11] <dsb> ya, but domain names are cheap. I've got a bucketload of domain names
[11:11] <windshear> thx
[11:11] <apokryphos> !rar | Axsuul
[11:11] <ubotu> Axsuul: rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[11:11] <apokryphos> Axsuul: for par2 I think there's something called gpar or else you'll have to use the CLI app
[11:11] <apokryphos> !info par2

[11:11] <sky123> dsb: I ripperscallions huh?
[11:12] <zoetrope666> spee_der, ok thanks anyway
[11:12] <LinAsH> Trainstroker, you can try with istanbul
[11:12] <dsb> I no rookie, but then again, as you can tell I'm far from up to par skill on my networkings. I have another domain that I manage, but I have it hosted
[11:12] <Axsuul> apokryphos: im trying to set up this app called "hellanzb" and they both require rar and par2
[11:13] <apokryphos> Axsuul: both of those are available from the repositories. See the info I just gave you. Though if you're going to download binary content via usenet I recommend klibido, rather.
[11:13] <dsb> ya, ripperscallions. I thought I would buy the domain for my band buddies as they keep putting up youtubes..
[11:13] <Trainstroker> thanks ash... anything that can save the file as avi or something>?
[11:13] <sky123> dsb: tenacious d...lol
[11:13] <dsb> indeed!
[11:14] <sky123> dsb: yo man if i knew you had beer, i woulda had this stuff fixed and flown over..lol
[11:14] <dsb> jimmyjah is a great harpiscordist!
[11:14] <Axsuul> apokryphos: im using gnome though

[11:15] <Axsuul> apokryphos: thanks, ill try that
[11:15] <sacater> is there a way to get sound drivers?
[11:15] <sky123> dsb: either Bind or djb..
[11:15] <sacater> from terminal
[11:15] <dsb> sky123: I knew sooner or later I would have to learn that...
[11:15] <savvas> sacater: sudo apt-get install alsa-base
[11:16] <sacater> tyvm
[11:16] <sky123> dsb: a nice one..though its not OPEN is djb-dns... check out djbdnsrocks.com
[11:16] <CaTT> Cze
[11:16] <apokryphos> Axsuul: all kde apps should work flawlessly on gnome, and visa versa

[11:16] <CaTT> Hi i mean ;)
[11:17] <Axsuul> apokryphos: i see, thanks.
[11:17] <dsb> and now my 40 year friend wants me to learn WOW... are you kidding me?
[11:17] <sky123> dsb: starcraft rocks man...even after all these years...it is a kick ass game
[11:17] <zdravko> hi there!
[11:17] <zdravko> is there skype for Edgy?

[11:23] <dsb> hey, I'm learning here!
[11:23] <sky123> ;)
[11:24] <sky123> learning...can be fun....sorta
[11:24] <dsb> I'm also new to ubuntu
[11:24] <sky123> if it finally ends up working
[11:24] <VigoFuse> Learning is good, a day I have not learned sometheing is a day that was wasted.
[11:25] <sky123> dsb: here is another one..that I have YET to be answered in here... how to BOND two interfaces on a ubuntu box...
[11:25] <sky123> does anyone know how to do this??
[11:25] <sky123> on my RH box it is snap
[11:25] <dsb> sky123, I had two interfaces on my gentoo and tried
[11:25] <sacater> HOW CAN I INSTALL FLASH ON MY UBUNTU?
[11:26] <Iulian> sacater: turn off the caps please.
[11:26] <apokryphos> sacater: please read the FAQ
[11:26] <savvas> dsb: you wanted linux on ps3?
[11:27] <dsb> no, I was being sarcastic
[11:27] <sky123> dsb: in other distros the whole /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ for ifcfg-etho,ifcfg-eth1, ifcfg-bond0 make it clear...in ubuntu im stumped
[11:27] <savvas> mkay
[11:27] <dsb> actually yes, but I'm not going to buy a ps3
[11:27] <sky123> dsb: lol
[11:28] <dsb> sky123: have you tried LFS or freebsd?
[11:28] <sky123> everyone knows that is what an old XBOX is for....loading linux
[11:28] <savvas> then this website won't be much of a help: http://dl.qj.net/PlayStation-3-Linux-Tools/catid/514
[11:28] <Lord_Dicranius> I got through all of the steps for compiling madwifi-ng except the very last step.  When I enter this command "wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta" I receive this error "wlanconfig: ioctl: No such device"  I did a search on the ubuntu forums for wlanconfig, but there were no answers there :-\  Can anybody help me please?
[11:28] <sky123> dsb: nope..just centos, rh,suse, now  ubuntu..
[11:29] <joe74> Ok, here's a good one, ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy", I have two sound cards, one VIA (integrated) the other Audigy (PCI), I can't set Audigy as default, it always chooses VIA as default, I did "sudo asoundconf set-default-card Audigy", then I reboot, and nothing, still VIA
[11:29] <dsb> how do you like suse?
[11:29] <sky123> savvas: touche! nice.....
[11:29] <joe74> suse sucks...
[11:29] <joe74> I just dropped suse for ubuntu
[11:29] <VigoFuse> So the majority here suggest that I use the ATI Linux package for the driver? is that do-able
[11:29] <sky123> suse was very very good BEFORE novel got hold of it
[11:29] <savvas> #ubuntu-offtopic :p
[11:29] <joe74> 9.3 best version of suse
[11:29] <dsb> am I a freakin old fart here?
[11:30] <sky123> yep
[11:30] <sky123> 10.1 was the final straw...i switched
[11:30] <joe74> still good for setting a web server, that's all
[11:30] <joe74> yeah smart and zen rug all that crap
[11:30] <joe74> drove me nuts
[11:30] <sky123> and never looked back...ubuntu rocks...now im back on topic..so nah nee nah nee nah nee
[11:30] <sky123> ;)
[11:30] <apikoros> how do i tell linux to boot into a particular runlevel?
[11:30] <dsb> remember when John Carmack and gang released a version of Quake with suse 6.3
[11:31] <joe74> Ok, here's a good one, ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy", I have two sound cards, one VIA (integrated) the other Audigy (PCI), I can't set Audigy as default, it always chooses VIA as default, I did "sudo asoundconf set-default-card Audigy", then I reboot, and nothing, still VIA
[11:31] <dsb> I have it
[11:31] <sky123> the one thing that DOES bother me about ubuntu is...the openldap implementation...with no tls/ssl support
[11:31] <sky123> i had to compile from source to get it to work
[11:31] <sky123> it was pretty evil
[11:32] <mikeymike> i accidentally 'stopped' XGL in system monitor... how do i 'continue' it from console?
[11:32] <dsb> I've been hoping to stay away from compiling
[11:32] <mikeymike> this sucks
[11:32] <mikeymike> is here any way to 'continue' it from a tty
[11:32] <mikeymike> there*
[11:32] <mikeymike> is the 'stop' and 'continue' just nice features?
[11:33] <sky123> joe74: thre is no way to disable the sound in bios first .. just curious...
[11:33] <mikeymike> anyone know?
[11:33] <Ayabara> would you recommend azureus, utorrent (wine) or ktorrent (or none of them)?
[11:33] <mikeymike> can anyone tell me?
[11:33] <mikeymike> i dont want to kill XGL
[11:33] <sky123> !ask
[11:33] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:33] <joe74> sky123 I need both, one for music other for headset
[11:33] <mikeymike> sky123: ive been asking
[11:33] <savvas> mikeymike: well i think a desktop restart would work: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[11:34] <mikeymike> savvas: would i lose all open x apps?
[11:34] <apokryphos> !xgl | mikeymike

[11:34] <savvas> mikeymike: probably :\
[11:34] <mikeymike> that sucks
[11:34] <mikeymike> im sending a 2 gig transfer using nautilus
[11:34] <mikeymike> i cant close it :(
[11:34] <savvas> then check it with netstat :p
[11:34] <mikeymike> good grief ther has to be a way to 'continue' a process
[11:35] <savvas> a process yes, but i don't think that also stands for xgl :)
[11:35] <mikeymike> why
[11:35] <mikeymike> how do i do it
[11:35] <ragamuffin> Hello I am installling alternate version as dual boot
[11:35] <mikeymike> i'll try
[11:35] <ragamuffin> How should partition the disk
[11:35] <mikeymike> from tty
[11:35] <dsb> mikeymike, I agree
[11:35] <dsb> go low level somehow
[11:35] <mikeymike> acidentally 'stopping' your x server doesn't kill it
[11:35] <mikeymike> it just pauses it. sorta.
[11:36] <mikeymike> dsb: explain?
[11:36] <savvas> mikeymike: why would you accidentally stop it?
[11:36] <mikeymike> savvas: ah man i acidentally clicked it
[11:36] <mikeymike> when i right clicked on the process
[11:36] <dsb> mikeymike, i'm just drunk, but tyring to think out loud also
[11:36] <bhudda> question: How do you force install a 32 bit application in the 64 bit version of ubuntu?
[11:36] <mikeymike> i need a way to 'continue' xgl
[11:36] <mikeymike> dsb: haha okay
[11:36] <herman_munster> Hi all. Anyone here know of a usb modem (dial-up!) that just works under Edgy?
[11:37] <mikeymike> i need to find an xorg chat or something
[11:37] <savvas> well if you were uploading something so big why would you even mingle with system monitor?
[11:37] <mikeymike> this sucks...
[11:37] <dsb> herman_munster I give all my recommendations to anything usrobotics from now on
[11:37] <mikeymike> savvas: ah gnome panel was using 250 megs of ram.. so i restarted it
[11:37] <icebank> thanks guys, gnight all
[11:38] <mikeymike> i dont know why gnome panel does that. it sucks..........
[11:38] <mikeymike> good grief
[11:38] <herman_munster> dsb: personal experience with edgy and usrobotics modem is good?
[11:38] <savvas> uhm
[11:38] <mikeymike> i need to know what 'stop' and 'continue' mean
[11:38] <dsb> linksys screwed me on a $50 wireless usb stick
[11:38] <mikeymike> is that just different levels of nicing a process?
[11:38] <mikeymike> perhaps i can renice xgl
[11:38] <mikeymike> somehow
[11:38] <dsb> usrobotics 19.99 no crashes
[11:39] <dsb> besides the fact that usrobitics was the leading modem company back in the day
[11:39] <herman_munster> dsb: and plug it it, setup connection... no driver probs?
[11:39] <savvas> dsb: once more, #ubuntu-offtopic
[11:39] <herman_munster> dsb: this is for a mom-and-pop couple :)
[11:39] <tevfikt> how can i record my screen? can someone advice some app?
[11:39] <dsb> on the box it clearly states linux friendly
[11:39] <herman_munster> nice
[11:39] <herman_munster> thanks, will research
[11:40] <dsb> i'm drunk, im bitter at linksys, I'm old and I remember what works
[11:40] <herman_munster> dsb: i'm just old
[11:40] <dsb> and damn moderators telling me offtopic stuff is getting on my nerves
[11:41] <savvas> dsb: you're out of topic :] 
[11:41] <mikeymike> does anyone know what the system monitor right click menu options "stop" and "continue" mean in terms of process nicing?
[11:41] <dsb> but I'm cool!
[11:41] <savvas> but you're way out of topic
[11:41] <savvas> ok i'll stop
[11:42] <sky123> coolness doesnt equal on topic....lol

[11:47] <mikeymike> how can i 'continue' xgl after hitting 'stop' in the system monitor right click menu
[11:48] <Lattyware> I use Gnome, personally. XFCE is good though, if you need somthing smaller.

[11:50] <navaladi> if i kill firefox also closed .
[11:50] <apokryphos> Lattyware: unless there's an option in the configure wallpaper, I doubt it (kde has a nice thing for this). You'll have to make some bash script to do it. Shouldn't be too hard, I'd imagine.
[11:51] <Lattyware> apokryphos: How do you mean? As in point it to a wallpaper, and then replace that image with a different file at shutdown or somthing?
[11:51] <Lattyware> via a script.

[12:15] <hoelk> yeah i want the .deb file
[12:15] <thoreauputic> hoelk: sure - just go to th http mirror site as in /etc/apt/sources.list and grab the deb ( but why?)

[12:18] <hoelk> sounds like a good way?
[12:18] <Asc> GSPOiG: Well, most people know how to resize a window, so I figured you probably meant tty size
[12:18] <thoreauputic> hoelk: it just d/l s the packages for you, yes
[12:18] <hoelk> anyone knows where he saves the stuf?
[12:18] <axloo> hi all, can i set the variable http_proxy once without to have to set it again after i restart my pc?
[12:18] <thoreauputic> hoelk: in your working directory I think
[12:18] <POVaddct> hoelk: /var/cache/apt/archives/
[12:18] <thoreauputic> POVaddct: does it?
[12:18] <looktj> I installed mysql-server on here and want different webservers to use my mysql connection
[12:19] <ESPOiG> Asc: wat is tty
[12:19] <hoelk> ok thanks for the help
[12:19] <POVaddct> thoreauputic: i think this is where apt stores the downloaded .deb files
[12:19] <minimec> ESPOiG: man yourterminal. Maybe you can also do this with some start options, like'Eterm -e irssi...'
[12:19] <infer_> !tty
[12:19] <ubotu> To get to the tty terminals 1-6, use the keystroke ctrl + alt + F1-F6 respectively (Alt+F7 will get you back to your graphical login).
[12:19] <thoreauputic> normally yes - just checking in mn apt
[12:19] <POVaddct> thoreauputic: but maybe it is different with -d
[12:19] <ESPOiG> infer: oh yeh my bad
[12:20] <Asc> ESPOiG: there are six non-X terminals, accessable via ctrl-alt-F1 through F6.  X is F7.
[12:20] <ESPOiG> i thought he meant thankyou :P... but with an extra t as it didnt work
[12:20] <axloo> hi all, can i set the variable http_proxy once without to have to set it again after i restart my pc? please somebody tell me :(
[12:20] <ESPOiG> Asc: yeh i dont a full screen terminal
[12:20] <ESPOiG> ill ask on debian forums
[12:20] <POVaddct> axloo: you can try adding the setting to /etc/environment
[12:21] <axloo> 10x , i will try now :)
[12:21] <thoreauputic> POVaddct: interesting - the -d option isn't made clear in the man page: I've never needed -d so I don't know
[12:21] <ESPOiG> sorry guys i meant to ask the question how to do i set the size of the terminal WINDOW when i run it :P
[12:21] <minimec> ESPOiG: In Eterm you have the -g otipn for geometry
[12:21] <POVaddct> thoreauputic: so hoelk has to try it :)
[12:22] <ragamuffin> How should I create a swap?
[12:22] <thoreauputic> :)
[12:22] <Stanbey> Hi. I just installed Ubuntu (looks good :-) and I'm trying to set-up a second user with a different language (Chinese). I have installed the language packs from my user but can't see how to change the language for the second user. Can someone point me in the right direction?
[12:22] <hoelk> well it works as stated
[12:22] <VigoFuse> That Xorg is nifty, thank you for that link. will write it down and use it when I boot to EEft
[12:22] <looktj> I got a problem with mysql
[12:22] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: if you are installing, easiest is to chooose auto partitioning
[12:22] <POVaddct> hoelk: and where does it store the .deb files?
[12:22] <hoelk> the only problem is i have no way to automatically download the packages i allready have that kdevelop depens on
[12:22] <hoelk> /var/cache/apt/archives/ was right
[12:22] <axloo> POVaddct thank you, your answer was very helpful to me!
[12:22] <minimec> ESPOiG: ... like Eterm -g 100x200+0+100
[12:22] <POVaddct> hoelk: okay
[12:22] <thoreauputic> hoelk: aha - thanks :)
[12:23] <POVaddct> axloo: no problem
[12:23] <ragamuffin> thoreauputic: I didn't find any autopartitioning option
[12:23] <minimec> ESPOiG: That should do it.
[12:23] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: umm - something like 'use available space' and don't choose guided or manual
[12:23] <ragamuffin> I am installing as dual boot
[12:24] <ragamuffin> thoreauputic: I have created apartition for ubuntu
[12:24] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: have you resized your other partition to make space?
[12:24] <thoreauputic> OK
[12:24] <looktj> my friend wants me to supply him a mysql database on my computer, he wants to use the database on his hosted forums
[12:24] <axloo> by POVaddct and thanks again you guys are very cool, always help me :)
[12:24] <ragamuffin> No, I had set apart a partition for ubuntu
[12:24] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: so just tell it to use that partition and let the installer make a swap for you
[12:24] <looktj> how do I make mysql use my IP instead of localhost?
[12:24] <Stanbey> Can anyone help me with my second user language question?

[12:26] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: umm - what are you trying to do ? Are you using guided/ manual?
[12:26] <erchache> looktj: do you want to separate mysql server from web/application server?
[12:26] <ragamuffin> I used manual I think
[12:26] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: how much RAM do you have?
[12:26] <looktj> erchache I am supplying a database for my friend's forums(on different hoster)
[12:26] <ragamuffin>  mb
[12:27] <erchache> ok
[12:27] <ragamuffin> 256 mb
[12:27] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: umm - how many mb?
[12:27] <erchache> see on /etc/mysql/my.conf
[12:27] <thoreauputic> OK
[12:27] <ragamuffin> thoreauputic: 256 mb
[12:27] <ESPOiG> minimec: neg it didnt work
[12:27] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: make a swap of around 512 MB
[12:27] <erchache> and edit configuration for your needs
[12:27] <ragamuffin> I don't find any option for that
[12:27] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: select the non-windows partition
[12:27] <erchache> and use grant to modify user permission
[12:27] <ragamuffin> I have
[12:28] <ragamuffin> and createed two partitions of the 15 gb faw space

[12:28] <ragamuffin> both with file system ext3
[12:28] <looktj> erchache: no one is active on #mysql
[12:28] <erchache> well see on mysql documentation to modify my.cnf
[12:29] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: you need at least one partition of around 512 MB with type "swap"
[12:29] <erchache> and grant command to set new permissions
[12:29] <looktj> ok I'll look
[12:29] <ragamuffin> How do you I create that thoreauputic ?

[12:30] <ESPOiG> hmm
[12:31] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: Are you using the graphical installer from the desktop CD? If so you should be able to select to create it ( I haven't used the graphical installer - I use the updater or the alternative CD)
[12:31] <ragamuffin> I am using gu but I don't see any option to create swap

[12:31] <cornflake> !help xorg
[12:31] <minimec> ESPOiG: Just tested that. It works
[12:31] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: you might need to erase the ext3 partitions and start again on the free space
[12:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about help xorg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[12:32] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: if you do that you can then create 2 partitions, one swap of 512MB, the rest of the space ext3
[12:32] <ragamuffin> I am using gu but I don't see any option to create swap
[12:33] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: did you erase your ext3 partitions first?
[12:33] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: you need space for new partitions including swap
[12:34] <ESPOiG> minimec: thx
[12:34] <Asc> It should be in the list of file system types when making a partition....
[12:34] <minimec> ESPOiG: np
[12:34] <ragamuffin> thoreauputic: I just created the ext3 partitions
[12:34] <erchache> how i can setup ipmi of my dl145 g2 on ubuntu?
[12:35] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: yes I know - but you need to get rid of them to make new partitions, unless you have space left
[12:35] <ragamuffin> thoreauputic: I need to do the thing over again?
[12:35] <ragamuffin> I will
[12:35] <thoreauputic> ragamuffin: you can't add a partition to an existing partition: each part needs its own space

[12:42] <TuTUx> hi all i just upgraded my ram to 1.5g(512m before), before i upgraded the swap (2.4G) was working fine(i mean it was buffering all the time) and now im sure it's turned on and I had update the /etc/.../resume and /etc/fstab by "update-initranfs -u" but the swap always stay quiet now, is it working?
[12:42] <ulaas> should i go nvidia official or a deb available?
[12:42] <thoreauputic> TuTUx: wiht 1.5 G of ram you won't see much swapping :)
[12:42] <MattJ> tevfikt: What are you recording?
[12:43] <standby> anyone knows why my laptop intel core 2 duo ..some times appear with 3600 bogomips ..other times ..11600 bogomips
[12:43] <fyrestrtr> TuTUx: yes, its working. The reason it was getting hit before was because of your low ram. You don't want swap to be hit a lot, it slows down your computer's performance.
[12:43] <MattJ> standby: It's probably power-saving
[12:43] <fyrestrtr> standby: its probably on powersave (which reduces the clock).
[12:43] <thoreauputic> standby: it's probably adjusting to the load

[12:44] <LadyNikon> where is the x11 profile? my mouse stops working after awhile
[12:44] <Flosoft> on a SMB share maybe?
[12:44] <LadyNikon> I am guessing something got screwed up during updating
[12:45] <LadyNikon> hows is everyone?
[12:45] <standby> thoreauputic, but the difference is a lot..i want the 4 core to work..not just 1
[12:45] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: you mean the Xorg config file? that is /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:45] <TuTUx> so one more question about my swap, my laptop is not very fast (centrino 1.74) so with 1.5G ram do u guys think i still need a swap partation? im not doing any heavy work by the way
[12:45] <rimmerson> good and you ladynikon

[12:45] <LadyNikon> POVaddct: thanks
[12:46] <thoreauputic> standby: are you running edgy with the generic kernel? It should pick up extra CPUs

[12:46] <rimmerson> Ladynikon where are you from
[12:46] <ulisse> is update-manager woking right for you on edgy? after inserting the password it doesn't update a thing...

[12:48] <MattJ> tevfikt: Ah, I didn't know... I've never had any success :/
[12:48] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: if the mouse stopped working, try sudo cat -A /dev/input/mice and see if it puts out random chars if you move the mouse
[12:48] <tevfikt> =o\
[12:48] <standby> thoreauputic, when i put on rescue grub option..it get 3600 bogomips..i think it is working just with one core

[12:48] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: also check with lsusb the mouse is still visible on the usb bus
[12:49] <standby> thoreauputic, i see the actual bogomips on /proc/cpuinfo
[12:49] <dooglus> diederick: I bought one to use with Linux and it's sitting unused.  I found it to work so unreliably that it's almost useless.  It's fine with Windows however.

[12:50] <LadyNikon> POVaddct: do i just type "lsusb"?

[12:50] <LadyNikon> I got a "Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

[12:51] <LadyNikon> only one line
[12:51] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: id 0000:0000 is just an usb hub
[12:51] <LadyNikon> ah
[12:51] <dooglus> diederick: because I've had the same issue using the usb2 ports for network access, too
[12:51] <TuTUx> hi all now is about my kernel, i had the generic kernel by default edgy, but somehow every time it has to startup with loading my laptop(vaio)'s dvd-rom, otherwise it took very long time to start. so i installed i386 kernel and using it currently, is it true if i switch back to generic will help the performance?
[12:51] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: then the mouse is not on the bus anymore
[12:51] <LadyNikon> POVaddct: how did that all of a sudden just stop working like that :?
[12:51] <LadyNikon> well your probably cant say how..
[12:51] <LadyNikon> how do i fix it :D
[12:51] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: maybe the device is (partly) broken?
[12:52] <LadyNikon> hmm
[12:52] <LadyNikon> yeah but it stops working after awhile
[12:52] <LadyNikon> if i reboot its detected fine
[12:52] <LadyNikon> if i let it set.. then it will stop working.
[12:52] <LadyNikon> after a few hours or so
[12:53] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: check "dmesg" right after it stopped working. the should be a usb disconnect message.

[12:58] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: feed the mouse with oatmeal :)
[12:59] <thoreauputic> ESPOiG: looks like a source code patch - you'd have to apply it and recompile I think
[12:59] <Asc> ESPOiG: you can make a link on the menubar or desktop or whatever to 'gnome-terminal --geometry 50x30' or whatever.  It'd probably be easier (not that I've actually looked at the link; I'm on a modem here)

[01:05] <j2daosh> but that reminds me of a question otis so thank you :)
[01:05] <thoreauputic> j2daosh: well, what are you looking for?
[01:05] <FearMoth> is there any apt-get command to revert to the original installation?
[01:06] <j2daosh> im going to be building a new core 2 dou system and am wondering if ubuntu has support for it yet
[01:06] <OtisJones> well.. first my widescreen, now it's my wireless network...  intel Pro wireless cards with their Function + F2 kill switch.
[01:06] <Chandan> hi
[01:06] <j2daosh> thoreauputic: not really sure... what interesting applications do you have loading on your box? i can pretty much find a use for just about anything...
[01:07] <Chandan> Is there anything for eyecandy thing
[01:07] <j2daosh> anything for eyecandy... thats kinda vague...
[01:07] <Chandan> like in microsoft vista .If I poing any icon in the panel its zooming ..can we do the same thing in ubuntu
[01:07] <j2daosh> OtisJones: i wont use wireless so i cant help you with that one
[01:07] <OtisJones> vista is a waste of money
[01:07] <OtisJones> promises that were never delivered.
[01:07] <thoreauputic> j2daosh: most of mine are from the repos - I compiled my own fluxbox, and a few other bits like the murrine GTK2 theme engine
[01:07] <OtisJones> I used to support microsoft.
[01:08] <OtisJones> now I support vmware.
[01:08] <j2daosh> yes Chandan, we call it....crap... i cant remember what we call it...
[01:08] <alecjw> i have an r2571usb card, will the rt2570usb drivers work?
=== HavoK is now known as Eons
[01:08] <j2daosh> compiz
[01:08] <Chandan> OtisJones, Its waste of money ..but can we see that feature ..in ubuntu ..is ther any pacakge
[01:08] <j2daosh> thats it
[01:08] <OtisJones> anypackage?
[01:08] <j2daosh> yes Chandan grep for compiz
[01:08] <OtisJones> well.. I'm pretty new too.

[01:09] <j2daosh> read those
[01:09] <j2daosh> beryl?
[01:09] <OtisJones> it's a pain in the butt.
[01:09] <OtisJones> beryl is when your desktops look like a cube.
[01:09] <j2daosh> yeah it is... but once you get it setup its only a minor headache :P
[01:09] <OtisJones> you can rotate.
[01:10] <j2daosh> ahh... i want beryl instead
[01:10] <Chandan> j2daosh, I have configured beryl in my system .. its workign fine .. but icons zooming is not coming ..Is that featuer is there in beryl ..How do I configure
[01:10] <j2daosh> i dont need the wobbly, water, magnify and all that crap
[01:10] <j2daosh> i used compiz
[01:10] <kraut> moin
[01:10] <thoreauputic> there is also 3ddesk ( older but has the rotating desktops)
[01:10] <j2daosh> which had zooming and all that stuff
[01:10] <OtisJones> ugh..  I'll go suffer with my wifi nic.
[01:10] <OtisJones> cheers
[01:10] <j2daosh> i just want the cube :)

=== flox_ is now known as flox
[01:11] <alecjw> i have an r2571usb card, will the rt2570usb drivers work?
[01:11] <thoreauputic> j2daosh: neither do I :) I justknow it exists :)
[01:12] <Chandan> thoreauputic, How about zooming in beryl..How to configure that
[01:12] <j2daosh> lol
[01:12] <raging_hog> installing dapper, I need to preserve mbr. Will it overwrite it?
[01:12] <thoreauputic> Chandan: I don't know - I have a crappy SiS onboard card here ;-)
[01:12] <j2daosh> well looks like researching is up to your Chandan, i know zooming is possible with compiz... i know nothing about 3ddesk/beryl yet
[01:12] <POVaddct> alecjw: why not simply try it?
[01:12] <Chandan> thoreauputic, ok ..
[01:13] <alecjw> raging_hog: no, it will overwrite the mbr, but if you have windoze, it will add it to the grub list
[01:13] <Chandan> j2daosh, its ok .I will check it in beryll..
[01:13] <Trainstroker> BERYL FTW
[01:13] <LadyNikon> POVaddct: i changed my mind on the oatmeal and started making rice heh
[01:13] <alecjw> POVaddct: it might take hours on this pentium with 32mb ram. i was wondering if anone else had any experinces with it
[01:13] <raging_hog> alecjw, is there a way to preserve mbr? thinkpad t42 has some bios stuff in the mbr
[01:13] <LadyNikon> rice cooker > oatmeal in a pot
[01:13] <j2daosh> LadyNikon: wha?!?! no oatmeal?!
[01:13] <LadyNikon> <~~ lazy
[01:13] <j2daosh> blasphemy!!
[01:14] <LadyNikon> j2daosh: i got a turkey to eat :/
[01:14] <POVaddct> alecjw: sorry, no. i only have a rt2570 card
[01:14] <j2daosh> tlol
[01:14] <Trainstroker> anyone know how to get ZD1211 chips workin in ubunut
[01:14] <j2daosh> lol
[01:14] <j2daosh> figures
[01:15] <VigoFusion> dangit, I fergot the stuff to type in now, oh well, I like this system better, I can live with a tiny screen...:-P
[01:15] <LadyNikon> not really
[01:15] <LadyNikon> but i couldnt think of anything else at the time
[01:15] <j2daosh> lol
[01:15] <LadyNikon> i did *try* tennis
[01:16] <LadyNikon> not my thing
[01:16] <Grimboy> Hey, can someone clarify something for me? From what I understand, logical partitions aren't bootable. Does this mean GRUB can't boot from them or just that they can't be booted directly?
[01:16] <j2daosh> i couldn't understand the scoring scheme... but i like hitting things so i made my own scoring rules :P
[01:16] <dromer> hmm, in KDE, how do I make it run a certain program on startup ?
[01:16] <LadyNikon> j2daosh: hitting someone in the face = 20 points?
[01:16] <dromer> ah, sessien manager
[01:16] <j2daosh> grim, nope
[01:16] <thoreauputic> Grimboy: Linux will boot happily from a logical partition
[01:17] <j2daosh> the mbr is on the primary partition with will boot a logical partition
[01:17] <Grimboy> thoreauputic: Ah, cool, thanks!
[01:17] <j2daosh> LadyNikon: yep :)
[01:17] <Grimboy> j2daosh: Thanks
[01:17] <j2daosh> s/with/which
[01:17] <dromer> no, damnit
[01:17] <LadyNikon> well
[01:17] <dromer> anybody ?
[01:17] <j2daosh> anybody what?
[01:17] <LadyNikon> plugging in a new mouse doesnt fix it
[01:18] <LadyNikon> so i guess i should reboot and see if this one craps out :/
[01:18] <j2daosh> sounds like an expensive personal problem LadyNikon :P
[01:18] <j2daosh> j/p
[01:18] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: maybe a usb controller or usb port problem?
[01:18] <j2daosh> whats the problem?
[01:19] <Yoric> Well, beryl is fun but perhaps a bit too unstable for me so far.
[01:19] <j2daosh> lol Yoric its so unstable for me i cant find it :P
[01:19] <matason> Hi - Can a Launcher control the window size of an application i.e. maximized?
[01:19] <LadyNikon> POVaddct: could be possible.. I figured something got updated wrong.
[01:19] <Yoric> j2daosh: :)
[01:20] <VigoFusion> 2 HDs in this one, XP one, Win2k on slave and Ubuntu 6.10 about to pwn them all. They all have thier own Boot Sector, thanks to GRUB, but UBUNTU is gonna own it all here soon.
[01:20] <LadyNikon> gawd i hate 1024 x 768
[01:20] <j2daosh> perfect form thoreauputic but you hit the WRONG way...
[01:20] <j2daosh> lol
[01:20] <LadyNikon> heh i remember saying that about the rez when it was 680 heh
[01:20] <thoreauputic> JDStone: no, just the racket went right back as it should, and hit you :)
[01:20] <j2daosh> lol thats right, hit JDStone
[01:20] <LadyNikon> POVaddct: we shall see..
[01:20] <j2daosh> :P
[01:21] <LadyNikon> its an old mobo.
[01:21] <LadyNikon> it still has ps2 connections on it heh
[01:21] <roryy> matason: some (perhaps most?) GUI programs take a --geometry command line argument which sets the initial window size.  Any particular app you're wanting to do this with?
[01:21] <POVaddct> LadyNikon: i remember 320x200 on my atari st :)
[01:21] <j2daosh> lady, if you bought usb mouse it should have come with a ps/2 adapter... use it
[01:21] <LadyNikon> j2daosh: yeah i keep those
[01:21] <matason> roryy: Hi - thanks - yes it's Vim 7
[01:21] <j2daosh> me too
[01:21] <j2daosh> :P
[01:21] <LadyNikon> j2daosh: i know.. i just like to check everything
[01:21] <roryy> matason: vim or gvim ?
[01:22] <TuTUx> HI ALL, is there any repos i can get Ardour ?
[01:22] <matason> Hmm - I believe I am using gVim

[01:22] <j2daosh> i always use the oldest part of my board :P, in these cases, the ps/2 slot
[01:22] <LadyNikon> my day is shot.
[01:22] <dromer> it's saturday :o
[01:22] <matason> roryy: Yes GVim
[01:22] <roryy> matason: try 'gVim --geometry=100x100' -- play with the numbers until you're happy
[01:22] <LadyNikon> dromer: life doesnt stop on the weekends ;)
[01:22] <dromer> :P
[01:22] <j2daosh> bingo... fire station... how old are u lady?
[01:22] <roryy> matason: or 'gvim' or whatever -- i'm not actually familiar with gvim
[01:22] <matason> roryy: Thanks very much
[01:23] <LadyNikon> j2daosh: i am 29
[01:23] <dromer> I have to draw more molecules :/
[01:23] <LadyNikon> i dont do bingo
[01:23] <j2daosh> oh ok
[01:23] <j2daosh> lol

[01:23] <LadyNikon> j2daosh: not yet kthnx ;)
[01:23] <dromer> it doesn't show up
[01:23] <j2daosh> apparantly they have rubbed off on you LadyNikon
[01:23] <LadyNikon> <~~ born brutal ;0
[01:24] <thoreauputic> j2daosh: not really - plenty of older women using linux ( some of them with unix backgrounds)
[01:24] <j2daosh> thoreauputic: i have yet to meet one.... :(
[01:24] <j2daosh> all the old people i know just want to talk about war and junk
[01:24] <thoreauputic> j2daosh: you move in the wrong circles ;)
[01:24] <j2daosh> lol
[01:24] <poulap> I am 54 woman but green with linux lol

[01:26] <thoreauputic> hmm
[01:26] <ubotu> Package beryl does not exist in edgy
[01:26] <j2daosh> why should i upgrade to edgy?
[01:26] <roryy> i suspect one has to install it by hand
[01:27] <thoreauputic> roryy: you may be right indeed
[01:27] <roryy> compiz appears to be in edgy
[01:27] <j2daosh> woot woot, i need to work on my compiling anyway :)

[01:27] <thoreauputic>  /join #ubuntu-xgl for beryl questions I guess
[01:27] <pip_> how do you format in linux?
[01:28] <j2daosh> u don't MUAHAHAHA
[01:28] <j2daosh> lol j/p
[01:28] <pip_> im running a live cd atm, and wanna format the HDA
[01:28] <gonzoism> can someone help me with ndiswrapper ?  i had it set up earlier, but now it won't come back u again.  and i can't figure out what the problem is
[01:28] <roryy> pip_: what would you like to format?
[01:28] <pip_> >*
[01:28] <thoreauputic> pip_: what are you wanting to do exactly?
[01:28] <gonzoism> ndiswrapper -i my_driver.inf ; modprobe ndiswrapper; iwconfig wlan0 mode Ad-Hoc;iwconfig wlan0 essid any;killall dhclient3 ;ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.x
[01:28] <gonzoism> that is what i run to start it but it doesn't work, is there something i'm forgetting ?
[01:28] <pip_> just format a hdd so i can run xp on it
[01:28] <j2daosh> pip, system, disks
[01:28] <j2daosh> oh
[01:28] <thoreauputic> pip_: hah /join #windows then
[01:28] <LadyNikon> so.. i just found out that there is a "read out loud" function in acrobat
[01:29] <j2daosh> pip > #windows
[01:29] <LadyNikon> it sounds like that purple monkey program
[01:29] <roryy> pip_: i suspect your windows XP install cd will be able to partition and format your hard drive
[01:29] <pip_> no it wont
[01:29] <pip_> i cant even start linux on it atm
[01:29] <j2daosh> lol we dont take kindly to yer kind 'round here boy
[01:29] <thoreauputic> pip_: this is a linux channel
[01:29] <pip_> yes i know, and i wounder how i format in linux_
[01:30] <j2daosh> pip... the point is... linux wont format to ntfs... thats windows
[01:30] <thoreauputic> pip_:  you can probably use gparted from the live CD of Ubuntu
[01:30] <j2daosh> so go to #windows
[01:30] <j2daosh> they will tell you to get the windows disk and do an install... it will format then
[01:30] <LadyNikon> why not just format the HDD with the windows cd?
[01:30] <defrysk> ntfs is windows patented
[01:30] <LadyNikon> or is pip_ trying to dual boot?
[01:30] <LadyNikon> defrysk: heh
[01:30] <defrysk> linux is not allowed to hande that fornat
[01:30] <pip_> j2daosh: ive tried asking them, and they cant help me
[01:30] <thoreauputic> LadyNikon: this is totally off-topic anyway
[01:30] <defrysk> handle
[01:31] <j2daosh> pip_: ok... heres what you do... its complicated... open the cd-rom... put the windows disk in :P
[01:31] <pip_> ok and then?
[01:31] <LadyNikon> oyvey
[01:31] <j2daosh> then run through windows setup :)
[01:31] <j2daosh> lol
[01:31] <defrysk> pip_, call the windows hlpdesk
[01:31] <defrysk> they can help you
[01:31] <LadyNikon> halp..
[01:32] <roryy> one can in fact create ntfs partitions in Linux with ntfsprogs, but i'm not sure if that's available on the live cd
[01:32] <j2daosh> it will say u want to format ntfs/fat32...
[01:32] <LadyNikon> pls to halp.
[01:32] <thoreauputic> pip sorry but windows help is not the topic here
[01:32] <j2daosh> use ntfs
[01:32] <LadyNikon> dont be sorry
[01:32] <kaur> when I try to modprobe speedstep-centrino I'll get the following error: FATAL: Error inserting speedstep_centrino (/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/speedstep-centrino.ko): No such device
[01:32] <kaur>  Cpu is intel core2 duo T2300
[01:32] <kaur> Ideas?
[01:32] <pip_> is dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null& pid=$ same as format?
[01:32] <j2daosh> no
[01:32] <thoreauputic> pip_: no
[01:32] <j2daosh> not even close
[01:32] <LadyNikon> O.O
[01:32] <kzm__> hey everybody.. does anybody has experience with nvidia beta drivers?
[01:32] <kaur> the cpu temp is about 50
[01:32] <pip_> what does it do?
[01:32] <defrysk> kzm__, run fine on my box
[01:32] <roryy> it writes zeros to nowhere
[01:33] <thoreauputic> pip_: formatting is making a *file system*
[01:33] <rickski> does anybody run ubuntu on an Apple PowerBook G4?
[01:33] <kaur> how do i get speedsteping to work?
[01:33] <LadyNikon> who would mess up an apple prodcut?
[01:33] <thoreauputic> pip_: please find a windows help forum - I will have to remove or quiet you otherwise
[01:33] <LadyNikon> product*
[01:33] <pip_> ok, but i cant make a file system with my windows boot cd since it says i dont have the start files, and that happened after ive installer ubuntu on the hdd
[01:33] <kzm__> defrysk, i have problems with it in a way it runs fine, i install something else it breaks because of some linux kernel headers, and i have to install again by hand
[01:33] <j2daosh> pip_: stop.. listen to what we are saying.... you are in LINUX...we deal with LINUX questions. windows can't make formatting any easier... its practically idiot proof.... put the disk in the drive... reboot computer... follow prompts...
[01:33] <pip_> and in the #windows channel they dont know what to do
[01:33] <rickski> LadyNikon: maybe if you have one to spare :)
[01:34] <defrysk> kzm__, just use amaranth's repository
[01:34] <LadyNikon> lets hope english isnt pip_'s first language
[01:34] <kzm__> defrysk, yeah? i somehow think i tried and then i gave up and used the shellscript
[01:34] <poulap> maaybe pip lost his dual boot?
[01:34] <j2daosh> lol j/p
[01:35] <rickski> ?
[01:35] <kzm__> defrysk, but ok.. i will give it a try again...
[01:35] <j2daosh> well if pip lost daul boot then he is asking the wrong question
[01:35] <LadyNikon> poulap: only the shadows know. heh
[01:35] <defrysk> kzm__, I installed amaraaanths nvidia-blx and it runs fine here without kickups or breakage
[01:35] <poulap> lol
[01:35] <liri> someone remind me how do I map a keycode to a certain function?
[01:35] <defrysk> glx*
[01:35] <j2daosh> liri: system, regional, keyboard
[01:35] <kzm__> another question, does anybody know how to get buttons, ubuntu icon and everything smaller everywhere
[01:36] <j2daosh> thoreauputic: so buddy ole pal... when do i get pb rights?
[01:36] <j2daosh> lol
[01:36] <thoreauputic> ?
[01:36] <j2daosh> punk buster
[01:36] <kzm__> defrysk, you used the blx? ok.. i tried the glx
[01:36] <Asc> Anybody got ssh X forwarding working?
[01:36] <defrysk> kzm__, that was a typo
[01:36] <kzm__> defrysk, whats the difference btw?
[01:36] <defrysk> i ment glx
[01:36] <aimtrainer> hi! I have a 640*bla res right now and cant change the res in the nvidia xserver settngs because the part to enter the new res is not displayed due to the low resolution and I cant get the window up
[01:36] <aimtrainer>  im afraid my explaination of my problem is kinda crappy..
[01:36] <kzm__> ah
[01:37] <aimtrainer> ah btw i have the beta nvidia driver installed
[01:37] <POVaddct> Asc: ssh -X username@hostname  does not work?
[01:37] <defrysk> kzm__, there was breakage a few weeks ago but thats no longer the case
[01:37] <knight96> Dose ubuntu has some chm viewer?
[01:37] <j2daosh> aimtrainer: u will need to edit your xorg.conf file
[01:37] <roryy> liri: one limited option is 'system -> preferences -> keyboard shortcuts'
[01:37] <KerLeone> I am a new linux user, can anyone help me please, I have trouble with the installation?
[01:37] <kzm__> dfrysk.. two weeks? thats about when i tried the repository
[01:37] <defrysk> kzm__, nvidia-glx can be savely installed now from amaranth's repo
[01:37] <aimtrainer> j2daosh: thanks
[01:37] <Asc> POCaddct: correct.  When I try to start a program, it tells me that it 'cannot connect to display'
[01:37] <kzm__> defrysk, thanx
[01:37] <liri> j2daosh: there's no system regional but preferences or administration
[01:37] <defrysk> kzm__, yw :)
[01:37] <Asc> *POV....
[01:37] <roryy> knight96: xchm looks promising
[01:38] <j2daosh> hold please, phone call
[01:38] <POVaddct> Asc: what is the setting of the DISPLAY variable?
[01:38] <knight96> can it be get by apt-get?
[01:38] <zorba64> knight96: gnochm or kchmviewer
[01:38] <kzm__> defrysk, u know by any chance how to get your genome interface using smaller icons for the buttons and everything?
[01:38] <roryy> knight96: oh, gnochm even more so (assuming you're running normal ubuntu)
[01:38] <roryy> knight96: yes
[01:38] <knight96> thanks all
[01:39] <Asc> POVaddct: HostComputerName:10.0
[01:39] <POVaddct> Asc: HostComputerName? shouldn't that be localhost?
[01:40] <KerLeone> I am a new linux user, can anyone help me please, I have trouble with the installation?
[01:40] <zorba64> KerLeone: just ask away old son
[01:40] <j2daosh> thoreauputic: remind iris how to set keybinds. im at work using putty so i cant see exactly where its at again
[01:40] <Asc> POVaddct: Hmm.  From what I hear it's supposed to pick a correct display automatically.
[01:41] <digiqq> KerLeone: what's the problem mate?
[01:41] <j2daosh> and i think i told him the kde way to do it and he is probably using gnome
[01:41] <POVaddct> Asc: yes. the display offset (10.0) is correct.
[01:41] <thoreauputic> j2daosh: I'm using fluxbox :)
[01:41] <j2daosh> lol crap
[01:41] <j2daosh> ok iris gimme a sec to finish this phone call and ill nx in and see what i get
[01:41] <POVaddct> Asc: but the hostname seems not to be
[01:42] <KerLeone> zorba64, I started the installation (also in differen video modes and in save mode), but after a while of installing a blue screen comes saying "Failed to start x server" and in the log it says "no screens found".
[01:42] <Asc> POVaddict: 'export DISPLAY=localhost:10.0' and retrying gives the same error
[01:42] <POVaddct> Asc: is xauth installed on both machines?
[01:43] <Asc> POVaddict: Yes.
[01:43] <zorba64> this should be fun...ok what are you installing from...live cd?
[01:43] <POVaddct> Asc: hmmm. and is X11Forwarding enabled in sshd_config on the server side?
[01:44] <Asc> POVaddict: Yes.
[01:44] <j2daosh> ahh crap...
[01:44] <liri> j2daosh: the system recognizes my function keys as keycode 176 and 177 question is how do I now set them as my volume up/down keys?
[01:44] <liri> j2daosh: I've done it before but a long time ago when I got this laptop and forgot how... I *think* it was through gconf-editor but I'm not sure.
[01:44] <j2daosh> my gnome theme is edubuntu...
[01:44] <EmxBA>  i've installed amarok on *ubuntu* and there is no icon in the gnome panel, what's the problem?
[01:44] <KerLeone> zorba 64, yes I think,  I made a cd from the iso of the deskotp version
[01:44] <POVaddct> Asc: and you run ssh as the same user that started the local X session?
[01:44] <roryy> liri: look at 'system -> preferences -> keyboard shortcuts'
[01:45] <KerLeone> zorba64, version 6.10
[01:45] <ndc> when i update some error W: GPG error
[01:45] <ndc> how to fix it
[01:45] <zorba64> EmxBA: none...put it there yourself perhaps
[01:45] <j2daosh> ok, system, preferences, keyboard shortcuts
[01:45] <j2daosh> type in the key code in the vol. up/down sections
[01:46] <Grimboy> EmxBA: Have you got the notification area on? Have you checked in amarok's options?
[01:46] <EmxBA> zorba64: not in the panel, in the place near the watch
[01:46] <EmxBA> yes, i want it to be in not. area, Grimboy
[01:46] <zorba64> KerLeone: and the live cd boots to a gui, or is that one of the probs
[01:46] <Asc> POVaddict: The lines 'X11UseForwarding yes' and 'X11UseLocalhost no' have been added to server sshd_config... and 'ForwardAgent yes' and 'ForwardX11 yes' have been added to client ssh_config, as per a tutorial I can't quite seem to find again.  Could any of that cause problems?
[01:46] <Asc> POVaddict: Yes, I'm running ssh as the same user.
[01:47] <Grimboy> EmxBA: So you've got the notification area on in gnome and have checked amarok's options?
[01:47] <POVaddct> Asc: dont know about the X11UseLocalhost option
[01:47] <kaur> I need urgent help with cpu scaling . Temp is constantly about 52C speedstep is not working. What to do?
[01:47] <zorba64> EmxBA: you mean the tray
[01:47] <j2daosh> catch that liri
[01:47] <EmxBA> zorba64: yes
[01:47] <antifuchs> hi there. I upgraded to 6.10 from dapper today, and now my laptop (an IBM T40p) hangs for about 5 minutes when booting up. Choosing the "recovery mode" in grub shows that it waits after starting the "kernel event manager", showing as the last message "NET: registered protocol family 17"
[01:47] <EmxBA> Grimboy: yes, the tray icon option is on
[01:47] <liri> ok hold up
[01:47] <antifuchs> it almost looks like it's trying to do a DNS lookup, or something.
[01:48] <Sobko> hello
[01:48] <antifuchs> searching for that symptom hasn't revealed anything. Do any of you have an idea what it could be?
[01:48] <KerLeone> zorba64, yes, first of all, some seconds after boot I have a menue in graphical format to choose install options. Then the install bar comes and after one or two minutes a dos-like window comes with the error message
[01:48] <Sobko> how to delete file
[01:48] <POVaddct> Asc: i suggest setting X11UseLocalhost to yes
[01:48] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: try turning off your wifi
[01:48] <thoreauputic> Sobko:  rm <file>
[01:48] <j2daosh> Sobko: CLI = rm /switch file_to_delete
[01:48] <zorba64> KerLeone: cant detect you display...what are you running
[01:49] <j2daosh> gui = right click, move to trash
[01:49] <ragamuffin> I just installed 6.06. 1 alternate version. But I can't play  movie or music files. "You do not have decoder installed to handle this file"
[01:49] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: um, how do I do that when (or before?) it boots up?
[01:49] <thoreauputic> !codecs
[01:49] <Asc> POVaddict: Hah, you got it.  I commented out X11useLocalhost no, restarted the daemon, and it works.

[01:49] <j2daosh> u may have to sudo if u dont own the file
[01:49] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: fn+f5 will toggle your wifi+bluetooth.
[01:49] <antifuchs> at least the atheros status led doesn't show any activity
[01:49] <KerLeone> zorba64, I have a ATI Radeon X850 XT and a CRT Monitor 19"
[01:49] <POVaddct> j2daosh: "switches" are called options in unix and they start with - not /
[01:49] <antifuchs> oh god,  you're right.
[01:49] <POVaddct> Asc: cool
[01:50] <Sobko> rm: cannot remove `linux-headers-2.6.18_386_i386.deb': No such file or directory
[01:50] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: cool, it now shows 7 more messages, waits for another 30s and starts to boot!
[01:50] <Sobko> why
[01:50] <antifuchs> now, how do I make it boot up unattended without taking half of forever? (:
[01:50] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: I have a T43, that's how I know these things :)
[01:50] <j2daosh> POVaddct: yeah... but i was using / as separator... i contemplated using {} but decided not to at the last minute
[01:50] <roryy> Sobko: is the file on your desktop ?
[01:50] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: fantastic advice (:
[01:50] <Sobko> no
[01:51] <POVaddct> j2daosh: ah, okay
[01:51] <thoreauputic> Sobko: that's a package manager function : try sudo apt-get remove linux-headers-2.6.18_386_i386
[01:51] <j2daosh> Sobko: whats because the file doesn't exist
[01:51] <roryy> Sobko: where is it?
[01:51] <Sobko> /usr/src
[01:51] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: you can disable some services, and the first thing you should do before troubleshooting is turn off the splash screen so you can see the bootup messages.
[01:51] <j2daosh> why do you want to delete it?
[01:51] <Sobko> i try to compile but fail
[01:51] <zorba64> any ATI X850 user in here?
[01:51] <Sobko> and i want try again
[01:51] <EmxBA> can someone help me with amarok?
[01:51] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: you can disable it from the grub prompt, just remove 'quiet' from the boot line.
[01:51] <j2daosh> Sobko: do you have build-essential installed?
[01:51] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: yeah, sounds like a good idea.. it seems like it's waiting for bluetooth
[01:52] <j2daosh> s/build-essential/build-essentials
[01:52] <Sobko> linux-image-2.6.18_386_i386.deb
[01:52] <thoreauputic> Sobko: that kernel is ahead of edgy - do you know how to compile a kernel?
[01:52] <Sobko> linux-headers-2.6.18_386_i386.deb
[01:52] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: on thinkpads, the fn+f5 will toggle both bluetooth and wifi off or on, so if you see the bluetooth light on, then your wifi is also on.
[01:52] <kaur> How do i get speedsteping to work?
[01:52] <POVaddct> j2daosh: build-essential is right
[01:52] <roryy> j2daosh: no, it's build-essential
[01:52] <Sobko> no
[01:52] <j2daosh> oh
[01:52] <j2daosh> ok
[01:52] <Sobko> i try to install
[01:52] <j2daosh> that one :P
[01:52] <Sobko> but fail
[01:52] <fyrestrtr> kaur: it works by default.
[01:52] <thoreauputic> Sobko: this is a Debian package, right? Not an ubuntu package
[01:52] <Asc> POVaddict: thanks for the help.  I love how cool things keep turning up, it makes things fun. :)
[01:52] <Sobko> maybe file corrupt
[01:52] <j2daosh> its been alittle while since i installed it
[01:53] <Sobko> oo
[01:53] <Sobko> so
[01:53] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: no, that's not how it used to work here
[01:53] <Sobko> how to i delete kernel
[01:53] <thoreauputic> Sobko: where did you get that package?
[01:53] <j2daosh> debian != ubuntu
[01:53] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: for me, fn+f5 used to toggle bt only
[01:53] <Sobko> i get ubuntu forum
[01:53] <kaur> fyrestrtr: No it doesn't. Cpu is about 53 C constantly
[01:53] <POVaddct> Asc: i'd rather use text apps and screen in ssh sessions. the detach feature of screen just rocks.
[01:53] <protocol1> is there a way to get my ubuntu machine to print from a computer on my network thats sharing its printer?
[01:53] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: acutally, it does both :) Just that the light on the wifi doesn't come on. I've had that happen many times.
[01:53] <Sobko> how to remove kernel
[01:53] <fyrestrtr> kaur: what cpu do you have?
[01:53] <Sobko> it error
[01:53] <j2daosh> go to /usr/src
[01:54] <Sobko> and
[01:54] <kaur> fyrestrtr: core 2 duo T2300
[01:54] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: well, I've been using wifi happily without ever having to press fn+f5 for years
[01:54] <KerLeone> zorba64, hey, I found a tutorial for my grapgics card in the net: http://blog.php-stage.de/?p=8
[01:54] <mamzers555> did you know that some routers have a nasty bug with irc
[01:54] <j2daosh> then do sudo rm file_to_delete (filename goes where the "file_to_delete" part of the command is
[01:54] <mamzers555> they can be disconnect with:
[01:54] <Sobko> hey
[01:54] <KerLeone> zorba64, I wil ltry that. Thanks for your help you helped to search for the right thing
[01:54] <fyrestrtr> antifuchs: heh maybe its an atheros-only thing. I have intel's chip in my laptop.
[01:54] <Sobko> can i remove kernel
[01:54] <antifuchs> oh, also: that it continued booting after I pressed fn+f5 seems to have been a fortunate coincidence. I can't reproduce it in non-recovery mode now
[01:54] <Sobko> how to remove
[01:54] <zorba64> KerLeone: have a look here too https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
[01:55] <protocol1> is there a way to get my ubuntu machine to print from a computer on my network thats sharing its printer?
[01:55] <j2daosh> Sobko: rm filename
[01:55] <antifuchs> it still hangs after starting the event manager, no matter if bt/wifi is on or not
[01:55] <thoreauputic> Sobko: stop being annoying
[01:55] <j2daosh> once you are in the /usr/src directory
[01:55] <KerLeone> zorba64, ok, thank you much for your help!
[01:55] <KerLeone> cu
[01:55] <zorba64> KerLeone: np
[01:55] <antifuchs> gah. laptops are annoying.
[01:55] <valehru_server> hmm...my ipod doesnt seem to be mounting when I hook it up via the USB port...strange
[01:55] <fyrestrtr> hmm, events manager. Hangs? No activity at all?

[01:56] <kaur> yes there is
[01:56] <Grimboy> antifuchs: Yet convenient at the same time.
[01:56] <fyrestrtr> kaur: just a sec.
[01:56] <thoreauputic> !printing
[01:56] <ubotu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[01:57] <kaur> use google keywords samba print share
[01:57] <VigoFusion> zorba: That one Xorg page showed me more than I can remember, it had the fix for the ATI RadeonXPRESS 200 on it though.
[01:57] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: it doesn't show any new messages for about 2 minutes, then continues
[01:58] <thoreauputic> kaur: no, you don't need samba to share printers between Ubuntu or linux boxes on a network - cups will do it
[01:58] <Daviey> I am trying to install something from the universe repo.  I'm pretty sure i have it in sources.list ( deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe
[01:58] <Daviey>  deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe) but it isn't recognised.  Any ideas?
[01:58] <liri> if I have a key which when using xev doesn't show up any symbol (NoSymbol) how can I map a symbol?
[01:58] <kaur> i thought one was win sry
[01:59] <thoreauputic> Daviey: what are you trying to install?
[01:59] <Daviey> thoreauputic, pyserial
[02:00] <antifuchs> fyrestrtr: I just looked into /var/log/boot; it seems to wait for 3 minutes between starting the event manager and continuing the bootup process. between those times, in kern.log I can find a lot of messages from 14:54, then nothing for 2 minutes, then "Inspecting /boot/System.map..." on 14:56.
[02:00] <thoreauputic> Daviey: no such package in dapper

[02:01] <heikki_> I need to run windows under Dapper. What is the most painless way? I can take a performance hit
[02:01] <antifuchs> the last message is from the ath driver, then ACPI says "PCI interrupt for device 0000:02:01.0 disabled"
[02:01] <Daviey> heikki, vmware
[02:01] <thoreauputic> Daviey: do you want source or a binary package?
[02:01] <Grimboy> I always used to be able lean back on my chair effectively. Now it seems like I've got something stuck in it. I've tried lschair but I just get the usual, wheels and cushions.
[02:01] <Daviey> thoreauputic, either
[02:01] <heikki_> Daviey, player/workstation/server?
[02:02] <kaur> fyrestrtr: so do u have any ideas?
[02:02] <thoreauputic> Daviey: then you can download from packages.ubuntulinux.org it seems
[02:02] <Daviey> heikki, player (free)
[02:02] <Daviey> thoreauputic, which file (there are three)
[02:02] <heikki_> Daviey, thanks, I'll look it up.

[02:03] <lilleman> Hello, I have a strange resolution problem. On a Radeon 9500 Pro, and a Viewsonic VA1912w, there's a naative resolution of 1440x900. But when it's set, the parts that's "outside the 4:3 field", to the left and right, is buggy and combined. So that when you drag a window over it to the left, it also shows to the right
[02:03] <Daviey> heikki, there is a website for creating images for free.  then you can use the player and have a full virtual machine
[02:04] <thoreauputic> Daviey: you'll need all three to build a deb - read the apt-howto for more info
[02:04] <Daviey> thoreauputic, thanks
[02:04] <thoreauputic> Daviey: or install apt-howto
[02:05] <antifuchs> also, heh. the text console is in black & white now.
[02:05] <thoreauputic> Daviey: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html  <-- this will help
[02:06] <liri> Ok now I need to sort up my hibernation problem
[02:06] <lilleman> anyone know anything about my problem? :)
[02:07] <CorpseFeeder> i just installed something called sensors-applet, but I have no idea where it is on my computer or what to look for
[02:07] <thoreauputic> Daviey: the package is called python-serial apparently

[02:08] <CorpseFeeder> where do I find this sensors-applet or how do I run it?
[02:09] <thoreauputic> Daviey: in these situations it's best to do a search like apt-cache search python serial
[02:09] <Chetic> I was playing with Beryl the other day while playing a video and now Totem refuses to run because it can't establish a connection to the sound server... What do I do?
[02:09] <Chetic> Other sound applications work
[02:09] <Daviey> thoreauputic, it's a pain as under sapper i simply did apt-get install
[02:10] <Chetic> Wait, no, none of my sound works
[02:10] <Aldoliel> CorpseFeeder, Right click on your panel and click "Add to panel" It should be listed in there somewhere
[02:10] <thoreauputic> Daviey: you still can
[02:10] <thoreauputic> Daviey: just install python-serial

[02:14] <mc44> SlimG: its not installed by default though, you have to install the .deb off the CD
[02:14] <bassM> Is there any hope in upgrading from dapper to edgy without complete reinstall, or is it just asking for trouble?
[02:14] <mc44> bassM: it should be fine as long as you havent got lots of 3rd part repository stuff on your computer

[02:26] <Zaggynl> Hi, I'm pretty much a gamer, and I'm wondering what the best/lightest desktop-manager (right word) is? Gnome seems a tad sluggish to me
[02:26] <davor> im trying to get GdmXserverTimeout to go up to 25s, but it isnt working
[02:26] <josh__> juxi, plug it in, sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mount/point
[02:27] <josh__> u may have to use the -t vfat switch with taht
[02:27] <Juxi> when I plug it in it's mounted and there's an fstab entry but when I access it, it says that only root can mount the device
[02:27] <josh__> ie - sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mount/point
[02:27] <josh__> ahh
[02:27] <Juxi> when I manually change the fstab entry I can mount it (defaults to user)
[02:28] <josh__> fstab entry, change to user,auto,umask=0000
[02:28] <Juxi> but since it's automounting the entry is deleted if I unplug the stick
[02:28] <josh__> hmm
[02:28] <davor> nevermind, i think i found the answer
[02:28] <Juxi> I do not want to add that manual entry into the fstab since the port might change (depending on which usb port I use)
[02:28] <josh__> it shouldn't be deleted from fstab...
[02:29] <kaur> how do I get the speedsteping to work?
[02:29] <josh__> does the port change if u use a different usb port?
[02:29] <Juxi> I read the forum posts and that's what should happen if you want to automount it ...
[02:29] <Juxi> yeah it does /sdc /sdd
[02:30] <josh__> i thought they all connected to a usb hub and that hub decided... if only one was plugged in it would always be 1 no matter what plug u use
[02:30] <Juxi> is there a way to edit the way this autogenerated entry?
[02:30] <janitor_x> hello
[02:30] <blizzkid> lo all. I've tried about every "solution" I could find on google, but still can't get my sound to work. AC97. Anyone any ideas?
[02:30] <woland_> is the upgrade process from dapper to edgy still troublesome?
[02:30] <janitor_x> i wanted to use console (no X) but telinit 3 seems to do nothing... any suggestions?
[02:31] <josh__> blizzkid: go to command prompt, type in amixer/alsamixer, make sure stuff aint muted
[02:31] <Juxi> any other ideas  @josh__
[02:31] <liri> when I'm going into hibernate mode the laptop goes all blank and just stays like that forever when I turn it off manually and turn it on again it boots up as if nothing happened...
[02:31] <liri> has anyone experienced that before?
[02:31] <ProN00b> blizzkid, that is strange, you must have some strange  ac97, i think i have a ac97, and it worked out of the box
[02:32] <josh__> hmm... lemme use my google-fu real quick
[02:32] <ProN00b> blizzkid, what does it say about the sound device in kernel logs ?
[02:32] <VigoFusion> I found it again, still interested?
[02:32] <blizzkid> ProN00b, as far as I can see from lsmod and such, it detects the card
[02:33] <ProN00b> blizzkid, so no errors but no sound ?
[02:33] <woland_> has anyone upgraded from dapper to edgy using apt?
[02:33] <blizzkid> indeed ProN00b
[02:33] <josh__> look in /etc/udev/rules.d/050_hal* and see what that says. That is the rule that creates sd* devices.
[02:33] <Juxi> I looked this up http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=173300 but the solution there did not work for me
[02:33] <kaur> How to solve this: /etc/init.d/powernowd: 156: cannot create /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor: Directory nonexistent
[02:34] <ProN00b> blizzkid, uuh, thats sucky, hmm, did sound work before ? like on other distros, windows ?
[02:34] <josh__> http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=debian-user&m=113928822321247&w=2
[02:34] <blizzkid> when this box was running windows, it worked fine
[02:35] <ProN00b> blizzkid, best you can do is prolly buying some cheap 10 bucks soundcard
[02:36] <josh__> blizzkid: did you check the mixer to make sure it wasn't muted?
[02:36] <blizzkid> ProN00b,  yeah, but I don't want to spend money for something that should just work, you know.
[02:36] <josh__> that was my problem...
[02:37] <blizzkid> josh__, yep; checked everything
[02:37] <Orkie> hi. what package gives you ldconfig?
[02:37] <Orkie> i've managed to mess it up somehow and need to reinstall it
[02:37] <ProN00b> blizzkid, the "should just work" is the fault of the hardware manufacturer, it worked for my via ac97 perfectly
[02:37] <VigoFusion> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI  oh I see now, lots more to learn, this is FUN!
[02:37] <josh__> next question... are u using alsa or esd?
[02:38] <Rookie_> 90% of your time goes to reading and learning when it is about linux
[02:38] <blizzkid> ProN00b, but then again... I'm really confused why an lspci and lsmod show no obvious problem
[02:38] <ProN00b> blizzkid, because it propably uses the generic ac97 driver and your chip somehow is special designed so it doesn't work with that
[02:38] <mc44> Orkie: dpkg -S <file>?
[02:38] <oyvind> Anyone know how I can prevent gnome volume manager from auto-mounting a partition on a removable USB drive ? I've tried the following HAL props to no avail: storage.automount_enabled_hint = false, volume.policy.should_mount = false, volume.ignore = true. lshal shows the properties are correctly set in HAL ...
[02:38] <blizzkid> (I'm not 100% sure, but I even think it worked in older Ubuntu)
[02:39] <ProN00b> how do you test sound ?
[02:39] <oyvind> it's a backup partition I don't want auto-mounted, as I have an entry for it in /etc/fstab ..
[02:39] <ProN00b> and do you get errors when you try to play ?
[02:39] <blizzkid> I tried to play some mp3/movie/...
[02:39] <blizzkid> no errors
[02:39] <Juxi> @josh that link did not help much .. in my rules there is only a definition of a socket
[02:39] <Orkie> mc44: thanks
[02:39] <herman_munster> oyvind: noauto
[02:40] <mc44> Orkie: libc6 :)
[02:40] <josh__> blizzard, im going to paste a script and send u the link. save it and run it and see if it kicks out an error
[02:40] <oyvind> herman_munster: OK, that's the HAL property key ?
[02:40] <Orkie> mc44: yeah :)
[02:40] <josh__> !pastebin
[02:40] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:40] <herman_munster> oyvind: no, thats the option to add to the line in /etc/fstab
[02:40] <Orkie> mc44: after all my hard work last night, i manage to corrupt part of my filesystem and had to rebuild it
[02:40] <Orkie> ldconfig was a casualty of that
[02:40] <herman_munster> oyvind: sorry, i don't do much gui stuff
[02:41] <alecjw> what command do i do to make a new, empty file?
[02:41] <blizzkid> ok josh__
=== mumbles-zzz is now known as mumbles
[02:41] <mc44> Orkie: ah, tis the law of the sod
[02:41] <herman_munster> alecjw: touch /some/file/name
[02:41] <woland_> how come after replacing all instances of 'dapper' with 'edgy' in sources.list i still see mention of dapper when i apt-get update?
[02:41] <Orkie> :)
[02:41] <josh__> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32522/
[02:41] <oyvind> herman_munster: Yeah, I know that, it's already there. But gnome-volume-manager still mounts it when I log in
[02:41] <josh__> there
[02:41] <alecjw> thanks herman_munster
[02:41] <oyvind> this is a HAL/pmount problem.. essentially I want the partition to be completely ignored by gnome-volume-manager
[02:41] <Orkie> luckily i know how debs work, as dpkg won't do anything without ldconfig
[02:41] <mc44> woland_: because you need to apt-get dist-upgrade. but you should be upgrading using upgrade-manager anyway
[02:42] <oyvind> but it does not respect any of the HAL properties I've tried setting for the volume
[02:42] <woland_> mc44, i don't have access to X
[02:42] <mc44> woland_: ah, sorry
[02:42] <josh__> still looking about usb flash problem
[02:42] <josh__> brb, phone call
[02:42] <herman_munster> oyvind: i have no idea re HAL
[02:42] <oyvind> herman_munster: ok, thanks anyway
[02:42] <mc44> woland_: you may need to apt-get dist-upgrade a couple of times to get everything working
[02:43] <Juxi> maybe somebody else has the same problem? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=302121
[02:43] <Juxi> it's about mounting my usb stick
[02:43] <Orkie> heh, you may spend all night fixing it to get eveything working after an upgrade
[02:43] <mc44> Orkie: positive thinking
[02:43] <blizzkid> josh__, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32523/
[02:43] <Orkie> :D
[02:44] <Orkie> hmm... well a positive thing that has happened is i've got hibernate working
[02:44] <Orkie> (that is how i corrupted my file system, by restoring an old hibernate image by mistake)
[02:45] <mc44> Juxi: add yourself to the defaults group?
[02:46] <recon> On other linux distros, there was a "lock" command for locking a text terminal. Is there any such command on ubuntu?
[02:46] <CaptainMorgan> wow... is it just me or is gedit really overlooked as a powerful editor? didnt' realize it was so competitive... any new editors or popular one lately?
[02:46] <Orkie> CaptainMorgan: i've written bootable programs in C/ASM using gedit
[02:47] <dromer> hmm, Avahi Zeroconf still can't see  mt-daapd
[02:47] <dromer> anybody?
[02:47] <Juxi> @mc44 there is no defaults group
[02:47] <recon> never mind, found program "away".
[02:47] <CaptainMorgan> I got sick of quanta's slowness.. and emacs crazy configs that I just don't have time for(and I am an emacs medium power user).... gedit is basically no fluff
[02:47] <asc> recon: there's one that can be found in repositories...
[02:48] <jatt> recon: lockvc?
[02:48] <mc44> Juxi: check in System -> Administration -> Users and groups, then Mange Groups under the User Privliges tab that everything is ticked
[02:49] <Orkie> CaptainMorgan: yes, it just works and the syntax highlighting is nice too
[02:49] <dromer> yay, it works :)
[02:49] <Juxi> ther's no user privileges tab

[02:50] <mc44> Juxi: ^
[02:51] <Orkie> isn't linux great? i've just lost part of my libc, reinstalled it and everything is working without even rebooting :)
[02:51] <Juxi> @mc44, everything is checked

[02:52] <mc44> Juxi: sorry dont know then
[02:52] <alecjw> something's asking me to select rausb0 for the first rt2570 card, rausb1 for the second rt2570 card etc. how do i do this?
[02:52] <josh__> Juxi: try adding a "noauto" entry in your fstab
[02:52] <Orkie> CaptainMorgan: no, sorry
[02:52] <josh__> that should supress the automounting feature and just mount according to the fstab
[02:53] <samu> Any perl programmers here? Are you using CPAN.pm to install CPAN modules?
[02:53] <blizzkid> should that be just "no auto" or with some options?
[02:53] <Juxi> @josh noauto where?
[02:53] <VigoFusion> Do I need a firewall and if I do where is one located at?
[02:54] <CaptainMorgan> no problem... either way I think I just found my new favorite editor... and it's been underneath the whole time :)
[02:54] <jrib> !firewall | VigoFusion
[02:54] <ubotu> VigoFusion: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[02:54] <josh__> /dev/sda1 /mnt/USB auto noauto,owner,josh 0 0
[02:54] <josh__> thats an example
[02:54] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[02:54] <alecjw> VigoFusion: generally, you don't nee d airewall in linux
[02:54] <exalted> Hi. First of all i need to know if there's a PPC ( iBook ) specific channel that i should go about; or can i ask here?
[02:54] <cypher1> alecjw, why ?
[02:55] <ghostshadow189> hi all , wat folder or file to manage and contain kde theme ?
[02:55] <alecjw> cypher1: whay what? the rtusb0 thing or the firewal lthing?
[02:55] <ghostshadow189> and how can i enable double click to open folder and file in kde?
[02:55] <blizzkid> josh__, so, what do you suggest now?
[02:55] <josh__> or u could change that to /dev/sda1 /mount/point auto noauto,user,umask=0000 0 0
[02:55] <VigoFusion> That is what I remembered, I installed Linux back when ZDnet was still ruler and only onethat promoted it.

=== digiqq_ is now known as digiqq
[02:55] <josh__> lemme look up that card and see what info i can get on it
[02:55] <Juxi> noauto does not work but if I add user it works, the problem is that this entry is gone as soonas thes tick is unplugged
[02:56] <cypher1> alecjw, i thought all OS'es need firewall
[02:56] <alecjw> cypher1: it has its ports closed automatically by default. unless you set up a server eg web server, ythey'll remain closed, so no hackers can get in
[02:56] <blizzkid> k, thx already josh__
[02:56] <alecjw> something's asking me to select rausb0 for the first rt2570 card, rausb1 for the second rt2570 card etc. how do i do this?
[02:56] <defrysk> ghostshadow189, systemsettings > keyboard and mouse > mouse
[02:56] <cypher1> alecjw, isnt that the case with windows also ?
[02:57] <josh__> http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/peripherals-hardware/34474-no-sound-please-help.html
[02:57] <josh__> give that a look, im still looking at others
[02:57] <alecjw> cypher1: i dont think so
[02:57] <Rookie_> even if none have a firewall, its still possible to get in (or hack) by using exploits
[02:57] <blizzkid> josh__, I checked that one before I came here
[02:58] <cypher1> Rookie_, yes depends on the applications you run
[02:58] <Orkie> i only use firestarter to disable and re-enable the firewall easily
[02:58] <Rookie_> any apps - even nano has exploits
[02:58] <digiqq> hey guys, how do I unblock a person from MSN when using gaim?
[02:58] <Orkie> i need it to telnet into my gp2x
[02:58] <Rookie_> Well, maybe not nano but any app
[02:58] <VigoFusion> Firewalls do help keep the pestering webjunk out of a system, any system that has an active connection to an internet can be accessed.
[02:59] <Orkie> digiqq: tools > privacy
[02:59] <Rookie_> correct VigoFusion
[02:59] <digiqq> Orkie: thx, that helps a lot
[02:59] <VigoFusion> Just good to ask stuff that I either dont know or forgot.
[02:59] <Orkie> digiqq: no problem
[02:59] <josh__> just out of curioutsity, in amixer/alsamixer, do you have any settings muted or the volume down on? like mine for instance... i didn't get sound because my surround center was down... i dont have surround sound at all

[03:01] <josh__> and you have attempted to change sound from open system to esd to alsa and none of them work?
[03:02] <blizzkid> defrysk, only "external amplifier is muted now, but even unmuting that doesn't change anything"
[03:02] <seelen> please help, Ubuntu startup hangs when gnome starts ... is afresh instaltion ... any suggest??
[03:02] <defrysk> blizzkid, in gnome your output should be set to esd check that also
[03:03] <blizzkid> josh__, I've only tested with the base install so far, didn't try any other yet, as I'm not quite sure how to do that

[03:04] <Orkie> backup the file first though :)
[03:04] <abarbaccia> Orkie, doesn't work
[03:05] <Orkie> odd, it should work...
[03:05] <Orkie> try sudo -s
[03:05] <Orkie> that will give you a rot shell
[03:05] <Orkie> *root
[03:05] <abarbaccia> can't script with sudo -s

[03:05] <Renan_s2> try 'sudo sh -c "echo blah >> file" '
[03:05] <seelen> asc, same problem in all .... the unique change is the integrated ati video card configuration
[03:06] <josh__> blizzkid: u got amarok installed?
[03:06] <asc> seelen: Ah.  It works until you try to configure the card?
[03:06] <seelen> asc, but is the only way to see my screen in the correct resolution
[03:06] <asc> Or, until after you configure it and start X more likely.
[03:06] <blizzkid> josh__, installing right now

[03:08] <Orkie> josh__: it isn't hugely different
[03:08] <asc> seelen: Ouch.  I don't know much about ATI support, except that it's... not very good.
[03:08] <Orkie> looks a bit nicer possibly
[03:08] <josh__> rgr
[03:08] <Orkie> ati support is fine
[03:08] <josh__> ati is fine... nvidia is the one i had probs with
[03:08] <Orkie> even if it doesn't make best use of the video hardware
[03:08] <Orkie> ati *used* to be awful
[03:08] <seelen> asc, and is not a gnome problem because with xfce the error is the same
[03:09] <seelen> asc, what can I do ??

[03:27] <what_if> intelikey: if you can get the manufacturers diagnostic software it _may_ test the mbr area

[03:28] <josh__> intelikey: yes, but like he said... it doesn't check the mbr
[03:28] <intelikey> anyway thanks for the input.
[03:28] <roryy> what_if: what if (!) one runs 'badblocks /dev/sda' instead of 'badblocks /dev/sda1' ?
[03:28] <josh__> do you have windows?
[03:28] <intelikey> josh__ no

[03:29] <VigoFusion> fix mbr? or is that a win/dos only
[03:29] <roryy> aargh. another thunderstorm
[03:29] <afief> How do i add extra languages to ubuntu(typing hebrew for example) ?
[03:29] <intelikey> VigoFusion @ me ?
[03:30] <VigoFusion> Whoever had the MBR problem
[03:30] <what_if> intelikey: well either way I have seen this problem before, it was my sisters semi-new computer would just lose the mbr
[03:30] <roryy> intelikey: it does sound a hardware problem, don't you think?  I can't imagine the mbr is written to very often -- only when installing an os or maybe when partitioning
[03:30] <intelikey> VigoFusion no M$ crap here.  and yes running lilo again fixes it    but in about 20 boots it's back to the same error
[03:31] <afief> How do i add extra languages to ubuntu(typing hebrew for example) ?
[03:31] <intelikey> roryy no partition here either.
[03:31] <VigoFusion> Maybe the MFT wich means Hardware is in error then.
[03:32] <roryy> intelikey: my point is it's not like there's anything in Ubuntu (or anything else) routinely writing to the mbr; if it breaks, it sounds like a hardware failure
[03:33] <blizzkid> josh__, no ideas left?
[03:33] <intelikey> roryy yeah i got that.  just wondering why the first block would be bad and badblocks in read/write mode cant find it.
[03:33] <Vidar_> I'm having problem with my soundMax sound card. I get sound, but I also get this high pitched constant tone. Furthermore, if I adjust the volume, I have to restart to get the sound working again.
[03:33] <iskywalker> hi!
[03:33] <roryy> intelikey: well, you said it only failed every 20 or so boots
[03:33] <iskywalker> i get

[03:33] <intelikey> yes i haven't counted but between 20 and 30
[03:33] <josh__> wait... 20-30...
[03:34] <iskywalker> i set in the  the macne xhost +
[03:34] <iskywalker> what could it be?
[03:34] <josh__> maybe your hd check is killin it
[03:34] <jatt> iskywalker: use ssh -X
[03:34] <roryy> intelikey: p'raps run badblocks many (50?) times, or tweak how badblocks does it's testing.  Maybe it's a time-to-failure type thing
[03:34] <jatt> iskywalker: ssh -X -l login machine_where_emacs_is_installed
[03:34] <FurryNemesis> Vidar_, got a built-in microphone?
[03:34] <jatt> iskywalker: then run emacs, no need to use xhost
[03:34] <intelikey> josh__ there ya go.   you may be on it.
[03:34] <josh__> cuz my harddrives get forced to be checked every 30 mounts

[03:37] <afief> How do i add extra languages to ubuntu(typing hebrew for example) ?
[03:37] <Vidar_> Crap! Got rid of the rest of the sound too
[03:37] <jatt> ok
[03:38] <jatt> it works here though. Problably your remote machine is messing with DISPLAY. Or something else.
[03:38] <recon0> Would anybody here happen to know how to setup/configure telnetd?
[03:38] <Vidar_> this happens everytime I try to change any volume settings
[03:38] <jatt> recon0: why do you want to install telnetd instead of sshd?
[03:39] <fragment> I am trying to find /etc/mkinitramfs/modules but my edgy ubuntu does not have that
[03:39] <fragment> it has a /etc/mkinitramfs but not as a directory
[03:39] <recon0> jatt: The client computer has no ssh compat, I have no privliges to install, the sysadmin isn't about to, so all I have is telnetd.

[04:10] <lnostdal> yes, it's totem
[04:10] <jrib> lnostdal: it has to do with the freedesktop mime files.  That extension doesn't match up with the actual filetype.  I don't know how to disable that check.  You could add the extension to the mime files... but that's not very nice either

[04:15] <pirast> xst, i think that they try to employee a xorg maintainer, xorg bugs should be solved faster then
[04:16] <flox> i need the Gaim version 2.0.0beta5, but i find only 2.0.0beta3.1 in the repository.
[04:16] <eneried> hello people, does somebody know if edgy could hibernate an asrock motherboard computer???
[04:16] <jrib> lnostdal: http://www.gnome.org/learn/admin-guide/latest/mimetypes-modifying.html  but like I said, there may be a better solution
[04:16] <flox> how i can get the last beta version for Gaim?
[04:16] <lnostdal> jrib, right
[04:17] <VigoFusion> I am going to attempt to resolve this ATI 200 Chipset problem now, I thank you all. Hope to return soon. :)
[04:17] <flox> i should ask someone to upgrade the repository for Gaim-ubuntu?
[04:17] <eneried> flox, go to gaim.org
[04:17] <xst> pirast: ok, sounds great. But until then, we are stuck with a broken X :-)
[04:17] <eneried> or maybe is gaim.sourceforge.net
[04:17] <flox> eneried: it's better to compile/make myself?
[04:17] <flox> than to ask the ubuntu team to upgrade repository?
[04:17] <eneried> flox, if you want to keep on dapper, the answer is YES
[04:18] <flox> eneried: i am on edgy
[04:18] <flox> this is the 2.00 beta3 on edgy
[04:18] <flox> but i need the beta5
[04:18] <pirast> xst, yeah.. to be honest, i dont think that it will get fixed in edgy.. maybe the bug is gone in feisty :-(
[04:19] <eneried> but ask ubuntu team to upgrade the repository of dapper adding gaim, firefox and ntfs support, the painful upgrade to edgy does not pay enough
[04:19] <neostrider> melissa?
[04:19] <xst> pirast: :-(
[04:19] <eneried> um, then search in non official repositories, maybe somebody compiled gaim beta 5
[04:20] <deema> can anybody here help me diagnose my wifi driver? I cannot get it to work, after many tries
[04:20] <flox> eneried: thanks!
[04:20] <flox> i got it : http://www.debuntu.org/gaim-2.0.0beta5-edgy-eft-feisty-fawn
[04:20] <Ioerror> rm: cannot lstat `Nirvana//.h<  !': Input/output error
[04:20] <Ioerror>  i got this error. why can i do to delete the folder?
[04:21] <eneried> let me get it too ;)
[04:21] <twilight> third and last time, i promise :) . I think I've a problem with hal in edgy. When I try to burn an audio cd, the system doesn't recognize the blank cd, and ask to insert it. The error is: " No property volume.disc.capacity on device with id /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/volume_empty_unknown". Suggestions?
[04:21] <Wolf-h26> guys help
[04:22] <Falstius> Does anyone know how to get xawtv to record sound?  Sound is fine when it is playing live and the setup uses a jumper from the tv audio out to line-on.
[04:22] <Wolf-h26> last night,my resolution was t 1024 by 768.This morning I can't inscrease it. and it's at 800 by 600.
[04:22] <eniac_petrov> Is there a statics - how many "Help!!!! " messages are tracked in freenode, about a day?
[04:23] <eniac_petrov> Wolf-h26: maybe your monitor is small?
[04:23] <pirast> xst, at least the bug is assigned to someone :-)
[04:23] <eniac_petrov> do you have speciffic, commercial video drivers?
[04:24] <Wolf-h26> the problem is that my resolution just changed without my notice :S
[04:24] <deema> can anybody here help me diagnose my wifi driver? I cannot get it to work, after many tries
[04:24] <Wolf-h26> I got no nvidia driver
[04:25] <Wolf-h26> this really sucks
[04:25] <luizito> deema, what's wifi card?
[04:26] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, why not install nvidia driver?
[04:26] <deema> wusb54gv2 driver is islsm from prism54.org
[04:26] <Wolf-h26> I don't know how,lol
[04:26] <Wolf-h26> i'm new to Linux
[04:26] <deema> package manager..
[04:26] <deema> Synaptic
[04:26] <janitor_x> just do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx on a terminal
[04:27] <deema> well
[04:27] <gnuts> hey everyone. Is there a good place to find a list of supported webcams for ubuntu and ekiga?
[04:27] <janitor_x> or synaptic if u like
[04:27] <caminomaster> hello
[04:27] <jrib> !webcam | gnuts
[04:27] <ubotu> gnuts: webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[04:27] <Wolf-h26> i'll give it a try
[04:27] <Wolf-h26> brb
[04:27] <deema> but it may require other repos...
[04:27] <caminomaster> I'm searching the infopipe library
[04:27] <gnuts> thanks!!
[04:27] <caminomaster> where can I find it?
[04:27] <deema> Wolf, which card do you have?
[04:28] <inimesekene> how can i simultaneously change the owner of a directory and it's subdirs and files ?
[04:28] <jrib> lnostdal: ok I came across something that claims if you make the handler for both asf and wmv files the same, the message will not show up
[04:28] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, you still need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf after intalling the driver...
[04:29] <Wolf-h26> wait
[04:29] <twilight> inimesekene: chown ->-R<-
[04:29] <jatt> does mozilla thunderbird in debian support connection to an ms exchange server using a protocol different than imap?
[04:30] <tritium> jatt: no
[04:30] <inimesekene> twilight i didn't get that
[04:30] <Ioerror> i need linux antivirus. i got infected. any help ?
[04:30] <quiet> i have installed artwiz fonts... but they don't show up under any of the gnome apps... i did check to make sure that the path is xorg.conf
[04:30] <lnostdal> jrib, i understand .. still; this is something that should be considered a bug IMHO .. "normal users" cannot fix this by themselves ..   i'm gonna do a search on launchpad and report it :)
[04:30] <janitor_x> Ioerror, infected?
[04:30] <quiet> Ioerror: no you didn't.
[04:30] <quiet> lol.
[04:30] <Ioerror> i cant delete a file
[04:30] <jatt> are there other alternatives? (I heard about a ximian or evolution connector but I don't like evolution)
[04:31] <Ioerror> rm: cannot lstat `Nirvana//.h<  !': Input/output error
[04:31] <quiet> Ioerror: rofl...  sudo rm /path/to/file
[04:31] <janitor_x> Ioerror, u cant delete a file that is not your own
[04:31] <Ioerror> i did it as root
[04:31] <quiet> it's not a virus it's just a corrupted file.
[04:31] <asc> Ioerror: it looks like either hardware or file system damage
[04:31] <tritium> Ioerror: I think you're mistaken about being infected
[04:31] <inimesekene> ok i got it
[04:31] <inimesekene> thanks
[04:31] <Ioerror> ok
[04:32] <[gen2] niki> he<y
[04:32] <Ioerror> what can i do now?
[04:32] <quiet> anyone using artwiz fonts?
[04:32] <[gen2] niki> i have a problem
[04:32] <[gen2] niki> I installed the amaranth nvidia drivers to get emerald without xgl stuff
[04:32] <Ioerror> How can i delete this file? I must delete i think is a virus.
[04:32] <[gen2] niki> but the glx of amaranth produces a coredumb and doesnt run at all
[04:32] <jrib> lnostdal: bug #19101
[04:32] <[gen2] niki> niki@gilgamesch:~$ glxinfo

[04:33] <jatt> ugh
[04:33] <quiet> Ioerror: you're way to new to Linux... it's not a virus...
[04:33] <tritium> Ioerror: it's not
[04:33] <Ioerror> ok
[04:33] <Ioerror> HOW can i delete it?
[04:33] <asc> Ioerror: 'sudo shutdown -rF now' and it will reboot and check your filesystem
[04:33] <Ioerror> I MUST TERMINATE IT
[04:33] <quiet> i would suggest you fsck your filesystem.
[04:33] <Wolf-h26> ok,now what do I do with this package?
[04:33] <Ioerror> quiet: fsck?
[04:33] <[gen2] niki> anyone else using amaranth drivers here?
[04:33] <Wolf-h26> NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run
[04:33] <quiet> man fsck
[04:33] <dfcarney> fsck is a filesystem check
[04:33] <dv_> [gen2] niki, no problems here
[04:33] <dv_> not at all
[04:34] <Ioerror> OK
[04:34] <Wolf-h26> ok,now what do I do with this package? NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run
[04:34] <liri> global system path is defined in /etc/environment?
[04:34] <tritium> Wolf-h26: please try the ubuntu nvidia packages instead
[04:34] <quiet> Ioerror: you were downloading warez, huh?
[04:34] <dfcarney> Ioerror: you know how Windows sometimes performs a check if you "shut it down improperly"?  Same thing...
[04:34] <Ioerror> THis folder is into a USB 2.0 HDD MAXTOR
[04:34] <[gen2] niki> dv_ which guide did you follow to install?
[04:34] <dv_> the one at amaranths page
[04:34] <quiet> Ioerror: what filesystem?
[04:34] <Wolf-h26> where do I download it?
[04:34] <tritium> !nvidia
[04:34] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:34] <dv_> actually I just added the two lines to sources.list
[04:34] <Ioerror> i think ntfs or fat32
[04:35] <tritium> Wolf-h26: ^^
[04:35] <quiet> oh god.
[04:35] <dv_> updated
[04:35] <quiet> dude.
[04:35] <quiet> you can't delete from ntfs
[04:35] <Wolf-h26> thanks
[04:35] <dv_> and added the beryl reps. thats it
[04:35] <Wolf-h26> brb
[04:35] <quiet> unless you are using -g3
[04:35] <Ioerror> and now?
[04:35] <dv_> beryl crashes sometimes with GL apps using FBOs,
[04:35] <quiet> er.. 3g
[04:35] <Ioerror> i cant open my hdd under windows:<
[04:35] <dv_> but without beryl, nothing crashes
[04:35] <Ioerror> it says some errors :(
[04:35] <quiet> sounds to me like you corrupted your drive.
[04:35] <CarlFK> is the alternate or server CD's mounted somewhere so I can wget a few files ?
[04:36] <quiet> i would suggest a fsck.. which probably wonh't fix it..
[04:36] <Ioerror> quiet: and now what can we do ?
[04:36] <quiet> if not, you need to format it.
[04:36] <Ioerror> how can i format it? its a usb
[04:36] <Ioerror> not a file system
[04:36] <quiet> yes it is..
[04:36] <quiet> lol
[04:36] <quiet> cfdisk /dev/sda
[04:36] <dizzie> Anyone here with a laptop with a mmc cardreader, and a Sony Ericsson, who got both working? ie, i want to copy files from my m2 card without using my usb cable provided when i bought the phone :o
[04:36] <Ioerror> i mean, not linux or windows
[04:36] <dv_> the usb drive has a filesystem
[04:36] <dv_> usually FAT32
[04:37] <asc> Ioerror, if there's files on it, it has a file system.  This includes things like USB disks and CDs.
[04:37] <Ioerror> ok
[04:38] <Ioerror> now what can i do ? i tryed the fsck
[04:38] <Ioerror> and
[04:38] <Ioerror> WARNING!!!  Running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem may cause
[04:38] <Ioerror> SEVERE filesystem damage.
[04:38] <Ioerror> it is dangerous
[04:38] <quiet> umount it.
[04:38] <quiet> and fsck /dev/sda1
[04:38] <tapas> Hi, i'm trying to build a kernel with ingo molnar's  -rt patches for my ubuntu system
[04:38] <quiet> or whatever the partition is.
[04:38] <Ioerror> unmount /dev/hda4 ?
[04:38] <quiet> usb would not show up as hda
[04:38] <tapas> i got the vanilla, sources, pached them up with -rt and then copied the ubuntu .config over and did make oldconfig
[04:38] <quiet> it would be sda
[04:38] <deema> hope you aren't providing some bad advice to ioerror
[04:38] <dfcarney> Ioerror: type 'mount' to get a list of your mounted partitions
[04:39] <Ioerror> ok
[04:39] <grimboy> My WLAN card was working until I installed network-manager. I can't connect to wireless networks any more (wired still works)
[04:39] <sobersabre> hi. I have all the installed libraries, for mp3 support.
[04:39] <sobersabre> I cannot play mp3s,
[04:39] <quiet> grimboy: ndiswrapper?
[04:39] <dfcarney> quiet: Wouldn't windows fsck tools be better suited to fix an NTFS or FAT32 filesystem?
[04:39] <blinx> how can I convert an ogg file to a midi?
[04:39] <sobersabre> when running mpg123 I get Segmentation Fault
[04:39] <quiet> dfcarney: if it's ntfs it won't fsck anyways.
[04:39] <grimboy> My WLAN card was working until I installed network-manager. Now I can't connect to wireless networks any more (wired still works). Is there anything I ought to do to get network-manger working?
[04:39] <quiet> fscking a vfat partition can be doen under linux just fine.
[04:40] <Ioerror> /dev/sda1 on /media/BACK UP type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=077,iocharset=utf8
[04:40] <anton__> join  #firefox
[04:40] <anton__> oops!
[04:40] <grimboy> Oh, I did the same message twice. Oops.
[04:40] <Ioerror> the usb 2.0 maxtor is vfat
[04:40] <quiet> Ioerror: okay...  umount /dev/sda1
[04:40] <quiet> fsck /dev/sda1
[04:40] <quiet> rather
[04:40] <flox> grimboy: i guess u need to clean ur '/etc/network/interfaces'
[04:40] <quiet> fsck.vfat /dev/sda1
[04:40] <sobersabre> guys, why the hell would mpg321/mpg123 give me a segfault ?!
[04:41] <grimboy> flox, Thanks, I'll have a look at that.
[04:41] <Ioerror> umount: /media/BACK UP: device is busy
[04:41] <Ioerror> i dont listen music
[04:41] <quiet> get out of the folder
[04:41] <Ioerror> or something
[04:41] <dfcarney> sobersabre: i dunno...maybe a divide by 0 error during decode?
[04:41] <flox> grimboy: when u switch to network-manager, u hv to remove all 'wireless' related things from the 'interfaces' file
[04:41] <sobersabre> dfcarney and why the helll this would happen ?!
[04:41] <Ioerror> i dont do anything with the usb and i cant unmount
[04:41] <Ioerror> if i unplug?
[04:42] <Wolf-h26> this is so complicated
[04:42] <anton__> hi everybody :) i have a question for you... :)
[04:42] <Wolf-h26> I give yp
[04:42] <dfcarney> sobersabre: a corrupt audio file, perhaps.  or maybe it was encoded with something that your decoder doesn't recognize (or mistakes for another standard)
[04:42] <Wolf-h26> lol
[04:42] <grimboy> flox, Ah, so that it can all be done dynamically, ok. Is # a comment in /etc/network/interfaces?
[04:42] <Wolf-h26> :/
[04:42] <flox> grimboy: yes
[04:42] <sobersabre> dfcarney this is strange, because I am able to decode them on my home machine.
[04:42] <sobersabre> and the parents computer cannot.
[04:42] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, just do ---- sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[04:42] <sobersabre> why ?!?!
[04:43] <deema> wolf just follow instructions
[04:43] <flox> grimboy: the line should look:
[04:43] <[gen2] niki> umm
[04:43] <asc> Ioerror, make sure all programs using the drive are closed.  Including terminals, file managers, etc.
[04:43] <flox> auto eth1
[04:43] <deema> janitor, they say you need restricted modules or somethnig
[04:43] <flox> iface eth1 inet dhcp
[04:43] <[gen2] niki> glx is still down
[04:43] <flox> grimboy: or sth like that
[04:43] <dfcarney> sobersabre: hmmm...  well, maybe it's a problem or incompatibility with a library that you're using.  you can check the libraries using 'ldd <binary>'
[04:43] <Wolf-h26> i'll give it a try...
[04:43] <varsendaggr> how do i restart alsa?
[04:43] <grimboy> flox, thanks, I think it's eth0 for me.
[04:43] <afief> :)
=== mc44_ is now known as mc44
[04:44] <dfcarney> sobersabre: i.e. compare the libs on your system to those on your parents'
[04:44] <varsendaggr> nm
[04:44] <sobersabre> dfcarney I am on eft.
[04:44] <Wolf-h26> janitor,what do I do next?
[04:44] <sobersabre> parents on dapper
[04:44] <dfcarney> sobersabre: if you want to get more technical, you could use 'strace' to trace the crash
[04:44] <afief> flox, thanks, I think it's eth0 for me.
[04:45] <sobersabre> dfcarney I have done this
[04:45] <afief> sobersabre: if you want to get more technical, you could use 'strace' to trace the crash
[04:45] <dfcarney> sobersabre: "eft" ?
[04:45] <afief> dfcarney I have done this
[04:45] <sobersabre> I don't see anything meaningfull
[04:45] <afief> I don't see anything meaningfull
[04:45] <sobersabre> I have run strace mpg123 <mp3 file>
[04:45] <sobersabre> I looked at the output.
[04:46] <afief> I have run strace mpg123 <mp3 file>
[04:46] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, are you done?
[04:46] <Wolf-h26> yup
[04:46] <sobersabre> and It "just" gets a SIGSEGV at some point.
[04:46] <afief> and It "just" gets a SIGSEGV at some point.
[04:46] <sobersabre> afief what's your thing ?
[04:46] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:46] <grimboy> flox, Ok, before it was showing me wireless networks now it doesn't do anything.
[04:46] <Wolf-h26> ok
[04:46] <tritium> Wolf-h26: did you install the nvidia ubuntu packages per the URL I had ubotu give you?
[04:46] <grimboy> s/do/show
[04:47] <dfcarney> sobersabre: what does 'eft' stand for?
[04:47] <flox> grimboy: i've done this thing yesterday. wit, i try to figure out what i've done just after
[04:47] <Wolf-h26> yes
[04:47] <flox> s/wit/wait
[04:47] <dromer> I need libcdk-java
[04:47] <tritium> Wolf-h26: good
[04:47] <sobersabre> dfcarney: Edgy Eft
[04:48] <dfcarney> sobersabre: ah, I should have known that.
[04:48] <sobersabre> I am using it. My parents have Dapper Drake ( 6.06 )
[04:48] <Wolf-h26> what do I do in the xorg conf?
[04:48] <blinx> no one an idea?
[04:48] <blinx> with my midi problem
[04:48] <deema> aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[04:48] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, look for the Section "Device".. then under Driver --- change it to nvidia
[04:49] <sobersabre> blinx do you have a hardware midi dev or do you want to use a sound card  ?
[04:49] <lgp> Hi
[04:49] <tritium> deema: don't do that again
[04:49] <deema> why not?
[04:49] <jsilva> How can I know what is IRQ 201?
[04:49] <deema> and Wolf, it may be just "nv"
[04:49] <deema> change that to "nvidia"
[04:49] <tritium> deema: because it's spamming the channel
[04:50] <strabes> i have a problem with downloading .tar.gz files to my shared vfat partition
[04:50] <Wolf-h26> ok
[04:50] <lgp> can anyone give me a hend?.hehe
[04:50] <deema> then click save
[04:50] <dfcarney> sobersabre: well, that could be why :)  seriously, it's probably a bug in a library or the package itself.  the first thing that you need to do is eliminate the differences and narrow things down to one file that's causing problems.  then you could go further by looking into the bug database for similar problems.
[04:50] <digiqq> ls
[04:50] <digiqq> exit
[04:50] <Wolf-h26> ok
[04:50] <lgp> got problems installing Crossover ..
[04:50] <Wolf-h26> what do I do next?
[04:50] <strabes> when i choose to download a tar.gz file to my /media/windows vfat drive (which is mounted according to http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_mount_Windows_partitions_.28FAT.29_on_boot-up.2C_and_allow_all_users_to_read.2Fwrite
[04:50] <flox> grimboy: i guess u need to kill NetworkManager
[04:50] <strabes> it doesn't work
[04:50] <sobersabre> dfcarney you don't think all you say is.... problematic, taking into an account that i used dapper for 1 year and played mp3s  ?
[04:51] <strabes> anyone?
[04:51] <flox> grimboy: or reboot...
[04:51] <strabes> brb
[04:51] <dfcarney> sobersabre: i certainly think it warrants an investigation, but you need to eliminate sources of uncertainty to narrow down *why* it's failing
[04:52] <Wolf-h26> man,all that just to change my resolution to 1024.....
[04:52] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26,  then look for the Subsection "Display" under it is Depth 24 ... under Modes-- add "1024x768" or/and "1280x1024" if your monitor supports it
[04:52] <asc> strabes: what's the error message?
[04:52] <tritium> Wolf-h26: no, all that to intsall proprietary nvidia drivers
[04:52] <tritium> Wolf-h26: if you couldn't change resolution, you had a separate problem with the open drivers
[04:52] <Wolf-h26> ok
[04:53] <sobersabre> dfcarney let's agree: these are the same binaries I had. TRUE ?
=== borg is now known as botxj
[04:53] <dfcarney> sobersabre: the same .MP3s or the same decoder?
[04:53] <sobersabre> dfcarney the same decoder.
[04:54] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, then save and log-out ... do Ctrl+Alt+Backspace ... then log-in again... your res should be the one that you desired...

[04:54] <jatt> does libflash-mozplugin handle youtube videos? Or must I use the propietary flash plugin?
[04:54] <Wolf-h26> it's already written 1024x768

[04:57] <Yggdrasil> how do i enable wpa client for my laptop to my wireless network ?
[04:57] <janitor_x> Wolf-h26, under section "monitor" change horisync and vertrefresh with the right one for ur monitor (its in the manual" ... be careful with the values
[04:58] <chopchop_> hi, i just messed around with my box and now i get this wierd error when i try to compile c programs : GLIBC_2.4 not found. What should i do ?
[04:58] <tritium> janitor_x: those values should be auto-detected
[04:58] <dfcarney> sobersabre: the same version of the decoder, using the same versions of the libraries compiled with the same compiler?
[04:58] <dfcarney> sobersabre: i'm just saying that if the problem doesn't occur in dapper, but occurs in edgy then it can (very likely) be attributed to some "upgrade" or "bug fix" introduced in edgy.  for instance, i've seen cases in which a developer has "fixed" a bug to make a decoder more "standards compliant", but this broke functionality for some files because they weren't encoded perfectly to begin with.
[04:58] <dfcarney> sobersabre: what you could try is to convert the .MP3 to a .WAV file, then convert the .WAV to an .MP3 -- see if that works.
[04:58] <mwe> Yggdrasil: using the network-manager applet is the easiest, but it will only work when gnome is running
[04:59] <janitor_x> tritium, depends on the monitor i guess... i had to manually set mine
[04:59] <tritium> janitor_x: you're right, the monitor has to support it

[05:01] <kenThomson2> dfcarney: ok here is it again
[05:01] <vnese> why FF2.0 usually crashes on my laptop :( and ubuntu does too
[05:01] <kenThomson2> So,...i am having a NTFS partition (10GB) and precedding that partition is another 20GB of unpartitioned space. Now what i want to do is, that i want to create a /home = NTFS partition + unpartitioned space (preceeding it). HOwever as i dont have any place to copy my DATA on the NTFS partition i need some other ingenious way of doing it
[05:01] <mwe> kenThomson: I didn't see your actual question. only that you asked if it was ok to ask and I said yes;)
[05:01] <Pupeno> Hello.

[05:03] <dfcarney> kenThomson2: I'm a bit confused.  You've got a 10 GB NTFS partition, 20 GB of unpartitioned space, and you want to mount /home to access both?
[05:04] <kenThomson2> Is there someway to JOIN partitions behind a already created partition? (ie, make a bigger partition without loosing the data of the first one?
[05:04] <mwe> kenThomson: oh you want to drop the ntfs partition and merge it with the unpartitioned space to a single ext partition?
[05:04] <kenThomson2> dfcarney: i want a ext3 as home (but i want the data from NTFS to be copied in there)

[05:16] <alecjw> it happened about a week ago while america was asleep, i think
[05:16] <Stx> I klined all the bots joining/parting this channel.
[05:16] <kenThomson2> dfcarney: yes i am looking at the page
[05:17] <dfcarney> kenThomson2: but be *very* careful about resizing partitions (i recommend that you back up all of your data to some other disk first)
[05:17] <botxj> aleka, lol, you aint seen the half of it
[05:17] <aleka> I was following a thread on the ubuntu forums about accessing music remotely.. and tried to give this "jinzora" a try...
[05:17] <kenThomson2> dfcarney: TELL ME THIS, can i 'extend' a partition from the front (the head side). I mean can i make it bigger, by merging the unpartitioned space in FRONT OF IT, to the already present back partition
[05:17] <aleka> seems like no one has heard of it
[05:17] <kenThomson2> I hope you get me
[05:18] <alecjw> kenThomson2: only if it's in the linux-swap file system
[05:18] <RadiantFire> kenThomson2: in general yes, you simply expand the filesysetm across the unpartitioned space, however, resize opperations have a tendancy to go awry
[05:18] <dfcarney> kenThomson2: doubtful.  i think that ext3 stores it's primary partition table at the beginning of the disk.  then again, maybe a tool would be smart enough to sort that out.
[05:19] <kenThomson2> alecjw: i want to do it for a home (ext3)
[05:19] <RadiantFire> dfcarney: I think you are confused, I believe that the ext3 indexing information is unique fromt he partition table
[05:19] <kenThomson2> RadiantFire: scary thought
[05:19] <three> Hi everyone
[05:19] <RadiantFire> a filesystem has no knowledge of other filesystems
[05:19] <tjbarn1983> Hi, I am a new Ubuntu user.  There are a couple of applications I have installed using Wine, but for the life of me I can't find where the installed files are.  Where would I find the files it installed at "C:\{path to files}"?
[05:20] <alecjw> kenThomson2: howe much space have you usedo nit and how much free space is there before it?
[05:20] <dfcarney> kenThomson2: you *could* move the data around in a few steps, however.  i.e. make a small ext3 partition, copy the data there, erase the NTFS (and convert it to an ext3), move the data over to the new ext3 partition, then extend that one
[05:20] <andresmujica> tjbarn the apps are in your home folder  .wine dir
[05:20] <kenThomson2> RadiantFire: Are you 100% sure, that i can extend, a partition (ext3) from front?
[05:20] <RadiantFire> kenThomson2: no
[05:20] <andresmujica> it' s hide.
[05:20] <deema> tjbam
[05:20] <alecjw> tjbarn1983: its in ~/.wine/drive_c for your c: drive
[05:20] <dfcarney> RadiantFire: i could very well be confused.  i don't know much about the actual implementation details of ext3
[05:20] <deema> ya
[05:20] <deema> it's hidden
[05:20] <RadiantFire> kenThomson2: however, why not just reformat the empty space and mount it somewhere in your filesystem
[05:20] <kenThomson2> dfcarney: sounds a workable idea
[05:20] <deema> or you can press CTRL + H and see it
[05:21] <three> I tried to install kubuntu desktop and all of the files installed except libavahi-compact-libnssd1 is this really important
[05:21] <RadiantFire> kenThomson2: that way you get access to it, without worrying about partition moves
[05:21] <kenThomson2> RadiantFire: i have got a way more complex problem...
[05:22] <PagingMrHerman> ok what the heck is this?
[05:22] <LjL> PagingMrHerman: technical difficulties, as the topic said - everything's fine now
[05:23] <tjbarn1983> And one more hopefully simple question.  I installed Mono, thinking it was .NET equivalent for Linux-type OS's.  I only have one app I want to run that was on Windows that requires .NET.  How would I get it to recognize Mono as .NET?
[05:23] <Maurox>  i ve have a problem on dell poweredge 1750, it seems to have a problem writing on the disk, at first i saw that some mpt modules were missing so i added, works fine for a week but now the machine turn off, any suggestions ?????
[05:24] <dthacker> Maurox: Boot from live CD, run fsck on filesystems
[05:24] <dfcarney> Maurox: what does the output of 'dmesg' say?  are there any errors?
=== DrPepperKid is now known as MacSlow
[05:24] <kenThomson2> dfcarney: RadiantFire: You see in my HDD, first i have NTFS 16GB partition, than rest 10GB IS EXT3 (empty partition). My NTFS PARTITION is full, that means 16gb of data needs to be copied to the 10GB ext3, which is not possible. What is likely is: I can copy 10GB from NTFS TO EXT3. Than i can resize NTFS (make it smaller), create a new small EXT3. than i can copy the left over 6GB of NTFS data to the new EXT3. after that i can destroy the NTFS
[05:24] <kenThomson2> completely and create a third EXT3 in that place. Now i need some way to merge all THREE EXT3 partitions as one EXT3 partition, for a single /home
[05:24] <kenThomson2> THat is the question
[05:24] <Maurox> firts error was scb2_flash: failed to probe
[05:24] <Maurox> so i blocked the module
[05:25] <Heligoland> tjbarn1983 - try dotGNU
[05:25] <Maurox> then says mpt_config: error on irq0
[05:25] <alecjw> kenThomson2: do you have more space before the partition thatn you've used inside the partition?
[05:25] <sethk> kenThomson2, it can be done and the odds are that it will even work, but it's risky and there are better ways to do it.
[05:25] <dfcarney> kenThomson2: ugh.  i still say that you borrow or buy a second drive and back things up that way.  it sounds too risky otherwise.
[05:25] <kenThomson2> alecjw: i cant get your question
[05:25] <sethk> kenThomson2, is you have the space, just back up the partition, delete it, create a new partition of the desired size (deleting others if necessary) and copy the data back
=== Heligoland is now known as Heligol[A] nd
[05:26] <janvoigt> hi @ all
[05:26] <sethk> kenThomson2, I agree with dfcarney about the risk
[05:26] <janvoigt> i need a sourcelist for ubuntu edgy
[05:26] <alecjw> kenThomson2: how much space have you used up on the partition and how much space is there before it?
[05:26] <sethk> this also emphasizes what I'm always saying; don't have a separate /home partition.  use one big partition
[05:26] <Maurox> so hwen i added the mpt missing  mpt_config stop to having an error and sbc2flash was blocked so dmseg says no eeror :S
[05:27] <sethk> kenThomson2, if nothing else, make sure /home is backed up before you try whatever it is you are going to try.

[05:28] <higi> ive got an intel core 2 duo and am using the 32bits version. Is it worth it to use the 64bits ubuntu?
[05:28] <sethk> alecjw, if you mean someone connected to your box, there are ways to get at it using netstat
[05:28] <alecjw> kenThomson3: a good grapgical parititoner is gprted, dunno bout a tutorial though
[05:28] <kenThomson3> alecjw: i can use gparted without tutorial LOL! :()
[05:29] <sethk> alecjw, start with   netstat -nap
[05:29] <higi> ive got an intel core 2 duo and am using the 32bits version. Is it worth it to use the 64bits ubuntu?
[05:29] <sethk> alecjw, as root, to get all the process names
[05:29] <sethk> higi, no
[05:29] <dfcarney> kenThomson3: none that i know of, but i'm sure that someone has written something like that.  i suggest just poking around on google.
[05:29] <alecjw> sethk:  and that will return the ip address of the computer on a network?
[05:29] <kenThomson3> Can gparted merge three ext3 partitions for me
[05:29] <sethk> higi, the difference is tiny.
[05:29] <dfcarney> sethk: good point.
[05:29] <higi> ahm ok then ill stay in the 32-bit version
[05:29] <sethk> alecjw, yes, of all connections to your box.
[05:29] <higi> thank you
[05:29] <easytiger> higi, i agree with sethk
[05:29] <kenThomson3> or is that out of scope of gparted and i need something more complex?
[05:30] <Maurox> dfcarney so when i blocked scb2_flash module and add mpt missing files sbc2_flash dmseg shows no error :S
[05:30] <Almindor> hello
[05:30] <Almindor> sometimes when I choose ubuntu (edgy) from grub it won't boot
[05:30] <dfcarney> Maurox: what do you mean when you say you 'blocked' the module?
[05:30] <Almindor> I get "starting up", the disk led is lit for a moment and nothing
[05:30] <Maurox> i add it to blacklist
[05:30] <Almindor> seems pretty random
[05:30] <sethk> Almindor, how often?
[05:31] <alecjw> sethk: i dont want ot know the connection to the box, but the connections from the box
[05:31] <Almindor> once per 5 resets or so
[05:31] <sethk> Almindor, hm...
[05:31] <Almindor> no other info
[05:31] <alecjw> sethk: ie its address on the network
[05:31] <higi> but ive got Hyperthreading disabled, is that normal?
[05:31] <Almindor> no errors
[05:31] <sethk> alecjw, it will tell you both
[05:31] <Maurox> dfcarney i add it to blacklist
[05:31] <bunnythebunny> Hey everyone
[05:31] <alecjw> dthacker: i think i'm getting somewhere now. thanks anyway
[05:31] <sethk> alecjw, do this:    netstat -nap | egrep '^tcp"
[05:31] <Almindor> is there a way to boot with more verbose info?
[05:31] <sethk> alecjw, that will get rid of most of the irrelevant stuff
[05:31] <dfcarney> Maurox: i'm not sure exactly what the problem could be, but spontaneous crashes are often the result of the following: bad RAM, corrupt filesystems, APIC errors, SMP issues
[05:31] <higi> sethk, easytiger is it normal that i have hyperthreading disabled?
[05:32] <bunnythebunny> Could anyone tell me why when i use "speaker-test" only the front left speaker makes sound?
[05:32] <dthacker> np
[05:32] <emil_p8> Need help with my microphone capture which disappeared when upgrading to edgy, SBlaster Live! 24bit onboard. Somebody with the same problem?
[05:32] <sethk> higi, I enable it on hardware where it exists.
[05:32] <kenThomson3> anyways guys, thank you for your help, good night!
[05:32] <higi> it exists on my cpu
[05:32] <Pupeno> Can a luks encrypted reiserfs filesystem be resized ?
[05:32] <higi> how do I enable it?
[05:32] <sethk> higi, sure, enable it, although I see very very slight improvement
[05:32] <alecjw> sethk: thanks. got it :)
[05:32] <higi> how can i enable it?
[05:32] <bunnythebunny> dfcarney: and crap power supplies
[05:32] <easytiger> higi, bios?
[05:33] <Maurox> dfcarney mmmmmmmmmm maybe that could be or maybe that machine is broken cause before some others machine were runing with Centos and havent this problem :S
[05:33] <higi> oh ok
[05:33] <higi> thanks
[05:33] <sethk> higi, the kernel should be built in such a way that it is enabled automatically.
[05:33] <dfcarney> bunnythebunny: good point
[05:33] <bunnythebunny> :)
[05:34] <dfcarney> Maurox: maybe.  if i were you, i'd start with a memtest, then an fsck.  as bunnythebunny pointed out, you may also want to check your power supply (the BIOS should have some status screen that displays the voltages being output)

[05:34] <Wolf-h26> hehe I can't wait
[05:34] <Maurox> dfcarney okay i thougt thje same to but i wanted an  opinion cause i thougth that was the SCSI HD
[05:35] <Maurox> damn my english..
[05:35] <dfcarney> Maurox: well, it could very well be some driver issue in Ubuntu that's causing problems. you just need to eliminate possible sources of problems to narrow things down.
[05:35] <Maurox> dfcarney okay thnx for your time :)
[05:36] <dfcarney> Maurox: no problem.
[05:36] <dfcarney> Maurox: and good luck :)

[05:39] <HL-Onwlyix> Hello
[05:39] <Led_Zeppelin> jrib: well, I am running Ubuntu edgy. and no flash stuff works
[05:40] <Pupeno> Would LVM help me not having to decide an exact size for the /home and / partitions being able to resize them latter ?
[05:40] <HL-Onwlyix> For some reason when I downloaded the Ubuntu alternate install, it came out as a fine
[05:40] <HL-Onwlyix> file
[05:40] <dthacker> Led_Zeppelin: Have you visited those links that jrib just sent you?
[05:40] <HL-Onwlyix> not a .iso
[05:40] <jrib> Led_Zeppelin: right, those links should tell you about using gnash or point you to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava

[05:40] <Clin1> Who here runs apache
[05:40] <HL-Onwlyix> it's not an anything
[05:40] <HL-Onwlyix> and it won't burn
[05:40] <nothlit> Led_Zeppelin, apparently to run the flash binary I read something about running firefox or w/e browser you use and all its libs/dependencies in 32bit mode
[05:40] <Zarephath> Led_Zeppelin, : Read all of it...I just setup my laptop following the information contained and even can view youtube videos..without flash issues...sooooo...something you missed probably
[05:40] <HL-Onwlyix> because it's just "file"
[05:40] <alecjw> HL-Onwlyix: is this in windoze?
[05:41] <HL-Onwlyix> yeah
[05:41] <HL-Onwlyix> nevermind
[05:41] <HL-Onwlyix> it wouldn';t let me rename it
[05:41] <Zarephath> That would make a diff if it is 64bit for sure..is is Led_Zeppelin ?
[05:41] <HL-Onwlyix> but I closed bittorrent and it did
[05:41] <Zarephath> *it*
[05:41] <shiar> i have ubuntu 5.10 and want to upgrade, but dist-upgrade isn't doing anything! does anyone know why?
[05:41] <Led_Zeppelin> Zarephath: its 64bit..yes
[05:41] <alecjw> HL-Onwlyix: did the download finish?
[05:42] <HL-Onwlyix> Yeah
[05:42] <Clin1> Does anyone here run Apache?
[05:42] <HL-Onwlyix> I fixed it, nevermind
[05:42] <dfcarney> shiar: did you edit your /etc/apt/sources.list?
[05:42] <Maurox> shiar: you need to change your source.list
[05:42] <Zarephath> Led_Zeppelin, : Sorry didn't catch that bit...I haven't setup on 64bit so I could be talkin out of my arse... ;-O
[05:42] <alecjw> HL-Onwlyix: that's strange. it should come with the .iso extention
[05:42] <shiar> change to what?
[05:42] <emilia> hello
[05:42] <HL-Onwlyix> I had to close bittorrent to rename it ti an .iso, but it is now
[05:42] <Maurox> shiar to the new sources for your update
[05:42] <alecjw> HL-Onwlyix: so was it seeding then?
[05:42] <emilia> does anyone know how to make it stop showing my cd icon on the desktop when i put in a cd? and have it only show in places?

[05:55] <HL-Onwlyix> Vefificating the CD takes longer than burning it
[05:55] <barryd> it wouldnt make a differnce, but there has to be a flag to run an app, and to sepcify where the x server is
[05:55] <HL-Onwlyix> Verifying*
[05:55] <roryy> ulga: you could try 'DISPLAY=localhost:10.0 xterm'; you may need to play with xhost settings (it's been a while since I've done this sort of thing)
[05:55] <barryd> because everything on linux is child/parent based
[05:55] <cubny> mc44: is it safe? because i heard it's not
[05:55] <mc44> cubny: it is "experimental"

[06:30] <dthacker> eduhat: If you have the equipment to install it on, and you are not going to trash anything else, then there should be no problem installing a Live CD to a HDD.  It may overwrite anything you already have on your hard drive, so don't do it unless you can afford to lose whatever is on the machine.  Does that answer your question?

[06:33] <HL-Onwlyix> I burned the alternate install and verified it
[06:33] <Clin1> well shoot can anyone else help me
[06:33] <alecjw> unearth: sudo aptitude install build-essential linux-headers-2.6.17-10 linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic
[06:33] <HL-Onwlyix> now I'm gonna try and boot.....
[06:33] <HL-Onwlyix> bbl
[06:33] <VigoFusion> Since the ATI chipset 200 doesnt seem to be stable or supported, yet, can  I toss in an old ATI Radeon PCI card and may fanagle it? (I still wanna figure the problem out but cannot see my screen well)
[06:33] <pradeep> wd, you have all the 64 bit codecs on breezy?
[06:33] <wd> pradeep, seem faster with this amd 64, it' crunching the 32 bit lol
[06:33] <kitche> attah: the permission for home is 755
[06:33] <unearth> alecjw ill give that a try now
[06:33] <alecjw> unearth: and, assuming that your wireless card is a pci one, download these: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rt2400/rt2500-1.1.0-b4.tar.gz?download
[06:33] <ashika> its also named xorg-dev
[06:33] <Crankymonky> Has anyone ever had Evolution say you have more unread messages than you actually have?  For example, it says I have 3 unread messages in my Inbox, but I see only 1
[06:33] <ashika> And rorry if some applications say they are designed for KDE will they still run on GNOME?
[06:33] <roryy> ashika: ah, i see it there too. Install that and try again
[06:33] <anton__> okay: usbmodules --device /proc/bus/usb/001/003
[06:33] <agent> LjL: ill just "cheat" and use ar from the connected computer :P - thats the only thing that i have, a bootable cd (without dpkg or ar - hah!) and this computer connected to it
[06:33] <roryy> ashika: indeed.  You will need the kde libraries, though
[06:34] <modified54> i installed edgy on a dell inspiron 300m. just got it off ebay with no os installed so im not completely sure what kind of wifi card is on it, but i need to get it working.   where do i start?
[06:34] <LjL> ashika: yes, they'll just install the bunch of KDE libraries
[06:34] <ashika> Like the KDE task manager for example.
[06:34] <wd> pradeep, no. i'm just using i386 breezy, didn't think i should chance 64 since bad experience with dapper and edgy.
[06:34] <ashika> So if I have the libaries it will function perfectly?
[06:34] <attah> kitche; well the system says that it should be 644, but anyway.. how do i change it, b/c it keeps changing back
[06:34] <kitche> attah: to make it permanment you will do sudo chmod 755 /home/<user>
[06:34] <deema> anton__ nothing
[06:34] <CoOlGhOsT> I have a wierd problem... When I use the 'Logout' function in Gnome my X goes crazy.. GDM is now a blank screen and switching to a console gives me mumbo-jumbo... Any ideas???
[06:34] <attah> kitche thx :)
[06:34] <kitche> attah: I just checked on mine and it seems to be 755 even changed the permissions to check
[06:34] <pradeep> wd, hopefully it will be fully supported
[06:34] <anton__> that's the problem :) you haven't got a driver installed :)
[06:34] <wd> pradeep, which one?
[06:34] <ashika> so package name kdelibs correct?
[06:34] <deema> so how
[06:34] <roryy> ashika: they should
[06:35] <roryy> ashika: if you want to *compile* for KDE, you will need to install extra -dev packages
[06:35] <pradeep> wd, i mean the 64 bit
[06:35] <Clin1> gosh dern we got some bad connectons
[06:35] <alecjw> uh-oh. another netsplit
[06:35] <ashika> but to run I just need kdelivs
[06:35] <dthacker> whee
[06:35] <LjL> ashika, you don't have to worry - KDE dependencies will just be installed automatically when you install the packages
[06:35] <wd> pradeep, what r u using?
[06:35] <deema> anton__
[06:35] <ashika> And out of curiosity why did you put compile in *'s
[06:35] <unearth> alecjw this is my first install of ubuntu what is the default root password
[06:35] <deema> anton__ you there
[06:35] <LjL> !root | unearth
[06:35] <ubotu> unearth: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:35] <kaur> i compiled a kernel and now i need to create a new initramfs for that i guess. How can I do this?
[06:36] <kitche> kaur: did you make a lot of modules?
[06:36] <kaur> kitche: yes
[06:36] <pradeep> wd, same old intel i386 :)
[06:36] <alecjw> unearth: same as the password you use to login
[06:36] <pradeep> wd, OS edgy
[06:36] <anton__> one second, i'll be back soon...
[06:36] <ashika> Oh I have a question do
[06:36] <kitche> !mkinitrd|kaur
[06:36] <eduhat> where is that alternate cd?
[06:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mkinitrd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:37] <finalbeta> unearth, ubuntu has a random root password (= root account disabled), you need to use sudo to get the root rights for your user.
[06:37] <ashika> do I need to use su even when im using the account I installed linux with?
[06:37] <LjL> ashika: sudo not su
[06:37] <kitche> kaur: they the mkintrd command see if that will work
[06:37] <wd> pradeep, no way, edgy i386? is it stable? because i would like to run edgy, but the 64bit scared me off, breezy just seems to work lol
[06:37] <ashika> su logs into root though.
[06:37] <LjL> finalbeta: there's no random password afaik, it's just locked
[06:37] <ashika> And does the account I installed ubuntu with already have root privelages?
[06:37] <unearth> alecjw it says Couldnt find any package whose name or description matched "build-essential" No packages will be installed
[06:38] <LjL> ashika: no, but it's got sudo rights
[06:38] <pradeep> wd, yes it's very nice :) everything on 32 bit is :P
[06:38] <kaur> kitche: command not found
[06:38] <kitche> ashika: sudo gives your user root power
[06:38] <LjL> ashika: and when using sudo you effectively are root
[06:38] <sunganes> hi i installed ubuntu server (drapper drake version with LAMP Server) this morning, I now have the shell prompt. I would like to install a gnome desktop env. How do i do this?
[06:38] <ashika> So I only need to use sudo once?
[06:38] <finalbeta> LjL, ah, did that change? because a vuln once was that the installer put the random password in the install logs.
[06:38] <Clin1> Mez, please stop and obide by the IRc rules
[06:38] <attah> kitche; does this make all contained files 755 too?
[06:38] <kitche> sunganes: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[06:38] <wd> pradeep, darn it i'm tired of swiiching back and forth......\
[06:38] <LjL> ashika: no, you need to do it every time you want to run something as root
[06:38] <sunganes> thx
[06:38] <alecjw> unearth: put the ubuntu cdrom in then do sudo apt-cdrom add, then do the command again
[06:38] <LjL> Clin1: ?
[06:39] <pradeep> wd, :P
[06:39] <ashika> Isn't there a way to keep root permissions permanently?
[06:39] <Clin1> Hes anoying me
[06:39] <kaur> kitche: the command is update- initramfs -u maybe
[06:39] <LjL> ashika: yes, "sudo -i"
[06:39] <agent> LjL: thank you for your help and suggestions
=== whyso is now known as rc-1
[06:39] <alecjw> ashika: that's very insecure. i don't recommend it
[06:39] <LjL> ashika: keeps you root until you type "exit"
[06:39] <kaur> kitche: but it only recognizes the old kernel
[06:39] <ashika> Yes thanks alecjw I was just thinking that to myself.
[06:39] <kitche> attah: directories should be 755 everything else should have different permissions
[06:39] <jamesrose> How do I enable the Windows Super Key ?
[06:39] <Clin1> Can i ignore him without getting baned
[06:39] <jamesrose> :s
[06:39] <Clin1> ...
[06:39] <effie_jayx> quick question
[06:39] <roryy> Clin1: try /ignore Mez!*@*
[06:39] <effie_jayx> I installed bery la nd xgl on my ati card
[06:39] <ashika> So to run as root I just add sudo before the command correct?
[06:40] <effie_jayx> it runs great
[06:40] <wd> pradeep, well, what did u do for all of ur codecs?
[06:40] <effie_jayx> but after I log out of the xgl session I get no
[06:40] <effie_jayx> gdm screen
[06:40] <alecjw> ashika: or fo graphical commands, gksudo
[06:40] <LjL> ashika: yes
[06:40] <LordMetroid> Why did I need to be identified?
[06:40] <Harti> hi
[06:40] <Clin1> god i hop i dont get banned for that
[06:40] <alecjw> ashika: or if you're using kde, kdesu for grpahical commands
[06:40] <attah> kitche ok.. i'll make the file complained about 644 since thats what it said..
[06:40] <kitche> kaur: hmm maybe that's it but I m sure it's mkinitrd mayeb you don't have it installed?
[06:40] <Clin1> God*
[06:41] <effie_jayx> so I use beryl play with it... come of of the session
[06:41] <effie_jayx> and I get no gdm screen
[06:41] <unearth> alecjw i recieve the same error
[06:41] <ashika> Im using gnome because I though I could launch it into pure bash mode. Like totally console.
[06:41] <Clin1> Lij isnt it a IRC rule not to be obnoxios?
[06:41] <ashika> Is that possible?
[06:41] <roryy> Clin1: if you don't offend anyone, you shouldn't have any problems
[06:41] <ashika> Without having to use terminal

[06:41] <Clin1> thaats why he did it...... oh well hes ignored
[06:41] <wd> pradeep, what method did u install all the codecs?
[06:41] <alecjw> unearth: that's very strange. are you sure you spelt it right? (i'm not sure that i did :s)
[06:42] <dthacker> hesperia: I'm not sure that's possible....
[06:42] <deema> ashika, I don't think that has anything to do with gnome
[06:42] <pradeep> wd, manual, most of it is in the repos
[06:42] <ashika> Is it possible though to launch ubuntu in pure console.
[06:42] <deema> ya
[06:42] <Harti> i see no [OK]  at the boot (only fscheck) in edgy. how can i change this to see it like dapper?
[06:42] <alecjw> hesperia: i assume that you'd only want this to happen while you're watching a video or somethihng. most video players do that.
[06:42] <Clin1> I GOT TO LEAVE OR IM GOING TO GO INSAIN
[06:42] <roryy> ashika: disable the gdm service
[06:42] <ashika> Thankyou
[06:43] <anton__> what i tend to do ashika as soon as i get ubuntu is enter in the console sudo password
[06:43] <ashika> Compiling worked.
[06:43] <deema> couldn't you just to a different runlevel
[06:43] <hesperia> alecjw: i want it also when i read pdf documents or in firefox etc....
[06:43] <wd> pradeep, i tried that a while ago, and certain mpg, w32 didn't play. so thats why i'm thinking about using easyubuntu.

[06:55] <roryy> unearth: that is, 'grep ^cdrom /etc/apt/sources.list'/
[06:55] <roryy> aargh
[06:55] <kaptengu> roryy: super is compose key?
[06:55] <deema> same way you joined this channel
[06:55] <roryy> unearth: that is, 'grep ^cdrom /etc/apt/sources.list'
[06:55] <xXaNaXx> my "monitor" on my ubuntu system is my 27" LCD TV, with a native res of 1280x720.  i just finished installing ubuntu 6.10, and after it was done and it rebooted, it keeps trying to go to 1280x1024, and i can't figure out a way to change it to 1280x720....it just hangs after the initial Ubuntu loading screen
[06:56] <ashika> So no one has the answer on how to boot ubuntu in console mode?
[06:56] <deema> maybe type /join #deema
[06:56] <kitche> diminthedam: hmm that's odd since there is libglib-2.0.0
[06:56] <kitche> ashika: someone anwsered you about it make sure gdm doesn't start on boot
[06:56] <pradeep> ashika, remove gdm from the runlevels
[06:56] <ashika> But isnt that permanent?
[06:56] <ashika> I mean if I open ubuntu and it loads gdm isn't there a way to exit it?
[06:56] <roryy> kaptengu: hrm there are a few options under 'Alt/Win key behaviour', nothing mentioning 'Super' though
[06:57] <deema> ashika ya
[06:57] <roryy> kaptengu: oh. hmm, i see, that's not much help
[06:57] <kitche> ashika: yes alt-ctrl-f2 will take you to the console then do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[06:57] <pradeep> ashika, 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop' is temporary
[06:57] <deema> anton__ ??????????
[06:57] <roryy> kaptengu: sorry, i thought there were more options available there
[06:57] <diminthedam> kitche: i found libglib 1.2 and 2.0 removing 1.2 shows that i must uninstall MANY other programs too. Is this safe to do?
[06:58] <kitche> ashika: if you want it permant you just have to chmod -x /etc/init.d/gdm
[06:58] <unearth> alecjw roryy, it took the command and nothing happened
[06:58] <VigoFusion> I am gonna try the ATI site for Linux binary, cant hurt to make an attempt.
[06:58] <kaptengu> roryy: thanks anyway
[06:58] <VigoFusion> I Thank you all
[06:58] <HL-Onwlyix> My computer refuses to boot from a CD
[06:58] <HL-Onwlyix> I don't know if it's just Ubuntu it won't boot from
[06:58] <alecjw> unearth roryy: the cd isn't in sources.list, but i don't know why....
[06:58] <anton__> oh, this software is starting to annoy me...
[06:58] <kitche> diminthedam: yeah it shoudl be ok then you can just reinstall glib-2.0 and it should pull the other packages back in
[06:58] <HL-Onwlyix> or the CD driv ealtogether
[06:58] <eleki1> hi all
[06:59] <HL-Onwlyix> because I don't have anything to test it with
[06:59] <deema> HL it's probably BIOS settings
[06:59] <roryy> unearth: OK, we need to add the CD to sources.list.  I think we need to make sure the ubuntu cd is in the 'first' cd drive
[06:59] <deema> you must tell it to check CDROM to boot BEFORE checking Harddrive
[06:59] <roryy> unearth: do you have the CD in at the moment ?
[06:59] <eleki1> I have a little prob with my notification area gaim azureus and other don't wanna go on
[06:59] <unearth> alecjw roryy, yes
[06:59] <eleki1> in fact, the only one who one is kamarok
[06:59] <roryy> unearth: ok, run 'mount |grep cd' -- what do you see (hopefully only one line)
[06:59] <anton__> sorry, deema. i'm back. i'll try to use gaim, cos if this is a problem with the client i'm using atm, i may as well use another one..

[07:00] <HL-Onwlyix> I've tried everything
[07:00] <eleki1> and if I click on the quit button, on on minimize button, he simply close the application
[07:00] <ashika> Thanks guys
[07:00] <anton__> okay, i think it worked, deema :)
[07:00] <deema> you need to have it check CDROM BEFORE checking the Harddrive
[07:01] <ashika> You guys are good here.
[07:01] <HL-Onwlyix> I've set it to boot from the CD drive first
[07:01] <HL-Onwlyix> I even disables the harddrive boot
[07:01] <deema> anton__ nope ..
[07:01] <ashika> Should've come here before the 3 irc channels that didnt do anything

[07:03] <HL-Onwlyix> I havent been able to test that yet
[07:03] <roryy> unearth: sounds good
[07:03] <mjelva> any of you have any experience setting up xosd? i'm keeping it simple at the moment, trying to run some of the example programs. however, i get an error saying "Could not create "osd"". looking at the code, "osd" is an alias for xosd_create ("osd = xosd_create (2);"). according to the manpage of xosd_create, it's the function that creates the osd window in the first place. so supposedly, it failing (as it does), would preclude the ...
[07:03] <HL-Onwlyix> deema, what do you mean wrong CD?
[07:03] <mjelva> ... program from working at all. any ideas how to fix?
[07:03] <jmx> Hey.
[07:03] <deema> I didn't say "wrong cd" I said you BURNED it wrong
[07:03] <roryy> unearth: if i remember correctly, it tells you what the cd is (should have the word 'Ubuntu' in the name somewhere)
[07:03] <deema> does it boot on other computers?
[07:04] <HL-Onwlyix> Hmm

[07:04] <unearth> rorry "Found label 'Ubuntu 6.10_Edgy Eft_ - release i386"

[07:05] <xXaNaXx> how do i set Ubuntu to boot up in 1280x720 resolution instead of 1280x1024?
[07:05] <roryy> unearth: ok, once that's done, try the aptitude install command again
[07:05] <unearth> rorry "Cant check signiture: timestamp conflict"
[07:05] <roryy> unearth: hrm
[07:05] <roryy> unearth: that's not so good
[07:05] <ashika> xXanaXx cant you do it from grub and select boot options and put in the command.
[07:05] <deema> so you used the ISO as an image, not as a file?
[07:05] <jmx> wy dont u just change it now
[07:05] <unearth> rorry "gpgv: Cant check signiture: timestamp conflict"
[07:06] <roryy> unearth: if you run 'date', what do you get?
[07:06] <unearth> roryy " E: Sub process gpgv returnedc an error (3)"
[07:06] <HL-Onwlyix> Yes, I used it as an image
[07:06] <xXaNaXx> dunno...how would i go about that?
[07:06] <HL-Onwlyix> It runs from widnows
[07:06] <unearth> roryy " E: Sub process gpgv returnedc an error (2)"
[07:06] <HL-Onwlyix> I get the browser
[07:06] <roryy> unearth: OK, so apt-cdrom failed
[07:06] <HL-Onwlyix> the CD has all the folders
[07:06] <deema> hm
[07:06] <ashika> Oh can someone help me with how to set up a swap drive after installing ubuntu. I already have a partition available
[07:06] <deema> not sure then
[07:07] <xXaNaXx> ashika: how would i go about doing that?
[07:07] <roryy> unearth: please run 'date' and tell me what it says
[07:08] <deema> HL-Onwlyix: I'm getting tons of errors trying to verify this CD!!
[07:08] <alecjw> roryy, unearth: couldn't unearth add the cd manually?
[07:08] <deema> what was that about
[07:08] <alecjw> by adding a line source.lsit
[07:08] <ashika> I dont know the exact command but when you go to grub press c over ubuntu.
[07:08] <HL-Onwlyix> Deema, I redid the CD at a lower speed and it verified
[07:08] <roryy> alecjw: no, you need to use apt-cdrom.  It does more magic than just putting the lin in sources.list
[07:08] <jmx> umm go to system-preferences-screen resoulution
[07:08] <ashika> it will bring you there
[07:08] <ashika> and type help
[07:08] <deema> oh
[07:08] <unearth> roryy "Tue Feb 22 03:00:40 EST 2000"
[07:08] <alecjw> roryy: ok.
[07:09] <HL-Onwlyix> I just burned the first one at too high a speed
[07:09] <Nuked> Hello. I am using edgt, and I tried to copy some files onto my 1gb thumb drive, and now edgy doesn't recognize it, and windows refuses to recognize it. What can I do?
[07:09] <roryy> unearth: ok, we need to set your system clock
[07:09] <ashika> xXaNaXx: type c in grub and type help in the command line it will give you a list of things one of the m is resolution.
[07:09] <roryy> unearth: this can do funny things, like case the screensaver to switch on
[07:09] <alecjw> unearth: your clock's 6 years out.
[07:09] <jamesrose> How can i boot the ubuntu live cd in qemu?
[07:09] <deema> well it's probably these things: you burned it wrong, bad CD, the BIOS settings are wrong, bad CD drive
[07:09] <deema> probably
[07:09] <deema> or download is corrupted
[07:09] <HL-Onwlyix> I've tried two different install versions
[07:09] <HL-Onwlyix> 4 different CDs
[07:10] <ashika> xXaNaXx you there?
[07:10] <Nuked> can anyone help with my usb issue?
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> screwed with every BIOS setting I could find
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> so I guess it's a bad CD drive
[07:10] <jamesrose> How can i boot the ubuntu live cd in qemu?
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> well I mean
[07:10] <roryy> unearth: easiest way to fix this is to right-click on the clock (at top-left) and choose 'Adjust date/time'
[07:10] <deema> you should go find another comp to try then
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> everything wirks from Windows
[07:10] <deema> before doing anything else
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> Opening the CD with windows brings up the browser
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> all the folders are there
[07:10] <HL-Onwlyix> etc
[07:11] <deema> well yeah
[07:11] <jamesrose> How can i boot the ubuntu live cd in qemu?
[07:11] <HL-Onwlyix> k, I'll do that
[07:11] <deema> but that doesn't mean it will boot
[07:11] <eduhat> do you guys know of other distros that have built in package managers, something like debian, to where i issue a command and it build and installs the program?
[07:11] <jamesrose> anyone?
[07:11] <roryy> unearth: once you've corrected the date and time, rerun the apt-cdrom add command
[07:11] <emilia> anyone know if theres a .deb package for the citrix metaframe client for ubuntu? or should i alien the redhat rpm?
[07:11] <deema> so try another computer HL
[07:11] <unearth> alecjw roryy, i resett the time and did the apt cd-rom command and everything seems ok now, no errors
[07:11] <roryy> unearth: *yay*.  now run the apt-get command from before
[07:11] <alecjw> unearth: cool! now we can make your wireless card work! (hopefully)
[07:12] <ashika> rorry how do I set up a swap drive after installing ubuntu
[07:12] <unearth> alecjw roryy is this correct: sudo aptitude install build-essential linux-headers-2.6.17-10 linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic
[07:12] <eduhat> do you guys know of other distros that have built in package managers, something like debian, to where i issue a command and it build and installs the program????????
[07:12] <xXaNaXx> sorry, the computer is in the other room, so i gotta go in there to try stuff
[07:12] <ashika> Well the sitation is in Windows with partition magic I set up a linux swapdrive so do I have to do # mkswap /dev/hda5
[07:12] <jmx> Anyone wanna help mae change from 64 to 32?
[07:12] <ashika> or can I skip to # swapon /dev/hda2
[07:12] <alecjw> unearth: sudo aptitude isntall build-essential linux-headers-generic
[07:12] <roryy> unearth: looks fine to me; I think alecjw can help you more with wireless stuff
[07:12] <looktj> what the command to restart mysqld?
[07:13] <patrixx> /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
[07:13] <patrixx> ;)
[07:13] <thranduilk> /etc/init.d/mysql restar
[07:13] <roryy> ashika: I *think* you can use /etc/fstab to enable swap
[07:13] <thranduilk> restart*
[07:13] <patrixx> :)
[07:13] <looktj> thanks
[07:13] <florent_> so good, my wireless card functions
[07:13] <unearth> roryy, thanks alot for all your help
[07:13] <roryy> unearth: np :)
[07:13] <ashika> Yeah I know but do I need ubuntu to format it if it is set by partition magic as a swap.
[07:14] <unearth> alecjw its going through its process
[07:14] <alecjw> Nuked: what does fdisk -l /dev/sda return
[07:14] <roryy> ashika: oh.  I'm not sure; you might as well run mkswap
[07:14] <rafaguap> Hi all! I can't get my usb memory key and my wireless card work together: it's an issue of which message I send to kernel at boot (acpi=force or not)... What to do???
[07:14] <unearth> alecjw its complete
[07:14] <ashika> In disk manager it identifies it as a swap partition and disables formatting and free space
[07:14] <jmx> Is it easy to change from 64bit to 32bit?
[07:14] <alecjw> unearth: cool
[07:14] <m0> is it easy to install java 1.6?
[07:14] <ashika> Because disk manager identifies it as a swap and disables free space and format so I was just wonderinf
[07:14] <roryy> ashika: hrm. sorry, not sure about that
[07:14] <florent_> m0 get automatix
[07:14] <ashika> Alright Ill just run it anywat.

[07:18] <eduhat> where can i get a ubuntu install guide?
[07:18] <mirak> I have troubles using auto-apt, it wants to installs useless things

[07:19] <ashika> eduhat: http://www.mrbass.org/linux/ubuntu/install/ it has pictures aswell
[07:19] <LjL> mirak: then just don't use auto-apt and install the stuff by hand instead
[07:20] <alecjw> unearth: yor're welcome. tell me if anyhting goes wrong. you need to sudo make all, not just make all like it says
[07:20] <eduhat> i really like ubuntu alot, its just that i need to configure it alot more.. is that possible in ubuntu, like add xterm, aterm, eterm, blah blah, add nessus, ethereal, dsniff, sniff, aircrack, sutff like that?
[07:20] <kaptengu> how can I press down a key and see the name of that key?

[07:22] <LjL> mirak, make?! no, you should use auto-apt with configure generally, not with make
[07:22] <eduhat> is version 6.06 LTS old?
[07:22] <ashika> eduhat: you should know the guide I sent you is for 5.02, however the concepts are the same except the GUI is different.
[07:22] <LjL> eduhat: no
[07:22] <florent_> eduhat, no it's a stable version
[07:22] <eduhat> okay
[07:22] <ashika> eduhat: version 6.06 LTS is not old its the most stable build
[07:22] <alecjw> eduhat: yes, but it's an LTS so it's more stable and better supported
[07:22] <attah> which permissions should what files have within my home? anyone?
[07:22] <ashika> eduhat: 6.06 LTS = Long Term Support
[07:22] <mirak> LjL: mmm, well it's for vdr, the configure doesn't go through plugins
[07:22] <alecjw> eduhat: well, it's 6 months old
[07:22] <ashika> alecjw
[07:23] <ashika> How come when you speak like to me it shows up your name is gold/yellow
[07:23] <LjL> attah, it's totally up to you. configuration files should generally be writable and readable by youself though, at least
[07:23] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell attah about permissions
[07:23] <PingunZ> Can I disable klogd and sysklogd from boot ?
[07:23] <xXaNaXx> ashika: did you see my last message?
[07:23] <dv5237> ashika: you get a highlight when someone types your name like im doing right now :)
[07:23] <LjL> mirak, well, auto-apt is just going to fail miserably. just do it by hand
[07:23] <alecjw> ashika: that's called nick hilightting - it's so you can see when people are talking to you
[07:23] <ashika> Oh ok.
[07:23] <ashika> So when I do it the person sees that?
[07:24] <ashika> xXanaXx: no I did not.
[07:24] <lancee> hey folks
[07:24] <alecjw> ashika: yes. if someoine says your nick, it make their name yellow
[07:24] <lancee> anyone know where can I find hydra and hydra-gtk packages for ubuntu?
[07:24] <LjL> depending on the client of course.
[07:24] <dv5237> ashika: typ the first letter(s) of a nick and complete it whit tab before you start talking to hem/her this way he cant miss you message
[07:24] <rafaguap> No clue from anyone at all for that kernel acpi issue?? ;-(
[07:24] <xXaNaXx> ashika: i don't think it's even getting to grub...i boot the system, and it gets to the Ubuntu splash screen, my monitor shows a resolution of 1280x1024, then it just hangs
[07:24] <njal> Does anyone know why cedega might be locking my machine up?
[07:25] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Are you dual or single booting.
[07:25] <xXaNaXx> ashika: single
[07:25] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Then you dont have grub because it is not needed.
=== m0 is now known as `m0
[07:25] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Did you try editing xorg.conf
[07:26] <xXaNaXx> ashika: not sure how to go about doing that...i'm pretty noob to linux, although i know a few of the basic
[07:26] <alecjw> unearth: i have to go now. i expect i'll be back in half an hour. if you have any probs you can speak to me then.
[07:27] <mirak> LjL: I installed one useless package that he wanted, and seems to work as it should now
[07:27] <mirak> for make
[07:27] <`m0> hi how do I know where I installed jdk1.6
[07:27] <`m0> i don't see it in /opt
[07:28] <ashika>  xXaNaXx: One second please
[07:28] <xXaNaXx> ok
[07:28] <tat> `m0: try sudo updatedb, then locate jdk
[07:29] <`m0> tat: thankyou
[07:30] <fiddy> is there a freetype package with BCI enabled for edgy?
[07:30] <fiddy> save me from autohinter hell
[07:31] <PingunZ> when I launch services-admin I get the error that I'm not allowed to edit the system configuration
[07:31] <`m0> How do I uninstall a program if I installed it if its not in the synaptic
[07:31] <ArrenLex> m0: that depends on how you insatlled it.
[07:31] <ArrenLex> installed *
[07:31] <abo> PingunZ, did you try sudo services-admin?
[07:31] <`m0> I installed Netbeans 5.5-beta from sudo netbenas.bin
[07:32] <PingunZ> abo, yes
[07:32] <`m0> now i am installing netbeans 5.5 non beta
[07:32] <ArrenLex> m0: Does netbeans.bin offer an uninstall option?
[07:32] <ashika> xXaNaXx:  Are you there
[07:32] <Doow> I remember seeing a page about more advanced uses of apt, specifically including how to artificially holding back packages from upgrading. Can't seem to find i right now though, anyone got an idea?
[07:32] <`m0> ArrenLex: all I see is enterprise3       module_tracking.xml       _uninst
[07:32] <luminousnerd> What the hell...when I ty7p7e some 7's appear and backspace doesn't work right, sometimes brak[ckets a7ppear... |:([[[ seriously wtf
[07:32] <abo> PingunZ, no idea then ...
[07:32] <xXaNaXx> ashika: yes
[07:32] <`m0> ArrenLex: and other files
[07:32] <PingunZ> abo, services-admin stopped working when I accidently disabled dbus, now it doesn't start again
[07:33] <Doow> I think it was somewhat official, or on an official wiki of some sort =)
[07:33] <ArrenLex> Doow: It's called pinning. http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.
[07:33] <Doow> ArrenLex: thank you
[07:33] <ArrenLex> m): what do you see there?
[07:33] <ArrenLex> m0: ** where do you see those files? xD
[07:33] <`m0> i see a file called _uninst
[07:33] <ArrenLex> (Dunno how that happened)
[07:33] <ashika> can you try sudo pico/etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:33] <`m0> ArrenLex: in /opt/netbeans5.5-rc2/
[07:33] <ria>  ndiswrapper: changing interface name from 'wlan0' to 'wlan1'??????
[07:33] <ashika> xXaNaXx:  Sorry its sudo pico /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:34] <ArrenLex> m0: if you installed it in /opt, that means all you have to do is delete the /opt/netbeans5.5-rc2/ folder.
[07:34] <xXaNaXx> ashika: where do i do that from? i don't get to a command line or anything...can't get past the Ubuntu splash screen
[07:34] <ArrenLex> ashika: The editor is called nano. Welcome to 2006.
[07:34] <`m0> ArrenLex: how about all the shortcuts affilliated with it?
[07:34] <ashika> ArrenLex: ? I use pico
[07:34] <luminousnerd> fuckin' a...
[07:34] <nuts`> hey... anyone experienced with wpa-supplicant?
[07:34] <ashika> ArrenLex: Oh I get it
[07:34] <luminousnerd> my s[4[keyboard is seriously fucked up7 :(
[07:34] <ChaosFan> wg 49
[07:35] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Oh youre on windows?
[07:35] <Clin1> !Language
[07:35] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[07:35] <ArrenLex> ashika: No, you use nano. em@debian:~$ file `which pico`
[07:35] <ArrenLex> /usr/bin/pico: symbolic link to `/bin/nano'
[07:35] <attah> LjL unfortunately this only helps me a bit.. which permissions are the standard ones to be more specific b/c my computer is sereously crippled
[07:35] <Poser> I have a quick question about ubuntu packages if anyone has a momment?
[07:35] <luminousnerd> Okay fine...my keyboard is seriously fscked up7 that better?
[07:35] <luminousnerd> |:)
[07:35] <ashika> ArrenLex: Pardon? I just did sudo pico and it worked
[07:35] <xXaNaXx> ashika: on the machine i'm typing from, yes
[07:35] <dv5237> luminousnerd: System >> Preferences >> Keyboard  youll prolly need US layout
[07:35] <Doow> !ask | poser
[07:35] <ubotu> poser: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:35] <xXaNaXx> ashika: on the machine i've installed to, no
[07:35] <ArrenLex> ashika: Yes. But pico is a symlink to nano.
[07:35] <luminousnerd> Seriously though, is this a linux p7rob? I've got a US layout already but I'll give it another go
[07:35] <Poser> XD
[07:35] <Poser> Okay, so basically, this is it
[07:35] <atzar> is it possible to run macosx (macbook intel) applications on linux ?
[07:36] <Poser> I want to remove some packages, but Add/Remove won't lwet me.
[07:36] <ashika> ArrenLex: Yeah I just discovered that so using pico or nano wont really make a difference.
[07:36] <Poser> so, I go to Synaptic.
[07:36] <LjL> attah, no standard ones. they can be different for each file. you could try "chmod -R u+rw /home/youruser" to make everything readable and writable to you
[07:36] <Poser> I want to remove stuff like Ekiga, Evolution, etc.
[07:36] <`m0> ArrenLex: Ah, I found an uninstaller file in the /_uninst/ directory
[07:36] <Poser> but sometimes, it ays it's going to also remove the packed "Ubuntu Desktop" and I have no idea what that is. :(
[07:36] <attah> LjL thats the problem -R has made it screwy..
[07:37] <ArrenLex> Poser: ubuntu desktop is an empty package which depends on everything a standard ubuntu install has, so if you want to reinstall a standard ubuntu you only need to install one package. It can be safely removed.
[07:37] <ashika> xXaNaXx: when you open your ubuntu computer can you do ctrl alt f2
[07:37] <LjL> attah, -R just means the changes will be applied recursively (i.e. to all files inside the directory)
[07:37] <xXaNaXx> ashika: lemme try...brb
[07:37] <dv5237> luminousnerd: did it work?
[07:37] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Tell me if that boots a console
[07:37] <luminousnerd> no not at all
[07:37] <luminousnerd> :(
[07:38] <sysdoc> !xgl
[07:38] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - Help in #ubuntu-xgl - See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[07:38] <jvai> i tried to install aptoncd.. from sourceforge... but it didnt.. i was missing a python dependency
[07:38] <Poser> ArrenLex, So, I can uninstall things like Ekiga, and Evolution? Cool. But I also run into dependenciy issues. I don't need the openoffice database app, but it won't let me uninstall it unless I get rid of the whole suite. :(
[07:38] <attah> LjL that seems to be one problem..
[07:38] <eduhat> what is evolution?
[07:38] <Doow> Poser: if you want to make a dist-upgrade in the future it might be good to remember that package though or you may miss something interesting/important new stuff
[07:38] <highvoltage> eduhat: a mail client
[07:38] <eduhat> okay
[07:38] <attah> another seems to be that my entire home is not availabe to my user O.o
[07:38] <luminousnerd> damnsacebardoesntwork
[07:38] <jrib> eduhat: evolution (1)        - e-mail, calendar, addressbook, and to do list application
[07:38] <ArrenLex> Poser: This is probably because some other component of openoffice depends on -base.
[07:39] <Clin1> Can some one test my site and tell me if my admin area opens the imaage yet. I dont know if my browsers defective. The URL is: http://cmweb.zaapto.org
[07:39] <PingunZ> Can I stop the klogd and sysklogd service from booting up ?
[07:39] <wikityler> how do i find the model of my gfx card in software, so i don't have to get a flashlight and look on the card itself?
[07:39] <ArrenLex> Poser: I have the same problem with draw: I can't remove draw without removing impress.
[07:39] <ArrenLex> wikityler: lspci
[07:39] <wikityler> do that in terminal?
[07:39] <PingunZ> wikityler, yes
[07:39] <ArrenLex> wikityler: maybe lspci | Display will get you there faster.
[07:39] <Poser> Yeah.
[07:39] <ArrenLex> wikityler: you know any other place to type commands?
[07:40] <xXaNaXx> ashika: nothing...all it does is freeze the screen on the Ubuntu splash screen
[07:40] <PingunZ> xchat ?
[07:40] <wikityler> well maybe it was the name of a program
[07:40] <ashika> xXaNaXx: when at the splash does ctrl alt f2 work?
[07:40] <ArrenLex> wikityler: it is the name of a program! lspci.
[07:40] <grimboy> wikityler, It is. A command prompt program.
[07:40] <xXaNaXx> ashika: nope
[07:40] <Poser> ArrenLex, they need to work on the dependencies. Power users won't want to keep using ubuntu if they are forced to keep packages they don't want. The kind of "You need this even tho you never use it" is far too much a windows/mac ideaology and doesen't belong in Ubuntu. :(
[07:40] <xXaNaXx> ashika: just freezes the whole computer on the splash
[07:40] <Doow> wikityler: or System->Administration->Device Manager could include it
[07:40] <St_MPA3b> how can i delete program and itsw config in console?
[07:40] <ashika> xXaNaXx: When you press power on does it show you any prompt every or ask you press X for boot options.
[07:41] <clemyeats> are the ATI and Nvidia drivers in violation of the GPL ?
[07:41] <ArrenLex> Poser: nono. If some component of openoffice depends on -base, chances are it actually NEEDS -base to run.
[07:41] <St_MPA3b> does "apt-get remove" remove configs also?
[07:41] <ArrenLex> clemyeats: Yes. But you're violating the gpl, not them.
[07:41] <roryy> PingunZ: it looks like you can disable them -- they have entries in /etc/init.d  -- take a look at 'update-rc.d' for an easy way to do this.  I'm not sure it's a very good idea, fwiw ;)
[07:41] <clop> hi, i guess i am running alsa sound -- is there a way to manually say, "set the volume to 25%"?
[07:41] <xXaNaXx> ashika: lemme reboot and check...but i don't think so
[07:41] <ChaosFan> clemyeats: yes, as their is no source code available, binary only.
[07:41] <Poser> True.
[07:41] <ChaosFan> s/their/there/
[07:41] <clemyeats> ArrenLex: what do you mean ? the user links ?
[07:41] <St_MPA3b> how can i delete program and itsw config in console? does "apt-get remove" remove configs also?
[07:41] <St_MPA3b> how can i delete program and itsw config in console? does "apt-get remove" remove configs also?
[07:41] <grimboy> Poser, If you care that much about efficiency or tweaking use gentoo. That's not what ubuntu is aimed for
[07:41] <Doow> St_MPA3b: I think you have to do --purge or something to get rid of configs (not 100% sure)
[07:41] <PingunZ> roryy, why isn't it a good idea ?
[07:42] <Poser> ArrenLex, But why do I need to uninstall the -Base to get rid of a PART
[07:42] <jrib> St_MPA3b: add --purge
[07:42] <roryy> PingunZ: i think they are moderately important bits of the OS
[07:42] <St_MPA3b> <Doow><jrib> 
[07:42] <ArrenLex> clemyeats: Because you are compiling and installing a module, and not the companies, you are violating the GPL, not ati or nvidia.
[07:42] <St_MPA3b> <Doow><jrib> ty*
[07:42] <roryy> PingunZ: why d'you want to disable them?
[07:42] <PingunZ> St_MPA3b, sudo apt-get remove --purge yourprogram
[07:42] <Doow> St_MPA3b: =)
[07:42] <smallfoot-> I hope someone can add computer hardware manufacturers who are Linux/FOSS/competition/etc friendly or unfriendly to http://vendors.bluwiki.org/
[07:42] <akk> I must be blind: is there really no way to search for bugs (e.g. by keywords) in malone?
[07:42] <PingunZ> roryy, to speed up boot process :)
[07:42] <ArrenLex> Poser: Hold on, what are you trying to remove?
[07:42] <clemyeats> ArrenLex: that's smart....
[07:42] <Doow> St_MPA3b: and next time, don't spam your question
[07:42] <jrib> akk: there is
[07:42] <St_MPA3b> <Doow> ok, sry :(
[07:43] <clemyeats> ArrenLex: are they not already compiled though ?
[07:43] <ashika> What irc client are you guys using
[07:43] <PingunZ> xchat
[07:43] <ArrenLex> clemyeats: It's the same thing lame does =P by distributing only the source to an mp3 encoder, they can't be sued by the patent owners for distributing an mp3 encoder.
[07:43] <Elive_user25> xchat
[07:43] <Poser> ArrenLex, Stuff like Evolution Mail, Ekiga, OpenOffice Database.
[07:43] <grimboy> ashika, Xchat
[07:43] <Clin1> Can soome one test my site and tell me of errors.... cmweb.zapto.org
[07:43] <Doow> ashika: XChat when graphical, irrssi when textbased
[07:43] <attah> anyone.. how do i assign my home bact to my user??
[07:43] <akk> jrib: I'm at https://launchpad.net/malone and I don't see any way to search for bugs there, just products.
[07:43] <ArrenLex> Poser: and what happens when you type "apt-get remove openoffice.org-base"?
[07:43] <deema> anton__ ??
[07:44] <Doow> attah: bact?
[07:44] <ashika> Doow: if you single boot ubuntu whats the key to go into boot options
[07:44] <jrib> akk: one sec (phone)
[07:44] <attah> doow: back
[07:44] <clemyeats> ArrenLex: so in other words, the drivers are not violating the GPL, but as a user you can't use them unless you do so yourself...
[07:44] <Doow> ashika: no idea =)
[07:44] <ashika> :(
[07:44] <effie_jayx> that site is SLOWWWWWWWWWwwwwwwwwwww
[07:44] <Poser> ArrenLex,  I haven't tried that. I've been trying to do it all through Synaptic.
[07:44] <ashika> ArrenLex: Whats the key to enter boot options when single booting
[07:45] <Doow> attah: you need to edit /etc/passwd/ (unless there's some fancy graphical tool nowadays)
[07:45] <ashika> Doow: Do you single boot
[07:45] <ArrenLex> ashika: in grub? to edit the boot command? e
[07:45] <Doow> ashika: nope, I got winXP on this machine too
[07:45] <attah> help! my home is no longer owned nor accessable by user
[07:45] <ChaosFan> attah: ``sudo chown -R <your username here> /home/<your username here>/; sudo chmod -R u+rw /home/<your username here>''
[07:45] <ashika> ArrenLex: No grub the person is single booting. So grub isn't there
[07:46] <roryy> attah: does the directory still exist?
[07:46] <jvai> ok peeps i'm ghost.
[07:46] <roryy> attah: if so, what does 'ls -ld $HOME' say?
[07:46] <ashika> ArrenLex: Isn't it possible before the ubuntu splash to enter boot options?
[07:46] <attah> roryy yes
[07:46] <xXaNaXx> ashika: i was able to get into grub, and i have 3 options: Ubuntu, Kernel 2.6.17-10-generic | Ubuntu, Kernel 2.6.17-10-generic (recovery mode) | Ubuntu, memtest86+
[07:46] <ashika> ArrenLex: I mean to edit screen resolution before launching while single booting
[07:46] <Silivrenion> i have some questions for someone
[07:46] <ChaosFan> !ask | Silivrenion
[07:46] <ubotu> Silivrenion: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:46] <matjan> hi i follwed this guide to detect cpu temperature, but when i do 'sudo modprobe i2c-sensor' it says: FATAL: Module i2c_sensor not found. what could be the problem?
[07:46] <alecjw> unearth: did it go ok?
[07:46] <ArrenLex> ashika: oh. That's in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:47] <matjan> the guide is at: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_detect_CPU_temperature.2C_fan_speeds_and_voltages_.28lm-sensors.29
[07:47] <ashika> ArrenLex: I know but if it wont boot or go console you cant edit xD You can also change resolution at grub
[07:47] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Go to Ubuntu non recovery mode and type e
[07:47] <ArrenLex> ashika: have they tried going into recovery mode?
[07:47] <mikelo> which package do i need to lauch a kde app?
[07:48] <Doow> matjan: sounds like you're missing a module for your kernel
[07:48] <ashika> ArrenLex: The problem is resolution so I didn't think recovery would work
[07:48] <Doow> matjan: check out the command apt-file to find it
[07:48] <attah> is there anyway to recover a lost permission to homefolder from failsafe prompt?
[07:48] <ArrenLex> ashika: if you can boot into recovery mode, you can modify xorg.conf from there.
[07:48] <jyoungxx> can somebody tell me what group I could put this user into so they can upgrade without having to type in a password when there is an update available by the notification?
[07:49] <roryy> attah: what does 'ls -ld $HOME' say?  (still waiting...)
[07:49] <jyoungxx> i'm running Dapper 6.06
[07:49] <roryy> attah: oh, from failsafe
[07:49] <clemyeats> ArrenLex: is Ubuntu 7.04 planning to come with these drivers though ?
[07:49] <attah> roryy ok will check..
[07:49] <jrib> akk: you can search after you click on "bugs in ubuntu"  (assuming you want to search for a bug in ubunut?)
[07:49] <roryy> attah: $HOME will be incorrect in failsafe
[07:49] <roryy> attah: ls -ld /home/attah  (or whatever it is)
[07:50] <ashika> ArrenLex: And if recovery doesn't work? There should be a grub option
[07:50] <NSK> hi. I need a 64bit customisable and mature distro for a server to run latest versions of LAMP. How does Ubuntu 6.06 Server LTS compare with Debian3.1, Fedora6, Centos4.4, Suse10, and other distros? Why should I prefer Ubuntu over the others?
[07:50] <ArrenLex> clemyeats: backtrack. Actually, it's legal to have those drivers as modules, but not to compile them into the kernel, if I understand correctly.
[07:50] <attah> roryy more or less owned by root
[07:50] <roryy> attah: the fix is    chown -R attah:attah /home/attah
[07:50] <ArrenLex> ashika: if recovery doesn't work, they have bigger problems than resolution
[07:50] <roryy> attah: where 'attah' is your username
[07:50] <matjan> Doow, what should i try to find?
[07:50] <ashika> ArrenLex: I was right it is vga=<resolution>
[07:50] <matjan> the module?
[07:50] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Are you there
[07:50] <akk> jrb: Ah, sure enough! Thanks.
[07:50] <Doow> matjan: that missing file
[07:50] <kitche> NSK: comparing debian and ubunut won't do anythign since they are pretty much the same
[07:50] <ArrenLex> clemyeats: And, ubuntu already provides these modules, in the linux-restricted-modules package
[07:51] <clemyeats> ArrenLex: ok
[07:51] <NSK> right
[07:51] <jyoungxx> can somebody tell me what group I could put this user into so they can upgrade without having to type in a password when there is an update available by the notification?
[07:51] <jyoungxx> i'm running Dapper 6.06
[07:51] <Doow> matjan: it was in your error message
[07:51] <matjan> Doow, apt-file, command not found
[07:51] <NSK> how about a comparison between ubuntu and centos?
[07:51] <NSK> what are ubuntu's strengths over centos or rhel ?
[07:51] <jyoungxx> centos is too far behind with the updates in my opinion
[07:52] <jyoungxx> they use red hats packages but they are old
[07:52] <ArrenLex> NSK: Wow, those are really old distros.
[07:52] <attah> roryy ok.. well thart seemed to work.. how do i accure access to really use it then
[07:52] <ashika> ArrenLex: Recovery boots at what resolution? The default is 640
[07:52] <ArrenLex> ashika: recovery boots into the console.
[07:52] <xXaNaXx> ashika: i wasn't able to get anywhere when going to non-recovery mode, but when i went to recovery mode, i was able to get a root prompt
[07:52] <NSK> yeah I have noticed ubuntu is well-updated regularly and this is a good thing
[07:52] <ashika> ArrenLex: That is why the person cant boot ubuntu but now they're afk
[07:52] <kitche> NSK: there is many comparsions on the net between distros but centos is stable sorta like how debian is stable
[07:52] <roryy> attah: I don't understand "accure"
[07:52] <attah> roryy; *that
[07:52] <attah> roryy accuire?
[07:52] <ashika> xXaNaXx: You could have done it without recovery but anyway we can still do it
[07:52] <roryy> attah: ah, acquire
[07:53] <Doow> matjan: ouch
[07:53] <attah> roryy sry..
[07:53] <unearth> alecjw it did not
[07:53] <roryy> attah: you should be able to 'telinit 2' and login normally now
[07:53] <Doow> matjan: I thought that came automatically
[07:53] <matjan> ahh..
[07:53] <ashika> xXaNaXx: You could have done it without recovery but anyway we can still do it
[07:53] <ashika> xXaNaXx: type sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:53] <ArrenLex> kitche: ubuntu dapper LTS is stable sorta like how ^B^B^B^B^B^B exactly like how debian is stable.
[07:53] <matjan> Doow, lemme check the repos
[07:53] <Stephenishere> what distro works the best with games in wine?
[07:53] <PF|Linux> Ok, Im installing an eggdrop
[07:53] <Stephenishere> gentoo?
[07:53] <grimboy> I'm having trouble with wireless. Before I installed network-manager and network-manager-gnome I could connect to wireless networks. Now I still get a list of them but connecting to them always fails (with no reason given). My /ect/network/interfaces looks like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32574/ and the output of iwconfig is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32575/. Has anyone got any pointers?
[07:53] <Poser> Anyone: Any tips on how to improve framrates in Beryl, on Edgy, with an ATi Radeon 9700 Pro? XGL was unstable but provided better frame rates. :(
[07:53] <unearth> alecjw there isnt a read me file only a FAQ which points me to a wesite
[07:53] <attah> roryy i'm pretty sure i don't have anny rights more than ownership yet..
[07:53] <kitche> ArrenLex: dapper is more up to date then debian 3.1 is
[07:53] <PF|Linux> oh dear christ there's too many people here >_>
[07:54] <alecjw> unearth:
[07:54] <ArrenLex> Stephenishere: the distro doesn't matter.
[07:54] <roryy> attah: what else do you need?
[07:54] <alecjw> :(
[07:54] <Doow> PF|Linux: so true =(
[07:54] <Poser>  Anyone: Any tips on how to improve framrates in Beryl, on Edgy, with an ATi Radeon 9700 Pro? XGL was unstable but provided better frame rates. :(
[07:54] <xXaNaXx> ashika: k, one sec
[07:54] <PF|Linux> I need help compiling an eggdrop
[07:54] <Stephenishere> sweet :) i like ubuntu's looks
[07:54] <ArrenLex> kitche: Yes it is, but only because they froze later. Once etch releases, debian stable will be more up to date than ubuntu LTS.
[07:54] <attah> roryy executing and changing and so on..
[07:54] <PF|Linux> anyone query me and help me?
[07:54] <ashika> ArrenLex: Are you like an official ubuntu person?
[07:54] <alecjw> unearth: sorry. i was looking at the rt2570 drivers, i assumed that they'd have a simmilar readme
[07:55] <ArrenLex> ashika: No? xD I don't even run ubuntu. I hate it.
[07:55] <unearth> alecjw im having a hard tome finding documentation on installation instructions for the 2500 drivers
[07:55] <Poser>  Anyone: Any tips on how to improve framrates in Beryl, on Edgy, with an ATi Radeon 9700 Pro? XGL was unstable but provided better frame rates. :(
[07:55] <kitche> ArrenLex: but stable to me is that the software is known to work,
[07:55] <ashika> ArrenLex: What distro are you using
[07:55] <xXaNaXx> ashika: ok, nano is up
[07:55] <ArrenLex> ashika: debian etch
[07:55] <roryy> attah:  'chmod -R u+rwX /home/attah'
[07:55] <ashika> xXaNaXx: search for kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-386 root=/dev/hda5 ro quiet splash

[07:55] <xXaNaXx> ashika: the page that came up is empty
[07:55] <ArrenLex> kitche: stable means that at some arbitrary point they said "no more upgrades to newer versions for any software" and just started applying bugfixes.
[07:56] <ashika> xXaNaXx: K plan b
[07:56] <kitche> ArrenLex: umm are you talking about the distro I m talking about the software in the distro
[07:56] <ashika> xXaNaXx: are you sure problem is resolution
[07:56] <netG> hi I have slow scrolling in Firefox2 if I enable compiz
[07:56] <alecjw> unearth: they're slightly different. README isn't in the root of the archive, but in the Module/ folder instead. sorry
[07:56] <ArrenLex> kitche: Yes. The software in debian "stable" and ubuntu dapper LTS is frozen. They will not get newer versions, only bugfixes. This is what theoretically makes it "stable": no new bugs are introduced.
[07:57] <Enselic> I am having a conflict (I think with two python version (2.4 and 2.5) when I try to run istanbul) Here is what I get when I issue '$ istanbul': http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32578/
[07:57] <xXaNaXx> ashika: not really...but my TV has native res of 1280x720, and it keeps flashing 1280x1024 on the TV screen at the Ubuntu splash screen, then it goes blank and won't proceed

[07:57] <xXaNaXx> ashika: i did that before, and it was empty too
[07:57] <kitche> ArrenLex: just so you know debian 3.1 just had a release with new software
[07:57] <elTigre> Hi
[07:57] <ashika> Type
[07:57] <ArrenLex> Enselic: try installing the python-xlib package
[07:57] <elTigre> I have trouble with my ubuntu....
[07:57] <grimboy> xXaNaXx, /etc/Xorg/xorg.conf
[07:58] <xXaNaXx> ashika: well, i did it without the "sudo" part
[07:58] <unearth> alecjw im usually not this alecjw my applologies i should have checked
[07:58] <attah> roryy I feel like brutaling my laptop since it doesn't work at all :s
[07:58] <grimboy> No, wait scratch that.
[07:58] <ArrenLex> kitche: 3.1 is sarge. Sarge is old.
[07:58] <Enselic> ArrenLex: I have done that, though in sunaptic it says "dummy".
[07:58] <elTigre> I wanted to upgrade from edgy to dapper, but it stopped in the middle with various error messages and I now have a System unable to run X or continue apt
[07:58] <roryy> attah: what happened?
[07:58] <alecjw> unearth: sorry. it was my fault. i didn't check that the archive structure was the same. happy compiling :D
[07:58] <kitche> ArrenLex: they jsut released an update to 3.1 if you look at their news
[07:59] <attah> roryy *nothing*
[07:59] <Doow> Hm.. pinning as described in http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html only seems to work for repos, I want to hold back a specific package that I installed from a .deb file
[07:59] <ashika> xXaNaXx: type sudo nano /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xorg.conf
[07:59] <smallfoot-> http://vendors.bluwiki.org/go/Vendors -- now covers the DRAM price fixing scandal
[07:59] <elTigre> and I don't have a working computer/installation besides the console now
[07:59] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Something should come up
[07:59] <ashika> ArrenLex: Why do you use debian over ubuntu?
[07:59] <roryy> attah: i don't think i understand.  chmod won't print any output unless there's an error
[07:59] <moises-l>  oi
[07:59] <xXaNaXx> ashika: k, brb
[07:59] <elTigre> is there a installation method that I can use, from just a plain console?
[07:59] <ArrenLex> kitche: Yes. "update" means they took all their bugfixes and stuck them on the install cdrom. The versions stayed the same.
[08:00] <attah> roryy well then it worked.. but /home/attah is still not at all accessible for logins
[08:00] <roryy> elTigre: you can use the alternate install cd
[08:00] <grimboy> Before I installed network-manager and network-manager-gnome I could connect to wireless networks. Now I still get a list of them but connecting to them always fails (with no reason given). My /ect/network/interfaces looks like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32574/ and the output of iwconfig is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32575/. Has anyone got any ideas about what I could be doing wrong?
[08:00] <roryy> attah: hmm
[08:00] <roryy> attah: maybe /home is inaccessible
[08:00] <elTigre> roryy: I can't download cds
[08:00] <ArrenLex> ashika: because Debian is much more Free than ubuntu is, and because ubuntu coddles its users, which I don't need.
[08:00] <elTigre> or burn them
[08:00] <Doow> I like to cuddle =)
[08:01] <ashika> ArrenLex: I see. I might go to Debian soon. I just ran my first linux yesterday
[08:01] <attah> roryy I'll just spent 4-8 hrs on installing again
[08:01] <elTigre> I could download it, but I burned an install cd at a friends, but I can't boot it
[08:01] <St_MPA3b> !backports
[08:01] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[08:01] <kitche> ArrenLex: umm the versions have changed for a lot of software in 3.1r3
[08:01] <roryy> attah: what does 'ls -ld /home' say?
[08:01] <kitche> but anyways it's off-topic
[08:01] <attah> roryy g2g sry cant stay :s
[08:01] <ArrenLex> kitche: No. Only bugfixes.
[08:01] <roryy> attah: it should be 'drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 2006-07-12 18:08 /home'
[08:01] <elTigre> mhhhh
[08:02] <elTigre> can anybody help me please?
[08:02] <kitche> ArrenLex: go read the release annoucement they even said they updated some software and put bugfixes
[08:02] <ArrenLex> kitche: look: random package: openoffice. 1.1.3-9sarge3: all
[08:02] <ArrenLex> That is not a new version.
[08:02] <xXaNaXx> ashika: i tried both sudo nano /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xorg.conf and sudo nano /etc/Xorg/xorg.conf , both are empty...the only thing that comes up are the controls at the bottom...no text in the files
[08:02] <ArrenLex> kitche: I did read the announcement. I paste: This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with a few adjustment to serious problems. Those who frequently update from security.debian.org won't have to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in this update.
[08:03] <_TomB> erm... where is xorg.conf in Ubuntu...
[08:03] <xXaNaXx> ashika: everything is the exact case i just typed, too
[08:03] <roryy> elTigre: this page mentions netinstall: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[08:03] <ArrenLex> kitche: security.debian.org is only security packages. It does not push new versions. Thus, this update is bugfix-only.
[08:03] <roryy> elTigre: along with other methods
[08:03] <PF|Linux> Ok, Im trying to install an eggdrop. When I do ./configure, I get the error "C compiler cannot create executables"
[08:03] <Stephenishere> Anyone, i dragged my top task bar and its stuck off the screen.. ;/ im a newb and i cant seem to get it back on
[08:03] <PF|Linux> What do I do?
[08:03] <Stephenishere> anyone know what to do?
[08:03] <ArrenLex> PF|Linux: have you installed build-essential?
[08:03] <PF|Linux> um
[08:04] <PF|Linux> I'll try that
[08:04] <elTigre> thanks I will try that
[08:04] <Silivrenion> I'm trying to setup a machine that won't have anything fancy on it.. I need apache, php, and ssh session support, nothing else really
[08:04] <PF|Linux> "sudo apt-get install build-essential?
[08:05] <Esteth> hey all, i've just used the 6.06 liveCD's GParted to shrink my main NTFS windows partition. i've managed to get back into windows XP Home now, but im not sure what to do to install edgey. My computer allready has a few partitons, put on my computer by Dell at manufacture, which i expect are recovery partitions, and im not sure where to install GRUB either :( any help?
[08:05] <Silivrenion> I was told ubuntu is a good choice for such a minimal configuration and server
[08:05] <PF|Linux> "sudo apt-get install build-essential"  ???
[08:05] <roryy> PF|Linux: yip
[08:05] <Silivrenion> I'm not sure which CD supports my needs?
[08:05] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: just use the ubuntu server-cd
[08:05] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Your installation is corrupt.
[08:05] <PF|Linux> im learning ;)
[08:05] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Those files should be there if you installed ubuntu.
[08:05] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: there you can choose to install ``automatic lamp''
[08:06] <xXaNaXx> ashika: was kinda afraid of that
[08:06] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Try reinstalling that could be your problem
[08:06] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Sorry for this. They should be there no matter what.
[08:06] <Silivrenion> ChaosFan :: I'm not seeing the image in the downloads page.. can you point me to it?
[08:06] <slicslak> is easyubuntu still the best way to get my fav proprietary software?
[08:06] <mfkg> Can Someone help get Enemy Territory running on a AMD64 Edgy Machine? (errors:./setup.sh: 278: /home/mfkg/.setup474: not found & ./setup.sh: 289: /home/mfkg/.setup474: not found)
[08:06] <xXaNaXx> ashika: ok...thanks for the help
[08:06] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Does the live cd boot for you
[08:06] <ashika> xXaNaXx: ?
[08:06] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: one moment ;)
[08:06] <ArrenLex> Silverenion: it's the alternative CD.
[08:06] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, create a new partition in the space you freed and install there. put grub in the mbr
[08:06] <lopa> can one use su on ubuntu?
[08:07] <Nezach> yes
[08:07] <xXaNaXx> ashika: i don't have that....just the "alternate" version
[08:07] <roryy> hrm. there was a specific server cd for previous releases
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> lopa, sudo su
[08:07] <Nezach> sudo su
[08:07] <lopa> it's unavailable on the distro unless you install it outside the package manager?
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> !easyubuntu | slicslak
[08:07] <ubotu> slicslak: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[08:07] <xXaNaXx> ashika: what would i need to do to the xorg.conf file if it was there?
[08:07] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Oh. Well I dont think its resolution and that your problem is the installation. If you want try using live cd and see if it boots.
[08:07] <Esteth> nolimitsoya: so create a new partition in my free space using ext3, then just run the installer on the liveCD and put grub on the MDR? is it possible to backup my MBR before i install grub to it, so if theres a problem i can restore?
[08:07] <nolimitsoya> slicslak, "at your own risk" is the key words. ;) apt-get is strongly preferred
[08:08] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: that would be 6.10 server cd for x86 CPUs: http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/pub/linux/ubuntu/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-server-i386.iso
[08:08] <lopa> ?
[08:08] <ChaosFan> for example
[08:08] <lopa> it's unavailable on the distro unless you install it outside the package manager?
[08:08] <ChaosFan> ArrenLex: alternative != server
[08:08] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Let me open mine hold on. I was going to suggest this but its better if you re do installation. This should be in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:08] <kitche> Chaosfan: it's called server install cd if you want the server install
[08:08] <ChaosFan> kitche: i know
[08:09] <roryy> the server cd comes with apache and other server-type stuff
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, yes, create a new partition, format to you liking and install grub in the mbr. mbr backup is now available to my knowledge, but you can always reinstall xp:s boot manager by using 'fixboot' and 'fixmbr' from the xp recovery console
[08:09] <kitche> ChaosFan: that wasn't for you
[08:09] <nuts`> w
[08:09] <ChaosFan> kitche: but you hilighted me, so i answered
[08:09] <nuts`> what path is cd drive in edgy usually mounted at?
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, id suggest you make two partitions, one for /, and one for /home.
[08:09] <ragnar_123> how do I update beryl from version 0.1.1 to 0.1.2?
[08:09] <roryy> nuts`: /media/cdrom0
[08:09] <ArrenLex> ChaosFan: Oh, hey, I didn't even know there was a new server install CD. Thanks!
[08:10] <ashika> How do you send files in irc. with xchat
[08:10] <ashika> O.o
[08:10] <ChaosFan> ArrenLex: np
[08:10] <nuts`> roryy: hmm if the files are burnt with windows cd, I am supposed to see them aint I?
[08:10] <nolimitsoya> ashika, dcc
[08:10] <roryy> nuts`: you should
[08:10] <ashika> xXaNaXx: Hold on I'll have to sent it its 145 lines
[08:10] <xXaNaXx> ashika: ok
[08:10] <Esteth> nolimitsoya: sorry, im a linux noob, and im not sure quite how i assign them drive letters or whatever, or even if i need swap space or OS-Share space or anything :S
[08:10] <ashika> what do you mean dcc
[08:10] <ashika> like dcc <path>
[08:10] <roryy> nuts`: you should also see a CD icon on your desktop (assuming normal ubuntu gnome)
[08:10] <nuts`> roryy: just switch to directory and do ls right?
[08:11] <ChaosFan> Esteth: forget about drive letters ;)
[08:11] <lopa> is su  unavailable on the distro unless you install it outside the package manager?
[08:11] <nuts`> roryy: i disabled those icons
[08:11] <ArrenLex> Esteth: there are no drive letters in Linux. The filesystem is arranged like a tree, with / being the "root" of the tree and directories being branches.
[08:11] <ashika> lopa: No its available. Try sudo
[08:11] <roryy> nuts`: yip.  Or just 'ls /media/cdrom' (or /media/cdrom0)
[08:11] <ArrenLex> Esteth: you mount new drives as branches of the tree, anywhere you want.
[08:11] <ashika> ArrenLex: How do you send a file over xchat
[08:11] <PF|Linux> Ok, I need Tcl on my system, how do I get that?
[08:11] <roryy> nuts`: look under the 'places' menu; it should be there
[08:11] <Wolf-h26> I'm loving ubunto so far....
[08:11] <ChaosFan> Esteth: in unix-like systems you have one directory structure, and any filesystem (or partition if you like that term better) may be mounted in any directory
[08:11] <nuts`> hmm yeah but it seems empty
[08:11] <nuts`> damn.. :(
[08:11] <ArrenLex> ashika: you don't, that I know of. Is it text? Use pastebin.
[08:11] <roryy> nuts`: run 'mount' -- is /media/cdrom0 listed?
[08:11] <ArrenLex> Esteth: swap space is recommended -- probably 1GB.
[08:12] <Wolf-h26> but i'm afraid to I end up having problems with it.
[08:12] <ashika> ArrenLex: I want to send him my xorg.conf but nano wont show it in one page so it takes forever
[08:12] <Silivrenion> thanks ChaosFan
[08:12] <lopa> ashika: you sire?
[08:12] <lopa> you sure?
[08:12] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, drive letters dont exist in the linux word. if you want a quick explaination, i can give ib, but for now, / is your root partition, where everything go unless you say otherwise. /home is the partition where all the users and thier files and settings reside. swapping in linux is usualy done with a separate swap partition, but it is not needed if you have enoght ram
[08:12] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: np ;)
[08:12] <ashika> lopa: Yes I am sure.
[08:12] <lopa> I mean is su available by default?
[08:12] <PF|Linux> Ok, I need Tcl on my system, how do I get that?
[08:12] <nolimitsoya> *world
[08:12] <ashika> lopa:  yes it is
[08:12] <ArrenLex> ashika: cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf - mouse select - copy - paste to pastebin
[08:12] <nuts`> rorry: hm it doesnt seem like that, no media/cdrom there.
[08:12] <roryy> PF|Linux: run 'apt-cache search --names-only tcl'
[08:12] <ArrenLex> !pastebin
[08:12] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:12] <xXaNaXx> ashika: you should be able to just right-click my name in here, and go to DCC > send
[08:12] <kitche> !root|lopa
[08:12] <nuts`> roryy: how do I mount it now?
[08:12] <ubotu> lopa: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:12] <ArrenLex> Oh. Or that.
[08:12] <roryy> nuts`: ok, run 'mount /media/cdrom0'  -- what happens?
[08:13] <Esteth> ArrenLex: so i need 2 partitions in my free space: 1 large one for my files and the like, and one 1gb one for my swap space. i select to install grub to the mbr, and the chances of something going horribly wrong are quite slim?
[08:13] <`m0> hi, what svn app do you guys recommend?
[08:13] <`m0> I used to use tortoise SVN in windows, which was nice
[08:13] <Luke> My avahi daemon does not start even when I tell it to via the services window. how do I get avahi to start?
[08:13] <witless> hi, i have a problem with X.  when i boot, X fails.  but if i "rmmod nvidia" and then restart gdm, everything loads ok and i'm able to log into the desktop.  any ideas?
[08:13] <ashika> xXaNaXx: did you get it
[08:13] <ashika> xXaNaXx: I sent it
[08:13] <ChaosFan> Esteth: we'd recommend 3 partitions, one about 2-3GB for your actual system, one large for your personal files and one about 1GB partition for swapping
[08:13] <ArrenLex> Esteth: That's right. You can have more partitions if you like -- typically an extra one for /home is recommended, but not required.
[08:13] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, you need three id you want a swap partition. read my highlight

[08:14] <ArrenLex> witless: what card and driver?
[08:14] <ashika> xXaNaXx: click IRC -> file transfers

[08:15] <root__> hi all
[08:15] <`m0> Any SVN app to retrieve and commit to svb reprository , you guys recommend?
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin | PF|Linux
[08:15] <ubotu> PF|Linux: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:15] <Esteth> o.k. one 3Gb ext3 for ubuntu itself. one 1Gb linux-swap partition for swap, and the rest of the space ext3 for my files?
[08:15] <xXaNaXx> ashika: where is that? i'm in mIRC
[08:15] <ArrenLex> Esteth: sounds good.
[08:15] <nuts`> roryy: tells: http://pastebin.com/827529
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, yes, if you need swapspace. you shouldnt
[08:15] <roryy> PF|Linux: you probably want tcl8.4.  Run 'apt-cache show tcl8.4'
[08:15] <elTigre> I'm back again... netinstall is no option since I have my root fs mounted all the time
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, its always better to have enough ram than have to swap
[08:15] <Esteth> i have 1Gb or ram, so i shouldnt, but id rather be on the safe side i think
[08:16] <witless> ArrenLex, it's a PNY GeForce 6800 card; i will paste my nvidia deb info, hold on
[08:16] <PF|Linux> ok
[08:16] <ChaosFan> nolimitsoya: but nowadays reserving 1GB for swapping if needed doesn't hurt either ;)
[08:16] <PF|Linux> install that?
[08:16] <EnterUserName> hi all would you guys suggest ubuntu for someone who does not know much abotu computers?
[08:16] <elTigre> I want  to try and grub the mbr (my boot partition is chronically overloaded and thus all dpkg reconfigure fails)
[08:16] <PF|Linux> roryy: instal tcl.84 ???
[08:16] <EnterUserName> or should i use a distro like suse :)
[08:16] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, if you want to hibernate, you have to devote more swap space than your total ram
[08:16] <roryy> nuts`: hrm. looks like it's a hardware problem -- i.e., drive, not disk
[08:16] <ArrenLex> EnterUserName: I would probably suggest MacOS for someone who doesn't know much about computers.
[08:16] <elTigre> and I am a little blindfolded since I only have console available and no real browser / manual
[08:16] <roryy> PF|Linux: install tcl8.4
[08:16] <PF|Linux> well yeah
[08:16] <EnterUserName> Hrm.. Ya.. What linux distro can i use to make it look like MacOS :)
[08:16] <PF|Linux> ok
[08:16] <roryy> PF|Linux: you might want to check what version of Tcl is required
[08:16] <witless> ArrenLex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32581/
[08:16] <ChaosFan> EnterUserName: if that one wants to learn about computers, yes. if that one just wants his pc to work, macOS or windows (for the rich)
[08:17] <PF|Linux> roryy: probably latest >_>
[08:17] <nolimitsoya> ChaosFan, true, but it is unnecessary and gives you an extra partition you realy dont need :)
[08:17] <nuts`> roryy: hmm that sounds bad =( but in windows it worx.. :[
[08:17] <EnterUserName> hmm
[08:17] <elTigre> how can I Install grub?
[08:17] <macsim> anybody knows witch software is used in http://www.ubuntuvideo.com/ ?
[08:17] <nolimitsoya> !grub | elTigre
[08:17] <ubotu> elTigre: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[08:17] <roryy> nuts`: i was guessing; it might not be
[08:17] <EnterUserName> Chaosfan: hrm ok.
[08:17] <ChaosFan> nolimitsoya: depends on your hardware and what you do with it ;)
[08:17] <macsim> for create the sceencast with sound
[08:17] <EnterUserName> lol is MacOSX still pay ;)
[08:17] <roryy> nuts`: regardless, i think you might be out of luck, sorry
[08:18] <`m0> What SVN app do  you guys recommend me to install
[08:18] <roryy> `m0: command-line svn
[08:18] <elTigre> ubotu: thanks
[08:18] <ubotu> You're Welcome!
[08:18] <nuts`> roryy: hmm ok...well... ill c...
[08:18] <Esteth> and one last question: do i have to explicitly mount my large "stuff" partition, or will it be mounted for me in the tree?
[08:18] <ChaosFan> `m0: depends on what you want to do ;)
[08:18] <kitche> EnterUserName: fedora core is one ubuntu is one suse is one for people that just want a computer to work in my opinion
[08:18] <EnterUserName> kitche: yup thats what im debating on
[08:18] <EnterUserName> Suse or Ubuntu
[08:18] <`m0> I just want to download from SVN Reprository and then Commit to SVN Reporository
[08:18] <Bilange> anyone has stability issues with beryl on a ATI Xpress 200M, by any chance?
[08:18] <ChaosFan> Esteth: you may automate the mounting (what is recommended since that's the usual way) but you don't have to
[08:18] <nolimitsoya> Esteth, you should mount your large partition as /home during install
[08:18] <ChaosFan> `m0: command-line svn
[08:19] <Esteth> nolimitsoya + ChaosFan: thanks, ill tell it in the install then :)
[08:19] <ArrenLex> EnterUserName: http://duggmirror.com/design/Completely_mod_Ubuntu_to_look_like_OS_X/
[08:19] <andy_> EnterUserName: I believe Ubuntu is an easier distribution than Suse
[08:19] <EnterUserName> thanx
[08:19] <Esteth> well, wish me luck, off i go to install ubuntu
[08:19] <ChaosFan> Esteth: hf
[08:19] <nolimitsoya> good luck Esteth :)
[08:20] <Esteth> thanks :)
[08:20] <EnterUserName> Just so you guys know I am not a newbie its a friend.. thati m setting it up on

[08:20] <ashika> xXaNaXx: check the msg
[08:20] <ashika> AFK BRB
[08:20] <wikityler> with all these nvidia drivers, is the s-vhs output supported?
[08:20] <ChaosFan> wikityler: should be, yes, a comrade of mine has it working...
[08:20] <ArrenLex> EnterUserName: Good thing you told us. Newbies in the ubuntu channel? Unprecedented! He would have to be killed.
[08:21] <Doow> ArrenLex: =)
[08:21] <EnterUserName> lol !!
[08:21] <mseney> i figured out my problem with vi. i needed to install the vim and vim-runtime packages
[08:21] <nuts`> w
[08:21] <nuts`> how would I set flags +r+w for a whole folder?
[08:21] <EnterUserName> Oh another quick question.. does Dapper have more sources than the latest release?
[08:21] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, -R
[08:21] <ArrenLex> mseney: Can you also figure out my problem with vi? The interface was designed by a blind, retarded monkey with no hands.
[08:21] <EnterUserName> for downloading applications
[08:21] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, using chmod, that is
[08:22] <akk> That vim problem is so weird -- why is there by default a vim that's not really vim?
[08:22] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: yeah thats for whole dir, chmod -R /directory
[08:22] <mseney> ArrenLex: lmao
[08:22] <kitche> EnterUserName: it's pretty much the same source just using a different repo
[08:22] <ortega10> in dapper, i used to have this menu option, in which i could see all the hard disks, their partitions, free space, etc, i don't remember the name... now i don't see anything similar in edgy, where did it go?
[08:22] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, yes, wasnt that your question?
[08:22] <`m0> Thanks ChaosFan didn't know bout svn command line
[08:22] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: but what would flags look like ( thought it was some 7777 stuff )
[08:22] <EnterUserName> ok..
[08:22] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: or do I just do +r+w ?
[08:22] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, 777 is read and write for everyone
[08:23] <infinity_> hey
[08:23] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: whats for me only?
[08:23] <ChaosFan> `m0: just ''sudo apt-get install subversion'' and be happy
[08:23] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, man chmod
[08:23] <infinity_> how do i get the scripts option in the context menu when i rightclick on files
[08:23] <mseney> aak, no clue. it came installed correctly out of box with 6.06 LTS but not 6.10?
[08:23] <jmx> How does on go about on how to switch from 64 bit to 32bit?
[08:23] <Doow> nuts`: you can write the flags both in octal mode (ie 777) and that other mode (ie +rwx)
[08:23] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, 755 is read and write for owner, and read and execute for everyone else
[08:23] <ortega10> i have a usb pendrive / mp3 player, and i formatted it in edgy, now i can see its files in edgy, but when i unmount it it says there are no music files to play... any ideas?
[08:24] <Doow> nuts`: just different ways of saying the same thing
[08:24] <ChaosFan> `m0: it's pretty easy, all you need for a start is ``svn co <repository>'' for checkout, ``svn up'' for updating that checkout and ``svn ci'' for checking in your changes
[08:24] <nuts`> hmm ok that should do, so I do "sudo chown +r+w (user) directory" ?
[08:24] <nuts`> chmod*
[08:24] <nuts`> that is
[08:24] <nolimitsoya> ortega10, you probably formatted with the wrong file system. should be fat16, mot likely
[08:24] <ChaosFan> nuts`: that would be ``sudo chown u+rw directory''
[08:24] <HL-Onwlyix> Hmm
[08:24] <HL-Onwlyix> this is a stupid question
[08:24] <HL-Onwlyix> but
[08:24] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: i used fat16
[08:24] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, just +rwx
[08:24] <kitche> ortega10: did you sync it before you unmounted the usb stick?
[08:25] <HL-Onwlyix> Is there a way to install Ubuntu without having to boot from the CD?
[08:25] <Dravas> LOL Windows killed my ubuntu partition
[08:25] <ortega10> kitche: what's syncing it?
[08:25] <nuts`> nolimitsoya: so I type "sudo chmod +rwx (user) directory" ?
[08:25] <ChaosFan> Dravas: what do you mean by ``killed''?
[08:25] <witless> ArrenLex: my nvidia modules are listed here  -  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32581/
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, you need the x, or you wont be able to execute programs, and you only need to enter the + once and then stack the letters
[08:25] <roryy> i wouldn't recommend +x with -R; rather +X
[08:25] <Dravas> Well i still have my Blag Partition I'm just gonna need to reinstall ubuntu
[08:25] <Silivrenion> is there a simple way with the server install disk to install the LAMP configuration, minus the MySQL?
[08:25] <ortega10> kitche: it's not an ipod, just a cheap chinese mp3 player
[08:25] <roryy> `m0: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ for more on svn
[08:25] <kitche> ortega10: makes sure the files are written to the usb
[08:25] <nolimitsoya> nuts`, as i said, if you want the long on on using chmod, type man chmod
[08:25] <rcarr> Anyone have any luck with the Intel 3945ABG? I got the source firmware and daemon, installed it all, when the driver loads it says it detects it
[08:25] <Silivrenion> So basically its just LAP
[08:25] <smallfoot-> Please help add computer hardware manufacturers who are Linux/FOSS/competition/etc friendly or unfriendly to http://vendors.bluwiki.org/
[08:25] <deema> anybody here use islsm?????
[08:25] <rcarr> but, it's not available as an interface or anything
[08:25] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: you can uninstall mysql afterwards
[08:25] <Morrissey> Hi, I think I did something to screw my fonts up in firefox ... all my fonts look great otherwhere in KDE, but specific in firefox they look really crappy .... anyone know how to fix?
[08:26] <ortega10> kitche: the files are there... i see them in ubuntu when i mount the usb drive again
[08:26] <Silivrenion> k
[08:26] <ChaosFan> Silivrenion: by typing ``apt-get remove --purge mysql''
[08:26] <ChaosFan> or whatever that package is named...
[08:26] <Silivrenion> does apt-get work pretty much the same as yum, or are there some things I need to watch out for?
[08:26] <ChaosFan> as I don't know yum...
[08:27] <Silivrenion> hmm
[08:27] <nolimitsoya> Silivrenion, i dont know much about yum, but apt is pretty straight forward.
[08:27] <roryy> Silivrenion: i think yum *always* updates its package index; you need to tell apt to
[08:27] <kitche> Silivrenion: they are pretty close together in how they work
[08:27] <roryy> Silivrenion: also, I recommend aptitude instead of apt-get
[08:27] <Silivrenion> yeah, yum updates everytime
[08:27] <ortega10> in dapper, i used to have this menu option, in which i could see all the hard disks, their partitions, free space, etc, i don't remember the name... now i don't see anything similar in edgy, where did it go ?
[08:27] <jmx> Ah I hate these stupid linux.
[08:27] <akk> Silivrenion: With apt-get and aptitude it doesn't automatically refetch the package list every time
[08:27] <nolimitsoya> ortega10, gparted?
[08:27] <Morrissey> Hi, I think I did something to screw my fonts up in firefox ... all my fonts look great otherwhere in KDE, but specific in firefox they look really crappy .... anyone know how to fix? This is what I did: sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig ... maybe I screwed something up then?
[08:27] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: no no, i have gparted now
[08:28] <akk> Silivrenion: so you need to do aptitude update or apt-get update periodically (but the up side is that you don't have to wait for it every time like with yum)
[08:28] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: it was some other gnome app
[08:28] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: disk manager, something like that
[08:28] <nolimitsoya> ortega10, apt-cache search disk manager
[08:28] <ArrenLex> Silvernion: apt-get install <package> installs. apt-get remove <pacakage> removes. apt-get remove --purge package purges all conf files. apt-cache search <term> searches. apt-get clean removes all cached packages. apt-get update refreshes the list of available packages. apt-get upgrade installs new versions of packages you have.
[08:29] <eduhat> can anyone help me un-install gnome and install fluxbox?
[08:29] <Wolf-h26> Will the ubuntu compagny plans to make ubuntu more user friendly?
[08:29] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-system-tools/+bug/61728
[08:29] <nolimitsoya> eduhat, sudo apt-get remove --purge gnome && apt-get install fluxbox
[08:29] <ArrenLex> Wolf-h26: if ubuntu was any more user-friendly, it would be windows.
[08:29] <ulaas> edgy nvidia xinerama gnome-terminal, does it ring a bell?
[08:29] <eduhat> because i dont really use gnome at all, and i dont know how to customize gnome at all
[08:30] <ArrenLex> nolimitsoya: apt-get remove --purge gnome only removes the metapackage, no?
[08:30] <roryy> Wolf-h26: indeed; they try harder with every release
[08:30] <nolimitsoya> ArrenLex, yes, apt-get autoremove would have to follow
[08:30] <Wolf-h26> i see
[08:31] <Wolf-h26> do they also plan to make a version for the Playstation 3?
[08:31] <roryy> *blink*
[08:31] <roryy> no idea
[08:31] <Wolf-h26> because Yellow dog is making a version for the PS3
[08:32] <patrick_king> !WebTTY
[08:32] <rcarr> Anyone have any luck with the Intel 3945ABG? I got the source firmware and daemon, installed it all, when the driver loads it says it detects it but no interfaces
[08:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about WebTTY - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:33] <rizo> Hi
[08:33] <kitche> Wolf-h26: porting ubuntu to a ps3 is more for a hobbiest really or someoen that wants to use ubuntu on the ps3
[08:33] <bradley> does anyone know if a speech to text program exists?
[08:33] <rizo> what are system requirements for edgy eft anyone know?
[08:33] <Wolf-h26> i see
[08:33] <Wolf-h26> http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/products/ydl/
[08:33] <ortega10> i have a usb pendrive / mp3 player, and i formatted it in edgy, now i can see its files in edgy, but when i unmount it it says there are no music files to play... any ideas ?
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> rizo, depends on configuration
[08:34] <bradley> --a program where you speak into a mic and it types it out,
[08:34] <rizo> what are the requirements for ubuntu out of the box
=== gr33npho4nix is now known as gr33npho3nix
[08:34] <ArrenLex> rizo: depends what you're installing. You could install a server on a pentium 1. You could install xubuntu on maybe pentium 2-3. You would need pentium4 for kubuntu\ubuntu.
[08:34] <nolimitsoya> ortega10, does it need some sort of special software on disk?
[08:34] <bradley> i think the XP equivalent would be dragonspeak or something...
[08:34] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: no it doesn't, the internal firmware handles everything
[08:34] <rizo> its ubuntu desktop using the default config
[08:35] <ArrenLex> bradley: I've never found one.
[08:35] <rizo> i can't seem to find the sys req on the ubuntu site
[08:35] <akk> bradley: IBM has one that works on linux (viavoice, maybe?) but I don't know if it's free or OSS
[08:35] <nolimitsoya> rizo, then idd recommend 500mhz p3 at least, and 128mb ram
[08:35] <ArrenLex> rizo: there are no system reqs for ubuntu because it all depends on your configuration.
[08:35] <peernaute473> help you speak french
[08:35] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: and it doesn't need software on ubuntu either, it works as a standard pendrive... i mean it used to work  :(
[08:35] <ArrenLex> !fr > peernaute473
[08:35] <nolimitsoya> rizo, if you have got a low end machine id say go for a cli install and then apt-get fluxbox or xfce
[08:35] <bradley> ArrenLex, you have been looking around for one?
[08:35] <rizo> what about to use Compiz and XGL
[08:36] <roryy> you need 192MB RAM to install from the live cd, i believe
[08:36] <ArrenLex> bradley: Yes, a while back.
[08:36] <bradley> akk, thanks i'll take a look for that.
[08:36] <kitche> ortega10: it worked in dapper?
[08:36] <nolimitsoya> rizo, 256mb ram and gf2
[08:36] <Pupeno> Can Evolution generate Sieve filters ?
[08:36] <ArrenLex> rizo: you'll need a video card for which 3D drivers exist. That's all.
[08:36] <rizo> is gf2 required?
[08:36] <ArrenLex> rizo: I recommend nvidia.
[08:36] <peernaute473> moi c'est tealk
[08:36] <nolimitsoya> rizo, i think you need that shader version, yes
[08:36] <ArrenLex> !fr
[08:36] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:36] <kitche> rizo any 3d acceleration card will work but XGL is more for nvidia and ati really
[08:36] <ortega10> kitche: yes it worked, and right now it kinda works... i mean it works as a pendrive, but those files aren't seen by the firmware music player later
[08:36] <peernaute473>  un frechi dans le coin
[08:37] <rizo> how about onboard graphics
[08:37] <harmental> hi..does anybody knows where can i find a good version of pacman or ms pacman for linux???
[08:37] <rizo> would that not be good enough
[08:37] <nolimitsoya> rizo, though you can use any graphics card, as long as it has the right shader support
[08:37] <ArrenLex> rizo: An intel onboard card should be fine.
[08:37] <nolimitsoya> rizo, most of the modern onboard cards are by far more powerfull than a gf2 :)
[08:37] <roryy> harmental: i see a 'pacman' in the repos
[08:37] <harmental> yes...but its kinda lame...
[08:38] <roryy> heh
[08:38] <ortega10> kitche: nolimitsoya: it's like it made two different partitions.... the files i copy in ubuntu can't be seen from the internal music player; and the files i generate with the firmware (recordings) can't be seen in ubuntu
[08:38] <rizo> how can check if it is supported?
[08:38] <ArrenLex> rizo: what card do you have?
[08:38] <Morrissey> wich is better of beryl/compiz and 3ddesktop?? Im currently using the last one because I think it uses less memory, correct?
[08:38] <rizo> i have no idea which brand the onboard graphic card is
[08:38] <rizo> it cna't be intel coz im running on amd
[08:38] <nolimitsoya> ortega10, did you partition the device, or just write a filesystem?
[08:38] <kitche> ortega10: well it does have two partitions
[08:38] <njan> Morrissey, they do different things.
[08:38] <ArrenLex> rizo: an AMD laptop? Amazing. I've never heard of one of those.
[08:39] <Morrissey> njan, oh, whats the difference?
[08:39] <rizo> desktop
[08:39] <ArrenLex> rizo: regardless, if it's relatively modern, you should be fine.
[08:39] <ArrenLex> Oh.
[08:39] <ortega10> kitche: well it can't really have two partitions, the internal firmware is in "single disk mode" (it can have two, one encrypted)
[08:39] <ArrenLex> Anyway, you should be fine.
[08:39] <rizo> Great
[08:39] <nolimitsoya> ArrenLex, there are loads of amd desktops ;)
[08:39] <rizo> thanks
[08:39] <ortega10> nolimitsoya: no i didn't partition it, i just deleted the existing partition, and make a new one occupying all of the space
[08:39] <njan> Morrissey, 3ddesktop is a userspace app that takes screenshots of your virtual desktops and makes them do spinny things when you hit a hotkey. It's cool, but it's not groundbreaking.
[08:39] <rizo> now only if the 700mb download could be faster lol
[08:40] <njan> Morrissey, compiz/beryl are a fairly different paradigm in terms of how your desktop actually works.
[08:40] <nolimitsoya> rizo, use the netinstall cd
[08:40] <ArrenLex> nolimitsoya: Yes, I just didn't think there were many desktops with onboard graphics chips.
[08:40] <Morrissey> njan, so compiz will change my desktop behavoiur even more?
[08:40] <njan> Morrissey, unequivocally.
[08:40] <ArrenLex> nolimitsoya: ...ubuntu has netinstall? What witchery is this?! A link?
[08:40] <rizo> net install?
[08:40] <Morrissey> njan, how much system does it take?
[08:40] <nolimitsoya> ArrenLex, most have onboard graphics :)
[08:40] <ArrenLex> Weird.
[08:40] <rizo> whats that?
[08:41] <rizo> you mean the alternative
[08:41] <rizo> ??
[08:41] <ArrenLex> No, not the alternative.
[08:41] <nolimitsoya> ArrenLex, i think there is one... did i dream it? it was linked the day before, and i didnt check it out. ca 160mb :)
[08:41] <stalefries> net install is where you install over the net, ie, you have a very basic cd that grabs all the stuff off the net in real time
[08:41] <njan> Morrissey, that, I couldn't tell you.
[08:41] <rizo> rite but i still have to get the rest of the packages
[08:42] <rizo> using the netcd?
[08:42] <ArrenLex> nolimitsoya: I know debian has them, but I've never heard of an ubuntu netinstall...
[08:42] <nolimitsoya> ArrenLex, me neither, till yesterday. the link was to the ubuntu ftp. ill se if i can find anything :)
[08:42] <ulaas> how do i install official nvidia driver from nvidia.com without bothering my ubuntu box and not ruining resricted-modules stuff
[08:42] <fooshang> I am having problems exploring a music CD with Nautilus. It opens soundjuicer insted. I see others in the forum were having very similar issues. Anyone hear of a correction?
[08:43] <ortega10> ulaas: you don't   :)
[08:43] <ArrenLex> ulass: can you explain why you would want to?
[08:43] <Kingsqueak> I like the ubuntu way, where the install CD actually gives you a full working system so you can use it even if your net connection is unstable or unavailable
[08:43] <ulaas> ArrenLex: 9629?
[08:43] <ArrenLex> ulass: 28192563923? What random numbers are these?
[08:44] <ulaas> ArrenLex: nvidia driver..
[08:44] <ulaas> ArrenLex: latest and the greatest
[08:44] <ortega10> ulaas: if it ain't broken don't fix it
[08:44] <FirstStrike> how would i go about releasing my ip address and renewing it in dapper?
[08:44] <ortega10> ulaas: stick with the stable one in ubuntu unless you have a problem
[08:44] <Morrissey> njan, wich is better? Beryl or compiz?
[08:45] <ulaas> ortega10: texture_form_pixmap....
[08:45] <ulaas> form/from
[08:45] <njan> Morrissey, go look them up, figure out what they are :)
[08:45] <rcarr> Err, I'm trying to compile an older version of the ieee80211 subsystem
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> Beryl has tons more bells/whistles and has a GUI to set them up that is a bit better
[08:45] <ortega10> ulaas: well then there's an unofficial repository for 3d drivers
[08:45] <njan> Morrissey, http://www.beryl-project.org/
[08:45] <rcarr> that will work with my wireless card
[08:45] <ortega10> ulaas: but it didn't work for me
[08:45] <rcarr> and when I make it, it deletes it's source directory
[08:45] <rcarr> before it does anything
[08:46] <Doow> nolimitsoya: there's a thingie called instlinux that will install ubuntu purely from repos if that's what you're talking about
[08:46] <ulaas> ortega10: how come nvidia-kernel-common is a dependency of restricted-modules.
[08:46] <ulaas> ortega10: no sense
[08:46] <ortega10> ulaas: i don't know, i don't have that package and i do have restricted modules
[08:46] <Doow> nolimitsoya: ok, not completely, you have to download an 11 mb file
[08:47] <ortega10> ulaas: http://albertomilone.com/driver_edgy.html
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> Doow, might be... though im pretty sure it was an iso...
[08:47] <kitche> ulass: since the nvidia driver is restricted since it doesn't give the source code out
[08:47] <ortega10> ulaas: there's the repository
[08:47] <ulaas> ortega10: awright. thanks bro
[08:47] <ortega10> kitche: but he says restricted depends on nvidia
[08:47] <Doow> nolimitsoya: ok, not instlinux then
[08:47] <ortega10> kitche: that would be weird
[08:47] <Infamous_Flame> Hey. Anyone know how to set Realplayer as the default player for video files in firefox?
[08:47] <Hades90> Hallo
[08:47] <ortega10> ulaas: and if the repository fails, check this out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:48] <kitche> ortega10: no it's not weird since nvidia is a restricted module
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> nope, cant find it. perhaps i was dreaming :/
[08:48] <ortega10> kitche: it's weird because i don't need to have the nvidia module just because i have the restricted modules
[08:48] <Doow> nolimitsoya: what did you need it for?
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> Doow, i didnt :)
[08:49] <kitche> ortega10: nvidia depends on restricted modules restricted modules don't depend on nvidia
[08:49] <Doow> nolimitsoya: =P
[08:49] <ortega10> kitche: well he said otherwise, i was commenting on that
[08:49] <witless> where is the IGNORE menu option in xchat??
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> witless, you could just use /ingore <username>
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> *ignore
[08:50] <witless> nolimitsoya:  the version i was using before would have an "ignore" option when you right-clicked on a nick
[08:50] <roryy> kitche: no, you had it right first time: linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic depends on nvidia-kernel-common
[08:50] <Doow> is there an easy way of saving all open files in emacs? (I assume there's a way, but I want an easy one =)
[08:51] <tonyb2006> whats the thing that ubuntu has thats like an OSD for volume control keys on the keyboard or a laptop called?
[08:52] <roryy> Doow: it looks like C-u C-x C-c should do that
[08:52] <Kingsqueak> tonyb2006: there's an xmms osd plugin
[08:52] <roryy> Doow: C-h k C-x C-c for more info
[08:52] <tonyb2006> the thing that comes w/ ubuntu
[08:52] <PF|Linux> What's the terminal command to delete a directory?
[08:52] <Doow> roryy: thanks
[08:52] <Silmethule> rm -r directory
[08:52] <Kingsqueak> PF|Linux: rm -rf /dir
[08:53] <roryy> PF|Linux: rm with the -r option. be careful ;)
[08:53] <ortega10> i have a usb pendrive / mp3 player, and if i format it i don't see those files in the internal player / browser, but if i delete the partition and don't format it, i only see one partition of 400 mb (it has 2000 total)... any ideas?
[08:53] <PF|Linux> k
[08:54] <d0uglas> Hi. Running gnome-terminal in kde. How can I specify which browser gnome-terminal uses when launching urls? It's not paying attention to what i have set in the kontrol panel or whatever
[08:54] <tonyb2006> is it notification-daemon
[08:54] <PF|Linux> I installed the eggdrop from the ubuntu repository. Anyone know how I get to it?
[08:55] <Kingsqueak> tonyb2006: maybe gnome-osd ?
[08:55] <tonyb2006> maybe
[08:55] <Doow> roryy: that just exited emacs which I should've figure with the C-x C-c part
[08:55] <kitche> PF|Linux: you mean the configuration files?
[08:55] <Kingsqueak> or xosd-bin
=== Silmethule is now known as Silme|away
[08:56] <PF|Linux> kitche: Yeah, I need to get it connected
[08:56] <roryy> Doow: ah, blast, didn't read your message carefully enough
[08:56] <roryy> Doow: my apologies
[08:56] <[Xtogu] > hi
[08:56] <kitche> PF|Linux the configuration files should be in /etc/eggdrop
[08:56] <Doow> roryy: np, I hade everything save before I tried it anyway =)
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> Doow, ArrenLex, this might be it: http://mirrors.xmission.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso :)
[08:56] <[Xtogu] > hi
[08:56] <roryy> Doow: C-u C-x s
[08:57] <Doow> roryy: that looks more likely =)
[08:57] <JoyFM> hi
[08:57] <R9KMC> hi everybody
[08:57] <JoyFM> which version of parted is used in 6.10 alternative?
[08:57] <St_MPA3b> !
[08:58] <St_MPA3b> !irc
[08:58] <ubotu> irc is Internet Relay Chat - Ubuntu IRC clients: xchat (http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/XChatHowto), gaim (http://help.ubuntu.com/community/GaimHowto), Konversation (http://konversation.berlios.de/docs/) - Also see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat and !guidelines
[08:58] <St_MPA3b> =-=-= Whar IRC client u use? =-=-=
[08:58] <roryy> JoyFM: not sure about on the alternative cd, but on my installed 6.10 I have version 1.7.1
[08:58] <ortega10> i have a usb pendrive / mp3 player, and if i format it i don't see those files in the internal player / browser, but if i delete the partition and don't format it, i only see one partition of 400 mb (it has 2000 total)... any ideas ?
[08:58] <roll> hi, can sombody tell me if all the ini files inside php.d folder aerw loaded automatically ??
[08:58] <R9KMC> I want just to know if it's possible to install Ubuntu Version 5.10 and update it to the last version?
[08:58] <PF|Linux> kitche: not there
[08:58] <roll>  hi, can sombody tell me if all the ini files inside php.d folder aerw loaded automatically ??
[08:59] <JoyFM> so it is maybe affected by this bug :  http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-parted@gnu.org/msg02094.html ?
[08:59] <PF|Linux> kitche: No "eggdrop" in /etc
[08:59] <roryy> R9KMC: you'll need to upgrade to 6.06 first, and then upgrade to 6.10 (the latest)
[08:59] <Clin1> Has any one ever installed Bionic? im stumped
[08:59] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: it would be cleaner to just install the latest
[08:59] <R9KMC> roryy: So i can update to 6.06 from ubuntu 5.10?
[08:59] <kitche> PF|Linux: do a search for eggdrop by doing sudo updatedb && locate eggdrop
[08:59] <roryy> R9KMC: yip
[08:59] <roll>  hi, can sombody tell me if all the ini files inside php.d folder aerw loaded automatically ??
[08:59] <R9KMC> :)
[09:00] <roryy> !upgrade | R9KMC
[09:00] <ubotu> R9KMC: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:00] <unearth> roryy ever installed/used qt?
[09:00] <anton__> erm. you could try an lsof, roll
[09:00] <Kingsqueak> roll: I would doubt it, look at your php.ini to check or run phpinfo();
[09:00] <roryy> unearth: a good while back
[09:01] <Stephenishere> damnit
[09:01] <Stephenishere> i ahve to get ready for work :/
[09:01] <roll> ok, but it is possible ?
[09:01] <Kingsqueak> roll: if you enable them, yes
[09:01] <roll> I seee.
[09:01] <Kingsqueak> roll: I doubt the stock php.ini would do that, it's not a great idea unless you need them all
[09:01] <roll> yes actually it is enabled.
[09:02] <Clin1> How do i use .sh files...
[09:02] <roll> becvause I have a php.d, and seems that all the modules like mysql are loaded from that fo9lder
[09:02] <Kingsqueak> Clin1: chmod 755 ./file ; ./file
[09:02] <roll> so, i need to knowe if simply by adding a new .dll file on thtat folder
[09:02] <roll> will be loaded by php
[09:02] <Kingsqueak> Clin1: or just   sh ./file
=== Silme|away is now known as Silmethule
[09:03] <abo> Clin1, usually from a shell (consol) . and then see what Kingsqueak said ;)
[09:03] <Linuturk> I need a forum moderator please
[09:03] <Clin1> thank you
[09:03] <jrib> Linuturk: #ubuntuforums maybe
[09:03] <yondaime> whenever i boot into install mode my mouse and keyboard gets stuck .. what could be the problem ?
[09:03] <Kingsqueak> roll: you will have to restart apache, and depending on your php.ini and the module it may or may not, you may need to add a new entry to php.ini to load it
[09:04] <grimboy> Why are there so many vim packages? Should I just install full?
[09:04] <Kingsqueak> grimboy: because it's pretty large and some people want leaner options, full is what I do
[09:04] <R9KMC> roryy: I read "Upgrading with the Update Manager application, use ' gksudo "update-manager"' " So when i use this command in terminal and it will update to 6.06 automaticaly?
[09:04] <Clin1> I still have no ideaa what to do    sh FILE gaave me this now run /home/admin/BOINC/run_client to run the client and /home/admin/BOINC/run_manager to run the GUI
[09:05] <roryy> R9KMC: that's the idea
[09:05] <grimboy> Kingsqueak, Fair enough, should I only have full installed then and remove the others? (I got greedy)
[09:05] <Hoxxin> i made a little mistake while installing ubuntu. i had the integrated graphic card activated in the bios, now i tried to change to the other in the bios but ubuntu wont start after that. what shall i do?
[09:05] <kitche> Clin1: it tells you how to run the program
[09:05] <jrib> grimboy: yeah, unless you want stuff like gtk gui or python scripting support
[09:05] <Kingsqueak> Clin1: it's telling you what to do...it installed and those are your two options
[09:05] <R9KMC> thanks :)
[09:05] <[Nicke] > is there any way to make ubuntu load like saa7134-oss instead of saa7134-alsa?
[09:05] <Clin1> boy am i a genious
[09:05] <Kingsqueak> grimboy: dunno, I find full useful, unless you are severely stretched on disk space I would just leave it
[09:05] <roll> where can I see
[09:05] <grimboy> jrib, But I do. I just don't want 8 different ways of opening vim
[09:05] <jrib> grimboy: hmm my mistake, full includes that stuff
[09:05] <yondaime> whenever i boot into install mode my mouse and keyboard gets stuck .. what could be the problem ?
[09:05] <Clin1> THANK YOU SO MUCH
[09:05] <Clin1> YAY
[09:05] <roll> where the .so modules are stored ???
[09:06] <roll> bin ?
[09:06] <Neftalena> hi everyone!!!
[09:06] <kitche> roll: they are stored in /lib probably
[09:06] <Kingsqueak> grimboy: well you probably have a GUI, as in 'gvim' and also vim, so it's no big deal, either will work
[09:06] <Doow> roll: /lib or /usr/lib usually
[09:06] <Neftalena> hola
[09:06] <Doow> Neftalena: hi
[09:06] <Neftalena> somebody can help me
[09:06] <R9KMC> other thing: my sister has got a laptop toshiba RAM:256Mo Intel centrino 1.4Go, will this be enaugh to install ubuntu?
[09:07] <Doow> !ask | Neftalena
[09:07] <ubotu> Neftalena: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:07] <Neftalena> :P thanx
[09:07] <grimboy> Kingsqueak, Ok, I'll just leave it as it is. You know what they say about stuff that works.
[09:07] <Doow> Neftalena: =)
[09:07] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: should be, though xubuntu would be what I'd recommend, lighter than gnome for 256MB of RAM
[09:07] <Neftalena> hi Doow
[09:07] <Neftalena> i'm a new user of linux
[09:08] <yondaime> hello
[09:08] <roll> how can I so a search on the entire machine from the shell ??
[09:08] <Zparks> Hello everyone, I am quite new to Ubuntu and I have a question about the alternate install cd, I really searched a lot but couldn't find it... Although the installer on the alternate cd is textbased, does it still install a graphical operating system? I'm sorry if this is a really frequently asked question, but I couln't find it anywhere :S
[09:08] <kasterfett> hi
[09:08] <ashika> Hi
[09:08] <kitche> Zparks: yes
[09:09] <ashika> Zparks: Yes it contains the full ubuntu. Its for people whos computer wont display the GUI properly
[09:09] <roll> need to search for mysql.so
[09:09] <Doow> Neftalena: welcome, what's your problem?
[09:09] <ashika> Zparks: For example my MAC wont do step 5 on the normal so alternate is needed.
[09:09] <bingnet922> Hi channel, my /etc/cron.* jobs run as expected, but new entries to /etc/crontab (system crontab, I think) do not run. I created the cron jobs via kcron and checked syntax in /etc/crontab. My new jobs should run as root and the command given has no errors when copied to the prompt manually. What am I missing? I've never set up a crontab before.
[09:09] <yondaime> my keyboard and mouse doesn't work .. they are locked up .. when i boot into ubuntu install .. does anybody have a clue ?
[09:09] <Neftalena> i don't know how i can run a C program in the console
[09:09] <jrib> grimboy: I guess you are talking about having /usr/bin/vim.tiny /usr/bin/vim.python /usr/bin/vim.full  etc?  You just update-alternatives --config vim  and use the one you want
[09:09] <vivabenfica> hi all
[09:09] <ashika> yondaime:  Does it work in another OS?
[09:09] <R9KMC> Kingsqueak: if she uses xubuntu, can she use other software such as openoffice, firefox, update manager, music player...?
[09:09] <ashika> yondaime: And is the speaker/mouse wireless
[09:09] <yondaime> yes.. windows perfect.. fedora perfect
[09:09] <Doow> Neftalena: first you have to compile and link it, have you done that?
[09:10] <roll> does anybody knows where the mysql.so for php is located ???
[09:10] <ashika> yondaime: keyboard/mouse*
[09:10] <Neftalena> no coz i don't know how
[09:10] <yondaime> ashika : didn't check speaker..
[09:10] <traxxed> hello
[09:10] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: absolutely, it uses xfce4 as the desktop, quite a bit leaner and faster on an older machine, leaving more room for apps to run
[09:10] <Zparks> Thanks kitche and ashika, so when the installation is finished, you have an OS with GNOME desktop?
[09:10] <Hoxxin> Can anyone help me what to do with this problem: i installed ubuntu and found out i used the integrated graphic card as default, i changed graphic card in bios but now ubuntu wont start, i also tried to reinstall but it gives error messages, what shall i do??
[09:10] <ashika> yondaime: I meant keyboard type
[09:10] <kitche> roll you can do sudo updatedb && locate mysql.so to find it
[09:10] <SurfnKid> can you play pls on xmms
[09:10] <Doow> Neftalena: are you learning to program or just trying to run someone elses prog?
[09:10] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: it would even run gnome, but xubuntu would be faster running
[09:10] <kitche> Zparks yes if you are using the ubuntu vf
[09:10] <grimboy> jrib, Oh right, thanks.
[09:10] <Neftalena> my teacher told me that i can do this... in the console :::: gcc + the name of my program + -o
[09:10] <ashika> Zparks: Yes. You an add KDE if you want but if you want KDE get Kubuntu.
[09:11] <Zparks> What do you mean by ubuntu vf, kithce?
[09:11] <Neftalena> i'm a student of informatiC in Mexico
[09:11] <ashika> yondaime: If they're wireless make sure to install drivers on ubuntu
[09:11] <SurfnKid> Neftalena, whats informatiC?
[09:11] <jrib> Neftalena: have you installed build-essential?
[09:11] <yondaime> ashika : they are not wireless.. they are regular pci stuff..
[09:11] <roll> great
[09:11] <R9KMC> Kingsqueak: Installing other debian software is also possible?!!
[09:11] <Doow> Neftalena: ok, your question is probably more suited for ##c
[09:11] <Neftalena> nop
[09:11] <vivabenfica> i am succesfully dual-booting ubuntu and xp, and just added mandriva for $hits and giggles. i told it to install bootloader on boot partition, but of course now when i boot i only see the bootloader ubuntu created with ubuntu and xp options. any idea how to see all 3 OS in ubuntu bootloader?
[09:11] <ashika> Neftalena: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware has information on compiling. Be sure to have proper libraries
[09:11] <Neftalena> yeah
[09:11] <kasterfett> i've got one problem with a bash script
[09:11] <jrib> Neftalena: you should install that package so that you can compile with gcc
[09:11] <kasterfett> anyone can help me?
[09:12] <Neftalena> ohhh thanx ashika
[09:12] <ashika> yondaime: Do they require special drivers
[09:12] <yondaime> ashika : no they are just plain old keyboard and mouse ..
[09:12] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: absolutely, the only difference is just the default look of the desktop
[09:12] <ashika> Neftalena: What are you trying to compile. Is it a XSomething software? KDE software? IF so you need x-dev and kde-dev from Synaptec. Besure to get the make software package and gcc aswell.
[09:12] <yondaime> it's an acer power S series computer..
[09:12] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: xfce4 is quite easy to use too, just less resource intensive than full on gnome
[09:12] <kasterfett> i va an IF -ELSE sentence
[09:13] <kasterfett> i've
[09:13] <Neftalena> ok look
[09:13] <ashika> yondaime: Do you have mouse/keyboard name/model
[09:13] <jrib> kasterfett: you may want to consider #bash, but go ahead and pastebin your code
[09:13] <kasterfett> and work perfectly, but if i insert a comment
[09:13] <Zparks> Sorry kitche, what did you mean with "ubuntu vf"?
[09:13] <ashika> jrib: how do you pastebin
[09:13] <kasterfett> then the code doesn'y works
[09:13] <scooter> hi
[09:13] <R9KMC> Kingsqueak: thank you very very much :)
[09:13] <Doow> !pastebin | ashika
[09:13] <ubotu> ashika: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[09:14] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC:  you could try the 'regular' install, if it's too slow, just apt-get install xfce4 and all the other xfce4* files and switch it over
[09:14] <scooter> can ubuntu linux run on an 800 mHz amc prossesor
[09:14] <kasterfett> and if i delete that comment, the code continues without working
[09:14] <yondaime> ashika : they are not even usb .. just regular stuff.. i'm sure this is a pci problem
[09:14] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: at the initial sign-on you can switch sessions once it's installed to try them both
[09:14] <Hoxxin> Can anyone help me what to do with this problem: i installed ubuntu and found out i used the integrated graphic card as default, i changed graphic card in bios but now ubuntu wont start, i also tried to reinstall but it gives error messages, what shall i do??
[09:14] <Zparks> well, i'll figure it out. Thanks for your help!
[09:14] <Neftalena> my teacher give me a program who  uses the shared memory
[09:15] <Kingsqueak> scooter: sure it should work just fine
[09:15] <R9KMC> Kingsqueak: ok I will try it
[09:15] <ashika> yondaime: Do you have model/name of your devices.
[09:15] <ashika> scooter: do you mean amd?
[09:15] <Kingsqueak> scooter: it's more a RAM question than anything, with full gnome it will be happiest with 512MB but will run fine with less
[09:15] <scooter> yea
[09:15] <jrib> Neftalena: ok, are you able to compile it now?
[09:15] <snowshoefox> !make-kpkg
[09:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about make-kpkg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:15] <TheGateKeeper> Hoxxin, will a livecd boot up?
[09:15] <snowshoefox> what pakcage is make-kpkg in?
[09:15] <Hoxxin> no
[09:15] <Hoxxin> TheGateKeeper no
[09:16] <yondaime> ashika : logitech - M-S69 mouse / fujitsu keyboard ..
[09:16] <scooter> my husband is getting ready to switch to linux on his pc and has been told that his prossessor wouldnt run the program properly
[09:16] <Hoxxin> TheGateKeeper when i start with the cd it comes up the screen where i can choose "install or start" "safe mode" etc
[09:16] <Neftalena> yes
[09:16] <Kingsqueak> scooter: it should be fine, just slower than a new machine is all, it may be faster with linux than Win was
[09:16] <jrib> scooter: try a live cd and find out, that would be the easiest way
[09:16] <Spee_Der> !moo
[09:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about moo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:17] <snowshoefox> yea it'll be faster with Linux
[09:17] <snowshoefox> in some parts
[09:17] <Kingsqueak> scooter: I just told someone else, the 'xubuntu' version is better for older machines
[09:17] <scooter> ok thanks
[09:17] <Hoxxin> TheGateKeeper is there a way to change the default graphic card in ubuntu? change-> reboot?
[09:17] <jrib> scooter: the live cd is the same as the "desktop cd" by the way
[09:17] <ashika> yondaime: You believe it to be your Motherboard's problem?
[09:17] <Zambezi> Is it possible to burn mds+mdf in Ubuntu? It's Alcohol 120%. mds2iso doesn't work. No files are created.
[09:17] <Kingsqueak> scooter: xubuntu just runs a different and more efficient desktop so it is easier on the machine
[09:17] <scooter> ok thanks so much i will get him to try it
[09:17] <TheGateKeeper> Hoxxin, if a livecd won't boot up correctly & you have modified the bios then I guess that is where the problem lies
[09:17] <wladston> anyone in here uses aptana ??? i'm having problems, it refuses to open php files!!!
[09:18] <yondaime> ashika : but it's a very common motherboard .. i'm sure there must've been somebody else with this problem.. it's a branded series of computer ( AcerPower S series )
[09:18] <scooter> thanks for the information bye bye
[09:18] <poco> hi
[09:18] <Neftalena> jrib: yes
[09:18] <traxxed> Is there a good site to get the .img of xubuntu?
[09:18] <barryd> I have just created 2 networks, on seperate subnets, router on 255.255.255.0, through to my wifi/laptop, then out to my client computer over eth0 on subnet 255.255.254.0
[09:18] <jrib> Neftalena: k, great
[09:19] <Neftalena> thanx jrib
[09:19] <kitche> traxxed: from xubuntu site pick a mirror and you will get .iso
[09:19] <Hoxxin> TheGateKeeper: ill get it to work if i switch back to the integr. graph. card, just wondering how i could change to the other card and reinstall :) thats the problem
[09:19] <traxxed> thanks kitche
[09:20] <poco> my ethernet card is not recognized after an (failed) update.... got nothing on lspci and "illegal vendor id unknown device" with lspci (the card is recognized with old live cd). my last upgrade was not successful btw
[09:20] <wladston> guys : there is noone on the #aptana channel :(
[09:20] <Neftalena> ok so... maybe u can explain me ... all
[09:20] <ashika> yondaime: And this works on Fedora? Try booting into recovery mode and see if you can type anything please.
[09:20] <jrib> Neftalena: explain what?
[09:20] <wladston> ok, if anyone, please /msg me ...
[09:20] <yondaime> ashika : ok .. thanks
[09:20] <Zaggynl> Anyone knows how to you can get the borders of metacity to glow? I'm kinda stuck googlin :
[09:21] <Neftalena> i just know how can a i do a program buuuuuuuut i don't know how i make to compile
[09:21] <poco> got it :p
[09:21] <ashika> yondaime: Sorry but thats all I can suggest right now. If you can type it means proper drivers aren't being loaded in ubuntu or your installation is malformed. Again sorry but I can't do much
[09:21] <Kingsqueak> Neftalena:   gcc -o foo foo.c  will make 'foo' out of foo.c if it can compile
[09:21] <jrib> Neftalena: gcc my_file.c -o my_file      the -o lets you give the output a name.  Then you run the command with:   ./my_file
[09:21] <TheGateKeeper> Hoxxin, if you can get a livecd to boot up correctly, you can compare /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the one on your hdd and make the appropriate changes, but backup the one on your hdd before altering it
[09:21] <ashika> yondaime: If it works then try reinstalling. If it doesn't I'm sorry thats all I can do
[09:22] <R9KMC> Kingsqueak: do you know any bittorrent link to download xubuntu? thanks

[09:23] <Hoxxin> TheGateKeeper ok tnx
[09:23] <ashika> yondaime: Sorry yondaime. I know it isn't much but you dont have to be mean about it.
[09:23] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/6.10/release/
[09:23] <TheGateKeeper> Hoxxin, good luck :-)
[09:23] <Hoxxin> TheGateKeeper tnx i need it :)
[09:23] <Kingsqueak> R9KMC: scroll down and there are .torrent files
[09:23] <yondaime> ashika : was i mean to u ? then i'm really sorry .. seriously
[09:23] <R9KMC> thank you
[09:23] <ashika> max: You were being sarcastic with the ..
[09:23] <dromer> hmm, lately all flash-video/audio seems to be out of sink in firefox
[09:23] <yondaime> ashika : i didn't mean to..
[09:23] <ashika> yondaime: you were being sarcastic with the ..
[09:24] <XyZ> hey, can you tell me one thing. I have a big mirror of linux sources in my local network, how can i learn my kubuntu use this mirror as repository for apt-get?
[09:24] <ashika> yondaime: thats \kind of cruel
[09:24] <yondaime> ashika : i wasn't sarcastic.. i really meant it..
[09:24] <roryy> ashika: please just drop it
[09:24] <kitche> XyZ: edit source.list to point to your mirror
[09:24] <ashika> yondaime: Oh. So if you try it let me know
[09:24] <ashika> roryy: Sorry we dropped it.
[09:24] <ashika> roryy: Rorry do you know how I can change the order of OS's in GRUB
[09:25] <Murrlin> afternoon.
[09:25] <XyZ> kitche, yes i know it, but i don't know which options i'm must to use
[09:25] <Neftalena> :S appears a message of which the directory does not exist
[09:25] <Neftalena> so i'm doing something wrong
[09:25] <roryy> ashika: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[09:25] <blue-frog> if /dev/hdb has not been created during boot, is there a way for me to create it via command line while running edgy?
[09:25] <roryy> ashika: but, be careful!
[09:25] <Murrlin> my network connection settings have become broke.
[09:25] <Murrlin> networks are 'disabled' upon start up. I have to manually activate them
[09:25] <ashika> roryy: Is there a safer way to autoboot windows unless you press something?
[09:25] <jrib> Neftalena: join me in #ubuntu-classroom and I will help you step by step if you want
[09:25] <kitche> XyZ: well that you would probably have to do some searching or ask your admin about it
[09:25] <roryy> ashika: yes, that is fairly easy
[09:26] <Murrlin> and, if I try to run the configurer again, it freezes, with no further actions
[09:26] <ashika> roryy: How so?
[09:26] <Murrlin> how can I fix this?
[09:26] <roryy> ashika: change the 'default 0' in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[09:26] <sunganes> hello. I now have Ubuntu server (drapper drake version) and ubuntu-desktop installed. So far things have been a breeze and I am starting to love ubuntu. I now need to install JAVA, Eclipse, JBOSS, Hibernate, Axis. are there packages for these already? what is the best way to go about doing this.
[09:26] <Morrissey> hi, how can I filter out wich packages installed takes up most of my space?? is there a way?
[09:26] <ashika> roryy: Change it to the number of the default OS to boot?
[09:26] <XyZ> kitche, i think i'm must to do something like list of all pakages on mirror
[09:26] <roryy> ashika: indeed
[09:26] <Neftalena> ok thanx jason

[09:28] <rcarr> multiple kernels?
[09:28] <Kingsqueak> sunganes: k, see what starchaser just told you then
[09:28] <hithere2> anyone here?
[09:28] <jatt> no
[09:28] <sunganes> starchaser: k thanks will start there
[09:28] <Luke> My avahi daemon does not start even when I tell it to via the services window. how do I get avahi to start?
[09:28] <Murrlin> ok correction, the congigurer pauses a long time before displaying itself fully, other than that, the rest of the stuff still applies.
[09:28] <ashika> rcarr: if that was to me no they're all same kernel numbers
[09:28] <Murrlin> what can I do?
[09:28] <roryy> ashika: i'm guessing one of the set is commented out -- that's the 'AUTOMAGIC' kernels list
[09:28] <ashika> roryy: So when counting for default would I include those?
[09:28] <roryy> ashika: no
[09:28] <hithere2> is there any IRc client for Ubuntu other than xchat that is a GUI based IRC client?
[09:28] <vivabenfica> hi. trying to get ubuntu, xp, mandriva triple boot going. please see http://pastebin.ulteo.us/236. will what i have there work?
[09:29] <vivabenfica> hithere2: gaim
[09:29] <ashika> roryy: So by default windows is 3 then? Since the two ubuntu
[09:29] <Murrlin> hithere2: like chatzilla? part of firefox
[09:29] <roryy> ashika: only uncommented ones; i'd guess any 'title' entry without any '#' in front, but I'm not 100% sure
[09:29] <Murrlin> oh yeah and gaim ^_^
[09:29] <rcarr> Ashika: Odd, have you done any tweaking to the initramfs, like install some new graphical bootsplash or  something
[09:29] <hithere2> Murrlin chatzilla?
[09:29] <rcarr> Ashika: Beyond that, no ideas
[09:29] <roryy> ashika: 1) it counts from 0, and 2) i'm not sure if the 'Divider' counts as an entry
[09:29] <starchaser> murrlin -> you tried doing  "ifdown eth0"  and then "ifup eth0" ?
[09:29] <Kingsqueak> hithere2: apt-cache search IRC | grep client
[09:29] <ashika> rcarr: No, none tweaking whatsoever
[09:29] <roryy> ashika: but it should be either 2 or 3
[09:29] <bingnet922> Hi channel, my /etc/cron.* jobs run as expected, but new entries to /etc/crontab (system crontab, I think) do not run. I created the cron jobs via kcron and checked syntax in /etc/crontab. My new jobs should run as root and the command given has no errors when copied to the prompt manually. What am I missing? I've never set up a crontab before.
[09:29] <starchaser> or maybe just "ifconfig"
[09:30] <hithere2> exit
[09:30] <Murrlin> starchaser: hrmm.
[09:30] <starchaser> bignet922 ->  su as root.  and then do crontab -e   - see if your cron entries are there.
[09:30] <kitche> !root
[09:30] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:31] <rcarr> !ubotu
[09:31] <fbc> When I come out of standby or suspend my wireless stops working. Can somone give the command to restart the wireless netwroking service?
[09:31] <ashika> roryy: Doesn't recovery count as an os
[09:31] <starchaser> oh sorry.  i meant  just  "sudo crontab -e"
[09:32] <roryy> ashika: yeah, so 0 for normal ubuntu, 1 for recovery, 2 for the separator (possibly) and 3 for windows
[09:32] <Murrlin> ifup 'couldnt read /etc/network/interfaces'
[09:32] <Murrlin> but I can less it just fine
[09:32] <ashika> roryy: But ubuntu and recovery are listed like this: ubuntu, recovery, ubuntu, seperator, windows
[09:32] <Kingsqueak> Murrlin: you ran ifup via sudo, as root right?
[09:32] <roryy> ashika: hrm. do you see three ubuntu entries when you boot up?
[09:33] <ashika> roryy: Automagic isn't uncommented
[09:33] <starchaser> murrlin ->  tried it using "sudo" , and in "sudo ifdown eth0"     and then "sudo ifup eth0"?
[09:33] <Murrlin> yes
[09:33] <ashika> roryy: I see 2 normal 2 recovery
[09:33] <Murrlin> let me see
[09:33] <nuts`> hum guys, is there a faster viewer utility for PDFs then Acrobat Reader?
[09:33] <Kingsqueak> Murrlin: did you change that file or something?
[09:33] <Murrlin> bbs
[09:33] <abo> nuts`, try xpdf
[09:33] <starchaser> fbc - > if your wireless is on eth1 , just do a "sudo ifdown eth1", "sudo ifup eth1"
[09:33] <roryy> ah, in that case *counts* windows is 4 or 5
[09:33] <ashika> roryy: It would be so much easier if it said in the list which number windows was :/
[09:33] <Murrlin> kings: nothhing but having to reactivate network every startup
[09:34] <starchaser> failing that do a "ifconfig" to figure out what your wireless card is on.
[09:34] <roryy> ashika: well, you can just count there
[09:34] <Murrlin> during startup, I get 'failed' on both network lines
[09:34] <Murrlin> starting basic networking, and um... the other one
[09:34] <starchaser> nuts -> xpdf
[09:34] <ashika> roryy: We forgot to include memtest xD so its 5 or 6
[09:34] <roryy> ashika: ah, right, sorry
[09:34] <roryy> ashika: anyway, you've got the idea
[09:35] <killown> how I set gdm as default ?
[09:35] <killown> how I set gdm as default login manager?  sorry! for repeat
[09:36] <rcarr> sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
[09:36] <starchaser> murrlin -> have a look at /etc/network/interfaces
[09:36] <rcarr> should give you the option to set it as default
[09:36] <killown> thanks rcarr
[09:36] <nuts`> starchaser: thks^
[09:36] <Murrlin> starkruzr: alright, what should I check for?
[09:36] <ashika> roryy:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32594/ as you can see they are exact duplicates. So should I remove the duplicates or can that cause no boot.
[09:36] <lifepositive> hi
[09:36] <Murrlin> perhaps... I dont know how the permissions could've gotten borked
[09:36] <lifepositive> i removed a program and it said it also removed ubuntu-desktop.  What exactly is ubuntu-desktop used for?
[09:37] <ashika> roryy: Ah I discovered the difference! first set is kernel: 27 second set is .26
[09:37] <ashika> roryy: So should I remove second set or leave it be?
[09:37] <Greyscale> <E[m] ess> <nekomata> [XX]  kdesu desu desu desu desu desu~
[09:37] <Greyscale> <E[m] ess> <nekomata> [XX]  </sekibuntu>
[09:37] <Vuen_> hey guys, i set up my computer to use the BSOD screensaver, but the fonts are wrong on most of the BSODs. it's not very convincing.
[09:37] <Vuen_> anyone know how i can set up the proper fonts?
[09:37] <roryy> ashika: leave it
[09:38] <roryy> ashika: if you uninstall the older kernel it should automatically be removed
[09:38] <Greyscale> Vuen_, hahaha, such effort just to emulate what we escape.
[09:38] <starchaser> murrlin ->  yeah - check the permissions.
[09:38] <ashika> roryy: Sorry to sound like an idiot but from where?
[09:38] <starchaser> mine are "drwxr-xr-x"
[09:38] <roryy> ashika: as in, 'sudo aptitude remove linux-2.6.15-26-386'
[09:38] <Murrlin> root r/w, group r, other r
[09:38] <roryy> ashika: or something similar
[09:39] <gsonic> hi
[09:39] <ashika> roryy: No gui way?
[09:39] <roryy> ashika: use synaptic, and remove that package
[09:39] <gsonic> im trying to flood a gmail account of spam but suscribing to newsletters isnt fast enough
[09:39] <Murrlin> and the d is what?
[09:39] <gsonic> anyone knows a more efficient way?
[09:39] <roryy> ashika: or, just leave it.
[09:39] <starchaser> murrlin -> sounds fine.   maybe post your query on the ubuntu forums. you'll need to post any output from dmesg that might be useful.
[09:39] <starchaser> and the contents of your "interfaces" file.
[09:39] <jatt> gsonic: why do you want such thing?
[09:39] <fbc> starchaser:  thanks I'll try that..
[09:40] <starchaser> d -> directory.
[09:40] <gsonic> jatt: for experimentation
[09:40] <jatt> of what
[09:40] <Murrlin> hrm
[09:40] <smoenux> !samba
[09:40] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[09:40] <gsonic> i noticed gmail does not permit infinite fowarding, i.e account 1>>fwd>>acocunt2>>fwd>>account 1
[09:41] <agent> using debootstrap, i get error "FATAL: kernel too old" when trying to  "chroot /ubuntu mount -t proc proc /proc" - how to get around this problem when installing a new kernel on host pc is out of the question?
[09:41] <ashika> roryy: Solver thankyou
[09:41] <gsonic> anyone knows of a internet utility to flood emails or something like that
[09:41] <starchaser> ubotu -> you can also just do "Places -> Network servers" in Gnome.  works for me.
[09:42] <gsonic> or putting an email somewhere where it'd be easilly be flood
[09:42] <roryy> ashika: np
[09:42] <ashika> gsonic: I haven't been here long but I don't think thats allowed
[09:42] <Murrlin> I'm not sure how to set the d, starchaser
[09:42] <Murrlin> I've got -rwxr-xr-x
[09:43] <ashika> roryy: Is that allowed talking of flooders and or hacking tools?
[09:43] <agent> gsonic: what exactly do you want? to flood others or to be flooded yourself?
[09:43] <starchaser> murrlin ->  ah.
[09:43] <gsonic> agent: to flood a fake gmail account i created
[09:43] <gsonic> massjunk@gmail.com
[09:43] <roryy> ashika: probably not. just ignore it
[09:43] <ashika> roryy: In Add/Remove when it says show commercial programs does it mean programs you have to pay for or are trials?
[09:44] <roll> i have downladed a rpm file
[09:44] <agent> gsonic: why and from what?
[09:44] <mike_> need help with kopete in gnome please, sound wont work
[09:44] <roryy> ashika: I think it means programs like Opera, which are (as I understand) completely closed source
[09:44] <roll> how can I inSTALL IT ?
[09:44] <roll> this rpm is an extension for php
[09:44] <gsonic> from anything that'll create massive amounts of mail or space usage
[09:44] <mike_> any ideas?
[09:44] <roll> i did rpm -i json.rpm
[09:44] <gsonic> to see how fast i can flood it
[09:45] <roll> how can I see that's inside the rpm ?
[09:45] <roll> can I extract the rpm ?
[09:45] <freemind> hello mates - is there any realtime traffic grapher for gnome? I found alot of tools, but no realtime output there :( I'm just looking for something like "du-meter" under win#
[09:45] <blue-frog> gsonic: think you should join #bored-to-death-have-nothing-better-to-do...
[09:45] <agent> gsonic: you cant really do what you want - i mean, it would be easy to do what you want but then you would be banned at gmail or even worse, banned from using your internet by your isp if gmail reports you :D
[09:45] <jrib> roll: what are you trying to install exactly?
[09:46] <mike_> can i have help gettign sound to work 100% it wont work in kopete chat
[09:46] <Seveas> freemind, there's probably a gdesklet that does that for you
[09:46] <gsonic> agent: I think youre exagerating the problem
[09:46] <lifepositive> I have a toolbar in firefox, the toolbar just under the URL toolbar!  and on that toolbar I have dragged some websites saved there!  Where is that stored on the hard drive as I want to move that file to the new firefox I installed?  Anyone know pls?
[09:46] <jrib> roll: if it's json, there are php4-json and php5-json packages in the repositories
[09:47] <agent> gsonic: no, you want to spam your own account as much as possible, right? if so, then no i am not :)
[09:47] <freemind> Seveas, I know - I've tested it out. When I'm downloading with 600kb, this gdesklet just shows "5,2mb/s" every 3 seconds - that isnt realtime?
[09:47] <starchaser> murrlin -> sorry. i was reading the perms of the directorys in that folder.  my interfaces is the same as yours...  just rw-r-r
[09:47] <roll> yea, my situation is this.

[09:49] <roll> do you mean
[09:49] <starchaser> roll -> or just use synaptic.
[09:49] <jrib> roll: you can use apt-get as starchaser said or you can use system > administration > synaptic
[09:50] <grimboy> roll, on the command line

[09:53] <Seveas> gracias
[09:53] <jrib> no problemo
[09:54] <roll> my question is: apt-get install php5 will replace the current php.ini ?
[09:54] <Murrlin> it's fixed :) thanks starchaser
[09:54] <Seveas> roll, no
[09:54] <starchaser> roll -> just checked my /etc dir - my php4 ini is in /etc/php4/apache2/   , so i guess that php5 will install into /etc/php5/

[09:58] <CPrgmSwR2> I just wish ubuntu had more packages in its package system - I understand it has close to 20,000 packages but many of those are packages that are split up like install php is split into 10 packages
[09:58] <RegalEagle> Seveas: Could you help me to install it? >_>
[09:58] <Seveas> RegalEagle, apt-get install eggdrop
[09:58] <RegalEagle> Seveas: Did that already
[09:58] <Seveas> RegalEagle, then it's installed 
[09:58] <CPrgmSwR2> its sudo apt-get install eggdrop
[09:58] <smoenux> starchaser, when I open, Network Servers -> Windows Network, I get nothing ... it worked yesterday ?
[09:58] <starchaser> CPrgmSwR2 -> thats just the php modules - you and pick and choose what you want.
[09:58] <RegalEagle> Seveas: How do I configure it and get it connected?
[09:59] <Seveas> RegalEagle, browse through /usr/share/doc/eggdrop
[09:59] <Seveas> RegalEagle, and a word of warning: bots are NOT welcome here
[09:59] <CPrgmSwR2> I relize that
[09:59] <Atmospherian> i am trying to install the development packages for OpenGL and when i try to apply the packages it says that it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop, xorg, and other stuff which is preety important.
[09:59] <starchaser> CPrgmSwR2 ->  check ubuntuguide.   have you added the PLF repos?
[09:59] <RegalEagle> Seveas: I wasnt going to connect it here, but I need to know how to configure it and get it on my network :/
[10:00] <CPrgmSwR2> yes I have
[10:00] <CPrgmSwR2> before I had 5,000 packages
[10:00] <Seveas> RegalEagle, then my advise of browsing through /usr/share/doc/eggdrop still stands
[10:00] <Seveas> (you can read that as: I don't know it :))
[10:00] <RegalEagle> Seveas: ok :|
[10:00] <CPrgmSwR2> then I enabled the multiverse and I forget the other one
[10:00] <CPrgmSwR2> but I got like 19,xxx packages
[10:01] <starchaser> CprgsWr2 -> there are other repos out there , but they are very unofficial and could bork your install when you come to doing an upgrade.
[10:01] <beligum> Hi guys, I need your help on a VERY offtopic question: What's the wishlist of a (rock)band called again?
[10:01] <CPrgmSwR2> Thats what I don't like about it starchaser
[10:01] <CPrgmSwR2> And I am voicing it so mabye someone to request that to be changed in ubuntu
[10:02] <smallfoot-> Please help add computer hardware manufacturers who are Linux/FOSS/competition/etc friendly or unfriendly to http://vendors.bluwiki.org/
[10:02] <CPrgmSwR2> my personal belief is that ubuntu has the greatest chance of having non computer users adoption linux
[10:02] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: hey hey
[10:02] <CPrgmSwR2> I think gyachi should be one of the top packages in the list since it is a yahoo client with webcam support
[10:02] <gnomefreak> hi
[10:03] <snowshoefox> What package do i need to install to get mkinitrd on my system?
[10:03] <starchaser> CprgmSwR2 ->  your extra packages could well be in future versions.   you asked about this in ubuntuforums - or the ubuntu wiki?
[10:03] <Atmospherian> how do i install the development packages without removing the vital system stuff?
[10:03] <starchaser> they do need people to test stuff.
[10:03] <Zaggynl> Is it possible to run Beryl with Dapper with the newest Nvidia driver?
[10:03] <abo> CPrgmSwR2, the fact that mp3, wmv.. and other nonfree media are not supported of the the box, makes all non-computer ppl not install ubuntu
[10:03] <CPrgmSwR2> Simple I am just not using ubuntu
[10:03] <gnomefreak> Zaggynl: ask in #ubuntu-xgl but no i think you need xgl also
[10:04] <Zaggynl> ah thanks
[10:04] <kitche> Zaggynl: yes you don't even need XGL

[10:17] <xelados> My goal is to mount it with 777 permissions, but everything I've tried hasn't worked. "mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/backup -O rw,user,noauto" was the last setup I tried.
[10:17] <Seveas> clemyeats, I'm beginning to think it's not stored in there
[10:17] <xelados> I've also tried "umask=0000" and "mode=0777". Made sure the mount point was chmodded to 777, as well.
[10:17] <gnomefreak> dope12345: yes when you go to packages.ubuntu.com and choose your distro than choose your package the page will show all depends
[10:17] <starchaser> kevin ->  yes.   installed it on a T43 thinkpad the other day.
[10:17] <clemyeats> Seveas: I've looked everywhere :)
[10:17] <sn0n> anyone else having firefox crashing often with the updates from the other night?
[10:17] <gnomefreak> dope12345: they will be there witha  red dot
[10:18] <Flannel> Clin1: that means that that image isn't there.  What URL are you going to at that time?  (and can you do an ls -l of your /images/ folder?)
[10:18] <Kevin`> starchaser thanks, makes it easier on me then :)
[10:18] <Seveas> clemyeats, including a file named .directory in the folder with the custom emblem?
[10:18] <clemyeats> Seveas: I can see the xml files in the home folder.. but it has to be somewhere in the db right ?
[10:18] <jrib> xelados: are you unmounting and remounting when you retry?  umask=0000 should work
[10:18] <Clin1> The images are their i can see the physical files
[10:18] <xelados> jrib, yeah, I'll go through the process again and see if it'll work.
[10:18] <Clin1> hold on il try a ls
[10:18] <xelados> Should I put the options in /etc/fstab?
[10:19] <lifepositive> gnomefreak: do you work? :)  or are you here 24/7? ;)
[10:19] <Clin1> Yes i can get an ls of the images il past it
[10:19] <gnomefreak> lifepositive: that is offtopic and yes i work
[10:19] <clemyeats> Seveas: what's the syntax for the .directory file ?
[10:19] <web-on> Hi everybody
[10:19] <MojOrow> would anyone know of a program that can be used to organize a life
[10:19] <jrib> xelados: sure.  Try to put all the switches in the beginning of your command and end with <device> <mount point> too (don't know if it matters)
[10:19] <fbc> How do I get the wireless network manager back on my tray? I told it to REMOVE by mistake. I want it back..
[10:19] <Seveas> clemyeats, nvm, it's a KDE specific thing
[10:19] <sn0n> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32602/

[10:20] <bingnet922> starchaser: I found the problem with cron, my command contained 'date...' instead of '/bin/date...' Thanks for getting me on the right path! 1 more ? for all, what's the difference between system cron (/etc/crontab) and root crontab (/?)? I noticed that kcron contains an additional parameter for the system crontab in the cron tree: "run as (user)" which prepends the command line in the crontab with the user name as in * * * * * user com
[10:21] <jrib> sn0n: does it happen all the time no matter what page you visit or do the pages all have flash?
[10:21] <xelados> Crap.. still 744, or whatever it is that's rwxr-xr-x
[10:21] <Flannel> xelados: 755 ;)  4,2,1

[10:22] <Flannel> Clin1: and the permissions on /images/ itself?
[10:22] <fmasi> some one can tell me how can i use lame options in soud juicer
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> is there anything similar to the windows search applet available for xfce/thunar/gtk?
[10:22] <jrib> xelados: what is the line in your fstab?

[10:23] <starchaser> a schedule?  like a timetable.    hmmm..  not sure.  they're more like Outlook.
[10:23] <Flannel> Clin1: and your site configuration?
[10:23] <Clin1> hu, which one
[10:24] <starchaser> fbc ->  right click on the panel - > add to panel ->  add the network monitoring applet.
[10:24] <Clin1> httpd or apache2
[10:24] <sn0n> what does    sudo touch /forcefsck     get accomplished ?
[10:24] <Kingsqueak> forces an fsck on reboot
[10:24] <Flannel> Clin1: er, you're using apache 1, not apache2, do you have an apache2 config?
[10:24] <jrib> xelados: sudo umount /mnt/backup && sudo mount -a
[10:24] <nolimitsoya> ok, say i want to copy all files with the ending .mp3 and .wma contained within a tree, keeping their relative paths, to another location. how would i do that?
[10:24] <Clin1> yes i have an apache 2 config
[10:24] <sn0n> jrib, which is?
[10:25] <eugman> anyone know if i810switch will work for s-video or just vga?
[10:25] <jrib> sn0n: hmm?

[10:25] <sn0n> jrib, whats a fsck
[10:25] <snide> hey guys :D
[10:26] <nolimitsoya> sn0n, its the tool used to check a filesystem
[10:26] <jrib> sn0n: type  'whatis fsck'  in a terminal
[10:26] <RegalEagle> What's the command to copy a file from one dir to another in terminal?
[10:26] <Seveas> RegalEagle, cp
[10:26] <sn0n> hrmm.. ok, i'll see if that fixes firefox
[10:26] <RegalEagle> thanks
[10:26] <nolimitsoya> RegalEagle, cp
[10:26] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: need more info as in the current path and the destination path
[10:26] <jrib> !cli > RegalEagle
[10:26] <snide> i gotta say that im impressed with the ubuntu because it is the only linux os that worked for me, its able to print / connect to my isp for internet /
[10:26] <aimtrainer> hi! Soemhow I cant write "d" in my console. In other applications the d-key doess work - anybody an idea?
[10:26] <fbc> starchaser: I don't see it anywhere on the list.
[10:26] <eugman> RegalEagle, you should do a search or install RUTE it's a linux manual that covers alot of the basics.
[10:26] <jrib> xelados: still the same permissions?
[10:26] <clemyeats> Seveas: what's the log file for gconf ? maybe we'll see the key while changing the emblem graphically...
[10:27] <fbc> starchaser:  I remember it was version 6.2
[10:27] <xelados> jrib, /mnt/backup didn't seem to even mount.. but it's in my /etc/fstab
[10:27] <HUNK> for these two days of bloody frustration im free to say that ubuntu sucks... ffs i smashed 2 keyboards just trying to connect to internet, and i still havent succedeed
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> Kingsqueak, /home/nolimitsoya/Music/<loads of subdirs> is their current home, and /home/nolimitsoya/Lab would be the destination.
[10:27] <Clin1> What are your thoughts
[10:27] <fmasi> some one can help me with lame options under sound juicer
[10:27] <Seveas> clemyeats, I don't think it has one
[10:27] <snide> however theres only one problem, which is graphic one .. i already have downloaded a driver from nvidia (amd64 one) but when i double click it and even typed sh nvidiablahblah in console .. none worked, wont install the latest nvidia driver.
[10:27] <clemyeats> ok
[10:27] <jrib> xelados: sudo mount /mnt/backup     then, I guess it doesn't do nouato stuff
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> Kingsqueak, though i cant see why you need it. just give me an idea if the principle, and ill adapt it
[10:27] <Vladdy> how do I build a kernel like ubuntu does?
[10:27] <Clin1> Flannel, nickle for your thoughts
[10:28] <Vladdy> apt-get source linux doesn't give me right result :S
[10:28] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: it would be easier to do  cp -R /home/nolimitsoya/Music  /home/nolimitsoya/Lab   then clean up what isn't wanted
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> Kingsqueak, thats not an option, im afraid.
[10:28] <HUNK> can someone pls help me get connected to internet on 6.10 ubuntu
[10:28] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: because I was going to give you the command
[10:28] <xelados> Awesome, it worked! If I want this to mount every time I boot up (X)ubuntu, I just remove "noauto" from fstab, right?
[10:28] <jrib> xelados: right
[10:28] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: why not?
[10:28] <snide> hunk you are connected to internet since ur using this xcire
[10:28] <snide> xchat i mean
[10:28] <Clin1> Flannel, are you getting information
[10:28] <RegalEagle> Ok, how do I not have permission to edit other users stuff when Im an admin?
[10:29] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: You could use find to get all the ones ending in .mp3 or .flac
[10:29] <Stormx2> sorry, wma
[10:29] <xelados> jrib, Alright. thanks. You saved me a lot of confusion. :)
[10:29] <HUNK> snide im in win -.-
[10:29] <jrib> xelados: np
[10:29] <nolimitsoya> Kingsqueak, the directory is several hundreds of gigabyte, and the files i want are just a fraction of those.
[10:29] <Kingsqueak> Stormx2: the issue becomes creating all the subdirs in the target
[10:29] <grimboy> Is there anyway to dynamically change the ServerLayout for Xorg?
[10:29] <agent> is there a way to bypass "kernel is too old" when doing chroot?
[10:29] <HUNK>  hi :), im preety much new to ubuntu and i just cant get it to connect to internet, I swaped DNS' with open ones, enabled DHCP on my ELCON Comborouter ADSL2253EU, i turned off ipv6 and it still wont wotk in mozilla nor any other web based
[10:29] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, yes, but how would i use that output to copy only those files, keeping their relative paths?
[10:29] <Seveas> agent, upgrade the kernel
[10:30] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: o.k. so why keep the subdir structure, categories?
[10:30] <agent> Seveas: besides upgrading the kernel ;)
[10:30] <nolimitsoya> Kingsqueak, yes
[10:30] <Stormx2> HUNK: Tried pinging, etc?
[10:30] <grimboy> And by dynamically I mean on the fly.
[10:30] <HUNK> yes
[10:30] <Clin1> HUNK make sure port 80 is open
[10:30] <HUNK> pinged router
[10:30] <HUNK> responds
[10:30] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: o.k. hmm
[10:30] <HUNK> port 80 is open
[10:30] <HUNK> every port is open on my router
[10:30] <Clin1> whaat about on the router
[10:30] <Clin1> ok on the pc
[10:30] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: gimme a bit
[10:30] <Clin1> do you have a fire wall instaled
[10:31] <Stormx2> HUNK: Try pinging google.com, etc?
[10:31] <HUNK> dunno for nux but in win zone alarm has 2-3 standard opened ports
[10:31] <HUNK> 80 etc
[10:31] <Clin1> dual boting>
[10:31] <Clin1> ?
[10:31] <Vladdy> hmm, apt-get linux-source :O
[10:31] <HUNK> yes
[10:31] <starchaser> hunk ->  tried turning off the firewall on your router (briefly)?
[10:31] <Stormx2> HUNK: You don't need to open ports just to use the internet...
[10:32] <Clin1> actuly you do in firefox in windows firefox will haang if not open
[10:32] <HUNK> hmmm i dont think shuting down routers fw is a good idea :?
[10:32] <Clin1> not advising
[10:32] <xelados> HUNK, to my knowledge NAT firewalls can interfere with a lot of things.
[10:32] <HUNK> i havent pinged google tho
[10:33] <HUNK> hmmm gonna check asap
[10:33] <Clin1> Where did my support guy run off too
[10:33] <starchaser> hunk ->  just turn off any windows machines you have first.  then bring the firewall down.
[10:33] <grimboy> Is there any way to change the ServerLayout for Xorg on-the-fly or does it need to be done by changing xorg.conf and restarting xorg?
[10:33] <Clin1> Flannel Please respond
[10:33] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: hmm sorry, going to leave before I can finish this.  basically you do a 'find <directory> -type f -name *.mp3' to get all the mp3 files, then you have to use sed or basename or something to just get the filename itself, then you need to test to see if the target dir path exists, if not, you need to make it (this is the pain in the neck part), then copy the file to the new dir destination
[10:33] <Vladdy> most of them have to be in xorg.conf
[10:33] <Vladdy> but resolution can be changed with krandrtray
[10:33] <niktaris> hi, can I add the keyboard indicator to the gnome panel via the command line ?
[10:34] <Clin1> Yes, nik
[10:34] <Clin1> niktaris you can
[10:34] <HUNK> hmmm i have nat in my router settings it sais someting about port trigerring etc nothing about fws
[10:34] <Clin1> but i dont know the code
[10:34] <nolimitsoya> Kingsqueak, ok, thank you :)
[10:34] <niktaris> Clin1, nice. and what's the command ?
[10:34] <HUNK> virtual servers, DNZ etc...
[10:34] <Kingsqueak> nolimitsoya: the 'trap' is making new dir trees is a bit of an annoying loop to write
[10:35] <Clin1> No sure ive just seen my friend use the terminal for everyhting including that
[10:35] <starchaser> hunk -> can you ping the router from ubuntu?
[10:35] <HUNK> yes
[10:35] <HUNK> it responds
[10:35] <FAZ> identify
[10:35] <niktaris> Clin1, lol. would be nice to know the code though..
[10:35] <starchaser> what the ip address of the router?
[10:35] <Clin1> God i need to step down......
[10:35] <HUNK> it asings me an adress through DHCP

[10:38] <snide> And I'm not one of staffs, by the way.
[10:38] <dudanogueira> fbc, its for gnome. in most cases it works sweet with the wireless device, in some cases, need some messing up
[10:38] <Clin1> It wont let anything open or the folder itsself nothing works in it or on it
[10:38] <fbc> dudanogueira:  Sorry, I already have it installed.. how do I get it to come up?

[10:40] <_feh_> wait what is i6 MB in KB's?
[10:40] <nolimitsoya> dudanogueira, a flag for doing archiving. having it set simplifies incremental backups and complicated tree breakouts
[10:40] <dudanogueira> fbc, running from terminal is a good way for debugging
[10:40] <_feh_> 1600 KB?

[10:41] <Rav|strangler> why does it say that
[10:41] <fbc> dudanogueira: thanks
[10:41] <Rav|strangler> it's not mounted anywhere
[10:41] <Rav|strangler> and I created a new windows folder.
[10:41] <puller> kitche,  i dont see any thing in kopete in there configuration to allow me to switch it
[10:41] <nolimitsoya> dudanogueira, fex, you could set the archive flag on all files in a directory, and have an archiver/copy unflag all files it parses to simplify spanning backups. or set the flags on only those files you wish to copy.
[10:41] <Clin1> Why is it when i get help they ether disconnect or dont respond,..... ticks me off
[10:41] <jrib> Clin1: yes, but I'm not sure I understand the problem yet.  Is it just that you can't access anything in the images folder on your website?
[10:41] <Flannel> Clin1: If you're editing your apache2 configuration, then that's the problem.  Your server is currently apache1, based on that error.
[10:42] <Clin1> wo nvm
[10:42] <dudanogueira> nolimitsoya, you can do that, but manually
[10:42] <abo> what is the irc command to get my nickname regged?

[10:42] <shini`> does ubuntu come with any tools for encoding audio? mp3/ogg anything?
[10:43] <eduhat> when i try to aptitude install fluxbox, it says it cant find any packages???
[10:43] <Flannel> Clin1: no... Since, that won't help.  Uninstall apache1, if you're using apache2, or uninstall apache2 if you're using apache1
[10:43] <georgy> shini`, yes
[10:43] <tonyyarusso> mabus: (Flannel) - is there a way to automatically do that, or would you have to look up the dependencies manually?
[10:43] <Flannel> eduhat: do you have universe enabled?
[10:43] <puller> anyone good with kopete messanger i need help!!!
[10:43] <shini`> georgy, What programs are these?
[10:43] <Clin1> fannel, thing is i only installed apache2 in synaptic
[10:43] <eduhat> Flannel: i dont think so
[10:43] <Flannel> tonyyarusso: um, I don't believe there is.
[10:43] <tonyyarusso> Nuts
[10:43] <Flannel> eduhat: then that's the first place to start,
[10:43] <Flannel> !universe | eduhat
[10:43] <agent> is there a way to bypass "kernel is too old" when doing chroot besides upgrading kernel?
[10:43] <ubotu> eduhat: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[10:43] <georgy> shini: what you wanna do ?
[10:43] <nolimitsoya> dudanogueira, i dont want to set up a script. i just want to find and copy every file with the ending .wma and .mp3 from within a directory several sublevels down, to another directory while maintaining relative paths. its a simple task with the windows search tools, but im having a hard time doing so in linux...
[10:43] <abo> kitche, Rav|strangler, it's not working!!
[10:43] <eduhat> Flannel: well how do i do that?
[10:44] <Flannel> Clin1: but, you installed apache1 at one point, then uninstalled it, right?
[10:44] <Flannel> eduhat: read the link uboty sent you
[10:44] <kitche> abo: nickserv should have sent you a message telling you how to register
[10:44] <Clin1> I dont think i ever installed that, oh wait that lampp thingi
[10:44] <Flannel> Clin1: lamp thingy?
[10:44] <Rav|strangler> "/msg nickserv register <password>
[10:44] <Clin1> um that wasa a third paarty script im not sure on uninstalling
[10:44] <Rav|strangler> sorry :-/
[10:44] <abo> kitche, didn't get anything... normaly I see a new tab or a popup...nothing
[10:45] <shini`> georgy, looking to encode some wavs into mp3 or ogg
[10:45] <Clin1> Apache Fruends
[10:45] <shini`> preferably mp3
[10:45] <georgy> shini : soundkonverter
[10:45] <kitche> abo: it's int he first window where you see everything when you connect
[10:45] <shini`> georgy, is that a kde package?
[10:45] <Flannel> Clin1: Ah, well, that's what you get for using a third party script ;) it mustve installed apache stuff (not apache2), you'll want to, in synaptic, look for everything that has apache in the name (not apache2) and remove it if it's for apache1 (you'll want to check descriptions, basically)
[10:45] <dudanogueira> nolimitsoya, this task could be performed with some line commands.. but in a graphic way, you can try AptOnCd. this program generates a iso with the apt ache or another file that you choose
[10:46] <Clin1> ok, thanks
[10:46] <georgy> shini : sudo pat-get install soundkonverter
[10:46] <shini`> ok
[10:46] <mabus> Flannel: what is sneakernet?
[10:46] <abo> kitche, ok you're right... it's saying this nickname is owned by someone else... weird I've been using it without registering ever since I have ubuntu ... no worries anyway :P
[10:46] <Clin1> HA, i did install it
[10:47] <_feh_> when I do sudo dpkg-reconfigure X I get package X not installed
[10:47] <nolimitsoya> dudanogueira, im trying to find a good way of doing this command line. 'cp `find -type f -name *.mp3` tmp' doesnt preserve relative paths though...
[10:47] <abo> kitche -NickServ- The nickname [ABO]  is already registered
[10:47] <_feh_> Do I need X and Xorg?
[10:47] <fre4k> can some one help me with a broken package.. i'm not able to upgrade
[10:47] <Flannel> mabus: sneakernet is when you use your sneakers (shoes) to transfer stuff between computers
[10:47] <kitche> abo use a new nick :)
[10:48] <gnomefreak> fre4k: sudo apt-get -f install
[10:48] <RegalEagle> How do I unzip a gz to another users folder?
[10:48] <nolimitsoya> RegalEagle, just use sudo
[10:48] <Clin1> fanel what is the start command for apache 2
[10:48] <fre4k> gnomefreak: i did that ..but it didn't help
[10:48] <_feh_> brb, going to try and reboot with new xorg conf and see if that works
[10:48] <Flannel> Clin1: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[10:48] <gnomefreak> fre4k: without a package name?
[10:48] <RegalEagle> nolimitsoya: sudo gzip filename?
[10:48] <Flannel> Clin1: with sudo, that is.
[10:48] <fre4k> gnomefreak: shall i paste the output some place
[10:49] <Flannel> RegalEagle: sudo -u username to write as them
[10:49] <fre4k> gnomefreak: mono ... i was trying to get the latest build
[10:49] <gnomefreak> fre4k: use pastebin please see bots message
[10:49] <djancak> hi, i just recently deleted 3 gigs of files, but ubuntu thinks my harddrive is still full. anybody know why?
[10:49] <gnomefreak> !pastebin
[10:49] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:49] <nolimitsoya> RegalEagle, id guess sudo gzip x <filename> /home/<other users name>/<folder you want it>
[10:49] <ctkroeker> djancak: try df
[10:50] <snide> haha!
[10:50] <djancak> ctkroeker: do you want me to show you the output of df?
[10:50] <snide> sometime I wonder if im invisable or not :D
[10:50] <Clin1> fannel, it seems to have gone though correctly but now it wont work
[10:50] <ctkroeker> djancak: does it show your partition as full?
[10:50] <kitche> RegalEagle: you can use gunzip it's just easier instead of doing gzip -x
[10:50] <Clin1> it wont even go to homepage
[10:50] <fre4k> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32605/
[10:51] <djancak> ctkroeker: yes.
[10:51] <snide> hey guys, can any of you send me a file (any file except virus / spyware) for connection test purpose?
[10:51] <puller> can i have help with kopete
[10:51] <Flannel> puller: you might try #kubuntu
[10:51] <Clin1> snide i will
[10:51] <snide> alright awesome!
[10:51] <puller> Flannel, but i am using kopete in gnome
[10:51] <ctkroeker> djancak: have you installed a lot of stuff with apt latelty? If so do "sudo apt-get autoclean"
[10:51] <Luke> My avahi daemon does not start even when I tell it to via the services window. how do I get avahi to start?
[10:52] <LjL> puller, it was a suggestion - you can ask about any kind of ubuntu here ;) just in #kubuntu they might know more about it
[10:52] <HUNK> come on peeps... listen ive got Elcon Combo Router 2253ADSLEU atached to my network card integrated on k8nf9 motherboard with nf4 chipset, i use opendns both in resolv.conf and routers settings, ubuntu version is 6.10
[10:52] <Flannel> puller: #kubuntu deals with kde apps a lot more than we do, it's a kopete issue, most likely, not a gnome one
[10:52] <Clin1> sinide accept
[10:52] <snide> where?
[10:52] <Flannel> puller: you're welcome to ask here, but really, you're more likely to get people who know what might be happening in #kubuntu
[10:52] <Clin1> its trying to send
[10:52] <djancak> ctkroeker: okay, i just did that. but it did not make a difference
[10:52] <ctkroeker> djancak: optionally "sudo apt-get clean" to clean out package files that have been installed
[10:52] <snide> interesting . . lemma check
[10:52] <Clin1> waiting for transfer to begin
[10:52] <ctkroeker> djancak: It won't uninstall anything
[10:53] <starchaser> HUNK -> whats "opendns"?  i just use the dns values that my ISP gives to my router.
[10:53] <RegalEagle> This isnt working at all >_>
[10:53] <M-Saunders> join #canonical
[10:53] <M-Saunders> Oops
[10:53] <snide> clinci, in my perference settings i already have checked the auto accept box
[10:53] <Otacon22> HI all, I have a TV pci card on my pc with ubuntu and I have installed "zapping", a package to see the tv by tv card, all work correctly, bui I can see the video but I can't listen the audio, why?
[10:53] <djancak> ctkroeker: the thing is, i know i should have 3 gigs of free space because i just deleted a whole bunch of files
[10:53] <snide> hmm i wonder what have went wrong
[10:53] <FAZ> exit
[10:53] <Clin1> its holding at waiting to transfer
[10:54] <djancak> ctkroeker: i am going to try restarting. brb
[10:54] <rc-1> when i do gksudo gedit /etc/jvm the correct jDK is on top, but java --version produces 1.4.2
[10:54] <_feh_> hey guys, that sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg did not solve the problem
[10:54] <ctkroeker> djancak: Have you cleaned the Garbage bin?
[10:54] <_feh_> any other ides?
[10:54] <snide> i see, i just recently done setting up vairous apps and all but i think ill restart
[10:54] <ashika> Ho
[10:54] <snide> brb
[10:54] <ashika> Hi
[10:54] <snide> exit
[10:54] <gnomefreak> rc-1: sudo dpkg --configure java
[10:54] <toby> Hi
[10:54] <kung> gn8
[10:54] <gnomefreak> rc-1: choose 5.0
[10:54] <Luke> rc-1: update-java-alternatives
[10:54] <ashika> _feh_, whats the problem
[10:54] <Clin1> Fannel, still their
[10:54] <gnomefreak> rc-1: oops
[10:55] <toby> i have had problem with gxl
[10:55] <gnomefreak> rc-1: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[10:55] <_feh_> ashika: I have a ton of squiggly lines all over my screen, seems something is messed up in either x or gdm
[10:55] <Flannel> Clin1: does the new error have apache or apache2 in the server string?
[10:55] <_feh_> can't figure out the problem
[10:55] <Luke> rc-1: run update-java-alternatives from the command line and it will let you change the default
[10:55] <mabus> Flannel: oh, haha
[10:55] <Clin1> nope it wont connect ot the apache itseld
[10:55] <Clin1> i started apache
[10:55] <Clin1> apache2* but nothing
[10:55] <toby> I can't get it to run at all
[10:56] <ctkroeker> djancak: try "sudo rm -fr $HOME/.Trash/"
[10:56] <Clin1> http://cmweb.zapto.org/ << see if you can
[10:56] <kitche> toby: do you mean xgl?
[10:56] <mabus> What packages do I need to download to compile C source code?
[10:56] <RegalEagle> I need to be able to gunzip using the desktop interface instead of the terminal
[10:56] <mabus> And their dependencies
[10:56] <toby> yeah that it
[10:56] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell mabus about compile
[10:56] <RegalEagle> Because none of this terminal stuff is working for me
[10:56] <RegalEagle> I need to login as root >_>
[10:56] <kitche> toby: join #ubuntu-xgl they can help you out more
[10:56] <Luke> mabus: i think its called build tools
[10:56] <Luke> mabus: build-essentials
[10:56] <toby> is that a chat
[10:57] <LjL> -s
[10:57] <kitche> toby:; yes it's a channel on this network
[10:57] <_feh_> anybody here good with partitions?
[10:57] <toby> thanks
[10:57] <mabus> Luke: Yeah, but I am not installing from the internet or apt-get
[10:57] <RegalEagle> I need to be able to login as root, how do I do that?
[10:57] <Luke> mabus: ha sorry again: its really a package called build-essential
[10:57] <Luke> mabus: i'm not sure what you mean?
[10:57] <lasindi_alien> Hi everyone, I'm trying to install a Windows wireless driver with ndiswrapper. ndiswrapper -i <driver> and modprobe ndiswrapper both worked, but I can't find my network device with ifconfig. Is there anything I need to do to make it appear?
[10:57] <djancak> ctkroeker: restarting didnt do the trick :/
[10:57] <Clin1> regal egal use su
[10:57] <Kevin`> _feh_ no, none of the 900 people here has any idea what a partition is..
[10:57] <Luke> mabus: you can use Synaptic to install it
[10:57] <zorba64> RedKrieg: sudo -s
[10:57] <Clin1> feh i do
[10:57] <RegalEagle> No terminal
[10:58] <mabus> Luke: I want to download the packages on a windows box, and bring them to an offline out-of-the-box dapper installation.
[10:58] <RegalEagle> Terminal is bad for me >_>
[10:58] <mamzers555> _feh_; whats the problem
[10:58] <rc-1> i used the command to choose version
[10:58] <_feh_> i just did a fresh install and backed up all of my data from previous ubuntu versions on a separate partition, how do i reinstall ubuntu and keep the partition with my backed up data?
[10:58] <ctkroeker> djancak: did you try the command: sudo rm -fr $HOME/.Trash/
[10:58] <mabus> Luke: I'm at a library, I have no internet.
[10:58] <Clin1> i dont belive their is any onther way
[10:58] <Luke> mabus: ah... there is a way to search/download .deb packages online
[10:58] <rc-1> but java --version still returns 1.4.2
[10:58] <Luke> mabus: let me look for the site
[10:58] <_feh_> mamzers555: my screen is messed up so i guess I will try and reinstall to see if that fixes it
[10:58] <Clin1> do you have access to the other, if i under stand then just copy it over
[10:58] <mabus> Luke: Yes I got that far (packages.ubuntu.com) But I don't know what packages and dependencies I will need. it's no good to bring it home to find out I need something else.
[10:58] <djancak> ctkroeker: that worked, thanks!
[10:59] <starchaser> regaleagle ->   you can view gzip compressed files in nautilus.  just double click on them.
[10:59] <ctkroeker> djancak: did that free up your space?
[10:59] <Clin1> fannel, their? Got any idea
[10:59] <kitche> mabus: build-essential is what you want and it will say what dependencies it needs when you click the link to the information page
[10:59] <Luke> mabus: hmm... it should say what deps it has on the site
[10:59] <djancak> ctkroeker: yes. i now have 25% freespace instead of 0%
[10:59] <rc-1> i choose the version with the command line, but it still just returns 1.4.2
[10:59] <Otacon22> HI all, I have a TV pci card on my pc with ubuntu and I have installed "zapping", a package to see the tv by tv card, all work correctly, bui I can see the video but I can't listen the audio, why?
[10:59] <mamzers555> _feh_; so don't install ubuntu on the backup-partition, i don't understand the problem
[11:00] <ctkroeker> djancak: It's because you had files in the garbage bin that didn't have the right permissions. That command cleared out thos files
[11:00] <LjL> mabus, then you have a problem, because you can't know in advance which dependencies you already have and which ones you need to get
[11:00] <jvai> hipitihop, is aptoncd in the dapper repos?
[11:00] <pianoboy3333> Ok... I was ummm... ripping a cd, and uhhh... sound juicer just freakin crashed...
[11:00] <lifepositive> bigfuzzyjesus: you here?
[11:00] <mabus> LjL: Well as I said, it's out of the box.
[11:00] <rc-1> java --version
[11:00] <djancak> ctkroeker: i see. i will remember this. any idea why they wouldnt have the right permissions?
[11:00] <jason0_> Anyone here use the wavelan plugin for xfce? Mine says: "No such wavelan device" when I mouse over it.
[11:00] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: what do you need regarding your sound?
[11:00] <rc-1> Unrecognized option: --version
[11:00] <rc-1> Could not create the Java virtual machine.
[11:00] <rc-1> 3
[11:00] <mabus> LjL: So I'm sure the dependencies are well known.
[11:01] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ah, thanks, ok, take a look at http://piano.juicemedia.tv/junk/alsaprobs
[11:01] <mabus> Luke: build-essential isn't a package in and of itself.
[11:01] <kitche> rc-1:; it's just java -version
[11:01] <mabus> really
[11:01] <_feh_> mamzers555: I just did a fresh install of edgy maybe a week ago all was fine until my gf's daughter got on my computer today and I come to fiind out something is wrong, my screen now has a billion squiggly lines all over it and I can not figure out how to fix it. so I was thinking of just reinstalling to see if that fixes the problem?
[11:01] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: you said take a look as to why alsa isn't starting up with my computer -- it's also oss
[11:01] <rc-1> ah thanks
[11:01] <mabus> At least, if I download it from packages.ubuntu.com it won't have anything useful in it
[11:01] <kitche> mabus: it will tell you what you need though it's a meta package but it will show you what packages you need to be able to compile
[11:01] <_feh_> it looks like static sorta, but squiggly horizontal lines^
[11:01] <ctkroeker> djancak: no idea, depends from were you deleted them... depends on what use you had for them (maybe some system files among them?)
[11:02] <kitche> mabus: look at it's dependencies
[11:02] <Flannel> Clin1: in the future, make sure you highlight me.  It makes it a whole lot easier to follow you
[11:02] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: are you using your own kernel or a Ubuntu one?
[11:02] <mamzers555> _feh_; so install edgy again
[11:02] <crashzor> _feh_, try booting a live version first ..
[11:02] <djancak> ctkroeker: mostly just stuff i downloaded off websites
[11:02] <Clin1> fannel, whaat do you meana highlight
[11:02] <kitche> Clin1: say people's names
[11:02] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: an ubuntu one, latest in edgy -- 2.6.17-10-generic
[11:02] <_feh_> crashzor: whys that?
[11:02] <Flannel> Clin1: say my name (you keep missing an L) so I see your message.  Anyway, I can't connect to  http://cmweb.zapto.org/
[11:03] <Clin1> oh, k
[11:03] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: and which alsa version?
[11:03] <mamzers555> _feh_; if dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg don't work, maybe its the hardware
=== dv___ is now known as dv_
[11:03] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: are you compiling against the correct linux-headers-$(uname -r) ?
[11:03] <Clin1> because apache 2 did not start i dont hink installed the right package im donwnloaading the server
[11:03] <_feh_> mamzers555: well it does not have the lines on the startup screen only when i get to the gdm login
[11:03] <ctkroeker> djancak: weird, but at least your rid of it. I had the same problem once. Found the answer at http://ubuntuguide.org/ lot's of great hacks for ubuntu
[11:03] <_feh_> and when i boot to gnome or fluxbox
[11:03] <Clin1> i hade apache2-common not just apache2
[11:03] <crashzor> _feh_, if that don't fix it then you need to look @ you're hardware save's you a reinstall ;)
[11:03] <DJayC> Is there a way to install an older version of the beta nvidia driver using repositories?  9629 breaks glxinfo...  I need to install 9625... any way to do that?
[11:04] <mabus> kitche: oh wow... the recursive dependencies are going to make this not an option
[11:04] <_feh_> i see
[11:04] <mamzers555> _feh_; so put in your edgy cd and start it, if you have the livecd then test if it works with it
[11:04] <djancak> ctkroeker: thanks a lot :}
[11:04] <Clin1> fannel, this this is ticken me off bad. i just installed aapache2 and apache2-common
[11:04] <lifepositive> when I play videos from youtube, firefox doesnt play any sound!  Any fix please?
[11:04] <djancak> Clin1: Flannel, not fannel.
[11:04] <ctkroeker> djancak: Your welcome
[11:05] <Clin1> fannel ok in clipboaard
[11:05] <lifepositive> take that back! sound works :)
[11:05] <kitche> DJayC: 9629 isn't beta
[11:05] <lifepositive> brbn
[11:05] <lifepositive> brb
[11:05] <Clin1> crud
[11:05] <_feh_> k
[11:05] <Clin1> Flannel, my bad
[11:05] <kitche> Clin1 type part of the name and pree tab might work better
[11:05] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: how can I find my alsa verision?
[11:05] <DJayC> kitche: Okay, well I guess I just need to install the 9625 release.. for some reason 9629 doesn't work right.. glxinfo just seg faults
[11:05] <_feh_> brb
[11:06] <Flannel> !lamp | Clin1, this shows you exactly how to set up a LAMP stack
[11:06] <ubotu> Clin1, this shows you exactly how to set up a LAMP stack: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.

[11:06] <Flannel> sigh.  We lose ubotu again?
[11:06] <Clin1> kitche, i got it
[11:06] <Flannel> Oh, hey.  There's ubotu.
[11:06] <Flannel> Clin1: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
[11:06] <Flannel> Clin1: You should try purging them, then retrying.  But really, you need to remove apache1 entirely.  not just the apache meta package
[11:06] <Flannel> Clin1: er, not purging.  in synaptic it's "complete removal"
[11:06] <Clin1> wo hold on i cant read that fast
[11:06] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I believe it's 1.0.13
[11:06] <Flannel> Clin1: its not important, that URL is the important thing.
[11:06] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: yes
[11:07] <Clin1> k, thanks Flannel,
[11:07] <Flannel> Clin1: but, that's liable to be problematic if you still have apache1 installed
[11:07] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: and what do you mean by compiling agains the correct kernel version?
[11:07] <Clin1> i uninstalled apache1
[11:07] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: dpkg -l linux-headers-$(uname -r) |grep ^ii
[11:07] <ocdj> hi all, I'm having a problem with my wireless connection, it randomly stops responding and when I try to "ifdown eith1" to reset there is no response, anyone have any idea what's causing this?
[11:08] <Clin1> i hade perl and apache server installed i removed tham
[11:08] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: it returned: ii  linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic 2.6.17-10.33   Linux kernel headers for version 2.6.17 on x86/x86_64
[11:08] <starchaser> ocdj ->  maybe its not eth1 - if you have an aetheros chipset its ath0
[11:08] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: and what parameters did you pass to configure?
[11:08] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: configure when I compilied what?
[11:09] <starchaser> ocdj -> type "sudo ifconfig" to see what you have.
[11:09] <Flannel> Clin1: removing the meta package ("apache") doesn't remove the server itself, make sure you got it all.
[11:09] <DJayC> I guess my question is, if the repositories are at 9629, is there a way to request 9625 from the repository?
[11:09] <ocdj> starchaser: it's eth1 according to ifconfig...
[11:09] <DJayC> or a way to download the deb for it
[11:09] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: to my understanding I compiled the drivers with module-assistant, so whatever it passes I'd assume
[11:09] <starchaser> ocdj ->  did you do a "sudo"?  like "sudo ifdown eth1"?
[11:09] <ocdj> starchaser: yes
[11:10] <starchaser> ok ...   what happens if you do "ifup" instead?
[11:10] <starchaser> sudo ifup eth1
[11:10] <ocdj> haven't tried, I figured it wouldn't matter if eth1 wasn't brought down in the first place
=== PriceChild is now known as PriceChild_away
[11:11] <starchaser> ocdj-> if it was down already you wouldnt get a response.
[11:11] <Slart> Hello, I'm having trouble using alt-gr to write, for example, the at-sign in latest Ubuntu 64bit. The gnome keyboard config-application only gives me errors "Error activating XKB configuration". Can anyone help me with this?
[11:11] <ocdj> starchaser: ah it would just hang like that?
[11:11] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: unload all the alsa modules, then only modprobe the one you need
[11:11] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: then pastebin the error spew and dmesg|tail
[11:11] <starchaser> shouldnt just "hang"..
[11:12] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ok, how would I unload them all, just look at that file, and unload all those?
[11:12] <ocdj> starchaser: yea I figure it would at least quit eligantly without really doing anything
[11:12] <starchaser> yeah.  yer right.  i brought down my eth0 and when i tried to do it again i got a response.
[11:12] <snide> hey one of you pls try send a file to me (any file except virus or spwyare) for connection test purpose
[11:12] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: yes
[11:12] <starchaser> odd.
[11:13] <ocdj> the only way I can bring it back up is restarting
[11:13] <starchaser> any idea what your wireless card is?
[11:13] <ocdj> but when ubuntu shuts down it hangs on trying to bring down eth1 too =\
[11:13] <starchaser> eek..  that doesnt sound right.
[11:13] <_Spire_> ocdj: you can find out if you need to via lspci
[11:13] <ocdj> I forget off the top of my head, one sec
[11:13] <deema> anybody know why when I hibernate, and turn back on, it won't load, some kind of crash, so hibernate doesn't work.
[11:14] <snide> Guys, one of you please SEND me a file for connection test purpose. (Any file will do except virus and spyware.)
[11:14] <starchaser> deema ->  dont use hibernate so.
[11:14] <deema> ....
[11:14] <ocdj> pro wireless 2100
[11:14] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: well, already I can't sudo modprobe -r snd_seq_device, but sudo lsof /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/* returns no output
[11:14] <starchaser> ocdj ->  odd .  i'm on the next version -  intel pro wireless 2200
[11:15] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: sudo modprobe -r $(lsmod |grep ^snd |awk '{print $1}' |sort -r)
[11:15] <_Spire_> pianoboy3333: what's your problem (it sounds sort of familiar to me)
[11:15] <starchaser> ocdj -> fresh install or an upgrade?
[11:15] <pianoboy3333> _Spire_: alsa and oss, sound in general doesn't start up with the computer, the modules are unloaded
[11:15] <Clin1> flannel,  i guess it is installed right but now to test it, would you recomend restarting?
[11:15] <deema> anybody know why when I hibernate, and turn back on, it won't load, some kind of crash, so hibernate doesn't work.
[11:15] <ocdj> starchaser: nope, this started when I added some graphics acceleration to x windows...
[11:15] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I got FATAL: Module snd_timer is in use
[11:16] <ocdj> starchaser: which I can't see why would mess with anything network related
[11:16] <RegalEagle> I need to graphically unzip this conf file, no terminal stuff.
[11:16] <KDan> how would you get Java 1.4.2 installed on a 64-bit ubuntu server? Can't seem to find a 64-bit version provided by Sun anywhere
[11:16] <starchaser> ocdj -> it shouldnt.   what did you add  - graphics drivers?
[11:16] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: purge the alsa-modules-* package that was generated by module-assistant
[11:16] <ocdj> starchaser: xcompmgr
[11:16] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: then what
[11:17] <ocdj> and a couple things in xorg.conf
[11:17] <_Spire_> pianoboy3333: hmm. I guess that wasn't my problem - stuff that used oss didn't work at all. have you tried putting the modules in /etc/modules?
[11:17] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: run the compile and install by hand
[11:17] <starchaser> RegalEagle ->  Places -> Home  - browse to the file.  double click.  it'll open if you have the permissions to do so.
[11:17] <starchaser> ocdj ->  xcompgr?  is that the 3d desktop stuff like compiz?
[11:17] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: would the package be alsa-modules-2.6.17-10-generic?
[11:17] <LordMetroid> How do I search for a specific file in linux?
[11:18] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: the version seems strange, but sure
[11:18] <_Spire_> starchaser: xcompmgr does compositing, but no fancy effects like compiz
[11:18] <ocdj> sorta, it does shadowing and other eye candy like that
[11:18] <starchaser> LordMetroid -> find . -name "*.mp3"
[11:18] <ctkroeker> LordMetroid: locate
[11:18] <LordMetroid> thank you, really nice
[11:18] <teclo> Hello, when I click on a link in xchat, I'd like firefox to browse the site. How can I do that ?
[11:18] <_Spire_> LordMetroid: be sure to run updatedb first
[11:18] <KDan> how would you get Java 1.4.2 installed on a 64-bit ubuntu server? Can't seem to find a 64-bit version provided by Sun anywhere
[11:18] <starchaser> ocdj -> sounds like you need to roll it back - i hope you have a copy of your old xorg.conf.
[11:19] <_Spire_> teclo: I don't use xchat myself, but you could look in the preferences
[11:19] <ocdj> starchaser: yea I do
[11:19] <xenoNfluX> I need help getting sendmail working properly, anyone here familiar enough?
[11:19] <Clin1> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH FLANNEL THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:19] <teclo> _Spire_: ok, gonna try
[11:19] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: should I purge alsa-driver too?
[11:19] <pianoboy3333> and what about alsa-base...?
[11:19] <jerp> tedlo, check your xchat preferences for the browser settings
[11:19] <_Spire_> pianoboy3333: alsa-oss too, if it's installed
[11:20] <function1> !ld.so.nohwcap
[11:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ld.so.nohwcap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:20] <pianoboy3333> _Spire_: that's not even version 1.0.11
[11:20] <xenoNfluX> !sendmail
[11:20] <ubotu> sendmail: powerful, efficient, and scalable Mail Transport Agent. In component universe, is extra. Version 8.13.8-2 (edgy), package size 191 kB, installed size 248 kB
[11:20] <_Spire_> xenoNfluX: what's your problem?
[11:20] <starchaser> xenonflux -> postfix is better.
[11:20] <starchaser> easier to config. and faster.
[11:20] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: there's no alsa-driver\* binary package, why?
[11:20] <function1> crimsun: come up with anything about that midi problem? i feel like its some kind of alsa config issue
[11:20] <_Spire_> I agree, but sendmail still works :)
[11:20] <Coffeegrinds> why is it i can view an ide CF drive but can\t mount it
[11:21] <Lahey> ya that 2
=== pug_ is now known as pugsley
[11:21] <crimsun> function1: I haven't looked, and I'm busy. Do you have the URL?
[11:21] <xenoNfluX> starchaser, that would work.... I'm not partial to either, just need basic mail functionality
[11:21] <LinuxHelp> Hmm, my X11 just crashed when I ran beryl-manager for the first time. /var/run/Xorg.0.log just tells me it caught "signal 11". Beryl-manager's output just says it lost its connection to  the X server. What should I do on my Debian Testing system?
[11:21] <xenoNfluX> starchaser, got a link to a help page for it?
[11:21] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: what do you mean...? in the repositories...? maybe because I compiled it once upon a time by myself, I really have no clue
[11:21] <LinuxHelp> ouch lol
[11:21] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: dpkg -l alsa-driver\*|grep ^ii
[11:21] <Coffeegrinds> and by view i canonly seeit in gparted
[11:21] <starchaser> xenonflux -> what are you trying to do?  set up a mailserver?
[11:22] <Apollo> seveas, does your repository work on Debian also?
[11:22] <Seveas> not all of it
[11:22] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: yea... it seems I checkinstalled it at one point
[11:22] <LinuxHelp> Hmm, my X11 just crashed when I ran beryl-manager for the first time. /var/run/Xorg.0.log just tells me it caught "signal 11". Beryl-manager's output just says it lost its connection to  the X server. What should I do?
[11:22] <function1> crimsun: sorry to bother you. i posted on ubuntuforums, nothing so far. strace output: http://pastebin.com/826804
[11:22] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ii  alsa-driver    1.0.13-1       Package created with checkinstall 1.6.0
[11:22] <starchaser> LinuxHelp ->   beryl is "work in progress"....   i had problems myself.
[11:22] <Slart> Am I the only one having problems with the gnome keyboard configuration-application in Ubuntu 64bit, latest version?... I cant even type the pipe-sign... or at-sign..
[11:22] <Apollo> Is it listed as such, I don't recall seeing it
[11:23] <xenoNfluX> starchaser, well, nothing that extravagant.... I'm just looking for the ability to have my PHP scripts send mail out... for registration confirmation, etc
[11:23] <_Spire_> xenoNfluX: then either postfix or sendmail will work
[11:23] <starchaser> xenonflux ->  ah.. so you're going to be using the mail() function in php that talks to whatever mailserver is running on the box.
[11:24] <xenoNfluX> starchaser, right
[11:24] <lifepositive> starchaser: did you catch any?
[11:24] <Coffeegrinds> help someone// I need to use my CF IDE drive and I can't seem to get the damn thing mounted
[11:24] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: uhh...checkinstall?!
[11:24] <starchaser> where are you installing it though - is it on a webserver that your isp has provided or is it an ubuntu box?
[11:24] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: yes, please do remove alsa-driver, then.
[11:24] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: it appears so
[11:24] <pianoboy3333> ok
[11:24] <crimsun> my god. checkinstall.
[11:24] <xenoNfluX> starchaser, a local Ubuntu Server Dapper box
[11:25] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so remove alsa-modules-2.6.17-10-generic, alsa-driver, and alsa-oss too?
[11:25] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: only the first two.
[11:25] <pianoboy3333> ok
[11:25] <Esteth> hey again all, im still having trouble with my wireless connection :(
[11:25] <BlackHawk> gn8
[11:25] <starchaser> xenonflux -> might not work . lots of ISPs dont allow that , because of the spam problem.
[11:25] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ok, now what
[11:25] <Out_Side> can someone help me get xmms-alarm working
[11:26] <starchaser> lifepositive -> too lazy to scroll up. what are you referring to?
[11:26] <lifepositive> if I upgrade my whole computer system to a different CPU etc, can I place this Hard drive in it, and will ubuntu pick up the new hardware?
[11:26] <function1> crimsun: should you have a peek at it and see anything obvious, please pm me. really sorry to be so persistent, i've had a really hard time finding anything on the web. thanks for your time.
[11:26] <Esteth> using a RT2500 connecting to a WRT54GS wireless router, ubuntu sees the card and lets me activate it, but i dont appear to get connected
[11:26] <Coffeegrinds> anyone?
[11:26] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: now untar alsa-driver-1.0.13.tar.bz2 afresh, and use the correct parameters to pass to configure
[11:26] <pianoboy3333> ok... what parameters would that be?
[11:27] <Out_Side> does anyone know how to get xmms-alarm working
[11:27] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: no idea, what's your sound card?
[11:27] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: should I put it in /usr/src ?
[11:27] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: no
[11:27] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: hda-intel
[11:27] <lifepositive> starchaser: did you catch any?  stars I mean ;)
[11:27] <Coffeegrinds> ahem.. a litle help with something supposedly simple... i can;t seem to mount /dev/hdb1
[11:27] <fre4k> gnomefreak: updated the system ... how do i check whether i'm running dapper or edgy
[11:28] <bXi> fre4k: uname -a
[11:28] <gnomefreak> fre4k: lsb_release -a
[11:28] <starchaser> lifepositive ->  not until tommorow , when the Leonid meteor shower hits us.
[11:28] <starchaser> ;-)
[11:28] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: ./configure --with-cards=hda-intel --with-oss=yes --with-sequencer=yes --with-debug=full --with-kernel=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build && make && sudo make install-modules && sudo depmod -e
[11:28] <gnomefreak> fre4k: did you reboot into the 2.6.17 kernel?
[11:28] <xenoNfluX> starchaser, I figure as much... but Comcast locally has been pretty lax about blocking ports.... I found a howto on the Ubuntu wiki for postfix, I'll give that a try
[11:28] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: oooohhh I remember what you told me to do last time, you told me to get the feisty of alsa-source and compile it with m-a
[11:28] <Out_Side> xmms will open but it doesnt play anything
[11:28] <pianoboy3333> ok, will do
[11:28] <ubu> To get a floppy to work. What do you recomend for program, please
[11:28] <Out_Side> is there another package i need for it?
[11:28] <fre4k> gnomefreak: yes i rebooted and chose the first kernel in grub
[11:28] <Out_Side> or is there a better alarm clock for ubuntu
[11:28] <fre4k> gnomefreak: dont remember the version
[11:28] <starchaser> xenonflux -> god! comcast...   blocked by spamcop regularly...  errgh!
[11:28] <gnomefreak> fre4k: the command i gave you will tell you
[11:29] <rockz> are there subtitles to episodes of "go open" ?
[11:29] <starchaser> i'd have your mail server hosted mate.  not on your local box.
[11:29] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: what about --prefix=/usr
[11:29] <fre4k> gnomefreak: it says 2.6.15-27-386
[11:29] <lifepositive> starchaser: :)
[11:29] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: no need
[11:29] <pianoboy3333> ok...
[11:29] <fre4k> gnomefreak: it says dapper :(
[11:29] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: the only thing that's bad is that this isn't going to build a deb :(
[11:30] <gnomefreak> fre4k: than try gksudo "update-manager -c"
[11:30] <starchaser> lifepostivie -> if your a real vinyl junkie, you can find me on a 4 Hero track...
[11:30] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ok, what now
[11:30] <fre4k> gnomefreak: cool .. it says new distro is available
[11:30] <gnomefreak> fre4k: it should give you an option to upgrade distro if not hit check and it should
[11:31] <gnomefreak> fre4k: there you go :)
[11:31] <fre4k> gnomefreak: thanks
[11:31] <gnomefreak> yw
[11:32] <hanasaki> any pda/phone run ubuntu?
[11:32] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: brb in 5 min

[11:44] <jasontk> Clin1: /query nickserv
[11:44] <Milos_SD> how can i run darkice with shoutcast?
[11:44] <jean> Hi All
[11:44] <Coffeegrinds> mount -t /dev/hdb1 (problany wrong
[11:44] <Clin1> seveas, how do i open nickserve
[11:44] <ashika> jasontk, Ctrl Alt F2 doesnt work?
[11:44] <Vix> Can I boot the Ubuntu 6.10 live DVD from a DVD+RW?
[11:44] <ashika> Coffeegrinds, isn't it hda1?
[11:44] <sethk> Coffeegrinds, definitely wrong
[11:44] <Coffeegrinds> nope
[11:44] <sethk> Coffeegrinds, you can't use -t without a type
[11:44] <Coffeegrinds> hdb1
[11:44] <Vix> Just-- before I burn it and all.
[11:44] <anton__> should work, vix
[11:44] <killown> anyone know a program to simulator guitar effects?
[11:44] <sethk> Coffeegrinds, either mount /dev/hdb1    or mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb1   using ext3 as an example
[11:45] <jasontk> ashika: nah
[11:45] <protocol1> kestaz, because coldplug does not only deal with ubuntu in general...but with any linux machine
[11:45] <ashika> Vix, Yes it should work.
[11:45] <Vix> That's cool. Anyway, it's an 'RW so no coaster, right? :D
[11:45] <kestaz> ok
[11:45] <jasontk> ashika:  totally kills the system
[11:45] <ashika> Vix, Why wouldn't an RW work.
[11:45] <Abst> How do I scan wireless networks?
[11:45] <Coffeegrinds> sweetness thanks
[11:45] <Coffeegrinds> vfat
[11:45] <ashika> jasontk, what about alternate version
[11:45] <jasontk> i've found some info online that bsaically said "you need to recompile the kernel"
[11:45] <protocol1> kestaz, which mean it could be on debian, gentoo, mandrake etc
[11:45] <jasontk> which is nice
[11:45] <Vix> ashika: It's one of those: "I thought I read somewhere..." things. :)
[11:45] <ashika> jasontk, ah that sucks.
[11:45] <jasontk> mm
[11:46] <mwe> Coffeegrinds: you need to create a mount point as well if you haven't done so
[11:46] <jasontk> just what i want to do
[11:46] <ashika> Vix, No I'm going to install ubuntu on my g4mac in 5 mins with a RW
[11:46] <sethk> jasontk, building the kernel isn't difficult
[11:46] <Vix> I just hope I can get wireless up and running on my laptop
[11:46] <Vix> and XGL for fun. :D
[11:46] <jasontk> sethk:  i know, but it's a pain, especially when i'd have to do it on another machine
[11:46] <jasontk> sethk: and then replace the kernel on the .ISO
[11:47] <ashika> jasontk, http://www.mil.ufl.edu/~number9/doc/linux_kernel.pdf its not that hard.
[11:47] <killown> anyone know a program to simulator guitar effects?
[11:47] <jasontk> i jusr wish i could skip the modprobe :)
[11:47] <sethk> jasontk, it's still easy enough
[11:47] <sethk> jasontk, you can skip modprobe
[11:47] <ubu> Is their not any program for a floppy disk in Ubuntu 6.10 ???
[11:47] <jasontk> yeah?
[11:47] <jasontk> when booting the livecd?
[11:47] <jasontk> to do the install?
[11:47] <jean> Mohaa, Callof Duty... Game have a port to linux?
[11:48] <kestaz> where can i get 2.6.18.2 kernel binary ?
[11:48] <ashika> jasontk, use alternate.
[11:48] <ashika> jasontk, then you can skip mod probe after installing either via grub or recovery
[11:48] <Milos_SD> can anyone help me with runing darkice streaming?

[11:52] <jean> I need to play Mohaa or Call of Dutty un Ubuntu. anyone can help me?
[11:53] <botxj> mohaa
[11:53] <botxj> mohawk? rockin...
[11:53] <ashika> jean, use wine to emulate windows.
[11:53] <jean> Mohaa - medal of Honor
[11:53] <botxj> it doesnt emulate widnows, it IS windows, Wine Is NOT an Emulator
[11:53] <ashika> botxj, thats it's full name.
[11:53] <factboy818181> hello, anyone know who i could shrink the size of the icons on the desktop in ubuntu?
[11:54] <jean> Wine?? Dont have a native Linux bin?
[11:54] <ashika> jean, Google Wine emulator. That will lead you to run it.
[11:54] <jean> Like Quake III
[11:54] <FunnyLookinHat> lol, nobody cares about the whole "wine isn't an emulator" definitions...  fact is, that's what is does for most people
[11:54] <botxj> omg i loved Q3
[11:54] <ashika> jean, Google Wine emulator. That will lead you to run it.
[11:54] <Milos_SD> boink, I have lame
[11:54] <Seveas> factboy818181, rightclick on the icon and select 'stretch icon'
[11:54] <ashika> Milos_SD, do you have the lame libraries
[11:54] <jean> Ok Tks.
[11:54] <ashika> jean, no problem.
[11:55] <lifepositive> drbreen: hello
[11:55] <Milos_SD> ashika, I don't know
[11:55] <Milos_SD> how can i chack that?
[11:55] <jean> But I dont have windows License, so I run only Q3...
[11:55] <jean> Tks...
[11:55] <ashika> Milos_SD, I'm not on Ubuntu right now but look in Syanptec Packager for a lame-* and check if you have it.
[11:56] <factboy818181> Seveas: thanks, but is there a way to do it for all the icons on your desktop at once?
[11:56] <SUDO_Tux> #phpBB
[11:56] <ashika> Milos_SD, In the descriptions one will probably say lame libraries. When you compile you need libraries thats how it works.
[11:56] <jean> To run A Game in Wine is needed a Windows?
[11:56] <Chandan> hi
[11:56] <theqkash> hello all
[11:56] <anton__> no, wine implements the windows apis so you don't need windows
[11:56] <Milos_SD> ashika, I have this
[11:56] <Milos_SD> LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder
[11:56] <Seveas> factboy818181, not that I know of
[11:57] <factboy818181> ok, thanks
[11:57] <Chandan> Is there any package simliar to kxdocker for gnome
[11:57] <mwe> jean: you don't need a windows license if it works in wine
[11:57] <Milos_SD> This package contains the frontend encoder binary.
[11:57] <mwe> jean: most games don't work in wine though. some do
[11:57] <theqkash> i need an application to convert pictures to have smaller size
[11:57] <jamesrose> GIMP?
[11:57] <Seveas> theqkash, gimp, imagemagick
[11:57] <jamesrose> Image Viewer?
[11:57] <jamesrose> Any Image viewer/manip would do it
[11:57] <lufis> theqkash: In Gimp, you can scale images
[11:58] <theqkash> in bigger quantity
[11:58] <jasontk> a ha, i've actually found the module in the squashfs, which is read only. is there an easy way to just rebuild everything without those modules? ie a livecd with the faulty module removed?
[11:58] <jean> Exists a list of the Games?
[11:58] <Milos_SD> ashika, I have liblame0
[11:58] <lufis> theqkash: You can do batch resizes with imagemagick
[11:58] <anton__> does the gimp have a batch-processing mode? it must do
[11:58] <theqkash> i have something like 130pics and converting one-by-one may be incomfortable
[11:58] <jamesrose> are these images for the web?
[11:58] <mwe> jean: not a complete one. frankcorner.org is listing a few
[11:58] <Milos_SD> This package contains the dynamic libraries, which provides the encoding
[11:58] <theqkash> for my photo gallery on website
[11:58] <Milos_SD> functionality of lame.
[11:58] <anton__> there must be a konsole application :)
[11:58] <jamesrose> If so imageshack.us will automaticly
[11:58] <sethk> jasontk, you can copy the files from the cd, replace or remove the module, make a new iso file, and burn it to a cd
[11:58] <jamesrose> scale them
[11:58] <theqkash> imageshack doesn't getting the role:)
[11:58] <mwe> jean: frankscorner.org*
[11:58] <jasontk> sethk:  yeah, that's what i was thinking
[11:59] <jamesrose> and if you register for free
[11:59] <jamesrose> you can upload more then one at once
[11:59] <jasontk> i think i'll remove the module, i don't need eth0, i've not even got anything to plug it into :)
[11:59] <sethk> jasontk, if it is a dependency of other modules that are to be loaded, removing it might break it
[11:59] <jean> <mwe> - Exists a similar game like Mohaa or Call of dutty.. 3d Shooter War native for linux?
[11:59] <jasontk> sethk: can't break it more than it is already :)
[11:59] <anton__> getting rid of eth0 will probably require compiling your own kernel...
[12:00] <mwe> jean: I don't know. I think COD runs in wine if you work at it though
[12:00] <sethk> jasontk, yes, I know, but you don't want to do work to end up where you are already without doing any work  :)
[12:00] <ashika>  jasontk, just install with alternate and remove it once loaded
[12:00] <jasontk> sethk:  true :)
[12:00] <jamesrose> Sorry, why do you need to remove eth0?
[12:00] <pudland> anyone have any guides/info on using motorola usb bluetooth?
[12:00] <ashika> Milos_SD, whats your error again
[12:00] <jamesrose> I don't recomend it
[12:00] <lufis> Anyone have any tips on installing unofficial software? e.g., gaim beta 5 when Edgy ships gaim beta 4... Should the old package be uninstalled? Will everything be fine if I use checkinstall while compiling and uninstall the checkinstall'd deb when I want to install a new version?
[12:00] <Milos_SD> DarkIce: LameLibEncoder.cpp:75: lame lib opening underlying sink error [0] 
[12:01] <jean> Tks all!!! :-) And sorry for Bad english...  :-)
[12:01] <Wirelex> hi
[12:01] <sethk> lufis, there are a couple of ways to do it
