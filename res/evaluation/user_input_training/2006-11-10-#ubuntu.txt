[12:02] <salim> hi again, I have ubuntu on my hardrive, and also want to install windows now (just for an app we use for school), I have disk space for it (just have to reformat it), but can I just install windows without damaging my actual ubuntu?
[12:02] <Zarephath> tell afasias about locales
[12:02] <skreet> salim, Windows will install a bootloader that will disable grub.
[12:02] <vasilis> skreet: yeah,sorry,xchat tab.. :)
[12:02] <nalioth> salim: you can do that, but you'll have to reinstall grub
[12:02] <skreet> vasilis, I hear ya... did you have to do anyting special for it to work
[12:02] <mc44> vasilis: http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/08/26/upstart-in-universe if you care that much :)
[12:03] <salim> reinstall grub, can I do that with ubuntu live cd, chroot and then grub-install?
[12:03] <skreet> salim, Yes.
[12:03] <dibblego> does anyone else get a 403 from http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-backports/multiverse/source/Sources.gz
[12:03] <skreet> salim, That's all you have to do, afaik
[12:03] <afasias> Zarephath, what about locales? I could find something like "regional settings" in System->administration menu. Can you please guide me?

[12:03] <vasilis> skreet: not really,on edgy it installed the driver and the daemon
[12:04] <Zarephath> afasias: Alas no...I only speak English and Spanish...but have never attempted to use the latter in Ubuntu
[12:04] <nette> skreet, okai thanks:)

[12:09] <OhEay> Hey, I have a RaLink wireless card (Belkin) and Ubuntu Installer just detected it, but I'm not in range of any wireless networks.  It was trying to configure it, but the lights on the card were not lighting up.. does this mean the card won't work when I get in range of an access point?
[12:09] <foo> I just got a new dell 20" widescreen .. and I have ubuntu with fluxbox. I see some blurry squigaly lines going up and down the screen ... kind of weird. I've tried adjust the sync rates with no luck. I almost think I see this in CLI too. I have this: VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  300/305 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter (rev 90) ... can my card not support this 1400x1050 resolution possible?
[12:09] <morphycs> bulmer: You welcome, check in the terminal after modifying the file and rebooting "ip a | grep inet6", if you get no output then ipv6 is disabled

[12:11] <Fletcheri> i can read what you are saying
[12:11] <Fletcheri> you dont seem to see what i type though
[12:11] <cosmodad> can anyone tell me why my microphone wouldn't work? I cannot use Skype and if I try testing using gnome audio recorder, it tells to correct my audio settings in the multimedia settings which I cannot seem to find. Anyone?
[12:11] <camirrakiu> ....
[12:12] <segfault> !nvidiabeta
[12:12] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) Beta version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[12:12] <Alaa> try to check alsamixer
[12:12] <Alaa> for the mic thing on skype
[12:12] <Alaa> $ alsmixer
[12:12] <camirrakiu> no one earme :( you discrimineme... cos im from sub america :(
[12:12] <Spee_Der> cosmodad: Double click your audio or volume control icon.......
[12:12] <Zarephath> Fletcheri, : Well you have to type back when I ask a question eh?
[12:12] <Fletcheri> yeah
[12:12] <Fletcheri> i am
[12:13] <Spee_Der> cosmodad: The, go through all the settings and be sure the mic is NOT muted.
[12:13] <Fletcheri> for some reason you cant see it
[12:13] <cosmodad> Spee_Der: did that. there's no level setting for mic at all
[12:13] <Fletcheri> can you read what im saying here?
[12:13] <OhEay> Hey, I use a RaLink PCMCIA card, and the Ubuntu installer detected it fine.  I wasn't in range of a wireless access point at the time, so I didn't configure it.  Should the card light up anyways, as it does in windows even if i'm not connected to a network?
[12:13] <mc44> Fletcheri: if you put the persons nickname first then it gets higlighted for them
[12:13] <cosmodad> Spee_Der: it's just master, pcm, line-in, and CD

[12:15] <Fletcheri> How can I register?
[12:15] <Spee_Der> cosmodad: That's the best I can do then, sorry. I went bonkers 'till I 'fingered' it out here......
[12:15] <mc44> use /msg nickserv register yourpassword
[12:15] <Zarephath> Fletcheri, : /msg nickserv set password <yourpassword>
[12:15] <shira> it was working yesterday.. the only I did was change my kernel to "generic"
[12:15] <Zarephath> mc44: Sorry yep..
[12:16] <cosmodad> Spee_Der: ok, thanks
[12:16] <Spee_Der> yep
[12:16] <|mp|> how do you get an ext. firewire hard disk to automount?
[12:17] <skreet> vasilis, Hey, what kernel are you using?
[12:17] <Fletcheri> ok i registered
[12:17] <Fletcheri> do i need to log in again?
[12:17] <Zarephath> |mp|, : It should do it automatically
[12:17] <Zarephath> Fletcheri, : Nope I see your nick lit up..see ya
[12:17] <mc44> Fletcheri: you should uuse /msg nickserv identify yourpassword
[12:17] <lupine_85>  /quote ...
[12:17] <mc44> Fletcheri: when you reconnect that is
[12:18] <lupine_85> much better if  you happen to be doing screenshots :D
[12:18] <cosmodad> Spee_Der: do you have any multimedia settings in the GNOME menu? I used to have it in Breezy but it seems to depend on some package that has been removed..
[12:18] <vasilis> skreet: the default that came with edgy,2.6.17
[12:18] <|mp|> hm... so why does it not do it i wonder??
[12:18] <skreet> vasilis, bummer.
[12:18] <skreet> vasilis, The only thing that's different is this was upgraded from 6.06 LTS Server
[12:18] <skreet> because it's the only disc I had handy
[12:18] <vasilis> mc44: Well,I can see the job list but can't really switch runlevels...
[12:18] <skreet> but I've upgraded everything to 6.10 ubuntu including the kernel
[12:19] <|mp|> Zarephath - any suggestions as  how to find out why it does not?
=== Carnage_\ is now known as Carnage\
[12:19] <vasilis> skreet: hmm..Duno,do you have the latest driver for that?
[12:19] <vasilis> maybe you can download it and build it yourself
[12:19] <skreet> vasilis, module is included with kernel and loads fine..
[12:19] <skreet> *shrug*
[12:19] <skreet> i should check the logs, huh? :)
[12:20] <vasilis> skreet: yeah,i guess..
[12:20] <xopher> Im using edgy, upgraded from dapper, how can I make my fonts look more crisp? Especially in firefox everythings kinda blurred
[12:21] <marshall> hey guys
[12:21] <marshall> some of my logs are 5+ gb, is this necessary? is there any way i can get my space back?
[12:21] <skreet> vasilis, Can you compare dmesg|grep ipw with this: http://pastebin.com/820729
[12:22] <bluefox83> marshall, logs are just records...you can delete them all if you want
[12:23] <dnite> does anyone know why someone's sound would just stop working? maybe where they would look (log files, config files) to see how to fix it?

[12:24] <nomin> can I use chroot to run a program that is installed on another partition on another distro?
[12:25] <zidoen> hi, i've installed edgy 64bit.. but the keyboard and touchpad seems to be a bit.. "extremely sensitive" at times.. when i start to write a character it suddenly writes 20 of them (i've set the delay to much longer than this in the keyboard settings)
[12:25] <vasilis> skreet: no idea,wait a sec,i'll try to turn my wireless switch to see what happens
[12:25] <pettern> I have a strange problem with ubuntu. each 15-30min my mouse flickers, any key i migh be using will get "stuck" for a few sec and stuff like games and movies freezes for a few sec. Any idea what the problem could be?
[12:25] <|mp|> Zarephath -  have found a few bug reports and old comments suggesting that the issue has been resolved
[12:25] <vanRijn> hm
[12:25] <vanRijn> is anyone successfully using NetworkManager with edgy?
[12:25] <skreet> vasilis, what laptop are you using?
[12:25] <skreet> vasilis, My wireless indication light is off.
[12:25] <wweasel> vanRijn: Yes.
[12:25] <skreet> vasilis, and I cannot turn it on.
[12:25] <vasilis> skreet: well that's the exact message it gave me when i put it off
[12:26] <zidoen> and it works fine in the testscreen on the keyboard settings, and most of the time otherwise.. but sometimes it spits out a bunch of characters.. anybody know whhat the problem might be?
[12:26] <vasilis> skreet: asus w7j
[12:26] <Zarephath> |mp|, : If you don't mind hangin' out I might be able to help you find out what is up..right now I am in the middle of something else :-)
[12:26] <vanRijn> wweasel: I can't get networkmanager to work with my wireless card consistently
[12:26] <skreet> vasilis, Nice. Dell E1705 here
[12:26] <|mp|> Zarephath - i will be around (am on an intermittent wifi connection in the amazon!) :)
[12:26] <wweasel> vanRijn: elaborate? What exactly happens? Does your wireless work without network-manager?
[12:26] <deyan> #30-40
[12:27] <skreet> vasilis, So when you turn it off you get Radio Freq kill switch is On..
[12:27] <skreet> that might explain something
[12:27] <vasilis> skreet: it seems that for some reason it considers the switch off,...Is it a hardware or some software button?you may need some special daemon to catch the signal from it
[12:27] <vanRijn> in fact, right now, I'm typing this from my wireless card, and yet both nm-applet and knetworkmanager don't think I have a wireless card at all, much less that it's connected
[12:27] <vasilis> skreet: yeah exactly that
[12:27] <skreet> vasilis, Okay.
[12:27] <skreet> vasilis, You've been a good help, thanks man.
[12:28] <vasilis> skreet: no prob
[12:28] <jvai> hey peepz
[12:28] <mc44> vanRijn: you may need to take wlan0 or whatever out of /etc/networking/interfaces before n-m will use it
[12:28] <vanRijn> mc44: it's listed as auto
[12:28] <vanRijn> mc44: and sometimes it does work
[12:28] <vanRijn> it's just very intermittent
[12:28] <skreet> vasilis, I want to say it's a hardware switch
[12:28] <jvai> dapper's tight.. i'm pushing it to my workplace but slooowly
[12:28] <skreet> vasilis, Because it works in windows with no daemon
[12:28] <skreet> vasilis, But the windows driver might be catered to Dell including the signalhandling.
[12:28] <skreet> so who knows
[12:29] <vasilis> true...
[12:29] <skreet> vasilis, http://pastebin.com/820729
[12:29] <skreet> reassuring

[12:34] <lightcap> how do I change the www-data user's timezone?  my cgi scripts are storing time values in localtime instead of UTC...
[12:34] <OhEay> I tried "recovery mode " but no dice there either
[12:35] <dnite> anyone got an idea why my sounds would stop working or where i can look to see why it's not working? It's been working fine.. i accidentally deleted an init script for flashplayer_nonfree that controlled flashplayer if it needed ESD .. but i don't think that would have done anything .. but i can't think of anything else..
[12:35] <skreet> vasilis, I killed and restarted ipw
[12:35] <skreet> vasilis, Got an eth1 now, with no wireless extensions
[12:35] <skreet> still off
[12:35] <zidoen> sometimes when i click on items on the top meny, ubuntu hangs up for a while and i cant do anything on the menu, i have to  press "alt+tab" to get something to happen and i can use the menu..
[12:35] <eternale1> i wish i could get my firefox working again... in 6.10... always crashes everytime i open it.. i've heard its something to do with javascript.. i've tried to apt-remove firefox it removed it and now says its not installed when doing apt-get firefox... but it "is" still there (running firefox from the menu opens it up, for a sec before crashing)  any other ideas?
[12:35] <eternale1> i've seen posts about it before on ubuntu forums
[12:35] <eternale1> but nothing really has worked
[12:36] <skreet> eternale1, apt-get clean ?
[12:36] <eternale1> hmm
[12:36] <skreet> eternale1, apt-get autoremove
[12:36] <skreet> try those to make sure it's gone 100%
[12:36] <vasilis> skreet: the module is there but it won't set the radio on huh?
[12:36] <skreet> then re-install
[12:36] <eternale1> ok thanks
[12:36] <eternale1> i will try that
[12:36] <skreet> vasilis, Yea, and for some reason it gave me and eth1 now
[12:37] <vasilis> skreet: i have an eth1 as well
=== dark_ is now known as dark_light
[12:37] <vasilis> skreet:don't really know how it works but you maybe able to pass the radio switch as a module argiment
[12:38] <skreet> vasilis, eth1 = wireless on your laptop?
[12:38] <OhEay> hey i just installed ubuntu server on a laptop.. grub loads up fine.. but soon as it loads the Kernel, I get an automatic reboot... no error, nothing.. any ideas? :(
[12:38] <OhEay> [15:34]  lightcap: how do I change the www-data user's timezone?  my cgi scripts are storing
[12:38] <vasilis> skreet: yes
[12:38] <vanRijn> grr
[12:38] <vanRijn> why does NetworkManager not see my wireless card???
[12:38] <lightcap> OhEay: sloppy cut and paste? ;-)
=== sk1nny|away is now known as sk1nny
[12:39] <vanRijn> eth0 doesn't even show up in /var/log/syslog in NetworkManager's output
[12:40] <OhEay> ?
[12:40] <OhEay> I'm just kinda lost... the install went fine
[12:40] <OhEay> now it just reboots for no reason
[12:40] <OhEay> i dont get it lol
[12:41] <skreet> vanRijn, Does the system see your wireless card?
[12:41] <vanRijn> skreet: yes
[12:41] <wweasel> vanRijn: Try running: iwconfig
[12:41] <vanRijn> skreet: in fact, it's up and working fine now
[12:41] <skreet> vanRijn, Then you're better off than me :P
[12:42] <vanRijn> skreet: heh. ick.  wtf??
[12:43] <wweasel> vanRijn: Ok, that would tell you if it's working. Hmm...have you made sure it's commented out in /etc/network/interfaces
[12:43] <vanRijn> wweasel: it is
[12:43] <vanRijn> this is downright silly
[12:43] <vanRijn> I'm going to reboot
[12:44] <OhEay> So does anyone know what would cause Grub to start booting linux, then just have a reboot
[12:44] <OhEay> out of nowhere?
[12:44] <OhEay> Is there something I'm missing?
[12:44] <SeAofSaRo> whats everyones favorite web design tool for linux?
[12:44] <OhEay> Should I set the Root= to something other than hda(0,4)
[12:44] <SeAofSaRo> i've been playing around with screem and don't like it much
[12:45] <[sYn] > I just made a beautiful Gears Of War GDM theme :D..
[12:45] <MarcN> OhEay: starts booting linux and dies?  Where in the boot is it?   Did you muck with /boot/ files?
[12:45] <OhEay> nope
[12:45] <vasilis> skreet: hey check here: http://pastebin.com/820743
[12:45] <OhEay> I JUST installed Ubuntu-server-i386
[12:45] <vasilis> skreet: just did a strings on the module
[12:45] <OhEay> I rebooted after the install, grub loads up, says loading linux
[12:45] <OhEay> And reboot.
[12:45] <vasilis> skreet: i see some parameters that you might find interesting
[12:46] <MarcN> OhEay: just the loading linux....  part?  nothing else?
[12:46] <OhEay> well
[12:46] <OhEay> I can get into the grub menu
[12:46] <skreet> wow i removed kubuntu-desktop and konquerer is still installed.. excellent
[12:46] <OhEay> If I stop it in time
[12:46] <OhEay> But if I try to boot linux, I reboot.
[12:46] <OhEay> I'm in the Grub menu right now.
[12:46] <allen2003> UBUNTU
[12:46] <allen2003> WHY I CANT USE Mp3
[12:46] <allen2003> >_>
[12:46] <allen2003> i mean amarock thingy wont install mp3 support
[12:46] <MarcN> OhEay: sounds like when you installed a new kernel, grub or the kernel didn't get updated completely.  Out of disk space?

[12:47] <OhEay> I don't think so.
[12:47] <allen2003> i already read alot
[12:47] <OhEay> I thought the installer formatted for you.
[12:47] <OhEay> I installed fresh.
[12:47] <MarcN> OhEay: can you boot and different kernel?
[12:47] <OhEay> I had windows 2000 on there.
[12:47] <OhEay> I'm not sure, how woudl I do that?
[12:47] <skreet> vasilis, Sorry for my ignorance, how do you pass a param to a module?
[12:47] <OhEay> The kernel it's using is /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-server
[12:47] <eternale1> skreet: well did autoremove and clean... its still there when in bash executing firefox... still crashing ... do have an error message though, something to the effect of Gecko received an X Window System error.
[12:47] <eternale1> http://pastebin.ca/244608
[12:47] <OhEay> I just installed is seconds ago...  It's the Server kernel.
[12:47] <MarcN> OhEay: but you had a previous kernel installed right?  Can you boot that one?
[12:48] <OhEay> I didn;t
[12:48] <OhEay> I had windows 2000 installed.
[12:48] <skreet> eternale1, Hmm, thats odd. My konquerer wont go away either.. damn apt :P
[12:48] <eternale1> hahah :)
[12:48] <MarcN> OhEay: so you just installed Ubuntu/Server version and this is the first boot of it?  It sounded like you were up and running Ubuntu and just installed a new kernel.
[12:48] <allen2003> Okey i installed the freaking thing it ask to restart still wont work
[12:49] <OhEay> Nope.
[12:49] <LjL> allen2003, perhaps not enough, have you installed xine's extra codecs?
[12:49] <OhEay> I just installed Ubuntu/Server version, and this is my first boot.
[12:49] <gnomefreak> allen2003: for starters install libxine-extracodecs  that should get amarok playing mp3s
[12:49] <eternale1> i ran it through gdb but just came up with the same error.
[12:49] <OhEay> But it just goes into a reboot loop.
[12:49] <vasilis> hmmm...let me see if they changed it on edgy,
[12:49] <StasIsLovE> hi, i want to install ubuntu on intel core duo mac, should i use cd image for desktom (386) or CD Image for Apple Macintosh PowerPC based desktop and laptop?
[12:49] <vasilis> skreet: i can guess that you have to add them in /etc/modprobe.d/options
[12:50] <allen2003> gnome freak where to fine that libxine
[12:50] <allen2003> !libxine-extracodecs
[12:50] <npodges> anyone here know python and gtk pretty well, that i can throw some questions by?
[12:50] <srf21c> earlier I was asking if there was anyone to suppress extraneous messages on IRC when using GAIM.  Turns out there is a package called gaim-irchelper, althought I can't find any documentation and it doesn't appear to block enter/leave messages by default.
[12:50] <ubotu> libxine-extracodecs: the xine video/media player library, binary files. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.1.2-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 1118 kB, installed size 2676 kB

[12:51] <LjL> allen2003, he's told already
[12:51] <LjL> look at your private messages
[12:51] <allen2003> lol
[12:51] <allen2003> ok
[12:51] <kitche> StasIsLovE: you want 386 since PowerPC has nothing to do with Intel but I m not sure if ubuntu can run on a Intel Mac

[12:51] <allen2003> i dunno how to use this propository thingy
[12:51] <botxj> i wonder if i can run linux on the PS3
[12:51] <vasilis> where the fuck is modprobe.conf....
[12:52] <botxj> language language honey buns :P
[12:52] <vasilis> prolly just the /etc/modprobe.d
[12:52] <LjL> !language | vasilis
[12:52] <ubotu> vasilis: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:52] <Asymmetry> vasilis, modprobe.conf is, I believe, simply 'modules'. Unless I'm off my rocker.
[12:52] <StasIsLovE> hm it rather urgent, does anyone know if i can run ubuntu on core duo mac laptop?
[12:52] <allen2003> !Ubotu tell me how to use multiverse
[12:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about  tell me how to use multiverse - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[12:53] <allen2003> nvm
[12:53] <OhEay> Does anyone else have any idea what would cause Ubuntu to reboot itself on boot?  No messages, no errors, nothing
[12:53] <OhEay> Grub loads itself, starts to load linux
[12:54] <OhEay> and reboot.
[12:54] <allen2003> installing the libxine now
[12:54] <OhEay> I just installed unbuntu server
[12:54] <vasilis> skreet: so what you have to do is put in /etc/modprobe.d/options options ipw3495 whatever_option
[12:54] <LjL> Asymmetry: :-P
[12:54] <LjL> OhEay: try with the various acpi=off, noapic etc kernel options perhaps
[12:54] <mamonassassina> hello,i connected my mp3 player and it seems to be "reading only"!not even root can modify its permissions,but i want to add files to it.
[12:55] <mumrah> hey, i'm having a serious problem with my edgy installation
[12:55] <mamonassassina> i mean,that's what it is for. :P how can i modify its permissions so i can write on it?
[12:55] <mumrah> i cannot read cds
[12:55] <Asymmetry> OhEay, Detail what, exactly, you did when you installed it. Partition types, sizes, location on the drive, physical characteristics of the machine itself (RAM, CPU type), what architecture did you install?
[12:55] <mamonassassina> ps: i'm on edgy
[12:55] <allen2003> whats kubuntu
[12:55] <mamonassassina> allen2003: ubuntu with kde instead of gnome
[12:55] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell allen2003 about kubuntu
[12:55] <allen2003> ah ok tnx
[12:55] <mumrah> anyone else having thise problem (no cd support)
[12:56] <Asymmetry> mumbles, make sure your /etc/fstab is correct.
[12:56] <mumbles> hu ?
[12:56] <allen2003> yay it work
[12:56] <allen2003> woot i got mp3 playin
[12:56] <LjL> mumbles: grep cdrom /etc/fstab
[12:56] <mumbles> oh tab compleate isshue
[12:56] <mumrah> mumrah **
[12:56] <mumrah> heh
[12:56] <allen2003> now time to fix my limewire
[12:56] <allen2003> >_>
[12:56] <LjL> yeah, mumrah, not mumbles
[12:56] <allen2003> anyone where is Java installed?
[12:57] <mumrah> dvds work find
[12:57] <lupine_85> slocate java
[12:57] <mumrah> fine *
[12:57] <vasilis> ok,can someone tell me how i can stop the X server on edgy using upstart?trying to start or stop the rc* won't work and i don't see it as a running job
[12:57] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell allen2003 about java
[12:57] <Asymmetry> Oh, whoops.
[12:57] <allen2003> woot
[12:57] <lupine_85> vasilis: /etc/init.d/?dm stop
[12:57] <allen2003> o.O
[12:57] <allen2003> Ubotu, please tell allen2003 about java
[12:57] <Asymmetry> vasilis, that only stops it one time. try this: chmod -x /etc/init.d/gdm
[12:57] <mumrah> "/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0" is the output of grep cdrom /etc/fstab
[12:57] <allen2003> i want to ask where the hell java installed coz limewire needs it in side the folder
[12:57] <LjL> allen2003, you don't have to re-ask ubotu every time! just look at your private messages windows for Ubotu.
[12:58] <lupine_85> cor, evil hack
[12:58] <LjL> !limewire
[12:58] <ubotu> limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[12:58] <allen2003> ok
[12:58] <allen2003>  o.O i insatalled java
[12:58] <allen2003> i cant install limewire
[12:58] <gnomefreak> allen2003: you need to install java than set it in update-alternatives before limewire will work
[12:58] <LjL> i don't think it needs java inside its folder
[12:58] <allen2003> ah
[12:58] <vasilis> Asymmetry: but how do i switch a runlevel?
[12:58] <allen2003> wait
[12:58] <gnomefreak> LjL: no just update-alternatives
[12:58] <Asymmetry> vasilis, why would you want to under Ubuntu?
[12:58] <allen2003> !sound
[12:58] <mumrah> when i try to mount the cd manually, it says no media present
[12:58] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[12:58] <lupine_85> telinit <runlevel> but all the runlevels (2-5) are the same in ubuntu
[12:59] <Asymmetry> vasilis, if you don't want X starting, enter the command I just told you.
[12:59] <vasilis> Asymmetry: to get to single user mode?
[12:59] <gnomefreak> allen2003: once java is installed type sudo update-alternatives --config java
[12:59] <LjL> gnomefreak: course. which is explained in the !java link
[12:59] <lupine_85> ah, that's telinit 1 ?
[12:59] <gnomefreak> it is?
[12:59] <OhEay> Asymmetry, I let the installer deal with the partitions, it set everything up.  the drive was formatted/fresh install.  The machine is a Toshiba 1625CDT Laptop with 64mb of ram
[12:59] <allen2003> ah ok gnome freak thanks
[12:59] <OhEay> The installer did everything
[12:59] <LjL> allen2003: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java#head-fef9352fb26820bb774df978180c9dd3a60e777b
[12:59] <vasilis> lupine_85: didn't really work for me...machine stopped responding
[12:59] <allen2003> sorry guys im only a kid and limited with linux heh/..
[12:59] <Gabby_Hayes> Howdy
[12:59] <LjL> gnomefreak, yes... though it does it a bit differently (but the result really should be the same), see above
[12:59] <OhEay> Asymmetry, should I reinstall?
[01:00] <OhEay> Someone tried to tell me the server kernel
[01:00] <Asymmetry> OhEay, You could try that. Or use a different installer.
[01:00] <allen2003> no such file and directory O_o
[01:00] <LjL> allen2003, while typing what?
[01:00] <mumrah> so anyone got any ideas on the cdrom thing?
[01:00] <LjL> mumrah: what does "grep cdrom /etc/fstab" say?
[01:00] <feryana> hi guys!!! Do you know where can I download a grammar corrector for Open Office Writer??????
[01:00] <mumrah>  "/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0" is the output of grep cdrom /etc/fstab

[01:01] <allen2003> woops sorry guys
[01:01] <mumrah> when i "mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 -t iso9660" i get "no media found"
[01:01] <gnomefreak> allen2003: update-alternatives

[01:02] <allen2003> hehe
[01:02] <allen2003> it gave me two selecftion hmmm maybe second one
[01:02] <LjL> allen2003, you need the one by Sun
[01:03] <allen2003> ok done thanks
[01:04] <allen2003> hmm
[01:04] <allen2003> can't open runLime.sh
[01:04] <mumrah> LjL: "/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0" is the output of grep cdrom /etc/fstab
[01:04] <mumrah> LjL: when i "mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 -t iso9660" i get "no media found"
[01:04] <LjL> mumrah: try typing manually "sudo mount /media/cdrom0" with a cd inserted
[01:04] <gnomefreak> allen2003: in terminal type sh runLine.sh
[01:04] <LjL> hm
[01:05] <gnomefreak> allen2003: also what version of ubuntu are you using
[01:05] <LjL> mumrah: i suppose it makes sense that your cd drive is /dev/hdc? (i.e. secondary master)
[01:05] <mumrah> LjL: i have tried multiple cds, burned and blank
[01:05] <mumrah> LjL: yes
[01:05] <mumrah> LjL: dvds work fine
[01:05] <LjL> !dash
[01:05] <ubotu> /bin/sh links to the DASH shell in Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). Since DASH is not 100% compatible with the BASH shell, some scripts might break. You can make scripts execute using BASH by changing the first line of the script to "#!/bin/bash"

[01:07] <jbroome> crap, sorry
[01:07] <radioaktivstorm> joseFK: thanks! ill try that
[01:07] <gnomefreak> JosefK: --force is never valid its unsafe for someone to use.
[01:07] <JosefK> radioaktivstorm: see gnomefreak's caveats
[01:08] <mikefoo> Is there a way I can do a memtest on a machine already booted into OS?
[01:08] <LjL> gnomefreak, i'm not sure in certain situation you really have better options
[01:08] <JosefK> gnomefreak: alternatives to fix a half-configured package?

[01:10] <Languid> hello, i booted into a gentoo livecd, passing the 'dodmraid' to the kernel, and when i boot into the environment my sata controller is recognized and my raid 0 configuration is properly recognized as one large 300gb partition instead of two 160gb drives.  when i boot into the edgy livecd, this does not happen (gparted sees them as two separate drives).  is there any way i can get the same functionality in ubuntu as i do in gentoo?  i have done so
[01:10] <Languid> me investigation and it appears to be the kernel module sata_via which gives me this support.  an lsmod in the ubuntu livecd shows this module is loaded, yet it still doesnt work properly.  can anyone help me?
[01:11] <JosefK> gnomefreak: indeed, advice taken, and I will do in future

[01:13] <JosefK> gnomefreak: and I'm certain automatix does more damage than --force* ever can..
[01:13] <LjL> allen2003, use "./runLime.sh" to invoke it rather than "sh runLime.sh" -- if that doesn't work, try "chmod +x runLime.sh" first
[01:14] <adm> whats with all this automatix talk... my eyes are hurting!
[01:14] <gnomefreak> javaJake: because its not supported in here and can do alot of damage.
[01:14] <h1st0> AsheD, VLC will play just about everything but wmv9  earlier wmv movies work fine.
[01:14] <allen2003> ok
[01:14] <AsheD> k
[01:14] <gnomefreak> JosefK: it does
[01:14] <wweasel> Ok guys, Automatix isn't THAT bad. It's just not something to recommend to people.

[01:23] <h1st0> sys0p7, its never been used before
[01:24] <Fletcher1> k can anyone help me out with a mounthing issue? :-[
[01:24] <Adam_G> JosefK, I don't suppose they're packages that can easily be removed?
[01:24] <JosefK> Adam_G: 'sudo aptitude clean; sudo aptitude -f install gnome-media-common'
[01:24] <Adam_G> ah, thanks
[01:24] <JosefK> Adam_G: may/may-not work, but that package is the cause of the trouble
[01:24] <bogdan> where is mounted so i can go mannualy ?
[01:24] <h1st0> Fletcher1, what is the issue?
[01:24] <JonBoon> Is there a better FTP client in the package manager than gFTP?
[01:24] <sys0p7> h1st0, that sucks...guess I'll be the first then to try anyway :)
[01:24] <h1st0> bogdan, did you try the forums?
[01:25] <allen2003> h1st0 it's okey :D
[01:25] <h1st0> sys0p7, i'm sure someone has done it perhaps they are not here right now.
[01:25] <JosefK> Adam_G: there are some options to force, but they're dangerous (man dpkg for more info on the --force options)
[01:25] <allen2003> brb guys
[01:25] <bogdan> not helping...i've googling for the 2 past days
[01:25] <Fletcher1> I'm trying to mount something and it says that it is already mounted or the directory is busy (it isn't already mounted as i tried umount and it said unmounted) and I cant see why it'd be busy
[01:25] <Adammk> hey just wondering have they fixed the problem with USB mass storage devices not being mounted?
[01:25] <LGKeiz> What do you guys think is best
[01:25] <h1st0> allen2003, also fyi if you start typing a users name then hit tab it will auto complete .   Terminal also does this on your box just fyi.
[01:25] <LGKeiz> Mac OSX
[01:25] <LGKeiz> Or Ubuntu?
[01:25] <sethk> JonBoon, the web browsers are the best ftp clients
[01:25] <sys0p7> h1st0, thanks...I'll explore the forums
[01:25] <Adammk> in Edgy
[01:26] <h1st0> bogdan, Is the card reader built in to the laptop?
[01:26] <JonBoon> i can use firefox to upload to my friends ftp?
[01:26] <bogdan> yes
[01:26] <Adam_G> JosefK, thanks. I've had to force once before... defintely make me nervous. (BTW, same issues with that last command)
[01:26] <sethk> Fletcher1, frequently there is a shell running, and the shell's current directory is somewhere in the mounted tree
[01:26] <h1st0> bogdan, what is the model of laptop?
[01:26] <bogdan> fujitsu-siemens
[01:26] <sethk> Fletcher1, try this:    sudo lsof | grep /whatever              whatever, of course, being the mount point
[01:26] <JosefK> Adam_G: from googling error 139 seems to happen when you have corrupted binaries on the system
[01:26] <h1st0> bogdan, MOdel #
[01:26] <bogdan> 1650g
[01:27] <Adam_G> hmm...
[01:27] <JosefK> Adam_G: probably a program only those packages are using for configuration, too
[01:27] <Adammk> have they fixed the problem with USB mass storage devices not being mounted in Edgy?
[01:27] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> hi
[01:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> god
[01:28] <Adam_G> so... something tied in with gnome's configuration is corrupted...
[01:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I love Ubuntu
[01:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> So what do you think is best
[01:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Ubuntu or Mac OSX
[01:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> o_o
[01:28] <Adam_G> I might see if I can get away with taking out as much of gnome as I can...

[01:29] <sethk> LGKeiz, osx has some very nice features, but I'm concerned about it's stability
[01:29] <sethk> LGKeiz, because the value of various features is very subjective
[01:29] <Fletcher1> sethk still doesnt work =/
[01:29] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sethk - uh huh :] \
[01:29] <sethk> Fletcher1, I didn't give you anything that was meant to "work".  I just asked you to check something
[01:29] <LjL> bogdan: use the pastebin for such long stuff please
[01:29] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sethk - maybe someday Ubuntu will get alot of features, yet stable.
[01:30] <Fletcher1> okay
[01:30] <sethk> Fletcher1, the results of that check were to suggest something to do.
[01:30] <h1st0> bogdan, is the card reader showing up in lspci?
[01:30] <Adam_G> JosefK, which logs? I don't see anything hopeful in /etc/dpkg or /etc/apt
[01:30] <bogdan> yes
[01:30] <Fletcher1> oh
[01:30] <Fletcher1> well
[01:30] <Fletcher1> nothing happened
[01:30] <sethk> LGKeiz, not a question of the number of features, in fact, linux has more features than osx
[01:30] <Fletcher1> when i ran the check
[01:30] <JosefK> Adam_G: there's /var/log/dpkg.log
[01:30] <cablesm102> Is there a way to disable the Totem mozilla plugin without uninstalling ubuntu-desktop? I want to use the Mplayer plugin, but it won't work with the Totem plugin installed.
[01:30] <sethk> LGKeiz, well, that's not really true, since you can run KDE and gnome under osx
[01:30] <Adam_G> JosefK, ah, ok :)
[01:30] <sethk> LGKeiz,I'll give you an example
[01:30] <Fletcher1> How do i check my nick again?
[01:30] <h1st0> bogdan, hrm... well i'm sure you just need the proper module for that card reader or mount the media.  But i've never used a card reader.

[01:31] <mcphail> bogdan: stop it
[01:31] <h1st0> Adammk, what problem?
[01:31] <sethk> LGKeiz, osx has a very nice feature that shrinks all the windows down to the point where you can see them all on the screen at once.  Some people say they don't want to live without it.  Other people say they never even use it.
[01:31] <LjL> bogdan: what part of "use the pastebin" didn't you get?
[01:31] <cablesm102> Adammk, I've never had that problem.

[01:32] <cablesm102> sethk, that's in Compiz. Still in beta.
[01:32] <RP3> Hello gracious Linux people.  I loaded Linux and everything works except that I can't mount a CD in my DVD-RW drive (it says "unable to mount media").  Drive shows up in hal-device-manager as CDROM and works fine under Windows and loaded Edgy just fine.
[01:32] <JosefK> Adam_G: I'm gonna get some kip, but to save you the effort I doubt gutting gnome would help
[01:32] <sethk> cablesm102, OK, I didn't know that, but that's not the point I was trying to make
[01:32] <h1st0> sethk, well if you use xgl or beryl it has a feature like this.  I'm sure there is an app that will do it for normal gnome though.
[01:33] <sethk> cablesm102, you'll recall that I said that linux has _more_ features than osx
[01:33] <Fletcher1> How is it I register or check my pass in IRC ?
[01:33] <cablesm102> sethk, got it
[01:33] <cablesm102> missed that
[01:33] <riddlebox> well my system doesnt lock up after  a few minutes now with the new nvidia drivers installed :)
[01:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sethk, only if  linux had more gaming support :(
[01:33] <Adam_G> JosefK, ok. I think I'm going to just let it be as it doesn't interfere with installing anything else
[01:33] <h1st0> sethk, you hit f10 in xgl and it tabs all the windows on the screen with live thumbnails  you can click one to bring it to the forfront.
[01:33] <Adammk> h1st0: I guess they did fix it then ;)
[01:33] <sethk> and I said, the question is not how _many_ features, but which features, and that's irretrievable subjective.
[01:33] <mumrah> i'm having a problem reading cds. my fstab is fine: "/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0"

[01:33] <JosefK> Adam_G: fair enough, good luck with it anyway
[01:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Yeah.

[01:34] <alves_rn> hello
[01:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sethk - In matter of fact, I am a big gamer, =) lol
[01:34] <Si[nt] aX> why wont totem play divx
[01:34] <h1st0> bogdan, perhaps search for the texas instruments flash card reader in the forums.
[01:34] <h1st0> Si[nt] aX, you need proper codecs for that.
[01:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sethk - ubuntu works well with wireless, I'm pretty impressed with it, I'm 10 doors down from the router, on the farest side of the room,and there is no lag or anything.
[01:34] <Fletcher1> Hey, how can i register in the IRC so i can send pvt messages?
[01:34] <h1st0> !codecs > Si[nt] aX
[01:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Flecher
[01:35] <alves_rn> is anyone using ATI pci-express video card?
[01:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> /msg nickserv register <password>
[01:35] <Fletcher1> thanks
[01:35] <sethk> LGKeiz, well, to be fair, linux isn't responsible for that, the wireless protocol is.
[01:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sethk - whatever wireless protocol it uses, it sure does a good job using it, Lol
[01:35] <sethk> LGKeiz, but it's true that if it were poorly done, linux could screw it up, and it isn't screwed up  :)
[01:35] <turgon> As long as I can play Neverwinter Knights, that's more than enough gaming for me :D
[01:35] <Si[nt] aX> weird
[01:35] <sethk> turgon, I'm still stuck on breakout.  :)
[01:35] <RP3> I'm having the same problem as mumrah
[01:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> turgon - you can play on ubuntu?
[01:35] <Si[nt] aX> i installed all these formats and lpugins
[01:36] <turgon> *Nights
[01:36] <bogdan> i did that, but no help
[01:36] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> turgon - If you can play on ubuntu you gotta teach me how :D
[01:36] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I will say good bye to windows lol permantly
[01:36] <RP3> can't mount a single CD in EDGY final release
[01:36] <sethk> mumrah, when you are troubleshooting, it's a very bad idea to say "my fstab is fine."  Perhaps it is, but you have a problem, and you don't know what is causing it, and eliminating fstab isn't a good place to start.
[01:36] <h1st0> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, I believe you can.
[01:36] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> h1st0 any idea how?
[01:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> turgon, please respond x.x
[01:37] <sethk> RP3, what happens when you try?
[01:37] <mumrah> sethk: fair enough. where should i move from here
[01:37] <h1st0> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, let me get you the howto
[01:37] <bogdan> can i do smth else ?
[01:37] <RP3> I was told DVD drives aren't really handled by fstab
[01:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> h1st0 sweet, I love you bro :P
[01:37] <turgon> Well, I haven't played yet (just ordered the DVD)
[01:37] <Si[nt] aX> ohh i guess i cant play movies from my network browser using file browser?
[01:37] <Anonymous1c4> Hmm... I have a problem with installing ubuntu...
[01:37] <RP3> sethk, it says "unable to mount"
[01:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> But you're saying you played other games on the ubuntu system turgon
[01:38] <RP3> mumrah, is that the same error you get?
[01:38] <Anonymous1c4> It seems when I try to format some unformated space, it stops at about 11 or 15% and makes my comp beep a couple tiems
[01:38] <turgon> Did what I wrote mean that? Sorry, wrong phrasing
[01:38] <sethk> RP3, mumrah in your position I would run mount under strace.  that allows me to see the error at the system call level.  However, it's a bit difficult to interpret.  If you like, run mount under strace, put the output onto the paste web site, and people here can look at it and possibly help.
[01:38] <mumrah> RP3, when i "mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0" i get "no media present"
[01:38] <h1st0> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, yeah they have a linux client
[01:38] <lullabud> Gah!  Why can't 6.06x just @#$% install on a Perc 5/i RAID controller?!?!
[01:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> h1st0 awesome, does it cost money *hopes not*
[01:39] <sethk> RP3, mumrah  Of course you may know more than enough to interpret the output yourself; I'm not trying to be insulting.
[01:39] <Anonymous1c4> Well, I can't really install either so you're not the only one lol
[01:39] <sizzam> how do i know which kernel I'm running?  I'm on a fresh install and here is what uname -a gives me:
[01:39] <h1st0> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, http://nwn.bioware.com/downloads/linuxclient.html  you just need your serial for the windows version
[01:39] <sizzam> Linux leshnix 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Fri Oct 13 18:45:35 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[01:39] <mumrah> sethk: lol, no offense taken. how do i run something as strace?
[01:39] <sethk> sizzam, uname -r
[01:39] <h1st0> sizzam, you are running 2.6.17-10
[01:39] <kitche> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: wine is free in everyway while cedega is pay
[01:40] <h1st0> sizzam, 686 version of that.
[01:40] <khermans> just use wine
[01:40] <h1st0> kitche, he doesn't need wine for never winter nights
[01:40] <sizzam> h1st0: sethk -- i thought i would start with the 386 kernel on a fresh install?
[01:40] <RP3> sethk & mumrah, I get the same thing "no media present"
[01:40] <sethk> mumrah, suppose you are running the command    mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom    to run under strace, you do:   strace -o strace.mount -ff mount -t iso9660 ...
[01:40] <kitche> h1st0: he asked about other games
[01:40] <h1st0> kitche, they make a linux client.
[01:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> h1st0 err I didn't mean nwn :) I meant If I wanted to play a game like gunbound or whatever I could
[01:40] <h1st0> ahh
[01:40] <sethk> sizzam, I'm not sure what edgy does.
[01:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> kitche isn't wine not very good?
[01:40] <lordtolstoi> hello ppl i need a floder arhive 4 flood i mean:D!
[01:40] <mzli> <sethk> how to mount iso parameter?
[01:40] <OhEay> Okay
[01:40] <kitche> LGKeiz it's good to a certain point cedega is better at games
[01:40] <OhEay> I give up
[01:41] <OhEay> Ubuntu just doesn't work
[01:41] <OhEay> My third install and it just reboots itself.
[01:41] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> OhEay lol don't ever give up, works fine here.
[01:41] <Anonymous1c4> At least you were able to install it hahah
[01:41] <mzli> sethk,  How to mount iso files?
[01:41] <OhEay> well
[01:41] <h1st0> LGKeiz-Ubuntu,  http://appdb.winehq.org/  go there and search for whatever games you want to play.  They will tell you wether its working or not with wine.
[01:41] <Anonymous1c4> I can't seem to even format some space :|
[01:41] <sethk> mzli, mount -r -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom                paths are examples, your system may vary  :)
[01:41] <OhEay> I have installed it three times now.
[01:41] <khermans> kitche, http://www.umasslug.org/index.php/Installing_the_latest_Wine_version_for_Ubuntu
[01:41] <OhEay> Every time, first boot and it reboots
[01:41] <OhEay> and continues to do so
[01:41] <sethk> mzli, oh, files, wait a second
[01:41] <mzli> sethk, thnx,
[01:41] <sethk> mzli, I do it this way:    losetup /dev/loop0 iso-filename
[01:41] <Si[nt] aX> what file browser will allow me to mount a windows share kinda like OSX with a simple right click and mount ?
[01:41] <mumrah> sethk, ok thanks
[01:41] <khermans> kitche, latest wine works just as well as cedega
[01:42] <sethk> mzli, then, mount -r -t iso9660 /dev/loop0 /mnt/whatever
[01:42] <h1st0> OhEay, well reinstalling won't fix that.  What about booting to recovery mode.
[01:42] <sethk> mzli, there is a way to do it in one step, where mount runs losetup for you
[01:42] <OhEay> Tried that as well.
[01:42] <OhEay> Didn't work either.
[01:42] <mzli> sethk, ok, thanks very much.
[01:42] <OhEay> Just reboots
[01:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holy fucking shit, RO works on wine
[01:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> opps
[01:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> wrong channel
[01:42] <OhEay> I don't think the server kernel likes my machine.
[01:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> >.>;
[01:42] <Anonymous1c4> lol
[01:42] <OhEay> And I can't run the regular ubuntu
[01:42] <h1st0> OhEay, okay hit a at the grub screen to apend to the end of the line and type acpi=off  see if that helps
[01:43] <h1st0> OhEay, does the livecd boot?
[01:43] <OhEay> ok
[01:43] <turgon> I read at Bioware's webpage the instructions to make Neverwinter run in Linux (didn't seem too complicated), and many posts from people playing so I have recently bought the Platinum DVD, and once I have it running I'll have all my comp-playing time covered :)
[01:43] <OhEay> well no.
[01:43] <Anonymous1c4> O.o
[01:43] <OhEay> 64mb of memory= not enough foir livecd
[01:43] <h1st0> OhEay, might be e to append
[01:43] <OhEay> :)
[01:43] <kitche> khermans umm ok don't know why you sent me that link since I pretty much know how to install most software anyways
[01:43] <blake> Can someone help me
[01:43] <h1st0> OhEay, ahh.
[01:43] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> OH YAY
[01:43] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> CS:S works
[01:43] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> o__O

[01:43] <h1st0> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, yeah I have it installed.

[01:45] <OhEay> Heh
[01:45] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Oh my...
[01:45] <OhEay> Then what's the problem :(
[01:46] <OhEay> It just reboots itself
[01:46] <OhEay> What the heck am I missing...
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> Hmm...
[01:46] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> can you guys help me dual-boot with my windows system/
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> how far do you get into booting it?
[01:46] <OhEay> I will just install windows 2000 on it for now.
[01:46] <OhEay> GRUB
[01:46] <mcphail> skreet: "sudo aptitide install packagname=versionnumber" IIRC
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> just grub?
[01:46] <OhEay> grub begins to load linux
[01:46] <OhEay> and reboots
[01:46] <OhEay> Yep.
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> eesh
[01:46] <OhEay> Soon as grub loads the kernel
[01:46] <skreet> mcphail, How about getting a list of options? :D
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> No errors or beeps?
[01:46] <blake> ok do u have any knowledge about ET and setting up servers?
[01:46] <OhEay> None
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> Hmm...
[01:46] <Anonymous1c4> ET?
[01:46] <LGKeiz> Ok
[01:46] <LGKeiz> Im on my windows system
[01:46] <Dominus_Suus> blake - sorry, less knowledge than I would have about webcams
[01:46] <mcphail> skreet: only way I know is to point firefox at the repo and see what's inside
[01:46] <LGKeiz> I have like 30GB to backup..
[01:47] <LGKeiz> I wonder how I am going to do this..
[01:47] <blake> dang
[01:47] <Dominus_Suus> blake - why don't you try one of the ET forums or rooms?
[01:47] <Anonymous1c4> Maybe there is a dedicated server program for Wolfenstein
[01:47] <blake> i dont know how to connect to ET rooms? i dont know any
[01:47] <blake> im very new to IRC
[01:47] <mumrah> i'm having a problem mounting cds, here is my strace output http://enja.org/david/strace_mount.txt
[01:47] <adm> did someone mention a windows system?!
[01:47] <Dominus_Suus> blake - you might want to look at the fan sites on gamespy and stuff like that
[01:48] <Anonymous1c4> Soooo
[01:48] <cirvin> does anyone know if there's a problem with the package, build-essential?
[01:48] <Anonymous1c4> Does any one know why my comp would stop formating at around 11 or 15%?
[01:48] <lullabud> cirvin:  i've never had problems with it.
[01:48] <Dominus_Suus> blake - my experience with the ET community is that it's far more loosely knit than the linux groups
[01:48] <Anonymous1c4> and make beeping noises?
[01:48] <Dominus_Suus> blake - being a proprietary game and everything
[01:48] <blake> yah. i was playing ET and someone told me to try sum IRC rooms cuz iv searched for tuts and stuff. no sucsess
[01:48] <lullabud> Anonymous1c4:  physical problems with the disk?
[01:48] <Anonymous1c4> Well, windows runs fine
[01:48] <skreet> LGKeiz, buy another hard drive? :D
[01:48] <Anonymous1c4> and when I installed windows it installed fine
[01:49] <blake> Im planning on setting up a Et server on linux :D
[01:49] <sethk> Anonymous1c4, sounds like a driver issue.  try running the install with dma disabled
[01:49] <cirvin> i know my code is valid, but it gives me very cryptic errors concerning my use of std::cout
[01:49] <Dominus_Suus> blake - do you need info on setting up a server or do are you troubleshooting it?
[01:49] <bokey> !ekiga
[01:49] <Anonymous1c4> what's the boot option for that?
[01:49] <lullabud> Anonymous1c4:  you installed windows across the entire hard disk, or the entire partition?
[01:49] <ubotu> ekiga: H.323 and SIP compatible VOIP client. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0.3-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 3582 kB, installed size 12568 kB
[01:49] <blake> need info
[01:49] <skreet> cirvin, Haven't had a problem.. what errors?
[01:49] <Anonymous1c4> Windows is on it's own partition, ya...
[01:49] <blake> more like help setting up 1
[01:49] <cirvin> the program is only a simple hello world in C++
[01:50] <lullabud> Anonymous1c4:  if you have windows running fine, but can't install ubuntu onto a different partition, it could be physical disk problems.  it could be something else though.
[01:50] <sethk> Anonymous1c4, on the kernel command line   ide=nodma
[01:50] <Adam_G> can anyone recommend screen video capture software?
[01:50] <RP3>  strace -o strace.mount mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom yields "mount: mount point /mnt/cdrom does not exist"
[01:50] <Adam_G> (other than istanbul)
[01:50] <sethk> anonymeeee, lullabud has a good point.  you can use badblocks to check the disk
[01:50] <Anonymous1c4> Hmm...
[01:50] <cirvin> undefined refrences to such things as std::cout
[01:50] <cirvin> its like the header is bad or someting
[01:50] <sethk> cirvin, that's in the c++ standard library
[01:50] <sethk> cirvin, unlikely that the header is bad.    what are you linking?
[01:50] <neuro_> blake: ET server runs fine on debian (I run one), I imagine it will run fine on debian, but it's not a packaged product, and I don't think this is the right place to look for help for configuring it on any distro
[01:51] <cirvin> just iostream
[01:51] <mumrah> RP3, does /mnt/cdrom exist?
[01:51] <Dominus_Suus> blake - go into the ET directory (/usr/local/games/enemy-territory/Docs) and look through the docs there
[01:51] <Dominus_Suus> are they any help?
[01:51] <sethk> cirvin, no, I meant what program are you linking?  something you wrote yourself?
[01:51] <LGKeiz> skreet - I'll just get Magic Parition lol
[01:51] <cirvin> hello world from a book
[01:52] <RP3> mumrah:  no
[01:52] <lullabud> cirvin:  you're in a book??
[01:52] <NotAvailable> my xubuntu doesn't properly shut down my PC, is there a fix for this ?
[01:52] <cirvin> the same code compiled fine under my other computer, running 6.06
[01:52] <RP3> mumrah:  mount/test exists
[01:52] <mumrah> RP3: try that
[01:52] <RP3> mumrah:  mnt/test
[01:52] <sethk> cirvin, it's either an install issue or a library path issue.
[01:52] <sethk> cirvin, check that libstdc++ is in the expected place.
[01:52] <mumrah> RP3, as root, "strace -o strace.mount mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/test"
[01:53] <cirvin> can you advise me on how to fix it?
[01:53] <RP3> mumrah:  admin@admin-desktop:/mnt$ strace -o strace.mount mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/test yields "strace: can't fopen 'strace.mount': Permission denied"
[01:53] <sethk> RP3, you need sudo.
[01:53] <mumrah> RP3, sudo it
[01:53] <skreet> ::sigh:: I want to downgrade my kernel, but I'm too incompitent to do it :(
[01:53] <sethk> RP3, you need sudo, also, to run the mount command
[01:53] <cirvin> forgive me for being anoob, but where should it be?
[01:53] <simmerz> I've just installed edgy on my laptop, and I'm trying to get my netgear wg511t card (ath_pci) working. Its found the card, and loaded the modules, but for some reason, I can't get it to do anything with the wireless assistant. any ideas?
[01:54] <cirvin> hm?
[01:55] <RP3> mumrah, sethk:  it's just sitting there, no prompt
[01:55] <adm> simmerz, what wireless assistant?
[01:55] <sethk> cirvin, wait, I'll see where mine is.
[01:55] <simmerz> adm, sorry, kubuntu, not gnome
[01:55] <adm> oh, well, you lost me
[01:55] <cirvin> okay, thanks
[01:55] <RP3> sethk, mumrah:  it says "Message from syslogd@admin-desktop at Thu Nov  9 16:55:01 2006 ...
[01:55] <RP3> admin-desktop kernel: [17183083.712000]  Disabling IRQ #217"
[01:56] <sethk> whoever asked me to look at the strace output for mount, /dev/cdrom0 is not the correct device for your cd
[01:56] <NotAvailable> out of 890 ppl (not counting me  .. is there anyone who knows how to fix a shutdown problem !? my xubuntu doesen't actualy power off my PC! HELP!
[01:56] <mumrah> sethk, was that mine? http://enja.org/david/strace_mount.txt ?
[01:56] <Dominus_Suus> NotAvailable - what are you using to shutdown?
[01:56] <sethk> mumrah, yes
[01:57] <kitche> NotAvailable does it say System Halted and stays there?
[01:57] <sethk> mumrah, it is saying there is no cd in /dev/cdrom0
[01:57] <NotAvailable> yes
[01:57] <sethk> mumrah, that either means that /dev/cdrom0 isn't pointing at your drive.  Or it could mean the drive is not configured correctly.  Or it could be that you forgot to put the cd in.  :)
[01:57] <NotAvailable> i tried with everi shutdown -... it still doesnt work
[01:57] <kitche> NotAvailable: that means your system is powered down you just have to hit the power button
[01:58] <NotAvailable> but i don't want to hold the pover button to power off
[01:58] <sethk> mumrah, your cd drive is IDE secondary master?
[01:58] <RP3> sethk:  mount says Mount error:  Unable to mount the selected volume.  No medium found.
[01:58] <mumrah> sethk, methinks so
[01:58] <mumrah> sethk, lemme check
[01:59] <kitche> NotAvailable: you are probably missing ACPI in your kernel
[01:59] <sethk> RP3, right.  it's querying the drive, and getting an answer that says there's no cd in it.
[01:59] <LGKeiz> Hey h1st0 how does CS:S run on wine?
[01:59] <NotAvailable> kitche: and how fo i fix that ?
[01:59] <mumrah> sethk, affirmative, secondary master
[01:59] <sethk> mumrah, ok.  can you boot and run the live cd?
[01:59] <kitche> NotAvailable: what kernel are you using now you can find out by doing uname -r
[02:00] <RP3> mumrah:  how do i see what my DVD is SUPPOSED to be?
[02:00] <NotAvailable> kitche:  2.6.17-10-generic
[02:00] <cirvin> sethk, any progress?
[02:00] <sethk> cirvin, yes hold on one moment
[02:00] <cirvin> mk
[02:00] <mumrah> sethk, not sure
[02:01] <mumrah> sethk, i upgraded with the update manager
[02:01] <sethk> cirvin, it depends on the gcc version.  you'll see the version in this path, so change it according to what gcc --version returns:
[02:01] <mumrah> RP3, that i do not know
[02:01] <kitche> NotAvailable you on a x86 machine or a x86_64?
=== dethwish__ is now known as richiefrich
[02:01] <NotAvailable> x86
[02:01] <sethk> cirvin:  /usr/lib/lbstdc++.so.6
[02:02] <sethk> cirvin, there is also /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6.0.5
[02:02] <sethk> cirvin, with that type of library, you'll always have the "real" library, as in libstdc++.so.6.0.5, then a link named libstdc++.so.6, then a link named libstdc++.so
[02:03] <sethk> cirvin, try installing the build-essential package with the flag to reinstall.
[02:03] <troopa> Does the AMD64 version of Ubuntu have a lot of issues with the ATI drivers?
[02:03] <mumrah> sethk, i'm gonna try the live cd, thanks for the help if you're gone when i return
[02:03] <kitche> NotAvailable: hmm generic should have ACPI in it but you can try linux-image-2.6.17-10-386
[02:03] <troopa> I can use the 'radeon' driver to get X to work properly, but if I use ATI or the open-source drivers then it will fail.
[02:04] <troopa> This sucks, because the 'radeon' drivers only have 2D support for my card.
[02:04] <skreet> I would really enjoy some working ipw3945
[02:04] <cirvin> whats the reinstall flag, it doesnt seem that file exists on my computer
[02:05] <ailean> cant totem play dvds?
[02:05] <RP3> Does anyone here know how to make a DVD RW drive work under Edgy?
[02:05] <troopa> I guess what I am asking is: Could the default ATI driver packages have issues running with the 64-bit version of Ubuntu? Would the i386 version work properly?
[02:05] <ailean> RP3, should work by default
[02:06] <NotAvailable> kitche:  well apparently i'm not the only one with this kind of bug... but the forum fixex don't work
[02:06] <mamonassassina> hello.
[02:06] <mamonassassina> i connected my mp3 player,but i can't add any files to it cause its "reading only".not even root can change that!so,how can i modify its permissions?
[02:06] <RP3> ailean:  nope
[02:06] <mamonassassina> i'm on edgy,and this didn't happen on dapper or breezy.
[02:07] <sethk> mamonassassina, edgy is still a bit, well, edgy.  stay with dapper for a while.
[02:07] <cirvin> sethk, whats the reinstall flag? that file doesnt seem to exist on my computer
[02:07] <mamonassassina> sethk: hm,ok,how can i downgrade?
[02:07] <mamonassassina> if that word even exists.
[02:07] <jrib> !downgrade
[02:07] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[02:07] <sethk> mamonassassina, I'm not the right person to ask about the package manager.  and yes, downgrade is a perfectly good word
[02:08] <sethk> cirvin, --reinstall
[02:08] <cirvin> XX soo simple....
[02:08] <Anonymous1c4> hmm...this is weird
[02:08] <RP3> I guess I can always delete Linux and go back to Windows since Windows will read CDs
[02:09] <cirvin> sethk no change
[02:09] <sethk> cirvin, try     locate libstdc++
[02:09] <Fletcher1> anyone help me mount a FAT16 HDD?
[02:10] <Random_Transit> does anyone here use Nvu???
[02:10] <sethk> cirvin, might want to run updatedb first, to update the file database
[02:10] <adm> RP3, Windows can also call home every other day
[02:10] <jrib> mamonassassina: I don't know the answer to your problem, but I can help you look... start searching for "pmount user permissions"
[02:10] <cirvin> oh there it is
[02:10] <ailean> RP3, you're not giving enough information
[02:10] <cirvin> doesnt look like its version number jives with my gcc number
[02:10] <ailean> RP3, tell us what you're doing and someone might be able to help.
[02:10] <anacaona> hello all
[02:10] <anacaona> just upgraded to edgy eft
[02:11] <anacaona> and i can't change the search engine in my new firefox
[02:11] <anacaona> though it seems to have many installed
[02:11] <jrib> !enter | anacaona
[02:11] <ubotu> anacaona: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[02:12] <turgon> RP3: the program which worked best for me to burn DVDs (even when other methods didn't) was K3B (just my noob experience, I have no knowledge of Linux at all)
[02:12] <Fletcher1> anyone help me with mounting a FAT16 HDD? I don't know which filesystem to use
[02:12] <adm> anacaona, https://addons.mozilla.org/search-engines.php
[02:12] <boggle> Fletcher1: -t vfat
[02:12] <sethk> Fletcher1, I told you three times.
[02:12] <Fletcher1> hi seth
[02:12] <Fletcher1> i get an error message
[02:12] <Fletcher1> when using msdos or vfat
[02:12] <Fletcher1> wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb ect....
[02:13] <anacaona> adm: the search engines are there, i just can't switch between them.
[02:13] <anacaona> jrib: duly noted.
[02:13] <ailean> guys, what repo do i need to add to get libdvdcss?
[02:13] <cirvin> ARg, this is very frustrating, it seems that that library version is not the same as GCC version
[02:13] <mumrah> sethk, i cant seem to boot to the live cd
[02:13] <jrib> !dvd | ailean
[02:13] <planktonboy> hi all
[02:13] <ubotu> ailean: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html  -  libdvdcss can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[02:13] <jrib> mamonassassina: can you tell me the output of the 'groups' command?
[02:13] <mumrah> !cd
[02:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:14] <ailean> ta jrib :$
[02:14] <mamonassassina> jrib: sure,but,where can i find that output?properties,permissions?
[02:14] <Anonymous1c4> sethk, when you use badblocks, you just type the partition in, like /dev/hdc6 or whatever? How long does it usually take
[02:14] <troopa> Does the  ATI Proprietary Linux driver support 3D acceleration?
[02:14] <bung> sorry this is OT, but does anyone know the name of the app that lets you connect to ET games easily QXL or something
[02:14] <jrib> mamonassassina: open accessories > terminal, then type 'groups' without quotes, and press enter
[02:14] <sethk> mumrah, really sounds like a hardware issue with this cd drive.  you might try disabling DMA in the BIOS setup.  (most, but not all, BIOS setups let you do that)
[02:14] <troopa> Does the  ATI Proprietary Linux driver support 3D acceleration?
[02:15] <mamonassassina> jrib: rgg adm dialout fax cdrom floppy tape audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
[02:15] <kitche> troopa: yes and don't repeat so fast
[02:15] <mamonassassina> rgg is the user.
[02:15] <sethk> Anonymous1c4, depends on the options (the time, that is).  and you run it on the device, as in /dev/hda, not a particular partition.
[02:15] <cirvin> sethk, why would it install GCC4.1.1 when the other libs are around 5.0.7?
[02:15] <RamiKassab> oops, guys I accidently releted all the files in a folder that were kinda important, is there a way to recover these? this is on an ubuntu server
[02:15] <Anonymous1c4> k
[02:15] <mamonassassina> and i may have found a solution,but i dont know what to do with it.
[02:15] <sethk> Anonymous1c4, to check a particular partition, you set the starting and ending block numbers for the scan
[02:15] <mamonassassina> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/pmount/+bug/8934
[02:15] <sethk> cirvin, different series of numbers.
[02:16] <Anonymous1c4> And, how do I know what the block numbers are from such and such megabytes of space?
[02:16] <sethk> cirvin, the libraries used to be separate packages, then they bundled the compiler and libraries into a single thing
[02:16] <sethk> cirvin, 4.1.1 is the latest released gcc, at least it was as of a couple of weeks ago.
[02:17] <cirvin> ugh, so what would be the next course of action?
[02:18] <Fletcher1> whats the paste dumping site?
[02:18] <jrib> mamonassassina: yes, it is probably related, but notice that that was fixed back in warty.  Where does your device get mounted to?
[02:18] <kitche> !paste
[02:18] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)

[02:19] <cirvin> sethk, i have no idea what to do next... is there some way i can point GCC to that library if it isnt naturally finding it?
[02:20] <sethk> cirvin, yes, on the command line, you use    -L /path/to/library
[02:20] <mamonassassina> jrib: done.let me try adding some file there
[02:20] <sethk> cirvin, that will add a directory to the paths searched to find libraries
[02:20] <byteshack> can some one help figure out why I have no sound?
[02:20] <cirvin> okay, lets see if that works
[02:20] <jrib> mamonassassina: nah, that won't do anything.  just gives you info.  What did it say?
[02:20] <byteshack> as far as I can tell I have everything I should have
[02:20] <mamonassassina> jrib: hahahah

[02:21] <byteshack> but nada sound
[02:21] <ailean> jrib, i just can't get this dvd to play
[02:21] <jrib> mamonassassina: interesting... that means you should be able to write to it.  What does 'touch /media/usbdisk/test' say?  (this creates an empty file called test)
[02:21] <byteshack> I'm not sure where else to go looking for issues
[02:21] <cirvin> sethk, no luck
[02:21] <mamonassassina> jrib: touch: no  possvel realizar touch sobre `/media/usbdisk/test': Sistema de arquivos somente-leitura
[02:22] <sethk> cirvin, you found the library with locate?
[02:22] <mamonassassina> jrib: translating...
[02:22] <jrib> mamonassassina: it's ok I know portuguese :)
[02:22] <mamonassassina> can't be done,reading-only.
[02:22] <sethk> cirvin, can you paste the command, and the output, to the paste site?
[02:22] <mamonassassina> jrib: oh,ok
[02:22] <sethk> !br
[02:22] <ubotu> Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[02:22] <cirvin> yah, its in  /usr/lib/ and xterm wont let me cut or paste
[02:22] <byteshack> it's read-only
[02:22] <skreet> There  has to be someone out there that has a ipw3945 that had the same problem as me and fixed it
[02:22] <jrib> mamonassassina: but, tath explains the problem
[02:22] <cirvin> i shoulndt have upgraded to edgy
[02:22] <mamonassassina> sethk: i speak english well enough :)
[02:22] <ailean> sethk, read before doing that
[02:22] <mamonassassina> sethk: and ubuntu-br and -pt are always empty.
[02:22] <sethk> skreet, that's half right.  there has to be someone out there that has the same problem
[02:22] <sethk> ailean, no thank you
[02:23] <skreet> sethk, I know that much.
[02:23] <ailean> sethk, cheek
[02:23] <sethk> mamonassassina, I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the person who asked the question
[02:23] <skreet> sethk,  :(
[02:23] <jrib> ailean: what player?

[02:23] <skreet> version wise..
[02:23] <mamonassassina> sethk: who?
[02:23] <ailean> jrib, any - i've tried vlc, xine, totem, ogle
[02:23] <RP3> sethk, is there a way to troubleshoot no medium found?
[02:23] <sethk> mamonassassina, I'm not sure, I'm completely confused at this point  :)
[02:24] <jrib> ailean: and you installed dvdcss from seveas' repo ok?
[02:24] <mamonassassina> sethk: ok :P
[02:24] <[sYn] > whats the command to find out what kernel im running currently?
[02:24] <byteshack> my experience from dapper > edgy hasn't quite been a pleasseant one either
[02:24] <ailean> jrib, yeah
[02:24] <sethk> RP3, can you boot the live cd?  I'm asking because, if you can use the live cd, that proves your cd drive is working and can work with linux.
[02:24] <ailean> jrib, and enabled decryption
[02:24] <byteshack> [sYn] : uname -a  maybe?
[02:24] <LGKeiz> with WINE can you run net programs ( aka services ) ?
[02:24] <RamiKassab> guys, is there any way whatsoever to try to recover files that were deleted on an ubuntu server machine running the ext3 filesystem? any help would be greatly greatly appreciated... thank you!
[02:25] <mamonassassina> jrib: so,what is the problem?
[02:25] <[sYn] > byteshack, thats the one :D
[02:25] <[sYn] > thanks
[02:25] <skreet> Why did they stop the free CD program for 6.10?
[02:25] <RP3> sethk:  I loaded edgy with this drive, and it works in Windows on this system
[02:25] <cirvin> sethk, what if i uninstalled everythign from build-essential and related packages?
[02:25] <sethk> [sYn] , uname -r.  uname -a shows the kernel and other info
[02:25] <ailean> ah, jrib i think i see my prob
[02:25] <jrib> mamonassassina: search for "ubuntu pmount read-only" I'm reading through the threads now.  here is an interesting one https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-system-tools/+bug/26338

[02:26] <jellegant> hello, room
[02:26] <sethk> cirvin, can't hurt.  I install the compiler from source.  It's not the recommended way, and everyone yells at me about it (well, except the people at work) but the problems disappear immediately.
[02:26] <jrib> mamonassassina: oops, wrong link.   I meant: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2252
[02:26] <cirvin> compile the compiler?
[02:27] <Hansin321> I am trying out Ubuntu Server 6.10 -- Is there a good command-line program to use to turn on and off what services are started at boot time?  thanks.
[02:27] <sethk> cirvin, right
[02:27] <ailean> jrib, for seveas' repo, should i leave it as dapper, or change it to edgy?
[02:27] <skreet> Hansin321, update-rc.d
[02:27] <sethk> cirvin, I'm very used to doing it, because I build the compiler for new hardware that we build at work.

[02:27] <sethk> cirvin, but building a native compiler is extremely easy.
[02:27] <Shaezsche> Fsck died with an exit error of 1 right before it finished my /home partition. what does that mean???

[02:28] <cirvin> i'd like to know how, if it fixes the probs
[02:28] <cirvin> but i have to depart for now
[02:28] <ailean> jrib, ta
[02:28] <RamiKassab> sethk: any suggestions? right now I'm willing to try anything
[02:29] <RP3> should I 86 Linux?
[02:29] <Shaezsche> must i wait for 30 boots to do a fsck, can i initiate it?
[02:29] <sethk> RamiKassab, first, you can't write anything to the file system.  if you do, you'll clobber the thing you are trying to recover
[02:29] <sethk> Shaezsche, there is a flag on shutdown that forces a check at the next boot
[02:29] <sethk> Shaezsche, you can also boot the live cd and check it that way.
[02:29] <Shaezsche> how can i set that flag?
[02:29] <Shaezsche> Fsck died with an exit error of 1 right before it finished my /home partition. what does that mean???
[02:30] <sethk> Shaezsche, if you like, you can set the number 30 to 10, or 5, or 1
[02:30] <Languid> anyone here have experience using dmraid with a via sata controller?
[02:30] <sethk> Shaezsche, depends on the error.
[02:30] <Shaezsche> error 1
[02:30] <Shaezsche> and how can i set that number
[02:30] <sethk> Shaezsche, the flag on shutdown i -F.       shutdown -F now
[02:30] <RP3> sethk, I did sudo mkdir /media/cdrom1 and now I get "no medium found" on both DVD drives
[02:30] <mamonassassina> jrib: interesting.so,the guy just had to format his mp3 player?
[02:30] <sethk> Shaezsche, you set/change the number with tune2fs
[02:30] <Shaezsche> okbut what does error 1 mean
[02:30] <jrib> mamonassassina: yeah, seems like it.  Though I'm not sure /why/
[02:31] <vintle> anyone fmiliar with mysqladmin?
[02:31] <sethk> RP3, paste the exact mount command you are using.
[02:31] <blake> OHHHH i see
[02:31] <Shaezsche> does anyone know what an fsck ERROR 1 is?
[02:31] <sethk> Shaezsche, the fsck error?  it doesn't say anything other than error 1?
[02:31] <blake> ima understanding the nonsense
[02:31] <Shaezsche> sethk it says fsck died due to an error of exit 1
[02:32] <sethk> Shaezsche, it has to say something before that.  well, it doesn't _have_ to, but I've never seen it only say exit 1.
[02:32] <adm> there is a -F option with shutdown (upstart)? O.o
[02:32] <sethk> Shaezsche, fsck itself crashed, then
[02:32] <Shaezsche> "fsck died exit status error 1"
[02:32] <sethk> Shaezsche, try booting the live cd and running fsck from there.
[02:32] <Shaezsche> um, ok
[02:32] <Shaezsche> how do i do that?
[02:32] <sarixe> hi mashera
[02:32] <Shaezsche> from the menu?
[02:32] <RP3> sethk, I tried mount /dev/hda and mount /dev/hdb
[02:33] <sethk> RP3, then you are telling it to use the options in /etc/fstab, which probably aren't what you need.
[02:33] <Shaezsche> i just reinstalled edgy but i didnt formate my ./home parition just ROOT
[02:33] <vintle> anyone familiar with mysqladmin? I got 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
[02:33] <sethk> RP3, try providing all the options on the command line.
[02:33] <no0tic> hi, on my intel hda audio card the mic input doesn't work, there's a way to make it work?
[02:33] <ailean> jrib, it was a problem with the actual DVD, i think. when it stopped after the piracy warning, but if i selected the menu before that could happen, it would continue.  not ideal, but i think it's just this DVD
[02:33] <jrib> ailean: oh I see, good catch

[02:49] <amiyourjuliet> dooglus: What do they mean when they say - include ${QTDIR}/bin at the end of your PATH
[02:49] <Darfff> Pelo, itll be even better if you open the fsb to 166 and use some ddr333
[02:49] <kitche> GaiaX11: it's cdda you need to burn the songs as audio cd is the only way

[02:50] <jrib> doctormo: what do you mean by "charges"?
[02:51] <kitche> GaiaX11: one way you can use any audio cd burner if the burner can do it which most can
[02:51] <doctormo> jrib: people who I look after their computer for them.
[02:51] <dooglus> amiyourjuliet: no, you just add /usr/lib/qt4/bin to the end of your PATH variable, wherever you sert that up

[02:54] <amiyourjuliet> so i downloaded and compiled qt4
[02:54] <Lathiat> amiyourjuliet: compile qt3 or compile a qt3 app?
[02:54] <cheesy> i want to stop X completely
[02:54] <jrib> amiyourjuliet: why are you compiling?
[02:55] <bulmer> cheesy: press ctrl+backspace
[02:55] <Lathiat> amiyourjuliet: you want the qt4-dev-tools package to get qmake to compile an app if the app you want isnt in the repository
[02:55] <Lathiat> cheesy: /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:55] <amiyourjuliet> lathiat: i want to compile a qt app
[02:55] <Lathiat> cheesy: (with sudo)
[02:55] <doctormo> dooglus: that wasn't me
[02:55] <dooglus> cheesy: type "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"

[03:01] <doctormo> MarcN: gdm starts ok but when you try and log in it takes you to the default xsession
[03:01] <Pelo> amiyourjuliet,   add/remove is a little more noob oriented  it's just for end user apps,  synaptic covers all packages individualy ,including dependencies such as libiraries and stuff
[03:02] <doctormo> MarcN: Executing default failed, will try to run x-terminal-emulator

[03:16] <adam_> what is a good file sharing utility besides amule?
[03:17] <hyphenated> amiyourjuliet: where'd you get this thing from? most apps have a 'configure' stage before 'make' when you use the source
[03:17] <jrib> adam_: gtk-gnutella?  bittorrent?
[03:17] <thomas_> limewire.
[03:17] <adam_> jrib, can i get that from ubuntu using apt-get what?
[03:17] <adam_> limewire is good too?
[03:18] <skreet> limewire is windows only afaik
[03:18] <thomas_> limewire's the best for tunes..
[03:18] <jrib> adam_: apt-get install gtk-gnutella,  you should already have the gnome bittorent program
[03:18] <thomas_> no limewire not just for windows.
[03:18] <thomas_> !limewire
[03:18] <ubotu> limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.

[03:18] <thomas_> LIMEWIRE DOES RUN ON LINUX. frostwire is just limewire only blue.
[03:19] <jrib> skreet: if there were, that does not mean you should too
[03:19] <adam_> so apt-get limewire?
[03:19] <LjL> skreet, then use the !botabuse factoid please.

[03:21] <CITguy> would anybody know what command i might run to test if a package is installed?
[03:21] <LjL> CITguy: apt-cache policy <package>
[03:21] <adam_> install in progress... thanks
[03:21] <skreet> Ubutu, please tell skreet about easyubuntu
[03:22] <skreet> Is that supposed to so something? :(
[03:22] <jrib> skreet: only if you spell ubotu's name right :)
[03:22] <skreet> That'll do it!
[03:22] <LjL> skreet, yes, give you the answer and tell you that you should message the bot in private
[03:22] <CITguy> (LjL) will that work in a script file to test existence?
[03:22] <skreet> Ubotu, please tell skreet about easyubuntu
[03:22] <Pelo> CITguy, sudo checkinstall

[03:23] <CITguy> ok, thanks
[03:23] <LjL> !offtopic | linuxfanstar
[03:23] <ubotu> linuxfanstar: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:23] <skreet> linuxfanstar, You probably shouldn't but you have the freedom.
[03:23] <bimberi> linuxfanstar: sure, as long as it's an Ubuntu question :)
[03:23] <Pelo> LjL, ?
[03:23] <bruenig> if I wanted to open a terminal, have it run a command, and stay open, how would I do that. for instance "xfce4-terminal -x ls /home, when I do that it will open run the command and then close, but I want it to stay open
[03:23] <dicon> hum
[03:23] <LjL> Pelo, "sudo checkinstall"?
[03:23] <linuxfanstar> well since you guys are probably engineers i wondered if you have ever had a group member who didnt do any work on your project
[03:23] <Pelo> LjL,  I got that from a site
[03:23] <linuxfanstar> dont know what i should really do about it
[03:24] <dicon> anyone has already tried to send a file to other ppl using xchat on ubuntu edgy?
[03:24] <skreet> bruenig, Try command && /bin/bash
[03:24] <dicon> it has a bug
[03:24] <dicon> :(
[03:24] <skreet> that'll run a shell..
[03:24] <LjL> linuxfanstar, definitely an #ubuntu-offtopic question
[03:24] <pepoX> ./ati-installer.sh: 176: Syntax error: Bad substitution
[03:24] <Pelo> LjL,   sorry  I guess I grabbed the wrong command
[03:24] <linuxfanstar> sorry
[03:24] <kitche> Pelo: checkinstall is used to make .deb files
[03:24] <skreet> linuxfanstar, Fire them?
[03:24] <linuxfanstar> student
[03:24] <thomas_> linuxfanstar: most people in here are just ubuntu users.
[03:24] <pepoX> i have problem with driver ati in edgy
[03:25] <skreet> linuxfanstar, Kick them out?
[03:25] <linuxfanstar> i will seach for some education ones...
[03:25] <linuxfanstar> well semester almost over
[03:25] <bruenig> skreet, that doesn't work, I did xfce4-terminal -x ls ~ && /bin/bash and it opened listed the contents and then closed
[03:25] <grodius> whats the path to xorg.conf
[03:25] <linuxfanstar> i want them to do the owrk but i cant get them to
[03:25] <thomas_> so if you're doing all the work anyways, don't worry about kicking them out of your project.
[03:25] <LjL> grodius: /etc/X11
[03:25] <grodius> LjL:  thanks
[03:25] <linuxfanstar>      /usr/x11
[03:25] <skreet> bruenig, Cant remember the hang command, hold on a sec
[03:26] <LjL> grodius: you might want to consider using "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" instead of tinkering with xorg.conf directly though
[03:26] <kitche> linuxfanstar: umm it's /etc/X11
[03:26] <LjL> linuxfanstar, no
[03:26] <kitche> LjL: he left :)
[03:26] <skreet> it would be great if any of my apps would launch
[03:26] <linuxfanstar> woops sorry
[03:26] <skreet> cant help you I guess :(
[03:26] <pppoe_dude> anyone here using qemu? do you get 100% CPU usage even when its not doing anything?
[03:26] <linuxfanstar> qemu is emulation
[03:26] <pppoe_dude> i have kqemu module loaded
[03:26] <LjL> pppoe_dude, i'm not sure it can detect when the guest is "not doing anything"
[03:27] <pppoe_dude> i.e. is it supposed to be 100% ? :P
[03:27] <LjL> it could catch HALT instructions, *if* they're issued, but i don't know if it does that
[03:27] <skreet> The guest is probably wasting cpu cycles for you :)
[03:27] <skreet> rather than the host OS
[03:27] <thomas_> pppoe_dude: if you're having problems with qemu, vmware player is pretty good as well.
[03:27] <pppoe_dude> thomas_, i c.
[03:27] <adam_> ok im back
[03:28] <adam_> for some reason, frostwire wont run
[03:28] <adam_> i hit the app, in the menu, and it doesnt run
[03:28] <kitche> adam_: did you install java?
[03:28] <adam_> any ideas?
[03:28] <adam_> no
[03:28] <adam_> what is the cmd?
[03:28] <thomas_> pppoe_dude: only difference is, with vmware-player you "need" to use premade images.
[03:28] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell adam_ about java
[03:28] <thomas_> but thats not completely true.
[03:28] <lullabud> pppoe_dude:  there's a major difference between vmware and qemu though.  qemu emulates all of the hardware which lets you run different architectures.  vmware only works on x86.
[03:28] <LjL> thomas_: well, another difference is that vmware is proprietary
[03:28] <lullabud> pppoe_dude:  that's not necessarily a bad thing though, vmware is better for sure, so long as your needs only require x86.
[03:29] <thomas_> but that doesn't really matter to most people.
[03:29] <Kaiyang> ok- For a beginner If i need to set up a server. Which should I use? DESKTOP or SERVER EDITION? I am poor in using console based unless it's dead easy
[03:29] <skreet> proprietary is the wrong word..
[03:29] <LjL> skreet: really?
[03:29] <skreet> Kaiyang, go with desktop then, server is console only by default
[03:29] <adam_> LjL, thanks
[03:29] <pppoe_dude> so i can't run any iso image on vmware?
[03:29] <thomas_> yeah not exactly.
[03:29] <LjL> pppoe_dude: http://www.easyvmx.com
[03:30] <lullabud> pppoe_dude:  of course, the other big difference is that qemu lets you create VM's, but the free version of vmware doesn't.
[03:30] <skreet> LjL, I think of proprietary as using it's own format not compatable with other formats.. but doesn't qemu also use it's own format, it's open vs closed, not proprietary vs standard :)
[03:30] <bimberi> Kaiyang: server edition.  You will need to become comfortable with the console.
[03:30] <thomas_> yeah thats what you want. you use qemu-img to create a vmdk image.. then you can use vmware-player to load that with installation media.
[03:30] <pppoe_dude> i c
[03:30] <LjL> skreet: well, that's the definition of "proprietary" that the FSF uses though. you might disagree but that's different from saying it's the wrong word
[03:30] <Kaiyang> Can DESKTOP EDITION work the same as SERVER Edition?
[03:31] <skreet> Kaiyang, yes
[03:31] <thomas_> yeah it can.
[03:31] <holycow> Kaiyang, its the same thing
[03:31] <holycow> desktop just has extra software
[03:31] <kitche> Kaiyang: you can install a desktop later on the server if you wish
[03:31] <adam_> man java takes forever
[03:31] <AlReece45> I would've thought this would've been easier, but how do I erase a DVD+RW?
[03:31] <|rt|> server and desktop do have different kernels
[03:31] <grodius> Can someone please help me, I updated to Edgy and now X wont start. Is there any way to reinstall the upgrade to Edgy completely?
[03:31] <adam_> startx doesnt work?
[03:31] <LjL> !downgrade | grodius
[03:31] <ubotu> grodius: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[03:31] <bimberi> Kaiyang: the desktop CD can only do a desktop install though.  The alternate can do a minimal/server install as well as desktop
[03:32] <riddlebox> is there a command I can run on a dir or files that will show me which contains a certain string? i.e. INSERT INTO?
[03:32] <grodius> ubotu: I wanted to REINSTALL edgy not 'downgrade'
[03:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I wanted to REINSTALL edgy not 'downgrade' - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:32] <|rt|> certain drivers do not work with the server kernel such as nvidia or ivtv
[03:32] <MarcN> grodius: try reconfiguring X --     sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:32] <tale_> I grabbed the latest ubuntu server vmimage, but it doesn't have a readme file telling the username and password.  Does anyone know it?
[03:32] <LjL> riddlebox: grep
[03:32] <bimberi> riddlebox: grep "INSERT INTO" * (in the directory)
[03:32] <grodius> MarcN: already tried that, didnt help
[03:32] <riddlebox> sweet thanks
[03:32] <Pelo> grodius,  download the cd and install from there , backup your home folder before hand
[03:32] <LjL> tale_: guess the username is "ubuntu" and the password's blank
[03:32] <skreet> goodnight everyone :)
[03:32] <|rt|> atleast not directly from the packages in the repository
[03:32] <lullabud> tale_:  i had the same problem.  had to boot single and change it.
[03:33] <MarcN> grodius: take a look at /var/log/Xorg.*log and see what it is complaining about.
[03:33] <Kaiyang> What's the PROs and CONS between the 2 EDITION ? In terms of server performance wise?
[03:33] <tale_> it's not ubuntu/<blank>
[03:33] <LjL> grodius: if you want to reinstall, just take the CD, wipe it out and reinstall. it doesn't make much sense in another sense
[03:33] <tale_> I'll single boot and replace it
[03:33] <kitche> Kaiyang: nothing really just that server is a bare system pretty much
[03:33] <bimberi> Kaiyang: none, all Ubuntu packages come from the same repositories
[03:33] <sethk> Kaiyang, no difference.  only difference is how much disk space they take up.  The desktop starts the display manager, but that doesn't impact performance unless it is used.
[03:33] <kittyhawk> hello
[03:33] <grodius> LjL: but is there a way to reinstall from the packages on the internet, and not wipe my hd
[03:34] <lullabud> tale_:  better yet, single boot and create your own user.
[03:34] <kitche> grodius: how did you upgrade to Edgy?
[03:34] <kittyhawk> I recently upgraded to edgy, and the colors on the console have changed, so that it's unreadable
[03:34] <LjL> grodius, no. you can reinstall single packages -- you can probably go and reinstall all of them. i don't see how that'd help though.
[03:34] <sethk> grodius, you never have to wipe your drive to install, regardless of the method.
[03:34] <kittyhawk> and in particular, nethack doesn't work :-(
[03:34] <grodius> kitche: using the upgrade program built in ubuntu
[03:34] <kittyhawk> any ideas either how to fix it or where I can look to find out?
[03:34] <cheesy> how can i open a conf file as root?
[03:34] <Kaiyang> OK. So lastly the LAMP is already available when I install the DESKTOP edition?
[03:35] <bimberi> cheesy: sudo vi blah.conf
[03:35] <LjL> cheesy: gksudo gedit <file>
[03:35] <kitche> grodis: update-manager right?
[03:35] <grodius> kitche: yes
[03:35] <thomas_> no lamp is not available.
[03:35] <MarcN> Kaiyang: sure.  Just install apache/mysql/php5/etc
[03:35] <thomas_> to install lamp after on the desktop system, you need to install ubuntu-server
[03:35] <thomas_> i believe.
[03:35] <kitche> grodius: you can try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to see if it grabbed all the packages for edgy that you have
[03:36] <LjL> ^5?
[03:36] <AlReece45> Has anyone here erased/blanked a DVD+RW with ubuntu?
[03:36] <grodius> kitche: no i have all the packages
[03:36] <bimberi> LjL: High 5 :)
[03:36] <LjL> oh =)
[03:36] <adam_> !gksudo
[03:36] <ubotu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use gksudo, as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using sudo {guiapp}
[03:36] <cheesy> LjL:  thanks
[03:36] <Kaiyang> Can you teach me a how to process on installing the AMP?
[03:36] <kittyhawk> also, does anyone know a way to ask apt to find all of the uninstalled "recommended" or "suggested" packages?
[03:36] <santeria> ok i used the text installer for the 64 bit edition of edgy and when it did that line thing, so i did ctl alt f2 and typed in the ocmmands and one of them was to find the nvidia drivers and it was sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx
[03:36] <grodius> X wont start for some reason, and ive run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and nothing helps
[03:36] <jrib> !lamp | Kaiyang
[03:36] <ubotu> Kaiyang: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[03:36] <kitche> grodius: cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log and paste it

[03:47] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow - well basically abunch of y's went down my screen
[03:47] <thomas_> !mysql | marc
[03:47] <ubotu> marc: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[03:47] <holycow> AlReece45, why don't you just select the files and hit delte?
[03:47] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> and when I hit a key they moved across the screen
[03:47] <blake> ivx:
[03:47] <holycow> its just another random access format
[03:47] <Mantice> Could some one help me I just upgraded to Edgy now my ubuntu dont boot.
[03:47] <blake> how do i whisper to people?
[03:47] <Pelo> santeria,  do you have multiple video cards  ?
[03:47] <grodius> jrib: done
[03:47] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ... when trying to start the live cd

[03:47] <santeria> nvidia
[03:48] <santeria> pci-e
[03:48] <Mantice> You know how you can add programs to boot on session ?
[03:48] <AlReece45> holycow: tried it, was mounted read-only for some reason :-/ and gave me a prompt on it for every file (took a while to cancel)
[03:48] <Pelo> santeria,  go and check the forum for your video card model
[03:48] <holycow> unmount it, mount it rw
[03:48] <santeria> where
[03:48] <jrib> grodius: yeah that took a while.  The log is needed to.  But why don't you just dcc that to me and I'll pastebin it for you (/var/log/Xorg.0.log)
[03:48] <LjL> !enter | santeria
[03:48] <ubotu> santeria: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[03:48] <AlReece45> holycow: k3b is working, didn't want another program installed, but it's working
[03:48] <ivx> blake are you kidding? you might want to try google for your help
[03:48] <santeria> i didnt....
[03:48] <Pelo> santeria,  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/
[03:48] <grodius> jrib: dcc what to you? my xorg.conf
[03:48] <Mantice> How do you remove programs that boot on session via terminal.
[03:48] <blake> ivx when i launch camorama, it cant detect my webcam. i did a lsusb and it is detected why cant it detect it
[03:49] <jrib> grodius: nah, /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[03:49] <thomas_> Mantice: Services.
[03:49] <troopa> I am getting the following error(s) when I run fglrxinf:  Error; Couldn't find RGB GLX Visual!
[03:49] <grodius> jrib: ok how do i send it to you? just in flood?
[03:49] <Mantice> thomas_ could it be that I added beryl as a service then ?
[03:49] <troopa> Here is my dmesg: http://paste.uni.cc/11512
[03:49] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow - I have a nVidia G-force 4000MX card, when I install ubuntu, what should I do If I get all these weird errors
[03:50] <ivx> blake, lsusb tell you what kind of hardware it is, but, like in the case of broadcome 34xx that doesn't mean it works, goo the name of the webcam and ubuntu, and look for a tutorial
[03:50] <holycow> what are the errors?
[03:50] <santeria> i cant really find it can someone help me?
[03:50] <thomas_> blake: maybe you should check out camorama's help pages.... they'd be the people that would actually know.
[03:50] <Mantice> thomas_ I need to remove it because its crashing ........
[03:50] <abhinay> iam getting 'There are differences between boot and its backup' ; 'not automatically fixing this' while booting; Is there any wrong with my hard disk ?
[03:50] <kittyhawk> what's the difference between apt's recommended and suggested packages?
[03:50] <ivx> blake *google, not goo
[03:50] <jrib> grodius: /dcc send jrib /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[03:50] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow - can't explain all it does, is yyyyyyy all down the screen
[03:50] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> But I think it's graphic card problem
[03:50] <grodius> jrib: also, i got the message for you that it gives me when i try to startx
[03:50] <LjL> abhinay: not necessarily. i had that too after messing up a bit with windows and linux
[03:50] <lazzareth> Im having trouble changing the port of the stock python bittorrent that comes with ubuntu.. ive changed the port range in download.py but it is still trying to use the blacklisted 6881 ?
[03:50] <LjL> abhinay: you need to, uhm... if i remembered. hold on
[03:50] <blake> ok
[03:50] <thomas_> Mantice: just change what window manager is being used with beryl-manager. Or you can just uninstall beryl, and metacity would take over where beryl had previously.
[03:51] <holycow> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you can't explain the problem and expect me to suggest a solution? i'm sorry bro i'm really trying here
[03:51] <abhinay> LjL, ok
[03:51] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow - It's unexplainable
[03:51] <grodius> jrib: crap i have to be registered
[03:51] <thomas_> lazzareth: do you have a router? maybe you could route the port differently.
[03:51] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> a bunch of y's go down the screen
[03:51] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> that is all
[03:51] <lazzareth> thomas_ as in make the external port point to 6881 ?
[03:51] <lazzareth> I could try that
[03:51] <holycow> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, ctrl / alt / f2 to go to console or f3 or f4
[03:52] <holycow> reinstall xorg install nvidia drivers maybe from repo?
[03:52] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sec
[03:52] <thomas_> lazzareth: with routers, you can take any port internally and make it any port externally.
[03:52] <jrib> grodius: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30797/ is your xorg.conf in case you need to show someone else
[03:52] <Mantice> thomas_ what Happend is I installed beryl and it dident work, so I upgraded to edgey now every thing is crashing.
[03:52] <any> hi, does ubuntu 6.10 come with nvidia drivers on the CD?
[03:52] <grodius> jrib: thanks
[03:52] <thomas_> Mantice, uninstall all of the packages beryl had you install.
[03:52] <Mantice> thomas_ I typed sudo apt-get remove ruby but it still booted.
[03:52] <grodius> jrib: im just going to put the file in flood, cuz i cant send it to you
[03:52] <jrib> grodius: ok
[03:52] <ivx> blake when ever you have a problem like whatever not working, google it and someone prolly has a fix, also when you talk to someone it is helpful to put there name in the line
[03:52] <thomas_> mantice: ruby is not beryl.
[03:53] <thomas_> mantice: ruby is a scripting language.
[03:53] <Mantice> I mean beryl :)
[03:53] <santeria> so how do i search to see if a nvidia 6800gs works
[03:53] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow - works fine in safe mode
[03:53] <blake> ivx ok thanks :)
[03:53] <nomasteryoda> Mantice, you mean emerald
[03:53] <thomas_> mantice: uninstall all packages you installed with beryl, and remove the repositories.
[03:53] <holycow> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, try using vesa drivers then and test it out
[03:53] <Mantice> brb
[03:53] <blake> ivx is this concidered whispering?
[03:53] <holycow> maybe its the nvidia proprietary drivers
[03:53] <LjL> abhinay: sudo dosfsck -ar /dev/whatever
[03:54] <LjL> abhinay: choose 1, "copy original to backup". that's assuming your HD is working correctly in general
[03:54] <santeria> how do i get my nvidia 6800GS to work im on my bros computer right now and it is runnign kubuntu with a nvidia fx5950 ultra
[03:54] <ivx> blake i dont' know what you mean by whispering but if someone said something like that you prolly used caps. don't do that, that is yelling
[03:54] <dudanogueira> hello! i installed the edgy on a laptop with intel gma 950 video card. i have to install something for make it run or is automatic?
[03:54] <any> hi, does ubuntu 6.10 include nvidia drivers on the CD? or do i have to install'em? thanks
[03:55] <abhinay> LjL, What is the copy original to backup means ?
[03:55] <blake> ivx, im so confused. how do u make the text turn red when ur talking to me
[03:55] <dudanogueira> any, you have to install them. automatix does the job very quickly and with no pain
[03:55] <Pelo> any,  I think you have to install them manualy from a package but I'm not sure
[03:55] <LjL> !automatix
[03:55] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[03:55] <any> thnx dud
[03:55] <ivx> blake i type your name in the begining, that makes it red for you, when you type ivx, it makes it red on my side
[03:55] <dudanogueira> blake, when someone writes your name
[03:55] <holycow> dudes please stop using automatix
[03:55] <santeria> i cant even get into ubuntu cause after the launch screen it shows a vertical colored stripe pattern
[03:56] <LjL> abhinay, there are two copies, and they normally should be identical. apparently, for some reason they aren't now. by choosing that option, you copy the main one to the backup
[03:56] <holycow> it will only result in a messed up system and you will be back here asking how to fix it
[03:56] <blake> ivx ok i see. thanks im googling it now
[03:56] <Pelo> santeria,  try installing again from scratch
[03:56] <nomasteryoda> no
[03:56] <santeria> ive tried that so much
[03:56] <santeria> that isnt the problem
[03:56] <dudanogueira> holycow, never had a problem with it
[03:56] <nomasteryoda> santeria, you need to reconfigure you xserver
[03:56] <Akuma_> any: this might help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Video
[03:56] <ivx> blake no prob have fun
[03:56] <santeria> nomasteryoda: my what?
[03:57] <Madpilot> dudanogueira, you're lucky then, automatix is a good way to break an Ubuntu system...
[03:57] <holycow> dudanogueira, it bypasses the packaging system and does all sorts of nasty behind the scenes things on its own
[03:57] <holycow> once you have use automatix you can basically write off your install, you ain't ever getting it back to normal without a re-image
[03:57] <santeria> nomasteryoda, this is my first time using ubuntu, or any linux for that matter. my what?
[03:57] <ivx> blake i just found https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam it might help
[03:57] <Pelo> santeria,  hold on
[03:58] <blake> ivx thanks ill check it
[03:58] <baxter_kylie> does anyone know if any special configuration is required for me to put /var and /usr on lvm?
[03:58] <Flannel> !lvm | baxter_kylie, not really.  If you want to install with LVM, you'll need the alternate CD though.
[03:58] <ubotu> baxter_kylie, not really.  If you want to install with LVM, you'll need the alternate CD though.: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[03:58] <botxj> what's the best way to handle a *.rar file in ubuntu?
[03:59] <blake> ivx, Add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list. where do i type this line?
[03:59] <sethk>  botxj with unrar, if you want to extract from it
[03:59] <santeria> ubrar? lol
[03:59] <jrib> !unrar | santeria
[03:59] <ubotu> santeria: unrar is rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression  There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[03:59] <Pelo> santeria,  boot up ubu,  ctrl + alt+ backspace ( I think ) to get back to full cli mode   then dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    to reconfigure xserver
[03:59] <lazzareth> thomas_ that failed to work?
[03:59] <botxj> sethk are you messing with me dawg?
[03:59] <lazzareth> thomas_ it still returned the 6881 error
[03:59] <santeria> you mean ctrl alt f2?
[03:59] <ivx> blake in the terminal, application>accesory?terminal
[03:59] <botxj> so i get unrar right?
[03:59] <santeria> pelo, you mean ctrl alt f2?
[04:00] <blake> ivx, lol sorri im noobie :P
[04:00] <sethk> botxj, right
[04:00] <Pelo> santeria,  that would work to
[04:00] <santeria> pelo, ok
[04:00] <baxter_kylie> Flannel: I've already installed and placed /home on its own lv. I just wasn't sure when/how lvm2 is started.
[04:00] <sethk> botxj, no, I'm not messing, unrar is a real program.
[04:00] <santeria> pelo, that was one of the commands jordan_u gave me to fix it
[04:00] <Pelo> santeria,   might be sudo dpkg ...
[04:00] <kitche> santeria: but rememebr you will have to restart X to use your new configuration
[04:00] <Jimbo53> hello
[04:00] <ivx> blake okay to add a source open that file, the end will be fine
[04:00] <abhinay> LjL, hey, it is saying 'No FSINFO sector' , shall i create one or continue without creating it ?
[04:00] <botxj> !unrar
[04:00] <ubotu> unrar is rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression  There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[04:00] <ivx> blake but you need to be root to do that
[04:00] <LjL> abhinay, stop. i don't know what that one means, and i did not get it
[04:01] <Jimbo53> just installed ubuntu today....new to nix
[04:01] <Pelo> santeria,  that is the command to reconfigure xserver-conf
[04:01] <ivx> blake for now open the terminal
[04:01] <baxter_kylie> Flannel; you're saying that I can just mv /usr and /var without having to set up initrd ... right?
[04:01] <santeria> pelo, yea that was sudo dpkg
[04:01] <ivx> blake then i'll walk you through it
[04:01] <SurfnKid> how can i set up IP spoofing for my browser?
[04:01] <blake> ivx, ok i got it open
[04:01] <SurfnKid> on ubuntu
[04:01] <Jimbo53> for some reason when its running for a while it will fail to respond when tryin to open appz'
[04:01] <ivx> blake type sudo passwd
[04:01] <santeria> so just dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[04:01] <ivx> blake make a root passowrd
[04:01] <Jimbo53> is there a firewall for linux that i should be running'
[04:01] <ivx> blake don't forget it
[04:02] <thomas_> SurfnKid: ip spoofing? what would you want that for?
[04:02] <Flannel> ivx, have him use sudo.  blake, no need for a root password, just use sudo to start your editor
[04:02] <blake> ivx. wait
[04:02] <Pelo> santeria,   when talking to someone please mention their nick so they get hightlited,  and yes
[04:02] <Madpilot> Jimbo53, not really; by default Ubuntu has no real need.
[04:02] <SurfnKid> thomas_, so website logs dont have my real IP
[04:02] <ivx> flannel i doubt he make the passowrd yet thought
[04:02] <Jimbo53> k
[04:02] <Flannel> ivx: "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" or "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"
[04:02] <santeria> pelo, ok i gotta get off my bro is bitching ;)
[04:02] <Flannel> ivx: he doesn't need a root password
[04:02] <thomas_> Jimbo53: ubuntu ships completely secure with no open ports... so if you haven't changed anything, don't worry about one.
[04:03] <Jimbo53> any idea why it ceases to respone when opening programs after its  up for a while?/
[04:03] <Madpilot> ivx, um... you don't need to make another pw for sudo, you know...
[04:03] <Pelo> santeria,  best of luck
[04:03] <ivx> flannel he should still create one, he will need it somemtime
[04:03] <thomas_> SurfnKid: look in firefox addons.
[04:03] <Jimbo53> Thomas: i dont think i changed anything...beeen kinda stumbling around in it for a day
[04:03] <Pelo> Jimbo53,  check your memory and cpu usage with the system monitor
[04:03] <Flannel> ivx: no he shouldn't.  Ubuntu doesn't use root by design.  He will never need a root password.
[04:03] <jrib> ivx: like when? :P  You can do everything with sudo
[04:03] <SurfnKid> thomas_, ok
[04:03] <blake> ivx,ok i dont need 1. what do i do?
[04:03] <Jimbo53> Pelo: ok checking
[04:03] <thomas_> Jimbo53: even if you do have ports open, the software is pretty solid.
[04:04] <Jimbo53> k
[04:04] <Flannel> blake: "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" or "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"
[04:04] <ivx> blake type what flannel shot ya
[04:04] <blake> ivx k
[04:04] <Jimbo53> Pelo: what is the system monitor called?
[04:04] <ivx> blake then add the source that it said on that site
[04:04] <thomas_> Jimbo53: just make sure you don't enable anything unsecure with samba print sharing or anything. Make sure you require passwords for everything.
[04:04] <bruenig> looking to open a terminal, run a command, and have the terminal stay open, i.e. "xfce4-terminal -x ls ~" will open the terminal, execute ls ~ but won't stay open, how can I make it stay open after the command
[04:05] <holycow> its called system-monitor ... why?
[04:05] <Jimbo53> Thomas: I been accessing other machines on the network (home) but thats all
[04:05] <blake> flannel ok im good now
[04:05] <blake> flannel. thanks
[04:05] <Pelo> Jimbo53,  I think it is called just that system monitor,  menu > system > admin > system monitor  ( or something very similar)   just keep it running and see what it says when your system becomes unresponsive
[04:05] <jrib> holycow: it monitors your system?
[04:05] <Jimbo53> k
[04:05] <blake> ivx. k thanks :)
[04:05] <ivx> blake can you make it through that doc now?
[04:05] <skelter> how do i add a directory to everyone's path? putting it in /etc/profile doesn't seem to work
[04:05] <thomas_> bruenig: create a launch script for it.
[04:05] <Mantice> Could some one help me ? I installed Edgy upgrade and now beryl crashes everything.
[04:05] <blake> ivx, yap
[04:06] <holycow> jrib, it's a rhetorical question dude
[04:06] <holycow> >_>
[04:06] <jrib> skelter: /etc/environment
[04:06] <Mantice> I cant get my gnome to boot.
[04:06] <skelter> thanks
[04:06] <Madpilot> Mantice, #ubuntu-xgl for Beryl & similar entertainments. Keep in mind that it's pre-alpha software...
[04:06] <Jimbo53> I was looking in wrong place for system monitor...duh
[04:06] <hulillama> hi, need some help
[04:06] <Mantice> Madpilot could you help me I want to remove it to get gnome working.
[04:07] <Mantice> I typed sudo apt-get remove beryl and beryl-manager but it still boots.
[04:07] <bruenig> thomas_, the launch script would have the same command wouldn't it? I just made a launch script, put that command in it and then ran it and it does the same thing, opens, executes, then closes
[04:07] <Madpilot> Mantice, I know zip about xgl/beryl/etc - try that other channel.
[04:07] <hulillama> im trying to install  vmware workstation but i get this error:
[04:07] <Mantice> I managed to boot into terminal and launch xchat-gnome but thats it.
[04:07] <thomas_> bruenig: then maybe there's a reason this program is crashing. Is this happening with other programs?
[04:07] <hulillama> ./vmware-install.pl
[04:07] <Mantice> Madpilot do you know how to remove programs from booting with your session ?
[04:07] <hulillama> A previous installation of VMware software has been detected.
[04:07] <Jimbo53>  still have a drive on this machine that is ntfs..is there an easy way to change it to something more linux compatable and save the data on it?
[04:08] <thomas_> hulillama: so uninstall the previous version.
[04:08] <holycow> Mantice, that wont work.  the answer is reinstall.  there is no easy way to restore your system to preinstall state because installation changes a lot of stuff
[04:08] <bruenig> thomas_, it is not crashing, i believe it is meant to do that, I am just seeing if there is some workaround
[04:08] <troopa> I have installed the ATI Proprietary Linux Drivers from ATI's website (64-bit). I successfully installed them, and then ran the aticonfig --initial properly. I rebooted and loaded into X fine, but when I try to issue fglrxinfo, I see: Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual!
[04:08] <holycow> i really wish xgl and beryl and aiglx projects posted hugeass warnings about uninstallation ...
[04:08] <bruenig> thomas_, if I just run, xfce4-terminal, the terminal opens and is fine it is only when I put those parameters that it does that
[04:08] <holycow> or at least our wiki did
[04:09] <troopa> I have a dmesg | grep fglrx in a pastebin if that would be helpful. But does anyone know how to fix this error?
[04:09] <ivx> madpilot well when i would do updates or whatever it never took that passwrd, i had to do sudo passwd, and it toook that, what's up with that
[04:09] <synphreak> I am sharing folders through Samba on my Ubuntu machine.  I have an NTFS drive that I can read to and write from in my Ubuntu machine.  I have managed to share the NTFS drive through Samba, but it appears as read-only to the Windows computers on the network.  How can I enable writing for the Windows machines?
[04:09] <hulillama> in synaptic pakage, i searched for vmware and removed everything, what else should i remove
[04:09] <thomas_> bruenig: if you open a program, it shouldn't close. are you opening the program with a terminal? if so, the terminal needs to stay open in order for it to run. you want to use the run program.
[04:09] <Mantice> holycow: I installed beryl it dident work so I left it on their because it wasent working then I upgraded to edgy and now it crashes I just want to remove it so It dont launch with my session.
[04:09] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow; > Failed to start the X server ( your graphical interface ) It is likely that it is not setup correctly, would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?
[04:09] <holycow> Mantice, yup, reinstall, start clean
[04:09] <Madpilot> ivx, no idea - were you using the original account you created on install?
[04:09] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow: This is the LiveCD 6.06, worked with this machine just fine
[04:10] <thomas_> synphreak: its a setting in samba you need to change. you've only enabled it to be shared as read-only.
[04:10] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> holycow: sceen gone all crazy, and now it's in root
[04:10] <Kaiyang> hi MAY I KNOW IS THERE ANY SOFTWARE ON UBUNTU THAT CAN SUPPORT RAID BACKUP?
[04:10] <thomas_> !caps
[04:10] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[04:10] <Kaiyang> ok
[04:10] <Kaiyang> lol
[04:10] <blake> fannel i still got webcam trobles. think u can still help me out?
[04:10] <Mantice> were does edgy keep the install files it took me days to download this?
[04:10] <ivx> madpilot, yes it is just me, no need for anymore accounts, but you are telling me it should take that password for updates and everything
[04:10] <thomas_> Kaiyang: yeah there is
[04:10] <holycow> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, not sure dude, would require you pasting your logs and i do this for a living so i don't really feel like digging too deep into things like this dude
[04:10] <bruenig> thomas_, the terminal closes, not the program I am starting with the terminal. "xfce4-terminal -x command" is meant to open a terminal, then the -x command has it execute the command, after it does all of that as it is supposed to it closes.
[04:10] <thomas_> Kaiyang: open synaptic and search "backup" and pick one.
[04:10] <Kaiyang> Q: What is it?
[04:10] <holycow> sorry mate, perhaps someone else can help
[04:11] <grodius> jrib: when i try to startx it says 'error in locking authority file'
[04:11] <bruenig> thomas_, but I am trying to see if there is a way to keep it open
[04:11] <grodius> jrib: did u see anything in my log that diagnoses the problem maybe?
[04:11] <blake> ivx. i still got webcam problems. think u can still help me?
[04:11] <Madpilot> ivx, it should - anytime a default Ubuntu install asks for a password, it's using sudo & wants your user pw
[04:11] <Mantice> My ubuntu is fine its just beryl keeps booting I need to stop it some how.
[04:11] <Kaiyang> Q: May I know what is the name?
[04:11] <thomas_> bruenig: you need the command to loop?
[04:11] <ivx> madpilot alright
[04:11] <sethk> Mantice, check whether it is started with the respawn option in /etc/inittab
[04:11] <synphreak> thomas_: I have an ext2 folder also shared with the same settings (writable = yes), and the Windows computers can write to it, but not the NTFS drive.
[04:11] <ivx> blake what is it doing
[04:11] <grodius> can anyone help me? im getting an error in locking authority file /home/grodius/.Xauthority when i try to startx
[04:11] <thomas_> Kaiyang: search.
[04:11] <Pelo> Mantice,  check under  system > admin > sessions
[04:11] <bruenig> thomas_, I want to see the output, if it does it so fast, it won't show me the output, that is the only reason I ask. If i just wanted to run the command, I could do that without using a terminal
[04:12] <jrib> grodius: ls -l ~/.Xauthority
[04:12] <holycow> Mantice, reinstall takes 20 minutes at most, you have used up 10 minutes already to only get it can't really be fixed.  pop your cd in and get it over with :)
[04:12] <ivx> blake what kind of cam is it
[04:12] <Madpilot> grodius, delete the .Xauthority file
[04:12] <blake> ivx. Quickcam messanger
[04:12] <santeria> i forgot who i was talking to but i tried dpkg-reconfigure xservedr-xorg popped up a message after i typed it said must be run as a root
[04:12] <ivx> blake who makes it
[04:12] <thomas_> synphreak: filesystems don't matter with samba. if your computer can read it, samba can share it. so it HAS to be a problem with your samba settings.
[04:12] <Mantice> Pelo: How do I do that with out my Gnome GUI ? I got a terminal
[04:12] <blake> ivx logitech
[04:12] <Mantice> Holycow: I dont have a cd I used the upgrade feature.
[04:13] <santeria> pelo,i tried dpkg-reconfigure xservedr-xorg popped up a message after i typed it said must be run as a root
[04:13] <thomas_> santeria: so enter your root password.
[04:13] <Pelo> Mantice,  no idea
[04:13] <ivx> blake alright hold on, btw did the install of that software work fine?
[04:13] <thomas_> santeria: use sudo
[04:13] <blake> ivx. camorama still cant detect my webcam after easycam installed the right driver
[04:13] <grodius> jrib: I did it,
[04:13] <santeria> ok :O
[04:13] <holycow> Mantice, lol, and getting another cd isn't possible then? ah well then your toast :/
[04:13] <holycow> sorry
[04:13] <Pelo> santeria,   try sudo dpkg ...
[04:13] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: when you get to the main graphical login screen, click the lower left corner and change session to something other than gnome
[04:13] <blake> ivx. yes it did
[04:13] <grodius> jrib: what does it do?
[04:13] <Kaiyang> Q: Well I found quite a lot. But I do not know which support RAID. I am currently installing the software call KEEP.
[04:13] <santeria> pelo, ok
[04:13] <jrib> grodius: what did it say?
[04:13] <thomas_> blake: have you googled whether or not other people with the same camera have support?
[04:13] <grodius> Madpilot: are you sure i should delete it
[04:13] <RAMiN> hello everyone, when I try to install ubuntu 6.06, the install will get stuck at 61%
[04:13] <Mantice> I remember adding beryl to session boot. how to i remove that via terminal.
[04:13] <Madpilot> grodius, yes, it'll be recreated when you reboot
[04:14] <ivx> blake is camorama the software you are trying to use to webconfrence or whatever
[04:14] <blake> ivx yes
[04:14] <ivx> blake i never played with them
[04:14] <greg> hello
[04:14] <RAMiN> hello everyone, when I try to install ubuntu 6.06, the install will get stuck at 61%
[04:14] <Mantice> Kingsqueak: I have gnome and beryl and terminal and thats what im using know.
[04:14] <thomas_> blake: maybe your camera just plain isn't supported. go to the camorama help pages. ubuntu is recognising your camera meaning there is nothing wrong with ubuntu.
[04:14] <ivx> blake you could try different software
[04:14] <santeria> pelo, on that menu does nv mean nvidia?
[04:14] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: if there aren't any, do   ctrl-alt-F1   then log in and do 'sudo apt-get install fluxbox'  or another window manager, when that's done, exit out of that login and do alt-F8
[04:14] <synphreak> thomas_: When setting up the NTFS drive, I had to specify which users could write to the drive, by adding them to the ntfs group.  Is it possible there is a user I need to add to that group for the Samba server to be able to write to it?
[04:14] <RAMiN> or it will get stuck at 15%
[04:14] <grodius> jrib: -rw------ 1 root root 125 2006-07-01 11:44 /home/grodius/.Xauthority
[04:14] <thomas_> synphreak: you need to add the samba user
[04:15] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: then log in but select 'fluxbox', once in there you can remove beryl
[04:15] <santeria> pelo, on that menu does nv mean nvidia?
[04:15] <jrib> grodius: what Madpilot said is true, I just wanted to see if it could actually be the problem
[04:15] <thomas_> synphreak: thats your problem. the user running samba must be on that list.
[04:15] <ivx> blake i do have a quick cam also, and i read that you can get it working, but the color looks weird, i woudn't giv eup
[04:15] <Pelo> santeria,  probably , but try just letting the app do it's job first ,  when in doubt just click yes for what ever the default is , you can always run it again
[04:15] <blake> ivx. easy cam said that i should test my cam out in camorama. what other software is there to use?
[04:15] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: or you can do  'sudo apt-get remove beryl' from the terminal on ctrl-alt-F1
[04:15] <grodius> jrib: ok then ill delete it
[04:15] <jrib> Madpilot: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30798/ is grodius's xorg log.  I don't think xauthority could cause that right?
[04:15] <RAMiN>  when I try to install ubuntu 6.06, the install will get stuck at 61%
[04:15] <ivx> blake i don't know, i will read somethings and see if i can find anything
[04:15] <blake> ivx. what software do u use?
[04:15] <RAMiN> help
[04:15] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> This is weird..
[04:15] <grodius> jrib: how do i delete?
[04:15] <blake> ivx. ill search too
[04:16] <greg> Hi. I found that 6.06.1 frequently locked up on my box everytime the box was left alone >30 min. Is there a credible reason to suspect 6.10.1 would be markedly improved?
[04:16] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Does anyone have problem installing ubuntu with a nVidia g-force card?
[04:16] <Pelo> RAMiN,   help us help you,  what is yoru problem
[04:16] <jrib> grodius: sudo rm ~/.Xauthority
[04:16] <synphreak> thomas_: sudo adduser samba ntfs
[04:16] <synphreak> adduser: The user `samba' does not exist.
[04:16] <thomas_> RAMiN: maybe you had a bad burn or download.
[04:16] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Does anyone have problem installing ubuntu with a nVidia g-force card?
[04:16] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> O_o;
[04:16] <ivx> blake i never needed to use it, i prolly shouldn't have bought it, it was an impulse buy :)
[04:16] <RAMiN> i dont know, someone told me there was a bug on the 6.06 cd
[04:16] <RAMiN> on all
[04:16] <grodius> jrib: gonna reboot and see
[04:16] <greg> RAMIN,  my noob's advice:  1) Reburn the CD;  2) TRy 6.10
[04:16] <blake> ivx :D
[04:16] <RAMiN> yes
[04:16] <thomas_> synphreak: i don't know which user is running samba or if samba creates users or what. but you need to add something to that list, that's all i know.
[04:16] <uadever> I've installed 6.06 without any problem
[04:16] <RAMiN> alright thanks
[04:16] <santeria> pelo, whats my video card's bus identifier?
[04:17] <RAMiN> i did too
[04:17] <RAMiN> the first time
[04:17] <RAMiN> not the 2nd  or 3rd
[04:17] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I got ubuntu installed on my laptop
[04:17] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> but my desktop won't install
[04:17] <thomas_> RAMiN: wait
[04:17] <Pelo> santeria,  I have no idea, you'll need to figure it out
[04:17] <RAMiN> k
[04:17] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Can anyone help me?
[04:17] <thomas_> RAMiN: did you do a check on your download?
[04:17] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Perhaps.
[04:17] <RAMiN> md5?
[04:17] <thomas_> RAMiN: make sure your MD5Hashes match those on the site
[04:17] <Clujo> when I shut down a dapper box today, saw openbsd server shutting down  .  whats that about?
[04:17] <santeria> pelo, or what is it so i know where to look? or do you know what is?
[04:18] <thomas_> Clujo: thats a SSH server.
[04:18] <santeria> what does it mean
[04:18] <RAMiN> okay
[04:18] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Munchkinguy well.. I think my nVidia G-force card doesn't like ubuntu lol
[04:18] <santeria> mine neither
[04:18] <Clujo> ohhhh.  yes, thanks, thomas_
[04:18] <RAMiN> well, I will have to get 6.10 later
[04:18] <Pelo> santeria,  I didn'T have that particular problem ,  if there is a default offered just use that
[04:18] <ivx> blake try looking at this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras after that you just have to search
[04:18] <RAMiN> its much better
[04:18] <RAMiN> bye all
[04:18] <RAMiN> i have to go
[04:18] <thomas_> RAMiN: sign up for shipit while your at it. its nice to have cds sent to you in the mail.
[04:18] <blake> k
[04:18] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: That's cause it works on a proprietary driver
[04:18] <RAMiN> but it costs money for shipping
[04:18] <nomin> I am trying to run programs on another partition and distro using chroot.  I'm getting this error message:  " cannot connect to X server :0.0".  What should I type in so the apps work with X?
[04:18] <santeria> pelo it said something like nvidia 0:0:0
[04:18] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Are you able to log in?
[04:18] <RAMiN> doesnt it cost for shipping and handling
[04:19] <thomas_> RAMiN: no it doesn't.
[04:19] <Madpilot> RAMiN, no, Ubuntu ShipIt is free
[04:19] <Pelo> santeria,  just use that then
[04:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Munchkinguy nope, you get a error, and than it goes to root on the livecd
[04:19] <thomas_> RAMiN: maybe where you live.
[04:19] <grodius> jrib: ok, that didnt work
[04:19] <RAMiN> seatle
[04:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ubuntu@ubuntu~
[04:19] <thomas_> RAMiN: maybe you'll have to pay tarrifs, but no shipping
[04:19] <RAMiN> seattle
[04:19] <sethk> nomin, that's usually a privileges issue.
[04:19] <thomas_> RAMiN: no there will be no cost to you living in the US.
[04:19] <Jordan_U> RAMiN: If you slive in the US it is free, most of the rest of the world also.
[04:19] <sethk> nomin, try doing, in a window under the user who started X,    xhost +
[04:19] <Shaezsche> is there a way to set a folder so only a specific user can view and access it?
[04:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Munchkinguy Failed to
[04:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> opps
[04:19] <RAMiN> whats the catch?
[04:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Munchkinguy Failed to start the X server ( your graphical interface ) It is likely that it is not setup correctly, would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?
[04:19] <sethk> nomin, because :0.0 is correct if the process is running on the same box as the X server
[04:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> thats the error o_o
[04:19] <RAMiN> why doesnt everyone do that then?
[04:20] <thomas_> RAMiN: that you have to give the cd to a friend when you're done ;)
[04:20] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> in a big blue box with lots of crap around it, and than it goes to root
[04:20] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> and circles around the screen
[04:20] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> that text that is
[04:20] <RAMiN> oh i will
[04:20] <jrib> grodius: do you have an intel card? does fglrx work with that?
[04:20] <RAMiN> okay
[04:20] <thomas_> RAMiN: basically the guy who started ubuntu is mega rich.
[04:20] <RAMiN> pimp
[04:20] <thomas_> RAMiN: he just wants to spread it's popularity.
[04:20] <RAMiN> i see
[04:20] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> it works in graphical safe mode though
[04:20] <ivx> ramin it takes a little while to get, but the linux community is much different than microsoft
[04:20] <tgelter> if I am running the generic SMP kernel in edgy, will I lose performance (as compared to the k8 SMP kernel that I used in dapper)?
[04:20] <nomin> sethk:  I already did that.  It's not working.  I also did "export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0" and after I did that I get, "cannot connect to X server localhost:0.0"
[04:20] <RAMiN> yeah, no paying
[04:20] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Is it a FX5500?
[04:20] <RAMiN> okay ill sign up for it then
[04:21] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> no
[04:21] <RAMiN> nice talking
[04:21] <thomas_> peace.
[04:21] <RAMiN> bye all
[04:21] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> nVidia g-force 4000MX
[04:21] <Jordan_U> RAMiN: Remember the guy that paid to get sent into space as a sivilian, he started Ubunutu :)
[04:21] <sethk> nomin, of course.  :0.0 is the same as localhost:0.0
[04:21] <sethk> nomin, when you did the xhost +, did it say "accepting connections from all users"?
[04:21] <RAMiN> cool
[04:21] <thomas_> Mark Shuttleworth
[04:21] <thomas_> no pun intended i guess.
[04:21] <thomas_> hehe
[04:21] <grodius> jrib: no, i think thats only for ATI cards
[04:21] <RAMiN> okay I will come back later if I have any problems
[04:21] <nomin> sethk, so I should not have typed in "export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0"?
[04:21] <Shaezsche> is there a way to set a folder so only a specific user can view and access it?
[04:21] <sethk> nomin, it won't hurt anything, but it won't help anything either
[04:22] <tgelter> if I am running the generic SMP kernel in edgy, will I lose performance (as compared to the k8 SMP kernel that I used in dapper)?
[04:22] <DualCortex> Anyone know if a DWL G132 or the G122 works right out of the box with EDGY?
[04:22] <thomas_> Shaezche: yeah, right click on the folder and go to permissions.
[04:22] <sethk> nomin, tgelter not that you'll notice.
[04:22] <Shaezsche> thomas it is set to ROOT only right now, yet all users can view it
[04:22] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Do you have nvidia-kernel-common installed?
[04:22] <uadever> can anybody tell me the difference from "removal" and "complete removal" in synaptic packet manager?
[04:22] <holycow> DualCortex, there is a large list on the wiki actually.  check there
[04:22] <ivx> blake if you are still there try this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=980f126584356cd552208af1420b68ec&t=191770
[04:23] <thomas_> Shaezsche: then you can change it int he properties window as root.
[04:23] <tgelter> sethk: have they done away with customized kernels in edgy or are they just not ready yet?
[04:23] <bimberi> uadever: complete removal takes out config files
[04:23] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Munchkinguy whyy would I have it installed, when I can't even get to livecd, to INSTALL the os
[04:23] <Pelo> g'night folks
[04:23] <jrib> grodius: try telling it to use the right one for intel
[04:23] <rlaska> Anyone had problems with firefox2 in edgy crashing, and the default fix (edit /etc/firefox/... and set to 32bpp display) does NOT work?
[04:23] <uadever> I see, thanks
[04:23] <sethk> tgelter, I don't know.  edgy isn't ready yet, let alone the kernels.  I never use the distro kernels, so I don't pay attention.
[04:23] <nomin> sethk, I already ran chroot from the other distro and now I'm doing the reverse.  I got the same display message before and I solved it by doing "export display... and xhost +.  I don't know why it's not working the same way with this distro.
[04:23] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: I see.
[04:23] <santeria> pelo, what do i do after i configure my x server? restart?
[04:23] <tgelter> sethk: why do you say that edgy isn't ready?
[04:23] <sethk> nomin, it should be
[04:24] <santeria>  im an ubuntnoob
[04:24] <sethk> tgelter, hang around here for a couple of hours, you'll see.
[04:24] <RedLance> I shared a folder using Samba (by right clicking and going to Share), but my windoze computer wants a user name and password to get into it.  How do I get it to just let me in?
[04:24] <nomin> sethk, I'll start it over and see what happens.
[04:24] <sethk> nomin, k
[04:24] <tgelter> sethk: hah, good point, but isn't that to be expected?
[04:24] <rlaska> Anyone have experience with firefox flash crashes, where the prescribed fix doesn't work?
[04:24] <zoidberg> hey guys.,..how is edgy...is it really buggy right now?
[04:25] <uadever> if I say normal removal to the dummy package of totem (which should be unuseful to me now that I've switched from gstreamer to xine - I use either mplayer or vlc to watch anything) it says that it should remove something which is just labelled as "ubuntu-desktop"
[04:25] <sethk> tgelter, yes, but compared to earlier releases, it's quite different
[04:25] <ivx> rlaska does firefox just close on you
[04:25] <santeria> what does one normally do after screwing with the x server?
[04:25] <sethk> tgelter, I hope ubuntu isn't on the yellow brick road to mandiva
[04:25] <Mantice> Im back.
[04:25] <Mantice> I installed fluxbox.
[04:25] <tgelter> sethk, yeah, I was around from breezy to dapper and things went wonderfully
[04:25] <uadever> how do I find out what is gonna be deleted if I say yes to that addition?
[04:25] <Mantice> Now I dont have to exit IRC to do console commands.
[04:25] <rlaska> ivx: yes. it gives me a Segmentation fault. When i'm trying to navigate the menus on lordoftherings.net, for example
[04:25] <thomas_> yeah ubuntu upgrades like butter.
[04:25] <santeria> what does one normally do after screwing with the x server?
[04:25] <sethk> tgelter, I think they make a serious mistake by having an arbitrary release date.  but ...
[04:26] <Jordan_U> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: uadever that is just a meta-package, it is OK to remove as long as you re-install it for upgrades like Dapper to Edgy.
[04:26] <Clujo> santeria: how are you screwing the x server?
[04:26] <bruenig> edgy = flawless for me
[04:26] <nomin> oh great.  My router is messing up my clock and now I can't do sudo because it says the last time I typed 'sudo' it was too far in the future.
[04:26] <bimberi> uadever: yes, ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage.  It can be removed safely, although it's good to have around for releast upgrades (eg. to Feisty when that happens)
[04:26] <grodius> jrib: how do i do that?
[04:26] <Mantice> kingsqueak: you there ?
[04:26] <jrib> grodius: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:26] <zoidberg> guys is edgy still very buggy...?
[04:26] <thomas_> feisty is the next release name? feisty what?
[04:26] <santeria> clujo,making it so my nvidia graphics card hopefully works
[04:26] <ivx> rlaska, sorry i was just wonder, i am working on that one also, i was curious if you where having the same problem as me
[04:26] <uadever> would feisty be ubuntu number?
[04:26] <grodius> jrib: thats what i just tried to do, there wasnt a real option for drivers
[04:26] <thomas_> 7.06?
[04:26] <thomas_> no
[04:27] <thomas_> 7.04 i think
[04:27] <thomas_> :)
[04:27] <jrib> grodius: I believe it's the first page
[04:27] <Jordan_U> !feisty
[04:27] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu will be codename Feisty Fawn it should be released in April 2007 and so have the release name 7.04. Until released it is beta. Today it is not even alpha. ;-)
[04:27] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Would you be able to set up internet access from the command prompt?
[04:27] <rlaska> ivx: try going through these steps: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911
[04:27] <Clujo> well, santeria, dont understand completely, but I guess it's control-backspace to re start the x.
[04:27] <thomas_> yeashhh thats a sweet name. feisty fawn heheehe
[04:27] <rlaska> ivx: they didn't help me, but I think it's helped most people
[04:27] <zoidberg> guys is edgy still very buggy...?
[04:27] <thomas_> i'm going deer hunting this weekend.
[04:27] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> munchkinguy - no.. Because I have wireless internet, and I would need to install the driver device.. so that fails
[04:27] <grodius> jrib: no, its just the name of the card and that is correct, its intel

[04:28] <ivx> rlaska, i'll give it a shot, thanks, good luck to ya
[04:28] <Gabby_Hayes> where, thomas?  (plenty of deer in NW Wisconsin)
[04:28] <Kingsqueak> zoidberg: of course, it's "Edgy"
[04:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> is it okay for me to start in safe mode, and install it from safe mode?
[04:28] <jrib> grodius: ok maybe, the second page
[04:28] <bimberi> zoidberg: experiences are mixed.  Yes it has bugs.  As does Dapper.  I find Dapper more stable personally.
[04:28] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> graphic safe mode
[04:28] <Jordan_U> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Yes.
[04:28] <thomas_> Gabby_Hayes: north Ontario.
[04:28] <rlaska> zoidberg: depends on your hardware... i'm still an ubuntu newbie (not a linux newbie), but you should go read through the current forum posts to see if you have the same kind of hardware as others who have had problems
[04:29] <Gabby_Hayes> thomas_  ..  keep arm  :-)
[04:29] <RedLance> I shared a folder using Samba (by right clicking and going to Share), but my windoze computer wants a user name and password to get into it.  How do I get it to just let me in?
[04:29] <thomas_> Gabby_Hayes: not quite. i keep mine locked.
[04:29] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu>  Jordan_U, but then after I get it installed, I'll probably get the error..
[04:29] <Gabby_Hayes> .. warm  (and don't let a bear get your deer)   :-)
[04:29] <Mantice> I recommend you all to install fluxbox if you only have one computer.
[04:29] <bimberi> zoidberg: another way to test is try the Desktop (ie. Live) CD
[04:29] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: You could try installing using the Alternate CD
[04:29] <zoidberg> ccol
[04:30] <Xenguy> .oO(Don't let the deer get yer beer!)
[04:30] <Jordan_U> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: But when you install it to the hard drive you can install the nvidia drivers ( you can even do it from the liveCD to test )

[04:30] <Sandrina1> Hello, I was wondering if I have 6600 GT Nvidia video card, how do I get ubuntu to use it, the resolution is 1024x768 and I want to you 1280x1024
[04:30] <rlaska> ivx: very welcome. if you run /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin directly from the terminal, check what error messages it gives you when it crashes. I think if it spits out a whole bunch of stuff, the fix described on that web page might work. If you only get "Segmentation fault" (like me), it might not.
[04:30] <Sandrina1> I installed the nvidia x.org drivers
[04:30] <Munchkinguy> Jordan_U: Are we talking about the same thing?
[04:30] <bimberi> !fixres | Sandrina1
[04:30] <ubotu> Sandrina1: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[04:31] <rlaska> bimberi: good suggestion on edgy
[04:31] <Jordan_U> Munchkinguy: I don't know, what are you talking about? ( I havn't been following )
[04:31] <rlaska> Anyone else have experience with firefox crashing on flash websites??
[04:31] <jrib> grodius: it seems like you want i810
[04:31] <grodius> jrib: daaaamn this isnt working, ive run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg before, i mean i know how it is supposed to work
[04:31] <Munchkinguy> rlaska: Always
[04:32] <bimberi> rlaska: yep, all the time.
[04:32] <jrib> grodius: did you manage to change the driver to i810?
[04:32] <bokey> rlaska# what flash version  and what firefox version ?
[04:32] <bimberi> rlaska: you mentioned a 'fix'.  Where is that documented?
[04:32] <grodius> jrib: no, i really dont see where to do this
[04:32] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Try installing with the alternate cd. Then you at least have ubuntu installed on the system, and you can work from there.
[04:32] <rlaska> I'm flash 7, firefox 2.0
[04:32] <bokey> rlaska# get flash9beta
[04:32] <ivx> rlaska, i think i am having a problem with java in general, frostwire at time comes up just a gray screen then will be fine, when i tried to go in the chatroom on there site, it started to load, the closed. any ideas?
[04:32] <rlaska> bimberi: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911
[04:33] <jrib> grodius: hmm did you see a page that said ati, nvidia, or fglrx at any point?
[04:33] <bimberi> rlaska: cheers :)
[04:33] <rlaska> i'll try flash9

[04:33] <ubotu> Yum!
[04:33] <jrib> grodius: ok, just edit it by hand.  'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' and change "fglrx" to "i810"
[04:33] <santeria> clujo, i put in all my stuff to hopefully get my graphics card to work with ubuntu, and i restarted the ocmputer and i didnt get the normal vertical colered line pattern, it brought up a menu that was messed up around the edges and said that the x server wasnt set up correctly
[04:33] <bokey> rlaska# ubotu is a bot.
[04:34] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Or you can use Freespire, a Debian-based OS with KDE as a shell, and *lots* of proprietary drivers. It could save you the hassle.
[04:34] <rlaska> LOL... boy, it's been a while since i've been on IRC
[04:34] <r4dixL> my apt-get is getting stuck on "Connecting to security.ubuntu.com" remains at 0%
[04:34] <r4dixL> anyhow has any ideas why?
[04:34] <The_Mu> Bwah
[04:34] <The_Mu> Can someone help me?
[04:34] <Clujo> sorry santeria, way out of my expertise.
[04:34] <santeria> oh lol
[04:34] <santeria> ok
[04:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Munchkinguy I think Jordan has a point, I could install from graphical safe mode, install nvidia drivers there, and then see how it goes :0
[04:35] <Shaezsche> is there a way to HIDE a folder so that other users cannot even see the directory?
[04:35] <The_Mu> I start Ubuntu up...
[04:35] <rlaska> The_Mu: what's up?
[04:35] <Shaezsche> i know how to set permissions, but that doesnt hide it
[04:35] <Mantice> I got my Ubuntu working I didn't have to reinstall. Ill never have to reinstall mahhahahahaha
[04:35] <bimberi> ubotu: thanks!
[04:35] <The_Mu> it goes through the loading thing...
[04:35] <ubotu> You're Welcome!
[04:35] <Munchkinguy> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Have fun
[04:35] <The_Mu> then it all goes black

[04:35] <RedLance> Is lmsensors still viable, or is there a new package?
[04:35] <santeria> jorden_u, you helped me last night some, i put in all my stuff to hopefully get my graphics card to work with ubuntu, and i restarted the ocmputer and i didnt get the normal vertical colered line pattern, it brought up a menu that was messed up around the edges and said that the x server wasnt set up correctly

[04:36] <santeria> why does ubuntu hate geforce cards?
[04:36] <Roger_The_Bum> on to my ubuntu box
[04:36] <Jimbo52> it did it again...why does ubuntu become unresponsive after running for an hour or so....had to use the reset button to restart it now it works again
[04:36] <Roger_The_Bum> and I can't seem to get it to work
[04:36] <Kingsqueak> santeria: can't you do something with chicken blood to fix that?
[04:36] <Munchkinguy> ubotu: computers
[04:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about computers - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:36] <Munchkinguy> heh heh heh
[04:36] <santeria> funny
[04:36] <rlaska> santeria: probably because Nvidia will only release closed-source drivers (no specs or anything) of varying levels of quality
[04:36] <Roger_The_Bum> is that ubuntu's fault or my own computer
[04:37] <Mantice> How do I start the software update manger. I have a funny feeling I am out of date.
[04:37] <Jordan_U> santeria: I don't remember your problem from before, have you tried: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh and choosing nvidia ?

[04:37] <flodine> anyone on 64 bit edgy who can help
[04:37] <what_if> does anyone know hot to get  '/dev/net/tun' to show up as a network device ??
[04:37] <Roger_The_Bum> edgy?
[04:37] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: 'sudo apt-get update'  then 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
[04:37] <rlaska> Jimbo52: what's up?
[04:37] <DualCortex> Aright, my Hawking USB (zd1211 drivers) wifi adapter worked out of the box (which isn't supposed to based on the wiki) but the problem is that every time I restart my PC, I must give it a comand to connect to my network. Other settings such as key, etc. are loaded except the ESSID. Anyone got any solutions?
[04:37] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: that's what the updater is doing underneath
[04:38] <Jimbo52> my ubuntu install frequently becomes unresponsive and i have to restart
[04:38] <santeria> jordan_u, i tried that with the list of commands you gave me last night, and it didnt really work, right now im on the version from the text based installer of 64 bit edgy
[04:38] <Mantice> Kingsqueak: Thanks for your fluxbox suggestion it worked a treat
[04:38] <nomin> sethk, I'm still getting the same display problem.  I can run BitchX just fine but nothing graphical.
[04:38] <thomas_> DualCortex: set up a boot time script with the command you need to keep entering.
[04:38] <Jordan_U> santeria: I remember now.
[04:38] <what_if> does anyone know hot to get  '/dev/net/tun' to show up as a network device ??
[04:38] <Jimbo52> a few minutes ago it just closed all appz and became unresponsive again till reset
[04:38] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: it's a nice simple window manager and it's quite flexible if you read up a bit on how to setup your own menus and keybindings too
[04:38] <Clujo> Jimbo52: on my laptop that happened to me too.  5 times anyway but it finally ran al the way thru
[04:38] <thomas_> !modem
[04:38] <ubotu> You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[04:38] <Jimbo52> do I need to re insall or what/.
[04:38] <Jordan_U> santeria: Did it ever get past: sudo apt-get update?
[04:39] <santeria> no
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: if you are new to linux in general, try 'xfce' as well, might be called 'xfce4'
[04:39] <flodine> does 64 bit edgy have all the stuff 32 bit has?
[04:39] <santeria> should i try all those commands over?
[04:39] <DualCortex> thomas: that could work, but it'd be better if I wouldn't need to find workarounds for every single hardware I got.
[04:39] <Jordan_U> santeria: Couldn't hurt.
[04:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> hmm
[04:39] <what_if> flodine: yes
[04:39] <Jimbo52> Clujo...what you mean finally ran all the way through?
[04:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I think  I might not mess with ubuntu on my desktop
[04:39] <what_if> flodine: just some of the proggies are still 32 bit
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: xfce is a middle ground between fluxbox and gnome sorta, more features than fluxbox but not as crazy as gnome and certainly worlds more stable than beryl
[04:39] <santeria> and btw, when i was partitioning my harddrive to have a space for ubuntu i was an idiot and totally deleted my windows xp so i better love ubuntu!!!
[04:40] <rlaska> Jimbo52: i'm a linux admin, but i'm new to ubuntu... it might be your display drivers. you could try to switch to a virtual console (ctrl-alt-[F1] ) (ctrl-alt[F7]  to switch back) and log in and run top to see if any one process is hogging up your cpu
[04:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Jordan_U - vmware server, is good with ubuntu normal using? or does it lag like hell, like vmware workstation?
[04:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Hey kingsqueak :)
[04:40] <totall_6_7> hello, i have a memory card that i use a card reader to transfer data from the computer to the card. If i delete files from the card using the pocket pc that the card is for, and i connect it back to the computer the computer is still reading the space as being taken up by the files that are no longer there. Is there any way to make the computer forget what it thinks is on the card
[04:40] <flodine> what_if what about flashplayer for 64 bit
[04:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Thanks for helping me kingsqueak.
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: no problem
[04:40] <Mantice> Kingsqueak: Ive used it before. Fluxbox saved me because when you boot using terminal you can only boot one program at time.
[04:40] <menko> HI, How do I get gnome-volume-manager to open media with thunar instead of nautilus (apart from changin nautilus bin)
[04:40] <totall_6_7> when i connect it, forget what was on the card from the last time it was connected
[04:40] <Clujo> Jimbo52: I mean I tried installing , install was unresponsive, but finally got it installed, thats all.
[04:40] <rlaska> Jimbo52: ctrl-alt-backspace will usually force xorg to bounce (you lose all your graphical apps, but it cuts short of having to restart)
[04:40] <what_if> flodine: i'm told theres still a problem there
[04:40] <Jordan_U> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: I don't use either, all I can tell you is there is no 3D acceleration.
[04:40] <bokey> santeria# if you are new to Ubuntu, you have to try rmrfing like everyone else.
[04:40] <Mantice> So I had IRC and I could use my console commands.
[04:41] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lol
[04:41] <rlaska> Jimbo52: you could also try creating a new user and logging in with that, to see if something is wrong with your current user's profile
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: also you do know there are many terminals too right?  alt-F1 F2 F3 etc
[04:41] <DualCortex> My Hawking USB (zd1211 drivers) wifi adapter worked out of the box (which isn't supposed to based on the wiki) but the problem is that every time I restart my PC, I must give it a comand to connect to my network. Other settings such as key, etc. are loaded except the ESSID. Anyone got any solutions?
[04:41] <flodine> what_if what do you do load 32 bit firefox
[04:41] <what_if> flodine: yes
[04:41] <rlaska> it's bedtime... nice to meet y'all, and good luck!
[04:41] <grodius> jrib: so im still lost
[04:41] <RedLance> Is lmsensors still viable, or is there a new package?
[04:41] <jrib> grodius: did you manage to change the driver?
[04:41] <Jimbo52> rlaska: i dont lose the desktop....still have graphics..the programs wont open or respond...and the only way to shut it down is the reset button
[04:41] <what_if> i've heard of that working... could also try 'gnash' instead. it is reported to work 64 bit mode
[04:42] <bruenig> gnash doesn't have sound though
[04:42] <what_if> does anyone know hot to get  '/dev/net/tun' to show up as a network device ??
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> flodine: I run 64 edgy, I just downloaded firefox and run it in my homedir and it works
[04:42] <Jimbo52> Rlaska: that wouldnt be display adapter would it?
[04:42] <grodius> jrib: i did, but it says thats not found either
[04:42] <flodine> what_if does it really run better on 64 bit i never tried it
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> works with mozilla-mplayer, flash etc
[04:42] <grodius> jrib: perhaps its  different name?
[04:42] <Jordan_U> RedLance: I don't know if it is something different bu tI have sensord installed.
[04:42] <specialbuddy> how do I get my mouse out of window when I'm playing a game?
[04:42] <Mantice> Kingsqueak can you only do that in terminal mode because alt f2 is run in gnome.
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> flodine: you just have to link in the plugins yourself to ~/.mozilla/plugins/
[04:42] <Jordan_U> specialbuddy: Can you alt+tab to another window?
[04:43] <specialbuddy> no
[04:43] <what_if> flodine: the system or firex for or ... ?
[04:43] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: oh from X you do ctrl-alt-F1 or F2 etc, then from there to get back it's alt-F8 to return to X
[04:43] <specialbuddy> I was playing tremulus and I couldn't get out to go back to the desktop
[04:43] <flodine> what_if  system
[04:43] <pradeep> hi I'm having problems with hd-install .. can someone help me :( ?
[04:43] <what_if> no noticable difference for every day apps
[04:44] <flodine> what_if  i always have 32 bit on my 64 bit chip
[04:44] <sethk> DualCortex, put the command at the end of /etc/rc.local
[04:44] <blake> i need help
[04:44] <specialbuddy> is there a way to get out
[04:44] <blake> installing sumthing
[04:44] <sethk> DualCortex, then it will run at the end of startup by itself.
[04:44] <sethk> DualCortex, a bit of a hack, but it works
[04:44] <what_if> flodine: you will notice a difference in 64bit 3d games (slight) and a big difference in 64 bit math
[04:44] <Jordan_U> specialbuddy: ctrl+alt+F7
[04:44] <specialbuddy> they said alt+enter but that just showed the desktop and I couldn't get out
[04:44] <specialbuddy> cool
[04:44] <specialbuddy> thanks
[04:44] <DualCortex> sthk: Well... it's a sudo command will it still work?
[04:45] <liquidboy> anyone know how to make the windows key open the root menu in windowmaker?
[04:45] <Mantice> Kingsqueak: thats cool Ill remember that one
[04:45] <blake> Will someone assist me on installing something?
[04:45] <liquidboy> i'm pretty sure its mapped to "mod4" but doesn't seem to work...

[04:45] <grodius> jrib: you still around? looking up something?
[04:45] <cnus8n> but still it isn't working
[04:45] <what_if> flodine: unless you do intense math with large numbers, then no real big difference (except bragging rights) ;)
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> flash9 for linux is out ?
[04:45] <santeria> jordan_u, when i typed in the one after find update it took the drivers off the cd ( i think) and then i typed the dkpg one and it only let me choose my preferred resolutions, then i typed gdm i think it was and it said already running, aborting!

[04:46] <cnus8n> yeah i know beta

[04:46] <Kingsqueak> I think I looked to check it just last week too
[04:46] <specialbuddy> ctrl+alt+F7 didn't work
[04:46] <liquidboy> works now for some reason :S
[04:46] <Jordan_U> cnus8n: Try the Ubotu link it is a .deb
[04:46] <jrib> grodius: pageUp or maybe shift+pageUp
[04:46] <flodine> what_if  so i should just stay with 32 bit edgy if no diffrence
[04:46] <thomas_> cnus8n: you did restart firefox after trying to install it though right?
[04:46] <Jordan_U> specialbuddy: ctrl+alt+F8 or any others ?
[04:46] <cnus8n> yeah
[04:46] <thomas_> k never mind then
[04:46] <Kingsqueak> flodine: IMO if you really don't understand the difference, yeah stick to plain 32 for now
[04:47] <marc> What is the proper way to recursively change the permissions of all files in a dir to 755?  I know its chmod -R 755 or something, but I cant get the rest of it right
[04:47] <what_if> flodine: unless you have a reason to go 64bit then 32bit has better software support (flash, etc )
[04:47] <nomin> sethk, it makes no difference if I type "xhost +" or "xhost -".  I still get the same message.  "cannot connect to X server :0.0"
[04:47] <santeria> meow, do you think this is funny? help me out MEOW!
[04:47] <Kingsqueak> flodine: 64 is a bit more alpha and if you don't have the experience, dealing with that can be a pain
[04:47] <Jimbo52> I have a drive on this machine that is still ntfs.....is there an easy way to change it to a more linux compatable filesystem without loosing all data?

[04:49] <Jimbo52> thomas: this is my first day using linux...wouldnt know how to shrink it or create a new partition here
[04:49] <sethk> nomin, thinking about it, it's possible that X is set up to use the .Xauthority form of authorization, and ignoring xhost
[04:49] <Jordan_U> santeria: NO.
[04:49] <Mantice> Is it normal for Edgy to remove your ATi Drivers ?
[04:49] <Munchkinguy> bye
[04:49] <sethk> nomin, try using the utility that makes a .Xauthority file from another one (the primary user's).
[04:49] <Jimbo52> machine has 2 120 gig hard drives
[04:49] <santeria> jordan_u OK. what do i do? :o
[04:49] <thomas_> Jimbo52: use either a partition magic boot cd or maybe even gparted live cd. i dunno i haven't  ever done this, but that's what you need to do.
[04:49] <Jimbo52> first one has the linux install
[04:50] <Jimbo52> can you use acronis disk utilities on linux?
[04:50] <thomas_> jimbo52: if they're two different drives, easy then.
[04:50] <nomin> sethk, what utility is that?  I'm just a schmuck that uses linux on the desktop.
[04:50] <Jordan_U> santeria: To restart type: sudo reboot , but there is one more command you can try ( although rebooting will have the same effect )
[04:50] <Jimbo52> yea two diff drives
[04:50] <sethk> nomin, I believe it's xauth
[04:50] <tjechno> hey hey
[04:50] <santeria> jordan_u ok
[04:50] <Kingsqueak> Mantice: when I did my upgrade, I had to redo my nvidia commercial driver install
[04:51] <sethk> nomin, yes, xauth.  check the man page.  I haven't done it in a while, so I'll have to figure the syntax out.  If I knew it off the top of my head I'd give it to you.
[04:51] <Xenguy> sethk: I seem to recall that xauth can be tricky permission-wise :-/
[04:51] <thomas_> jimbo: create a very large ext3 partition, then copy all the data from the ntfs one into the ext3, then when you're sure everything copied correctly, unmount all drives on that hard drive, then use gparted to convert the entire disk into ext3 drives.
[04:51] <Xenguy> sethk: be sure you know what yer doing
[04:51] <grodius> jrib: 00:02.0 for the VGA controller and 00:02.1
[04:51] <Jordan_U> santeria: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart ( to see if your graphics work )
[04:51] <nomin> sethk, ok.  thanks.  I'll look this stuff up.
[04:51] <grodius> jrib: 00:02.0 for the VGA controller and 00:02.1 for the graphical interface
[04:51] <sethk> Xenguy, indeed, that's true, but his situation is that his alternate user is DOA anyway, so he doesn't have a lot to lose
[04:51] <Sby_Fitnes_Diran>  /J #SURABAYA
[04:52] <Mantice> Kingsqueak: ok ill reinstall mine.
[04:52] <jrib> grodius: k, well try "vesa" as your driver.  Maybe that will let you get to X
[04:52] <Xenguy> sethk: sounds like you are aware of the issues then :-)
[04:52] <Jimbo52> Thomas: so just copy the data to the one with the ubuntu install correct?
[04:52] <tjechno> hello??
[04:52] <traskbtrojanek> Any Window Maker users in here?
[04:52] <Jordan_U> tjechno: hi.
[04:52] <thomas_> jimbo52: join #jimbo so we can talk in peace for a tick.
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> traskbtrojanek: not for years but I have
[04:53] <Xenguy> traskbtrojanek: awhile back
[04:53] <tjechno> Jordan_U: hi how you doing?
[04:53] <traskbtrojanek> Kingsqueak: do you happen to know how to get my dock to be horizontal instead of vertical?
[04:53] <Jimbo52> thomas...ill try
[04:53] <Jordan_U> tjechno: good
[04:53] <Jimbo52> everything here is totally new
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> traskbtrojanek: wmprefs I think?
[04:53] <santeria> jordan_u, when i restarted, it took me to the menu wehre i can choose to install instead of just running, should i hit install from text based installer? or off of hard disk since thats the only os ive got running
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> wmakerprefs maybe
[04:53] <Xenguy> traskbtrojanek: can you drag it around?
[04:53] <tjechno> Jordan_U: I am just looking for a chat....I am new to linux ubuntu
[04:53] <grodius> jrib: im gonna write something out in flood that it says when i try to startx
[04:53] <sethk> traskbtrojanek, right click on it, choose options, I think that'll work in wmaker.  not sure though.
[04:54] <traskbtrojanek> I can move the dock up and down and from side to side but can't arrange the icons to be horizontal..
[04:54] <Jordan_U> santeria: Restart without the install CD in the drive.
[04:54] <traskbtrojanek> I'll try those.
[04:54] <Jimbo52> Thomas i sent im
[04:54] <Mantice> What has better wine support the opensource drivers or the ATI.com drivers ?
[04:54] <santeria> jordan_u OHH ok :)
[04:54] <tjechno> Jordan_U: I have used it for 6 months now and I think it's great!!
[04:54] <Kingsqueak> traskbtrojanek: one of the preference utils I think lets you position it on whatever of the four sides you want
[04:54] <thomas_> Jimbo52: dude

[04:55] <atrus> i'm on feisty, and just updated. all gtk apps are now showing some ugly bitmapped font. (no anti-aliasing). xterm still works with xft though. suggestions?
[04:55] <r4dixL> and i have them in my /etc/network/interfaces
[04:55] <grodius> jrib: check what i wrote in flood
[04:55] <Jordan_U> tjechno: Try: #ubuntu-offtopic, this is really only supposed to be a support channel.

[04:55] <r4dixL> thanks man
[04:56] <atrus> crimsun: glutton for punishment? :) playing with newer stuff, testing, looking for bugs to triage, etc.
[04:56] <marc> I want to make all files and folders in my music dir 777 so as to remove a bunch of crap files that windows lcreated, how to I change the permissions all at once?
[04:56] <santeria> jordan_u now it went back to those damned colored lines
[04:56] <r4dixL> Xen, i have 192.168.0.1 in it
[04:56] <atrus> er, report more so than triage.
[04:56] <r4dixL> do i just delete it?
[04:56] <crimsun> atrus: you're highly unlikely to find reasonable support with feisty _here_. :)
[04:56] <jrib> grodius: alright I don't really know what's going on, sorry
[04:56] <Jordan_U> santeria: :(
[04:56] <thomas_> somebody upgraded to feisty already?
[04:56] <thomas_> wtf
[04:56] <Xenguy> r4dixL: that doesn't sound right
[04:57] <r4dixL> so what do i do?
[04:57] <santeria> jordan_u :(
[04:57] <r4dixL> should i put my nameservers in resolv.conf?
[04:57] <santeria> rutgers is gonna win
[04:57] <Xenguy> r4dixL: you probably want 'nameserver' lines...
[04:57] <r4dixL> yeah
[04:57] <Xenguy> r4dixL: 'domain' as well me thinks
[04:57] <r4dixL> mmm

[05:03] <totall_6_7> hello, i have a memory card that i use a card reader to transfer data from the computer to the card. If i delete files from the card using the pocket pc that the card is for, and i connect it back to the computer the computer is still reading the space as being taken up by the files that are no longer there. Is there any way to make the computer forget what it thinks is on the card
[05:03] <totall_6_7> when i connect it, forget what was on the card from the last time it was connected
[05:03] <r4dixL> hehe ^5 =)
[05:03] <Jordan_U> santeria: No, that was the correct command, it just didn't give the output I expected.
[05:04] <santeria> jordan
[05:04] <santeria> jordan_u did you mean type glxinfo, then grep renderer? or glxinfo | grep renderer
[05:05] <santeria> jordan
[05:05] <santeria> damnit
[05:05] <Jordan_U> santeria: Run glxinfo and see if you can tell where it says what driver you are using.

[05:08] <synphreak> thomas_: just wanted to let you know how I fixed that problem with making a share on an NTFS drive writable.  in /etc/fstab i set umask to 0000 (instead of 0002), and that fixed it.  That says to me that really there is just some user I need to add to the ntfs group (though smbd runs as root, and I added root to the ntfs group and it didn't work).

[05:13] <NewcomerXb> I wonder why there's an error in the way my root partition is mounting... that's strange isnt it?
[05:13] <zcat[1] > totall_6_7: You have to unmount the card (like "safely remove hardware" in windows) before you unplug it. Also if you delete stuff in Gnome it will get moved to a hidden trash folder. You have to empty the trash before it's really gone.. any of that help?
[05:13] <Zambezi> Will there be difference in CPU-load and memory using Ubuntu Dapper server compare to Debian Sarge server? Both without X. The computer will work as a Jabberserver and Spamassassin.

[05:14] <totall_6_7> i will have to figure out if my pocket pc has a way to 'safe eject' the card
[05:14] <Zambezi> Yourname, Get me a stable external.
[05:14] <zcat[1] > MrGiMmE: linux has bwbasic, which is quite similar to gwbasic. not sure what realbasic is like but possibly compatable ?

[05:14] <Cerebra> Ok, I'll make it easy, I need any version of linux to run inside of XP Pro, not as a dual boot. Can any one help?

[05:16] <witless> so, guntella network, and emule network?
[05:16] <MrGiMmE> And its coded in REALBasic
[05:16] <Yourname> m4rk: And run x4vncviewer from term, and you're good to go.
[05:16] <NewcomerXb> I may try aMule, but Im enjoying gnutella
[05:16] <NewcomerXb> You can install it in add/remove programs quickly. buth of them
[05:16] <witless> how about command-line clients?  there is mutella for gnutella, is there one for emule?
[05:16] <MrGiMmE> I know you can install REALBasic on ubuntu
[05:16] <NewcomerXb> ^-^ Yay I helped hehe

[05:18] <MrGiMmE> Damn
[05:18] <m4rk> xvncviewer: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3:
[05:18] <m4rk> i'll see if i can sort that out myself
=== bradley_ is now known as bradley
[05:19] <Yourname> m4rk: Try removing it, and then use synaptic to install it. Synaptic installs the libs too, I think.
[05:19] <Zambezi> Xenguy, I'm in the channel right now too. I'll give it a shoot if I can find the image I'm looking for.
[05:19] <NewcomerXb> !remount
[05:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about remount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:19] <avagant_> I'm telling you bash_aliases is probably everything in your world.
[05:19] <NewcomerXb> oy
[05:19] <Xenguy> Zambezi: cheers (I'm off to bed :-)
[05:19] <MrGiMmE> Hmm
[05:19] <r9chard> telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl :P
[05:19] <zcat[1] > MrGiMmE: I just googled "realbasic linux" and the first hit is an announcement that there's a realbasic port for linux :)

[05:20] <MrGiMmE> Alright!
[05:20] <MrGiMmE> Thanks zaatar
[05:20] <avagant_> why type sudo apt-get install when you can just put apti instead?
[05:20] <MrGiMmE> zcat[1] ** lol
[05:20] <wd> how can i upgrade ubuntu 5.10 to dapper?
[05:20] <NewcomerXb> Okay i give up
[05:20] <MrGiMmE> Dang Tab
[05:20] <avagant_> or yum for sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get update
[05:20] <zcat[1] > about the third his is the realbasic homepage which mentions it's for all thre platforms. So there's your answer
[05:20] <r9chard> dist upgrades aren't as good
[05:20] <r9chard> may as well reinstall
[05:20] <NewcomerXb> Does nobody have a hint for me? :/
[05:20] <avagant_> wd: type gksu "update-manager -c"
[05:20] <MrGiMmE> Thank you very much
[05:21] <skel> anyone know if sun announces Java to be released under gpl if Ubuntu will replace gcj with sun's Gpl'd java?
[05:21] <avagant_> If you don't have burning capabilities.
[05:21] <zcat[1] > hehe.. obvious google search :)
[05:21] <avagant_> I personally am going to stick to Dapper until things get a little more worked out with Edgy.
[05:21] <traskbtrojanek> Still can't get it to work..
[05:21] <traskbtrojanek> Does anyone know how to get a horizontal dock in Window Maker?
[05:21] <r9chard> edgy works better for me
[05:21] <wd> avagant_,  thanks. i really have a amd 64, tried edgy but was disappointed with wine and 32 codecs not supported so i was told to install old version.
=== avagant_ is now known as avagant
[05:22] <avagant> I don't know why that stupid _ was there.
[05:22] <zcat[1] > I'd like to try edgy but my wife won't let me. Shared computer .. :(
[05:22] <avagant> I have an amd too, not sure of the 64 or whatever of mine.
[05:22] <zcat[1] > I played with it on my lappy though
[05:22] <wd> avagant, dapper is more stable than breezy right/
[05:22] <wd> avagant, yeah i know
[05:23] <traskbtrojanek> zcat[1] : dual-boot?
[05:23] <avagant> Dapper is ten times more stable than Edgy.
[05:23] <avagant> I couldn't use any of the programs I normally use on Dapper.
[05:23] <thomas_> zcat[1]  use either qemu or vmware-player. everybody's happy then.
[05:23] <avagant> Xchat, xmms, tomboy half the other things, wouldn't work.
[05:23] <wd> avagant,  yeah. i know. didn't have a dapper cd so i found my old breezy one.
[05:23] <zcat[1] > Nah, I have the security cameras on this machine. I don't want it rebooted all the time..
[05:23] <traskbtrojanek> Everything is working fine for me on Edgy :|
[05:24] <zcat[1] > and it's a bit slothful to run two oses at the same time..
[05:24] <thomas_> zcat[1]  so run it virtually.
[05:24] <wd> avagant, damn thats not good.
[05:24] <avagant> wd: Yah, so it's better I stick to Dapper.
[05:24] <traskbtrojanek> Get another computer :P
[05:24] <zcat[1] > on a 1ghz machine with only 300M of ram? nah...
[05:24] <avagant> Wait wd don't do that gksu thing cause you might just update straight to edgy.
[05:24] <cheater> Can anyone help me get sound working in Edgy Eft? It was working earlier, but now it stopped. It only doesn't work for videos. Music works.
[05:24] <wd> avagant, i was told by some guru's that i won't see a big loss in performance
[05:24] <wd> avagant, ok
[05:24] <avagant> you might have to burn a new disc.
[05:25] <avagant> Don't quote me on that.
[05:25] <avagant> I think it doesn't update that far, but just in case.
[05:25] <wd> avagant,  oh crap. i'll go to the site and burn it, that means new installation huh?
[05:25] <avagant> I told some poor guy to update to Edgy and it didn't work for him and broke his Dapper.
[05:25] <avagant> Well I'm not sure how that works.
[05:25] <zcat[1] > dapper's pretty sweet anyhow.. I'm not in a hurry to upgrade. I have backports so I get enough of the new hotness from edgy to keep me happy.
[05:26] <avagant> I'm not sure if you can update that way, give it a try real quick.
[05:26] <hektik> hey in the edgy install, if i resize a partition with windows on it, will it erase the partition or just resize it without affecting those fiels ?
[05:26] <avagant> alt+f2
[05:26] <avagant> type in gksu "update-manager -c"
[05:26] <avagant> see what happens.
[05:26] <novaterata> can anyone explain why i have low-id in amule even after forwarding all the ports in my router config and opening them in my software firewall
[05:26] <mitsuhiko> hoi
[05:26] <m4rk> where do i get libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3:
[05:26] <wd> avagant,  i've played with ubuntu for about a year, took a break for 6 months now i'm back. tried gentoo, nice, fast, but compiling man, tiredsome.  :)
[05:26] <mitsuhiko> anyone with a 32bit dapper here?
[05:27] <avagant> wd: Gentoo is a bad word to me. :D
[05:27] <zcat[1] > novaterata: isn't low-id the good one?
[05:27] <mitsuhiko> i need a copy of the dapper libfreetype.so.6
[05:27] <bimberi> hektik: it _should_ resize safely.  Make sure you're backed up though.
[05:27] <wd> avagant,   lol
[05:27] <avagant> wd: Just installing it from cd was a bore.
[05:27] <avagant> I left for 6 hours and it was only on package 88 of like 300 some.
[05:27] <wd> avagant,  oh my gosh, i tried the mininal install and 6 days later still going....lol
[05:27] <Brokenstein> is there an easy way to totally wipe out ubuntu and start over with a fresh install without wiping the contents of home folder?
[05:27] <novaterata> gentoo is only cool on the xbox cause its pre-compiled since there is only one xbox
[05:27] <avagant> Yah, when I saw that I was like, nope.
[05:28] <avagant> I should learn to read up on these things.
[05:28] <traskbtrojanek> Does anyone know how to get a horizontal dock bar in Window Maker?
[05:28] <mitsuhiko> ah. never mind
[05:28] <avagant> Right now I'm dualbooting because I can't get my mind off of Windows.
[05:28] <wd> novaterata, ur right
[05:28] <mitsuhiko> my server is running dapper
[05:28] <avagant> wd: I've been using ubuntu for about a month and a half.
[05:29] <avagant> It's been an all mighty trial.
[05:29] <dsnyders> I tried an edgy upgrade, and somehow lost my eth0 and Xwindows.  How do I convince my machine that it has an eth0?
[05:29] <avagant> hahaha
[05:29] <Brokenstein> when we get a better version of flash i wouldn't see any more need to even use wine
[05:29] <avagant> plead?
[05:29] <FirstStrike> Gently stroke it and tell it everthing will be ok.
[05:29] <novaterata> is there a decent irc channel search engine, i can't find the amule channel
[05:29] <avagant> Brokenstein: There's flash 9.
[05:29] <zcat[1] > backup /home and do a clean install ? :)
[05:30] <wd> avagant, well, i'm  going to dual boot again, this time ubuntu on one hd, windows on another, and third hd for file, just reading dual booting with two hd and i'm gonna try that instead of one hd, two partitions.
[05:30] <wd> ooooops sorry guys
[05:30] <Brokenstein> umm flash 9 is out already?
[05:30] <avagant> Yes sir.
[05:30] <avagant> Well it's in beta.
[05:30] <bimberi> !flash9 | Brokenstein
[05:30] <ubotu> Brokenstein: Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[05:30] <avagant> But it works absolutley fine.
[05:30] <Brokenstein> hell yeah!
[05:30] <avagant> wd: That's what I'm doing right now.
[05:30] <avagant> wd: Windows hda, Ubuntu hdb.
[05:30] <novaterata> how much free space do you have on your partition, you could possibly resize it smaller, then make a new one and copy home on to it
[05:30] <avagant> I'm very indecisive.
[05:31] <avagant> I was half thinking maybe trying a software raid, but I just got everything set up the way I want it.
[05:31] <dsnyders> avagent, indecisive, eh?  Are you sure?
[05:31] <avagant> hahaha.
[05:31] <avagant> I don't know, let me think about it.
[05:31] <hhhjr> ok anybody know where a nubie can get some help installing firmware for a nexus dvb pci card? PLease
[05:31] <avagant> My problem is I only have 2 10gb hd's.
[05:32] <senthil> hi
[05:32] <avagant> So I have to make every little space count.
[05:32] <Mantice> can I bind
[05:32] <avagant> But once I saw you can get a 250gb for like 60 dollars online I was like BAM.
[05:32] <wd> avagant,  hmmm, did u take out win hd, install ubuntu on 2nd hd set to master, then edit grub menu, plug windows back in and bamm?
[05:32] <avagant> wd: no even easier.
[05:32] <avagant> haha
[05:32] <avagant> windows is on main.
[05:32] <avagant> ubuntu is on second
[05:33] <TheReconHunter> Hey, im having a problem wth my boot disk
[05:33] <avagant> installed dapper using instulux.
[05:33] <avagant> sets everything up for you.
[05:33] <Mantice> I have a Internet keyboard my dad uses the back button on it to go back in firefox. But in ubuntu the back button dont work can I bind this button to backspace ?
[05:33] <GaiaX11> Is there a lighter pdf viewer for gnome than acroread and xpdf?
[05:33] <nomasteryoda> evince
[05:33] <avagant> the only problem with installux is it's a netboot type thing, meaning it took me 3 hours to install.

[05:33] <Madpilot> GaiaX11, try evince
[05:33] <novaterata> go to Target and buy a hard drive, back up home on to it, install ubuntu, move home back, reformat Target drive and take it back to Target
[05:33] <TheReconHunter> im currently running a dapper install disk, and trying to use gparted. However, when i try to move one of my partitions, it freezes, and i cannot cancel out of the process, and i dont want to b/c of the risk to my files
[05:34] <avagant> You can get a hd at Target?
[05:34] <novaterata> yes
[05:34] <avagant> I wonder if I have any coupons laying around. :D
[05:34] <skelter> could anyone help me troubleshoot the cause of my lack of sound? it stopped working mysteriously (mysterious to me, anyway). edgy 64 bit.
[05:34] <TheReconHunter> Also, i cannot resize my ubuntu installation partition, only shrink it
[05:34] <wd> avagant,  yeah but i don't want to install grub on my windows mbr, it's hell taking it off, and fdisk /fixmbr doesn't always work.
[05:34] <novaterata> i think just PATA, but i might be wrong
[05:34] <avagant> wd: Hmm, well I just did it. Can't learn anything without breaking your box! :d
[05:34] <avagant> I was gonna try opensuse, but I can't imagine how long that would take me.
[05:35] <TheReconHunter> Its been doing nothign for the past like 30 minutes
[05:35] <avagant> Especially if it's more than one disk.
[05:35] <TheReconHunter> and its REALLY annoying
[05:35] <TheReconHunter> anyone know what i can do wihtout losing my data>
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> novaterata, make sure .EVERYONE ... to wipe the drive with DBAN at least 3 times
[05:35] <avagant> I'm gonna go target for my next hd!
[05:35] <wd> avagant, i have the 5 iso cd, version 10, been siting in my desk here at home for about 2years now. ubuntu rocks.
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> i have recovered data from a drive that was formatted with gparted ... to ntfs and windows was installed again..
[05:35] <B|nTaRa> hmm
[05:35] <avagant> Ubuntu is rockin it, my only qualm is the whole alsa/sound issue.
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> recovered some most everything
[05:36] <skelter> what is this alsa/sound issue?
[05:36] <B|nTaRa> i cant play .avi / .mp4 videos files
[05:36] <TheReconHunter> anyone wana help me?
[05:36] <wd> madpilot long time how r u?
[05:36] <skelter> my sound died for no reason i can see
[05:36] <B|nTaRa> totem sent me error
[05:36] <avagant> skelter: Not being able to play more than one sound at once.
[05:36] <skelter> trying to fix it
[05:36] <novaterata> did you install the non-free codecs
[05:36] <skelter> ah, well that's not my problem
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> B|nTaRa, try vlc or xine
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> and the codecs
[05:36] <GaiaX11> Madpilot: Thx :-)
[05:36] <novaterata> they are just not installed by default cause they aren't free as in freedom just pizza
[05:36] <avagant> I don't even really have anything on either harddrive to "keep" anymore though, since I've been changing os's so much.
[05:36] <wd> avagant, does this net thing, instulux install grub into win mbr?
[05:36] <avagant> I'm not sure, I think so.
[05:36] <TheReconHunter> im currently running a dapper install disk, and trying to use gparted. However, when i try to move one of my partitions, it freezes, and i cannot cancel out of the process, and i dont want to b/c of the risk to my files.
[05:37] <zoidberg> guys whats a good torrent client for dapper...other than azureus..?
[05:37] <avagant> because Windows doesn't like not being the main hd or whatever.
[05:37] <TheReconHunter> anyone know what i can do to solve this problem?
[05:37] <zcat[1] > dban is overkill.. a single zero-wipe is more than enough for what most people need.
[05:37] <Brokenstein> for torrents i prefer bittornado
[05:37] <avagant> I use Nicotine for all my p2p needs.
[05:37] <nomasteryoda> zcat[1] , NSA can recover data from even a 6 over wipe with dban
[05:37] <nomasteryoda> beleive me, it can be done..
[05:38] <zoidberg> guys whats a good torrent client for dapper...other than azureus..?
[05:38] <avagant> nsa?
[05:38] <senthil> can u tell how to install 2nd level localization
[05:38] <wd> avagant, trying to get around that, i found a couple of tutorials editing the grub menu.1st, i'm gonna try that and see what happens. that way if i bounce ubuntu again, i can just plug it out.
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> National Security Agency...
[05:38] <zcat[1] > probably.. but is NSA your threat, or some kid with Norton's tools trying to get your credit card number?
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> even RIAA can
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> yea
[05:38] <B|nTaRa> nomasteryoda, cant
[05:38] <B|nTaRa> xine cant play
[05:38] <B|nTaRa> it ask me to start playback
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> B|nTaRa, you install the codecs?
[05:38] <TheReconHunter> im currently running a dapper install disk, and trying to use gparted. However, when i try to move one of my partitions, it freezes, and i cannot cancel out of the process, and i dont want to b/c of the risk to my files. Anyone know what i can do without messing up my partition, and potentially, my data?
[05:39] <avagant> wd: That might be a better idea, in my case I just did whatever. Haha
[05:39] <B|nTaRa> !codecs

[05:39] <zcat[1] > I bet I could fill a drive end to end with my CC number and then zero-wipe it. It would not be woth the credit limit on my card for you to recover it.
[05:39] <avagant> wd: I'd never tried dual booting before, so this was pretty much a "wow my first time!"
[05:39] <zoidberg> guys....can anyone help me....i'm looking for a good torrent client that works well with UBUNTU?
[05:39] <avagant> I wanna try getting osx on my pc....(spoken softly)
[05:40] <nomasteryoda> TheReconHunter, you "should" be able to reboot without loosing data... BUT.. download on another computer the gparted live boot cd and try that..
[05:40] <NewcomerXb> im going to ask again :(  defaults,error s=remount-ro  What is this?
[05:40] <nomin> zoidberg, azureus
[05:40] <nomasteryoda> its newer and has worked on all the drives I've used...
[05:40] <GaiaX11> avagant: Nicotine ask me for a passwd? Which pass?
[05:40] <avagant> GaiaX11: You make one up!
[05:40] <zoidberg> nomin: other than azureus
[05:40] <avagant> GaiaX11: It's like registration.
[05:40] <avagant> You can use it every time.
[05:40] <GaiaX11> avagant: for examplo:

[05:41] <zoidberg> thats fine nomin

[05:42] <senthil> where is the 2nd level localization source code ... i like to learn this
[05:42] <novaterata> you just have to make sure the trackers aren't red and there are seeders etc.
[05:42] <avagant> mine is sktfeelsdapper for user name and well pass.
[05:42] <novaterata> the more popular the better

[05:43] <bruenig> what is the command, I forgot, to list all the information about eth0
[05:43] <novaterata> ironically i have the same problem with emule/amule
[05:43] <wd> avagant,  oh soulseek?
[05:43] <avagant> Soulseek > all.

[05:44] <bruenig> wine utorrent indeed
[05:44] <avagant> and then sudo ifup eth0
[05:44] <traskbtrojanek> Everyone: Please, hacking(applying programming hacks to software) is different than cracking(breaking into computers).
[05:45] <traskbtrojanek> :|
[05:45] <traskbtrojanek> Does anyone know how to add/delete workspaces in Window Maker?
[05:45] <avagant> It's the equivilent to clicking network connections and "disconnecting".
[05:45] <zcat[1] > traskbtrojanek: nobody but you and ESR cares anymore .. :(
[05:45] <traskbtrojanek> Heh.
[05:45] <fiveiron> any idea why the installation of 6.10 would stall after I click forward on the "Prepare disk space" screen?  It just sits there not doing anything
[05:45] <avagant> Man I didn't think it would be so hard to learn Ruby.
[05:45] <wastrel> traskbtrojanek:  right-click on the clip in the top left
[05:46] <TheReconHunter> hey, is there a system restore feature for ubuntu, like on windows?
[05:46] <wastrel> <3 wmaker
[05:46] <TheReconHunter> i messed something up majorly bad
[05:46] <senthil> where is the 2nd level localization source code ... i like to learn this
[05:46] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, what did you do?
[05:46] <dsnyders> avagant, ifup eth0 reports error getting interface flags, no such device
[05:46] <nomin> dsnyders, what does tcpdump listen on?
[05:46] <novaterata> hacking first referred to the boys that ran the telephone switchboards listening to conversations that sounds more like breaking into computers to me
[05:46] <avagant> o rry?
[05:46] <wd> avagant, hmmm, u didn't like the ubuntu bittorrent app?
[05:46] <traskbtrojanek> wastrel: Then what? All it gives me is to rename, etc.
[05:46] <avagant> wd: I used it once.
[05:46] <traskbtrojanek> wastrel: nothing about adding/deleting workspaces :|
[05:46] <avagant> wd: And it wasn't for "legal" software :D
[05:46] <wastrel> traskbtrojanek:  hmm.  i'm not running it right now.  maybe in the root menu
[05:47] <traskbtrojanek> I have a custom menu..
[05:47] <wd> avagant, oh, ok. lol
[05:47] <wastrel> heh
[05:47] <avagant> But every other time on Windows or Ubuntu I used it I haven't had good luck.
[05:47] <TheReconHunter> fiveiron: i tried going from XGL compiz to AIGLX Beryl
[05:47] <TheReconHunter> and on the way
[05:47] <wastrel> traskbtrojanek:  it's been a few years since i used wmaker...
[05:47] <dsnyders> nomin, it says listening on any device
[05:47] <avagant> I did the port fowarding and everything.
[05:47] <Mantice> Could some one help me with wine I dont understand :(
[05:47] <TheReconHunter> i made it so i can no longer acess alot of my programs
[05:47] <TheReconHunter> and
[05:47] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, so...  did you create a .Xsession file to load Beryl?
[05:47] <TheReconHunter> text keeps like flashing
[05:47] <wd> avagant, ok well i'm off to download dapper, then try this edit grub menu thing and see if i can dual boot that way without installing in win mbr.
[05:48] <zcat[1] > btw; I have a question; How can I get the ubuntu 6.10 bootdisk to recognise my raid array on a DL380 ?
[05:48] <TheReconHunter> itll just go nuts
[05:48] <TheReconHunter> fiveiron: at this point, im not sure at all
[05:48] <avagant> wd: Well good luck with that.
[05:48] <grodius> a
[05:48] <TheReconHunter> this is seriously messed up
[05:48] <avagant> wd: I'd offer advice but I did mine the easy way.
[05:48] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, rofl... are you familar with the console?
[05:48] <TheReconHunter> yes sir
[05:48] <TheReconHunter> but
[05:48] <avagant> TheReconHunter: Did you chmod -R anything?
[05:48] <avagant> Haha
[05:48] <TheReconHunter> no
[05:48] <wastrel> traskbtrojanek:  it's supposed to be in the workspaces submenu in the root menu.
[05:49] <TheReconHunter> I dont know whats going on, its just going nuts
[05:49] <avagant> TheReconHunter: I ask cause I did the same thing to my /usr/bin and ended up not being able to sudo.
[05:49] <traskbtrojanek> Any idea what the command is..?
[05:49] <wd> hey guys is there an easy way to install dapper by upgrade or update? instead of reinstall?
[05:49] <TheReconHunter> i cant unmount anything
[05:49] <nomin> dsnyders, have you had ubuntu running on that computer before?
[05:49] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, just delete the .Xsession file in your home dir, and either log out manually of X, or hit ctrl-alt-backspace
[05:49] <TheReconHunter> gparted just wont work
[05:49] <novaterata> speaking of that i can't su or sudo but i can run root console
[05:49] <jrib> ubotu: tell wd about upgrade
[05:49] <zoidberg> guys i just downloaded bittonarod and installed it
[05:49] <wd> jrib, thnx
[05:49] <zoidberg> but when i type bittornado in the terminal
[05:49] <TheReconHunter> where would it be 5iron?
[05:49] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, why in the heck do you want to unmount something if you only screwed up your X?
[05:49] <B|nTaRa> i just realise that im using amd 64
[05:49] <avagant> novaterata: Did you chmod anything you weren't suppose to?
[05:49] <zoidberg> it doesnt launch
[05:49] <TheReconHunter> well
[05:49] <zoidberg> its says bad command
[05:49] <zoidberg> ?
[05:49] <TheReconHunter> im trying to repartition my hard drive as well
[05:49] <B|nTaRa> but i installed xubuntu using my x86 ISO
[05:50] <B|nTaRa> should i reinstall xubuntu / ubuntu using amd 64 ISO ?
[05:50] <avagant> My next thing to try is the alternative cd, once I bork this installation up enough.
[05:50] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, fix x, then repartition.....   delete /home/yourname/.Xsession
[05:50] <dsnyders> nomin, yes, yesterday it was running dapper just fine.  I tried to upgrade to edgy, and now no ethernet, and no xwindows.
[05:50] <wastrel> you can't resize a mounted partition
[05:50] <avagant> How'd you upgrade to Edgy?
[05:50] <nomin> dsnyders, ok I see.  You did an upgrade.  Does it show up in the device manager?
[05:50] <novaterata> zoidberg check your gnome menu
[05:50] <traskbtrojanek> wastrel: Ah, I can put a Workspace Menu into my custom menu, thanks.
[05:50] <novaterata> from dapper ... dun dun dun
[05:50] <avagant> dsnyders: How did you upgrade to Edgy?
[05:51] <dsnyders> nomin, how do I start the device manager?
[05:51] <avagant> I mean what method.
[05:51] <fiveiron> dangit... stupid install disk
[05:51] <B|nTaRa> anyone can help me ?
[05:51] <TheReconHunter> im not seeing .xsession
[05:51] <B|nTaRa> should i reinstall xubuntu / ubuntu using amd 64 ISO ?
[05:51] <TheReconHunter> and i dont really remember using one
[05:51] <avagant> novaterata: Comedy beats?
[05:51] <nomin> dsnyders, btw, I'm just a novice.  On dapper it's under System>Administration>Device Manager
[05:51] <fiveiron> .Xsession...  capital X
[05:51] <pilibeen> has anybody heard of people having shutdown problems in Dapper before?....when i try to shutdown using xfce it starts to shutdown then brings me to a terminal login where I can't type anything...
[05:51] <dsnyders> avagant, I ran a couple of scripts on a website.
[05:51] <zoidberg> its not in the gnome menu either
[05:51] <menko> HI, How do I get gnome-volume-manager to open media with thunar instead of nautilus (apart from changin nautilus bin)
[05:52] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, if you can't find that file then have you just tried logging out at back in?
[05:52] <dsnyders> nomin, I do not have xwindows.  I'll need a command line solution.
[05:52] <avagant> dsnyders: Did it have "gksu update-manager -c" in it?
[05:52] <TheReconHunter> yeah
[05:52] <TheReconHunter> i just restarted
[05:52] <TheReconHunter> ill try again tho
[05:52] <novaterata> B|nTaRa did you get my message
[05:52] <nomin> dsnyders, how experienced are you with linux?
[05:52] <zcat[1] > pilibeen: it's just slipped you to the wrong console.. try alt-F? to a few others, one will be displaying all the shutdown text...
[05:52] <B|nTaRa> novaterata, nope
[05:52] <avagant> I don't recommend anyone changing their sources list to edgy because apparently there are alot of problems with that.
[05:52] <dsnyders> avagant, I do not remember.  I have seen that command since, though.
[05:53] <avagant> dsnyders: That's apparently the "prefered" way to upgrade to Edgy.
[05:53] <avagant> Otherwise you might have problems.
[05:53] <novaterata> ok B| i asked if you enabled your universe and multiverse sources in package manager
[05:53] <dsnyders> nomin, I've been running fedora for a few years.  I switched to ubuntu a month or two ago.
[05:54] <senthil> hi
[05:54] <B|nTaRa> novaterata, i did
[05:54] <novaterata> so you installed the codecs already
[05:54] <hektik> is their a remote desktop option on the livecd so somone can see my desktop while im on the live cd ?
[05:54] <B|nTaRa> i still searching / reading on how to install the codecs
[05:54] <novaterata> did you try oss instead of alsa?
[05:54] <avagant> or alsa-oss?
[05:54] <avagant> even better!
[05:54] <fiveiron> any idea why the installation of 6.10 would stall after I click forward on the "Prepare disk space" screen?  It just sits there not doing anything
[05:55] <thomas_> hey i'm having trouble locking the version of a package in synaptic. Its got a lower version than a package available in repositories, and i'm installing this package manually. Everytime i update my computer, the package updates, which is not what i want. The Lock Version button in synaptic does not seem to be functioning, can somebody help me with this?
[05:55] <dsnyders> avagant, I've tried that command since the original upgrade failed.  However, with no XWindows, the gksu command fails.
[05:55] <hektik> is their a remote desktop option on the livecd so somone can see my desktop while im on the live cd ?
[05:55] <pilibeen> zcat[1] : yeah i've tried checking the other terminals...the only which isn't a login is F8, which shows me exactly what it always shows...list of startup checks
[05:55] <novaterata> the easiest is probably to install Automatix2 and let it do that
[05:55] <avagant> why don't you have a xwindows?
[05:55] <senthil> where is the 2nd level localization source code ... i like to learn this
[05:55] <Mantice> How do you show hidden files in ubuntu???
[05:55] <novaterata> you have to install that yourself but its not hard just google Automatix2
[05:55] <bimberi> hektik: System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
[05:55] <avagant> Is it like a server install or something?
[05:55] <fiveiron> dsnyders, apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:55] <zcat[1] > pilibeen: weird.
[05:55] <dsnyders> avagant, apparently that's one of the ways the upgrade can fail.
[05:55] <fiveiron> dsnyders, man apt-get
[05:55] <thomas_> !automatix
[05:55] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:55] <avagant> Ahhh.
[05:55] <bimberi> Mantice: <ctrl>H  (in nautilus)
[05:55] <dsnyders> fiveiron.  apt-get needs an internet connection, no?
[05:55] <avagant> Yah see I just ran gksu "update-manager -c" in windows.
[05:56] <avagant> ERrr in dapper.
[05:56] <bimberi> lol
[05:56] <avagant> Silly spelling.
[05:56] <fiveiron> dsnyders, no... if you have the files already, I'm assuming you can just install from those
[05:56] <novaterata> i didn't know that, well it works great for me, anyway if you don't want to do that then just install everything gstreamer
[05:56] <jobless_> guys i have a problem with my mouse.. the pointer acceleration does not increase though i change the setting..!
[05:56] <avagant> I wanna try that beryl edgy thing, but I'm NOT sure my computer can handle, and the last time I tried I borked my xsession file pretty bad.
[05:56] <avagant> errr just Beryl my bad.
[05:57] <Mantice> bimberi: thanks
[05:57] <fiveiron> avagant, thats why you make a .Xsession.bak
[05:57] <skelter> can anyone help me troubleshoot a lack-of-sound issue?
[05:57] <dsnyders> fiveiron, I have the edgy iso, but I have been unable to find instructions on how to point apt-get at the iso
[05:57] <bimberi> Mantice: np :)
[05:57] <avagant> fiveiron: usually, but it's me.
[05:57] <TheReconHunter> alright, im back, with no more luck
[05:57] <B|nTaRa> novaterata, problem solved .. i can play .avi / .mp4 using VLC player
[05:57] <avagant> fiveiron: and then i got gnome to show up again cept everytime i restarted it would pop up that it couldn't start and then start anyways.
[05:58] <booger> does any one know of a good video confer app?
[05:58] <avagant> i need detailed instructions, PLUS I don't know what videocard, whatever you need I have.
[05:58] <hektik> bimberbi: are you sure its in taht location ?
[05:58] <novaterata> yeah vlc always works, but if you install gstreamer or xine plugins you can play them in other things
[05:58] <TheReconHunter> geez, its even worse than befor
[05:58] <TheReconHunter> e
[05:58] <novaterata> although i would use vlc anyway
[05:58] <avagant> ubuntuforums.org has plenty of tutorials.
[05:58] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, what exactly is the problem?
[05:59] <TheReconHunter> text just randomly flashes in and out
[05:59] <TheReconHunter> and iit seems as if something is very wrong here
[05:59] <avagant> He's in the Matrix basically.
[05:59] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, don't be overly dramatic... you've only screwed up your xwindows
=== Caplain_ is now known as Caplain
[05:59] <novaterata> anyone, i'm rarely on irc is there a search engine for channels that is good
[05:59] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, have you tried removing the beryl files?
[05:59] <TheReconHunter> lol
[05:59] <avagant> How do I found out if I can run beryl?
[06:00] <B|nTaRa> novaterata, such as ?
[06:00] <avagant> Or better yet, what equipment I have to find that out?
[06:00] <TheReconHunter> well, something is wrong
[06:00] <B|nTaRa> nvm
[06:00] <TheReconHunter> i have a half complied version of beryl
[06:00] <TheReconHunter> a verision of beryl that doesnt work from teh repos
[06:00] <bimberi> hektik: i haven't checked on the latest LiveCD, but it's usually there
[06:00] <TheReconHunter> and yes, i did try removing the files
[06:00] <fiveiron> do you have a .beryl config or something?
[06:00] <OC-William> will ubuntu detect a ps2 kb and mouse automatically?
[06:00] <avagant> I need to figure out what videocard I have, so I can see if I can run beryl.
[06:00] <fiveiron> (i've never used beryl)
[06:01] <novaterata> i'm looking for help with amule and i dont' even want to bother you guys with it but this is the only channel i know where people are helpful
[06:01] <grekkos> anyone have a problem with the Gaim install on Edgy? when I try to add an account the protocol drop-down list is empty
[06:01] <TheReconHunter> i really dont know, i followed some tutorial
[06:01] <fiveiron> avagant, you might try a beryl chatroom
[06:01] <TheReconHunter> on teh beryl site
[06:01] <TheReconHunter> and it didnt work
[06:01] <grekkos> who needs help with beryl?
[06:01] <avagant> Is there one?
[06:01] <TheReconHunter> i wanted to upgrade to edgy any way
[06:01] <fiveiron> TheReconHunter, if you could give me a url i might be able to help you
[06:01] <grekkos> avagant: join #ubuntu-xgl
[06:01] <novaterata> all usb keyboards should work on the same driver
[06:01] <grekkos> avagant: there's help there for xgl and beryl
[06:01] <avagant> grekkos: I really just want to find out if I can actually do it.
[06:01] <novaterata> i mean ps2 recognized imac keyboard
[06:01] <grekkos> avagant: what exactly?
[06:01] <TheReconHunter> Fiveiron: i doubt its worth it- i backed up any important files
[06:01] <novaterata> oh way, ps2 or ps2 like playstation?
[06:02] <TheReconHunter> and i want to reformat my hard drive
[06:02] <TheReconHunter> but i cannot use gparted
[06:02] <avagant> Well I don't know what videocard whatever I have.
[06:02] <avagant> I wanna know man!
[06:02] <avagant> haha
[06:02] <avagant> I know I have alot of ATI stuff.
[06:02] <Mantice> Whats go to desktop button in ubuntu
[06:02] <avagant> It's on the lower left.
[06:03] <novaterata> what like F11 in OS X
[06:03] <Mantice> is there a short cut for it ?
[06:03] <avagant> I don't know, but it's that button that's blue on the lower left of the screen.
[06:03] <Mantice> like windows D for desktop.
[06:03] <novaterata> there is a show desktop icon on one of the panels
[06:03] <avagant> novaterata: lower left.
[06:03] <avagant> haha
[06:04] <wastrel> ctrl shift d shows desktop in gnome
[06:04] <wastrel> sry ctrl alt d
[06:04] <avagant> Well, maybe having crazy graphics with beryl wouldn't be a good idea anyways.
[06:04] <avagant> I don't know if this old heap could handle it.
[06:04] <novaterata> msg avagant i made mine look like windows and mac at the same time in case i'm in a particular mood there it is
[06:05] <TheReconHunter> is it worht it to upgrade to edgy?
[06:05] <avagant> novaterata: what your ubuntu?
[06:05] <avagant> or beryl?
[06:05] <novaterata> msg avagant edgy
[06:05] <TheReconHunter> like is it stable
[06:05] <TheReconHunter> etc?
[06:05] <avagant> ahhhhh
[06:05] <avagant> edgy is not very stable.
[06:05] <novaterata> i think he means what do you press in a Dialog box to quickly switch to desktop
[06:05] <booger> :--
[06:05] <wastrel> i like edgy real good
[06:05] <novaterata> i don't think there is one
[06:05] <wastrel> depends on your hardware & what apps you want to use :] 
[06:05] <novaterata> all my hardware actually works in edgy
[06:06] <TheReconHunter> i mostly want to use it for listening to music
[06:06] <TheReconHunter> and beryl
[06:06] <TheReconHunter> and my hardware is pretty good
[06:06] <avagant> somebody answer me!
[06:06] <avagant> hahaha
[06:06] <novaterata> although i still don't know if my 5.1 headphones (thats right headphones) get all 6 channels
[06:06] <avagant> how do i find out what videocard i have, to use with beryl?
[06:06] <Mantice> How do I run a program in wine ?
[06:06] <novaterata> lol oh, um Device Manager?
[06:07] <novaterata> thats where it says mine
[06:07] <novaterata> did you winecfg
[06:07] <Mantice> dw
[06:07] <grekkos> Ok i'm sorry i want afk a sec i donno if anybody answered my question
[06:07] <grekkos> ok nvm they didn't
[06:07] <avagant> hmmm.
[06:07] <avagant> guess i can't find beryl anyways.
[06:07] <grekkos> What's up with the Gaim on Ubuntu
[06:08] <grekkos> oh avagant try this guide
[06:08] <grekkos> let me get you the link
[06:08] <avagant> k
[06:08] <klerfayt> how to load psmouse rate=40 instead of 80 at start up?
[06:08] <grekkos> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php?title=Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/XGL&printable=yes#Graphic_Card_Drivers_and_3D_Video_Acceleration
[06:08] <zcat[1] > btw; I have a question; How can I get the ubuntu 6.10 bootdisk to recognise my raid array on a Compaq DL380 ? cpqarray conflicts with the 53C1510 driver. Can I tell the bootdisk kernel not to load the symbios module at boot?
[06:08] <grekkos> that tells you how to install beryl pretty nicely
[06:08] <amit> hey fellas, i am stuck up with a problem where the kernel doesn't load the required graphics module (savage)
[06:09] <zcat[1] > Err scratch that, 6.06 bootdisk (which has the same bug)
[06:09] <avagant> does it tell you how to find out which graphics card you have so you get the right one? haha

[06:13] <Lathiat> crimsun:
[06:13] <botxj> here we go again
[06:13] <botxj> lol
[06:13] <klerfayt> what's the reason?
[06:13] <botxj> botnet attack
[06:14] <botxj> did you guys piss somebody off?

[06:14] <B|nTaRa> :)
[06:14] <Byan> so
[06:14] <Byan> what exactly is happening?
[06:14] <nomin> this is the beginning of attacks on ubuntu
[06:14] <botxj> y'all definitely piss somebody off
[06:14] <BluR> someone is bored i guess
[06:14] <nomin> ubuntu is getting too popular
[06:14] <Lathiat> its called 'some idiot that likes <otherdistro> better'
[06:14] <Lathiat> move along, keep talking :)
[06:14] <botxj> this is a botnet attack
[06:14] <Byan> I know it's an attack
[06:14] <Byan> I mean
[06:14] <wastrel> Byan:  some jerk with too much time on his hands is trying to disrupt the channel
[06:14] <zcat[1] > btw; I have a question; How can I get the ubuntu 6.06 bootdisk to recognise raid on a Compaq DL380 ? cpqarray conflicts with the symbios driver which is loaded first. Is there something I can tell it at bootup so it won't load that module?
[06:14] <Byan> how is he doing it though
[06:14] <Madpilot> botxj, this isn't the first time; this channel is just a big target
[06:14] <goudkov> hi guys, is there a way to install a proper deb of firefox 2 on the dapper?
[06:14] <botxj> that's sad
[06:14] <jbroome> hey it's that guy again
[06:15] <wastrel> Byan:  this isn't the place to discuss methods :] 
[06:15] <nomin> it's like the southpark WoW episode
[06:15] <AfterDeath|idle> any ops around, join ##asb-nexus to see alerts about open proxies
[06:15] <botxj> so i guess we get to see the defence system of this network
[06:16] <botxj> i connect using mIRC

[06:20] <botxj> damn that must cause services to flood
[06:20] <Madpilot> neuro_, well, I could kickban, how about that?
[06:20] <neuro_> Madpilot: so now you're threatening me? :(
[06:20] <botxj> what is freenode's main channel?
[06:20] <botxj> #freenode ?

[06:27] <botxj> those stupid bots made my mIRC freeze
[06:27] <novaterata> oh so just cause i have xchat i'm ok?

[06:27] <heatxsink> hi guys, retarded question, but when I'm logged into my box, and I manually edit /etc/hostname by hand, when I try to log out, and log back in I can't SUDO anymore!!!  I can't remmeber how to change a hostname!!! Help!
[06:27] <botxj> aight Madpilot

[06:27] <novaterata> if you are on windows there is a free version of Xchat you have to search around for
[06:28] <Flannel> heatxsink: you'll need to use the recovery console to set them correctly

[06:28] <AsheD> Xchat is Linux :)
[06:28] <heatxsink> yup
[06:28] <heatxsink> did it
[06:28] <neuro_> don't have to search too hard
[06:28] <neuro_> www.silverex.org
[06:28] <novaterata> Xchat is everything
[06:28] <botxj> AsheD i did say they flooded me with CTCP Version requests
[06:28] <novaterata> mac or win too
[06:28] <wastrel> gnome has a GUI for changing hostname
[06:28] <novaterata> its the best on Max OS X
[06:28] <jrib> heatxsink: reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu (so you can edit /etc/hosts)
[06:28] <bimberi> heatxsink: you need to get into recovery mode and make sure /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname match
[06:28] <Madpilot> novaterata, far as I know, all versions of XChat are free...
[06:28] <AsheD> botxj:: yes, they did, but that by itself won't crash mIRC
[06:28] <neuro_> silverex does the win32 builds for x-chat that aren't shareware
[06:28] <aSt3raL_> my edgy quit working
[06:28] <Mez> bless xchat's network send queue
[06:28] <aSt3raL_> hangs on boot up
[06:28] <mattthebaker> irssi has been my fav since my gentoo livecd days
[06:28] <novaterata> Madpilot the official Windows XChat2 i think tis called is shareware
[06:28] <botxj> AsheD my mIRC didnt crash though just froze for a couple of minutes

[06:30] <nixternal> man i got owned during that crap
[06:30] <bimberi> heatxsink: np :)
[06:30] <aSt3raL_> what would cause edgy to freeze at the beginning of booting?
[06:30] <novaterata> a bad peripheral driver etc
[06:30] <bimberi> nixternal which irc client?
[06:31] <nixternal> jeesh the lag
[06:31] <novaterata> i used to have a toshiba satellite pro that would hang if the pcmcia was on
[06:31] <aSt3raL_> is there a way to see the boot items?
[06:31] <novaterata> or soemthing like that
[06:31] <aSt3raL_> its nice that edgy got rid of all that except when something goes wrong on boot you have no idea what the problem is

[06:32] <heatxsink> bimberi:  and via ssh
[06:32] <aSt3raL_> its in the grub settings?

[06:32] <nixternal> konversation, im filing a bug
[06:32] <jbroome> heatxsink: look at /etc/motd
[06:32] <Flannel> aSt3raL_: it's the boot options, you can set them in grub
[06:32] <aSt3raL_> how do i configure grub?
[06:32] <heatxsink> jbroome:  do I just delete everything?
[06:33] <bimberi> heatxsink: edit /etc/motd
[06:33] <Flannel> aSt3raL_: get to your grub menu, and inside grub you can edit 'e' the commands
[06:33] <jbroome> heatxsink: delete what you want.  i usually keep the first line w/the kernel ver
[06:34] <B|nTaRa> hmm

[06:34] <novaterata> did you know you can use cygwin in windows to chmod and rm pesky undeletable folders?

[06:35] <Lathiat> heatxsink: what garbage?
[06:35] <mattthebaker> ack... is the gnome shares tool worth messing with, or should i just edit smb.conf?

[06:45] <wastrel> prasys_:  check errors in your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[06:46] <prasys_> sure let me check
[06:46] <prasys_> is it because i need to allocate memory to UMA

[06:47] <maple1> does ubuntu have fluxbox in the repositories?
[06:49] <outRider> can someone briefly explain how ubuntu and its repos work? is it the case that packages on the official repos (main and restricted) wont be updated at all for edgy?
[06:49] <wastrel> !info fluxbox
[06:49] <ubotu> fluxbox: Highly configurable and low resource X11 Window manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.15.1+1.0rc2-1 (edgy), package size 899 kB, installed size 2888 kB
[06:49] <jrib> ivx: it's a wiki, after you register you should be able to edit (link at the top)
[06:51] <nalioth> outRider: they'll be updated for 18 months from the release date
[06:52] <neuro_> longer for dapper, natch
[06:52] <nalioth> outRider: dapper has a few years of support in front of it
[06:52] <ivx> jrib alright i'll see if i can swing it, thanks
[06:52] <prasys_> okay let me reboot
[06:53] <outRider> nalioth, so if new versions of say gnome or totem or nautilus come out ill see it on the edgy repo?
[06:53] <bimberi> outRider: main and restricted won't change in the "edgy" distro.  Security updates come through edgy-security and others through edgy-updates
[06:53] <wastrel> yeah that, security updates only on the current distro, upgrade in 6months for new software
[06:53] <nalioth> outRider: security updates for certain, not so sure about all updates
[06:54] <nalioth> outRider: i suspect you'll be looking at the next release for "the latest and greatest"

[06:54] <outRider> does that include device drivers?

[07:37] <Mantice> Can some one help me edit my Grub boot file ?
[07:37] <xenon> hi
[07:37] <t3m17> hi
[07:37] <WerdnaDesktop> Mantice: nano <nameoffile>
[07:37] <Mantice> It does it by defult and I cant stop it.
[07:38] <Mantice> I can only join when it says network is busy cant do a list or somthing like that.
[07:38] <Jordan_U> t3m17: All I know is that shutdown isn't available becasue you are using seperate sessions and gnome can't access GDM ( so it is a problem that everyone with XGL installed as a session has including me ), I don't know if there is a way to fix it, but try #ubuntu-xgl
[07:38] <Mantice> I am editing the grub config file I just dont know what to do.
[07:39] <Jordan_U> Mantice: What are you trying to do ?
[07:39] <Jordan_U> Mantice: specifically
[07:39] <Mantice> I have a IDE HD and I have 2 SATA HD's called sda1 and sdb1. I want to boot windows off sda1.
[07:40] <sin> my Beryl XGL works just fine
[07:40] <Kaiyang> hi need help on Networking.. Please view http://sg.geocities.com/legendary616/
[07:40] <squeee> How do I set up an nfsroot?
[07:40] <Mantice> and I boot off my IDE one btw.
[07:40] <Kaiyang> How to make my Apache on PC 2 and PC 3 Accessible to public?
[07:40] <noodles12> my volume buttons on my keyboard change the volume of the microphone. How do i make it change the main volume? I change the preferences and all it does is change which vol is shown in the taskbar.
[07:41] <Jordan_U> Mantice: maybe #grub?
[07:41] <stegel> Jordan_U do you have any suggestions?
[07:41] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  you'd have to portmap to the 2 machines behind the NAT box.
[07:41] <stegel> Kaiyang, i don't suggest asking homework questions on IRC...usually get a lot of sh*t for that
[07:41] <Kaiyang> Sorry I am a newbie in networking. Cannot understand what u mean Wastrel
[07:42] <Kaiyang> No... I am runing ubuntu server on PC 2
[07:42] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  your internet provider only gave you one IP address.
[07:42] <Jordan_U> stegel: Possibly to try to install gconf to try to get gconf-schemas ( whatever that is ) back so the removal script doesn't complain.
[07:42] <Kaiyang> and I cant make it accessiable
[07:42] <Kaiyang> Yes i only have 1 IP
[07:42] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  so you can only assign that IP address to one of your computers.
[07:43] <wastrel> the other 2 can't be reached
[07:43] <Mantice> Any any one else help every one is sleeping in #grub
[07:43] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  there's a way to get around this - sortof - using portmapping
[07:43] <Kaiyang> How do I do that?
[07:43] <Kaiyang> portmapping?
[07:43] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  but it's not the same as having direct access.
[07:43] <Kaiyang> example?
[07:44] <WerdnaDesktop> Where can I find a tutorial of some description for DCOM (controlling Kaffeine, amaroK, Konversation, et al)
[07:44] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  portmapping is when the router recieves a request from the internet on a specific port, it knows to send it to a specific machine on the LAN.
[07:44] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  for example, a connection from the internet on port 25 would be sent to a mail server on the LAN
[07:45] <stegel> thanks Jordan_U
[07:45] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  but it's not going to work for multiple web servers, because they all need port 80
[07:45] <squeee> How do i set up an nfs root?
[07:45] <Kaiyang> I see I have web servers for PC... port 80 for apache, and port 8080 for TOMCAT
[07:45] <Kaiyang> PC1
[07:46] <Mantice> fdisk -i dont work for info about hard drives any other commands ?
[07:46] <Kaiyang> Does that seems the same?
=== WerdnaDesktop is now known as Werdnum
[07:47] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  yes, webservers normally use port 80 , and 8080 is also common
[07:47] <sin> if i install XFCE on Ubuntu can i choose from the sessions between Gnome and XFCE before i login?
[07:47] <wastrel> sin:  yes i think so
[07:47] <Jordan_U> sin: yes.
[07:47] <sin> ok
[07:47] <Kaiyang> So I do I portmap?
[07:47] <Kaiyang> Need any software?
[07:47] <sin> anyone also able to run Beryl/XGL in xfce too?
[07:48] <Jordan_U> sin: I know it can be done, but I don't know how, try #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl
[07:48] <sin> ok..
[07:48] <Jordan_U> sin: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[07:49] <sin> its that easy?
[07:49] <sin> :-P
[07:49] <sin> darn!
[07:49] <wastrel> Kaiyang:  You can find it in your router config.  if you want to connect from the internet to pc2, you'll have to set up a router on pc1 also
[07:49] <Jordan_U> sin: Yup, are you on edgy?
[07:49] <sin> yea
[07:49] <khalsa> Hello: Linux newbiw (complete). Just installed ubuntu. Used synaptic to install some stuff. Then I saw Automatix thing. Was running automatix when accidentally unplugged computer. Now synaptic/automatix/update thing all fail and dont work. Tried "fix broken packages" in synaptic--no good. Tried sudu apt-get install -f -- no good. Seems to have Failed on installation of VLC. Unable to remove or add those packages. Help?
=== linuxboy_ is now known as linuxboy
[07:50] <Flannel> khalsa: stay away from automatix.  With your current state, you're probably better off reinstalling
[07:50] <Jordan_U> sin: Ok, if you want to ever remove XFCE and all the programs that came with it, run: sudo apt-get autoremove xubuntu-desktop
[07:50] <wastrel> !automatix
[07:50] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[07:50] <Kaiyang> well my modem is a router gateway
[07:50] <Kaiyang> not sure is there such feature
[07:50] <Mantice> Any one here have exprence with grub and windows xp and sata hard drives /
[07:50] <khalsa> oh.. ok. That's unfortunate. Thanks
[07:50] <Flannel> khalsa: automatix is unfortunate ;)
[07:51] <khalsa> second question: I want to play the game Tremulous, what do I need to install other than the game itself to play? (opengl?)
[07:51] <Axidus> c
[07:51] <sin> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[07:51] <Axidus> Has anyone worked with samba
[07:51] <Axidus> I need help setting up my xp and ubuntu
[07:51] <Mez> argh
[07:51] <Kaiyang> Does Port Forwarding means the same for port mapping?

[07:51] <Mez> whats the package to install to get the ATI control panel?
[07:52] <dorto> whenever ubuntu boots, I am getting "Internal error failed to initialize HAL" dialog box. USB pen drives are not automatically mounted anymore!
[07:52] <dorto> any way to fix this?
[07:52] <Axidus> not a dual boot , I need to network both boxes together
[07:52] <ircm0nkey> hi guys
[07:52] <Axidus> but I cant seem to get samba going
[07:52] <charle97> dorto, do you any cds in your drives?
[07:52] <Axidus> I see the network on my ubuntu box but not on my xp box
[07:52] <Jordan_U> khalsa: If you have your graphics card set up, just:  sudo apt-get install tremulous
[07:52] <wastrel> sin:  make sure you have universe enabled
[07:52] <charle97> dorto, have*
[07:53] <grekkos> can anyone tell me the command to change my hotkeys?
[07:53] <sin> hmm how do i double check that
[07:53] <grekkos> everytime I hit shift and backspace x restarts
[07:53] <sin> i thought i had it
[07:53] <grekkos> lol
[07:53] <Flannel> grekkos: #ubuntu-xgl (it's an XGL thing)
[07:53] <grekkos> oh it is
[07:53] <dorto> charle97, CDs are not getting mounted either
[07:53] <grekkos> ok
[07:53] <grekkos> Flannel: thansk, i wasn't sure
[07:53] <khalsa> Jordan_U: I dont think i have graphics card setup. I dont even know what kind of graphics card I have (looks ok though)
[07:53] <Axidus> has anyone worked with samba before?
[07:53] <charle97> dorto, but at startup do you have any cds in your drives?
[07:54] <sin> wastrel, how do i check that again
[07:54] <dorto> charle97, no, not always
[07:54] <Kaiyang> Is port forwarding the same as port mapping?
[07:54] <Mantice> I need help with grub any one ?
[07:54] <dorto> charle97, but a USB hard disk is attached while the system boots
[07:54] <wastrel> sin grep universe /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:54] <charle97> dorto, maybe you should remove that before you boot
[07:54] <Fulcrum> i thought it'd be larger
[07:55] <Jordan_U> khalsa: what is the output of: glxinfo | grep direct ?
[07:55] <dorto> charle97, ok, will try removing all removable devices and try to boot ubuntu like that
[07:55] <grekkos> Flannel: do you know off-hand how to fix that XGL bug?
[07:55] <sin> should i uncomment all of them
[07:55] <Jordan_U> khalsa: If yes, your graphics are set up.
[07:55] <Commander-Crowe> hey um...I want to get a wireless card...any recommandations?
[07:55] <Fulcrum> anyone have any idea why server is smaller?
[07:55] <sin> because it doesnt need X etc
[07:55] <|thunder> Fulcrum; no X11
[07:55] <Lathiat> Fulcrum: because it doesnt have as many packages on it
[07:56] <Fulcrum> alrighty, k thanx
[07:56] <charle97> no gnome
[07:56] <Lathiat> Fulcrum: its no real difference to the 'alternate' cd functionally, but it just includies a bunch of server-related packages on the cd
[07:56] <wastrel> i like me some alternate
[07:56] <Commander-Crowe> I want to get a wireless card...any recommandations?
[07:56] <wastrel> why boot x just to run an installer?
[07:56] <Flannel> grekkos: nope.  I have no GUI, thus no XGL.  I just know it's an XGL thing.  they should be able to help you.
[07:56] <Mantice> Any one know how to configure grub with another drive ????????????
[07:57] <khalsa> Jordan_U: glxinfo: http://pastebin.ca/244835
[07:57] <grekkos> Flannel: ok thanks anyway ;)
[07:57] <|thunder> Commander-Crowe; dont repeat. I have a linksys wmp54G ver4. works great live even
[07:57] <sin> wastrel, should i just uncomment everything with universe in the line ?
[07:57] <Mantice> This is taking to long. I dont want to have to change my boot order in the bios every time just cos I cant get grub working.
[07:57] <wastrel> sin:  back up the working copy first
[07:57] <Jordan_U> khalsa: Then your graphics aren't set up completely ( no direct rendering / 3D support )
[07:58] <sin> kk
[07:58] <dorto> Commander-Crowe, linksys wusb54g also works with ndiswrapper but you better check it out to be sure
[07:58] <sin> but is that what i want to do
[07:58] <sin> uncomment all of those, or everything in the file?
[07:58] <khalsa> Jordan_U: ah, ok. "grep direct" just sit's there
[07:58] <wastrel> sin:  if you want multiverse you can uncommend those too.
[07:58] <khalsa> Jordan_U: so is there a guide or instructions on how to go about doing that (once i've re-installed it seems)
[07:58] <Mantice> how do I make grub auto configure my windows drive...... ?
[07:58] <wastrel> but yes, uncommend universe , i guess xubuntu-desktop has some dependencies in universe.
[07:59] <Jordan_U> khalsa: That is because it wasn't supposed to be run seperately, it's OK to quit it though :)
[07:59] <Flannel> wastrel: that doesn't make any sense.  Whcih version of ubuntu? sin?
[07:59] <sin> Edgy
[07:59] <Jordan_U> Mantice: sudo update-grub ( back up your grub.conf first )
[07:59] <sin> im not sure the diff from multi and uni... i need to read up again, been a while since i read the docs haha
[08:00] <khalsa> Jordan_U: oh: here is the output when run properly: direct rendering: No

[08:00] <ubotu> khalsa: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:00] <sin> just not sure which i need to install XFCE
[08:00] <sin> i guess universe only right
[08:00] <sin> so just uncomment every line with universe in it ?
[08:00] <baxter_kylie> What's the official name of the screen with the splash image and statusbar during boot?
[08:01] <Majic> I don't really like Xfce.  GNOME is way better.
[08:01] <Majic> XFCE just runs faster and more efficiently.
[08:01] <Jordan_U> If this produces output you have an ATI card: lspci | grep radeon
[08:01] <wastrel> sin:  yes
[08:01] <sin> ok sweet... i wanna try Beryl/XGl on xfce :-P
[08:01] <wastrel> Jordan_U:  grep -i
[08:01] <khalsa> ubotu: thank you, seems like I have an Nvidia
[08:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thank you, seems like I have an Nvidia - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:02] <wastrel> khalsa:  not necessarily

[08:02] <Majic> heh
[08:02] <WWade> i saw some xgl video shit on youtube and i was wondering if anyone could tell me the system requirements to run that xgl shit good
[08:02] <khalsa> outsmarted by the bot
[08:02] <wastrel> khalsa:  lspci |grep VGA

[08:03] <WWade> ok thanks.. sorry about the language
[08:03] <khalsa> wastrel: that's a good thing I hope?
[08:03] <Jordan_U> khalsa: Ok, follow the nvidia instructions.
[08:03] <Majic> I am running Xubuntu right now.  I didn't like Xfce because you couldn't select multiple files on the desktop by clicking and dragging over them.  I installed GNOME on Xubuntu and switched sessions.

[08:03] <Jordan_U> khalsa: Yes, nvidia has very good linux support

[08:03] <Majic> Feels more like home, now. :p
[08:03] <khalsa> Jordan_U: ok will-do. I will re-install, then get nvidia drivers running
[08:03] <sin> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[08:04] <wastrel> hm
[08:04] <wastrel> you may have a broken package somewhere causing trouble
[08:04] <Majic> Also, the network manager and battery applet work way better in GNOME.
[08:04] <Jordan_U> sin: Try 'apt-get -f install'
[08:04] <khalsa> Also: I was very happy to see that my pci wireless card worked as soon as I put it in the computer
[08:04] <fnf> Hi, I'm installing the nvidia binary blob, it said I didn't have the libc package so the installation failed, do you have any suggestion for that ?. What "libc" package should I install ?.
[08:04] <sin> sudo apt-get -f install xubuntu-desktop ?
[08:04] <khalsa> just had to install "network manager" to get WPA and all was good.
[08:04] <sin> or just sudo apt-get -f install

[08:06] <Mantice> That did not work my grub did not boot windows.
[08:06] <michaels_> what package gives me rar support?
[08:07] <ircm0nkey> can anyone give me their opinion on whether i should install a duel boot for windows and ubuntu or just say screw everything in windows and just install ubuntu by itself?

[08:07] <dfgas_> edgy sucks, it wants me to remove ubuntu-desktop just to install vmwareplayer
[08:07] <dfgas_> is there a way around this
[08:07] <wastrel> ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage, not required
[08:07] <Flannel> dfgas_: "ubuntu-desktop" is just a meta package.  vmwareplayer must conflict with something in ubuntu-desktop
[08:07] <what_if> michaels_: rar & unrar
[08:07] <Mantice> I didn't think it would take hours just to configure grub.
[08:07] <SilentDis> hello :)
[08:07] <JonBoon> ircm0nkey,  unless you use a few windows only apps daily, just go with ubuntu
[08:07] <dfgas_> Flannel, meta package?
[08:08] <Flannel> !metapackage | dfgas_
[08:08] <ubotu> dfgas_: A meta-package is a package that simply depends upon other packages and brings them in. It's not a real package, but a very useful package that can drag in other package versions.
[08:08] <wastrel> JonBoon:  you mean the trash can applet on the gnome panel?
[08:08] <JonBoon> yes wastrel
[08:08] <Mantice> Can any one help me with grub ????
[08:08] <dfgas_> hmmm
[08:08] <ircm0nkey> i can live without windows
[08:09] <dfgas_> Flannel, there was other things too it wanted to remove, checking now
[08:09] <wastrel> JonBoon:  you can add it back like you'd add any applet to your panel - right-click the panel and choose "add to panel"
[08:09] <Mantice> I need to boot windows :( but I cant because grub = requires configuring and I dont know how to
[08:09] <dfgas_> Flannel, gaim, and libdbus
[08:09] <Flannel> dfgas_: chances are it conflicted with one thing, which is required for ubuntu-desktop, which means when that thing goes, you don't have the full requirements for u-d, which means it needs ot be removed
[08:09] <Mantice> Is their any way I can find more info about my SATA drives and what HD they are called.
[08:09] <dfgas_> Flannel, it didn't do this in dapper
[08:10] <JonBoon> ooohh so what folder do i find the trashcan in?
[08:10] <Flannel> dfgas_: vmwareplayer isn't in the repositories, so... I have no idea.
[08:10] <SilentDis> Mantice:  while I probably won't be much assistance, a description of the particular problem would probably lead to more offers of assistance :)
[08:10] <dfgas_> Flannel, vmwareplayer is
[08:10] <grekkos> is Mplayer still available on repos?
[08:10] <SilentDis> JonBoon: ~/.trash

[08:15] <wastrel> Mantice:  i dunno from sata
[08:15] <Healot> !find gnupg
[08:15] <ubotu> Found: gnupg, gnupg-doc, python-gnupginterface, gnupg-agent, gnupg2 (and 3 others)
[08:15] <Jordan_U> grodius: PowerPC, mac, it must have been somebody else I am remembering.
[08:16] <dfgas_> Flannel, Jordan_U, you guys get that?
[08:16] <Mantice> wastrel: It use to work on the old distro's but now it dont :(
[08:16] <grodius> Jordan_U: no, not me. Im using a Dell laptop. but yeah Im having a big proble
[08:16] <Jordan_U> dfgas_: Yes, it looks fine.
[08:16] <grodius> Jordan_U: Do u think u could help?
[08:16] <wastrel> Mantice:  do you know the drive numbers?
[08:17] <Flannel> dfgas_: yeah... odd.  I have no idea where vmwareplayer came from.  ah.  It's vmware-player, but I still don't see where it would conflict.
[08:17] <Mantice> wastrel: I have them mounted in linux how do I get their names ?
[08:17] <wastrel> Mantice:  df
[08:17] <Jordan_U> grodius: possibly, what kind of card do you have?
[08:17] <grodius> Jordan_U: an intel card
[08:18] <grodius> Jordan_U: IT says the drivers cant be found
[08:18] <wwweasel> I'd like to change the association when I double click an audio cd on my desktop. I don't want it to open sound-juicer. Any ideas please?
[08:18] <Flannel> wwweasel: right click the icon, there's an option
[08:18] <dfgas_> anyone use fliterproxy?
[08:19] <dfgas_> filterproxy
[08:19] <wwweasel> Flannel: If there is, I am blind. I see "Open", and I have explored all through "Properties"
[08:19] <Mantice> /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1
[08:19] <Mantice> wastrel: /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1
[08:19] <wastrel> wwweasel:  properties > open with  at least in my gnome... :] 
[08:20] <wastrel> Mantice:  ok halfway there
[08:20] <wwweasel> wastrel: I am aware of that for files. Try that with a CD. Not there
[08:20] <grodius> Does anyone know of a way to reinstall Edgy
[08:20] <wastrel> ah a CD
[08:20] <Mantice> wastrel: by the way my hard drive is on sda1
[08:20] <grodius> I dont want to wipe my harddrive but I want to reinstall Edgy without the CD
[08:20] <wastrel> i dunno  that might be the alternatives system.
[08:20] <Majic> You don't have to wipe your drive to reinstall...
[08:21] <Flannel> wwweasel: check the "preffered application" dialog, or whatever it's currently called
[08:21] <wastrel> Mantice:  well i don't play around with grub too much so I always forget how to do the drive numbers.
[08:21] <wastrel> sec.
[08:21] <Flannel> wwweasel: it just starts at 0 instead of 1 (or 0 instead of a)
[08:21] <grodius> Majic: How bout tell me HOW instead of telling me something I already know
[08:22] <wwweasel> Flannel: It's not in preferred application
[08:22] <Majic> I'd rather not, you seem kind of forceful. :p
[08:22] <wwweasel> Flannel; I don't get the thing about 0s, 1s and a's
[08:22] <Majic> *I know it's possible, but I don't know exactly how.*
[08:22] <Mantice> wastrel I changed my root to rootnoverify lets see if that helps.
[08:22] <Flannel> wwweasel: then I have no idea.  I suppose you might have to update-aternatives, but I dont know what you'd update
[08:22] <grodius> Majic: Actually, I was just asking for help, you wanna be a dick just dont talk to me
[08:23] <wastrel> Mantice:  so sda1 would be (hd0,0)  and sdb1 would be (hd1,0)  i think.  what do you have in there for your linux drive?
[08:23] <Majic> 0.o  I wasn't trying to be a dick, but as long as you're calling me one I'll call you one too. ;p
[08:23] <Majic> Oh yeah..."dick!"
[08:23] <Mantice> wastrel: but my IDE HD is hd0
[08:23] <grodius> 'you dont have to wipe your harddrive to install linux...' Ok- I never said that, but thanks for the help
[08:23] <Flannel> wwweasel: hda1, with a and 1 being the important things.  the former (letter) gives you the location (primary IDE master, slave, seconary master, slave are a b c d etc).  then the number (1+) is the partition number.  In grub, all numbering starts at 0.  so, hda1 would be (hd0,0) hdb3 would be hd1,2, etc.

[08:24] <wastrel> Flannel:  what about sda1 , sdb1
[08:25] <grodius> Is there anyone who can help me, im trying to re install linux without a disk.
[08:25] <Majic> grodius:  Sorry for telling you that it's possible and not helping.  It's just, I know that it's possible but I don't know exactly help.  Best of luck with your problem.
[08:25] <Majic> ..exactly how to do it.*
[08:25] <grodius> Majic: ok thanks then
[08:27] <nol13> i heard fedora core is better than ubuntu, is this true?
[08:27] <Flannel> wastrel: they all get mushed together.  hd0 could be the IDE or the SATA, depending on how your BIOS sees them (in order that theyre listed in BIOS)
[08:27] <BeanBag> what is the purpose of the chroot and fakeroot command?
[08:28] <wastrel> nol13:  we like all linux.  fedora, ubuntu, slackware, etc.  big happy family <3
[08:28] <progek> Hello, has anyone here ever used tomcat? I don't have a problem setting this up, just need advice.
[08:28] <charle97> wastrel, including suse?
[08:28] <Healot> BeanBag: to jail a program into a different run-time library i.e running 32-bit programs libraries in a 64-bit environment
[08:28] <dorto> nol13, depends on what one is looking in a distribution
[08:29] <wastrel> charle97:  never tried suse myself.
[08:29] <dorto> BeanBag: chroot allows to change to a different installation and work as if you have booted into that installation
[08:29] <Healot> I hate German distroes :)
[08:29] <nol13> vastrel: cool, what about BSD though?
[08:30] <dorto> suse 10.1 was too buggy, they released a 'remastered' version recently to fix it up
[08:30] <Jordan_U> Healot: Warum?
[08:30] <dorto> BSD ship a bit old software, but they are rock-solid
[08:30] <dorto> installation is not trivial either
[08:31] <dorto> progek, what advice do you want regarding tomcat?
[08:31] <Fulcrum> how can i setup my 3 port router to work as a switch?
[08:31] <Healot> Jordan_U: SuSE << German :)
[08:31] <srf21c> if any of you are using Gaim to connect to this IRC channel, and you want to find a way to suppress all the enter/leave room messages, install the gaim-extendedprefs plugin There's an option in there to disable these annoying "noise" messages.
[08:31] <Fulcrum> i was thinking just use in port one and out port 2
[08:31] <Fulcrum> but thats not working
[08:31] <nol13> dorto: so is there really any difference really other than package management and defaults and stuff? does redhat really add anything into RHEL other than support or what?
[08:31] <eternalswd> how can I mount one folder to another location?
[08:32] <srf21c> I was asking how to do this this earlier and nobody was able to help.  :(
[08:32] <progek> dorto: Thanks, well for a while I have been using apache for static pages but I am now getting into tomcat utilizing java servlets/JavaServer pages and was wondering If I could dump apache and use tomcat as also my http server but with servlets as well?
[08:32] <Jordan_U> Good night everybody.
[08:32] <Healot> nol13: some proprietary apps, yes
[08:33] <progek> basically, can I use tomcat like a web server too?
=== neil is now known as neil__
[08:33] <dorto> nol13, I see fedora's biggest limitation to be its package manager
[08:33] <progek> nol13: I would agree since i tried FC6 for a few weeks
[08:33] <dorto> you get a big, monolithic installation with a 6CD or 2DVD disk set and then the package manager keeps crashing the system if you try to install additional stuff
[08:34] <dorto> it might take another year or two for yum to get stabilised
[08:34] <SilentDis> all distros are good for someone.  look at slackware.  there's gotta be 2... 3 users or so of that!  *giggle*
[08:34] <BeanBag> is there anyone here form cape town in south africa?
[08:34] <neil__> dorto: oh, it's improved then :)
[08:34] <wastrel> that's always been redhat's weakness ( compared to debian-based distros)
[08:34] <grekkos> SilentDis: most linux users I know are on Slack ;)
[08:34] <wastrel> it's great if you only need to install one or 2 extra things.
[08:34] <pc3> das
[08:34] <pc3> das
[08:34] <SilentDis> grekkos: i know, that was the joke ;)
[08:34] <dorto> progek, only someone with good knowledge of both Apache and Tomcat can answer that I guess
[08:34] <grekkos> heheh
[08:35] <wastrel> but for desktop use, installing lots of extra software... forget about it
[08:35] <progek> ok thanks dorto
[08:35] <dorto> I never used tomcat for static web hosting
[08:35] <grekkos> i'm going to bed
[08:35] <grekkos> I'm pretty satisfied with Edgy right now
[08:35] <Fulcrum> so um, isn't there a way to setup a router as a switch?  I 4 Got
[08:35] <nol13> so these rethat proprietary apps, they cant get incorperated into other dists or other dists just dont want to? centOS has them though right?
[08:36] <dorto> CentOS takes the sources from RHEL repository if am not wrong
[08:36] <Flannel> progek: tomcat sits ontop of apache, to run JSP stuff, it's equivalent to installing PHP, or whatever else.
[08:36] <dorto> fedora is different
[08:36] <SilentDis> grekkos: g'night.  don't let the bed bugs maul you :)
[08:36] <dorto> but tomcat can run on its own too, and serve HTML files
[08:37] <neil__> dorto: so can php ;)
[08:37] <progek> Flannel: Thanks, but I mean, right now I have a port open for apache http server and also a port open for tomcat (8080) I use apache http for static pages and I have been creating servlets in tomcat. I notice that in apache you place the index.html in /var/www, but what about tomcat?
[08:37] <dorto> <SilentDis> look at slackware.  there's gotta be 2... 3 users or so of that! <-- LOL! I am one of them ;)
[08:37] <neil__> SilentDis: don't be. anjuta is totally hosed, that's all ;)
[08:38] <Mantice> Any one grub expert ?
[08:38] <kholerabbit> how do I mount partitions on the edgy livecd? there is no "disks" item in the menu..
[08:38] <Mantice> Or is their somthing better than grub ?
[08:38] <SilentDis> i don't think my ximeta netdisk works under edgy yet.  barely got it working under dapper, had to compile it locally, as i'm running the k7 core.
[08:38] <Healot> Mantice: developer perhaps
[08:38] <Flannel> progek: you don't need to have a port open for tomcat, it can interface via apache.  Of course, you cna also run it on it's own
[08:38] <dorto> neil__, any application server can host HTML pages too, just slower
[08:38] <SilentDis> lol neil
[08:39] <Mantice> Every one seams to hate configuring grub
[08:39] <progek> Flannel: I was thinking of running it on its own, as a static web server and servlet/JSP container.. so this is possible?
[08:39] <tmpvar> hrm, xgl..
[08:39] <Flannel> progek: tomcat will require your 'static' html pages to be compiled just like any other.  you'll just have a file with a bunch of printish commands
[08:39] <Healot> Mantice: what problem you encounter whike configuring GRUB>?
[08:39] <Mantice> My hard drive dont boot.
[08:39] <progek> Mantice: run live cd, mount hd and reinstall grub
[08:40] <Mantice> I dont have cd.
[08:40] <dorto> progek, it is possible, but people don't recommend such a configuration for production use
[08:40] <kholerabbit> anybody know how I can mount an ntfs partition on edgy livecd?
[08:40] <Flannel> Mantice: how did you install ubuntu?
[08:40] <progek> I see, thanks dorto
[08:40] <progek> I will just use apache with tomcat then
[08:40] <Mantice> I had a cd then.
[08:40] <dorto> progek, for development purposes it should be fine
[08:40] <progek> Mantice, can you download the iso and burn it?
[08:40] <Mantice> Ive been upgrading over the years
[08:41] <nol13> so what are peoples feelings on the best office suit for linux?
[08:41] <Flannel> nol13: that'd be a perfect question for #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:41] <Mantice> progek: Right now New Zealand is having a broadband crisis. some of us cant download faster than 3 kb's on our broadband lines.
[08:41] <dorto> Mantice, if you can't download and burn a live cd, wait for one of the IT magazines to ship a free GNU/Linux live cd. It's flavour of the season these days ;)
[08:41] <nol13> fine...
[08:42] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  you know, i've never tried that.  should be sudo mount /dev/hdxx /media/location -t ntfs
[08:42] <Flannel> Mantice: you can also grab a (smaller) super grub disk.
[08:42] <user07lux> tonnyuda@yahoo.co.uk
[08:42] <progek> Mantice: or you can use ubuntus shipit for dapper :D but you may want to get grub fixed sometime sooner
[08:42] <Mantice> I dont want to download another cd image.
[08:43] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: Thanks, I'll try. The Dapper livecd just had a System>Administration>Disks app, where you just clicked "mount" but I can't seem to find that..
[08:43] <Mantice> I have dapper disks but I have edgy.
[08:43] <progek> you can still use the live cd though
[08:43] <progek> then open a terminal and mount the hd
[08:43] <Mantice> and I dont really want to reinstall my os just for grub.
[08:43] <progek> even though it's dapper
[08:43] <Flannel> Mantice: you don't need to reinstall the entire OS
[08:43] <progek> you don't have to reinstall the os, just grub
[08:43] <Flannel> !grub | Mantice
[08:43] <ubotu> Mantice: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[08:43] <Flannel> the first link there
[08:44] <Mantice> Should I explain my problem first ?
[08:44] <progek> there is a how to on the ubuntu forums for reparing grub with the live cd
[08:44] <SilentDis> kholerabbit: nt.  not sure what's on/not on the edgy disk, just got mine in the mail... VERY wary to put it in and try to upgrade :P
[08:44] <Flannel> progek: there's a howto on that page, probably better htan the forums one.
[08:44] <Flannel> Mantice: sure.
[08:44] <dorto> Mantice, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[08:45] <progek> oops, didn't see that message you posted
[08:45] <Mantice> I have IDE HD = Ubuntu SATA1 = Windows boot drive NTFS = SATA2 = NTFS storage
[08:45] <harmental> hey everybody...
[08:45] <Mantice> I want to boot the windows drive.
[08:45] <harmental> what is the correct ligne for the fstab when mounting a fat32 disk (iocharset, nls and codepage options)
[08:45] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: haha, yeah My monitor stopped working a while ago so I am just using a friends laptop, just using the livecd of edgy
[08:45] <Flannel> Mantice: that would be either hd0,0 or hd1,0.  Whichever isn't your ubuntu one (it depends on how your BIOS reads the drives)
[08:46] <kholerabbit> whats the terminal command for creating a foldeR?
[08:46] <Flannel> kholerabbit: mkdir
[08:46] <kholerabbit> cheers
[08:46] <Mantice> Grub says windows is in HD1 but when I select it it says error code 23 24
[08:46] <midgetg0at> Wine error after nVidia update: Error: API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module has the version 1.0-8762, but this client has the version 1.0-8776.  Please make sure that the kernel module and all NVIDIA driver components have the same version.
[08:46] <Mantice> 23 or 24.
[08:46] <midgetg0at> Anyone know the fix? It crashes Steam.
[08:46] <SilentDis> question - is it even possible to perform an upgrade dapper > edgy with the 6.10 desktop cd?
[08:46] <Flannel> Mantice: pastebin your boot.lst please (/etc/grub/boot.lst)
[08:46] <progek> SilentDis: you can upgrade without a cd from dapper
[08:46] <SilentDis> i'm stuck on dialup, i live in the boonies, so large downloads scare me :P
[08:47] <progek> oh I see
[08:47] <Mantice> Sure.,
[08:47] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: Not as far as I know, you need an alternative cd, fast internet, or the dvd which I think has all the cd put on one (Desktop, Server, alternative...)
[08:47] <midgetg0at> No one know wine issues?
[08:47] <Flannel> kholerabbit: there is no "alternate" installation, just desktop or the guiless server.  And yes, the alternate has that, and it also is a repository with additional packages.
[08:48] <xukun> hi all. If I want to watch movie trailers like the one in apple.com/trailers then I see a window displaying the message "no video" anyone has an idea?
[08:48] <xukun> I,m using firefox
[08:48] <SilentDis> kholerabbit: thanks.   I don't mind paying a few bucks for a CD to be shipped to me, especially if a bit goes back to the project :)
[08:48] <dorto> xukun: you might need flash 9 beta for linux package, google for it
[08:48] <Mantice> Flannel: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30815/
[08:48] <ruxpin> how can I install 'php4-cups' - apt-get refuses
[08:49] <xukun> dorto, thanks I will
[08:49] <Mantice> Flannel: I changed root to rootnoverify and it still dident work.
[08:49] <nol13> flash 9 has been having a few hiccups for me, sometimes after a pause it wont play anymore and sound is hit or miss(alsa prob?)
[08:49] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: do you know a command for listing the available drives I can mount?
[08:50] <cge> Why can't I join #ubuntu+1?
[08:50] <SilentDis> lol.  xm radio Lucy on... their bumper:  "lucy, alternative rock from when MTV played videos... to when it taught your teenage daughter to be a slut. ROFL
[08:50] <Flannel> cge: because it doesn't exist at the moment
[08:50] <lakupuu> evo
[08:50] <cge> Flannel: Err, I'm running it right now?
[08:50] <Flannel> cge: feisty?
[08:50] <cge> Flannel: yes
[08:51] <Flannel> cge: the channel still redirects people to #ubuntu, because edgy was just released.  No idea when the channel will be opened again.
[08:51] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  i BELIEVE ubuntu is smart enough to discard missing hds in the /dev folder.  so a quick ls /dev/hd* should be sufficient
[08:51] <cge> Flannel: Ok, thanks. I just wanted to know if anyone knew how fontconfig chooses its aliases
[08:52] <BHSPitLappy> any tips for when sound stops working?
[08:52] <BHSPitLappy> tried killing artsd and esd.
[08:52] <BHSPitLappy> it's bad enough where in Banshee, a song doesn't even progress.
[08:53] <Mantice> Flannel: do you know whats wrong ?
[08:53] <Flannel> Mantice: nope.  Everything looks reasonable.  Which error do you get?
[08:53] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: that problem is that there is hda, hda1, hda2, hda3, hda4, hda5, hda6, hdb... and there should only be 2 partitions..
[08:54] <Mantice> error code 23 / 24 im not to sure it said somthing about a number.
[08:54] <Flannel> Mantice: well, which is it?  That's an important thing ;).  reboot, try it, write down the error, etc
[08:55] <Mantice> 23 : Error while parsing number This error is returned if GRUB was expecting to read a number and encountered bad data.
[08:55] <zidoen> i have a "bouce keys problem" similar to the one in: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25574 - except i don't have a toshiba but a Dell.. Anybody know what might fix the problem there, since there's no "psmouse" mod in /etc/modules
[08:56] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  it's not discarding them then.  had that same thing on my DSL box (crappy little laptop).  let me poke a bit...
[08:56] <blueone> how can i access a windows share from bash? i can access it from from the UI. (thanks)
[08:56] <Mantice> Flannel: its 23.
[08:57] <Flannel> Mantice: ah, those map lines... where you have (hd) make that (hd0)
[08:57] <loutrine> During the installation of Samba 3.0.22 on Ubuntu Edgy Eft, I received this output http://pastebin.com/821005 is that normal?
[08:57] <Mantice> Flannel: both of them ?
[08:57] <loutrine> (I asked on samba but It's very quiet atm...)
[08:58] <kholerabbit> ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/hdb /media/location -t ntfs
[08:58] <kholerabbit> mount: block device /dev/hdb is write-protected, mounting read-only
[08:58] <kholerabbit> mount: /dev/hdb already mounted or /media/location busy
[08:58] <kholerabbit> woops...
[08:58] <Flannel> Mantice: yeah, you're swapping hd1 and hd0, because windows likes to think it's always on the first hd
[08:58] <Mantice> Flannel: I see what about rootnoverify ? should I change that back to root ?
[08:58] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  you need to specify the partition.  mount /dev/hdb1 /media/location
[08:59] <kholerabbit> if I add the "1" I get: mount: special device /dev/hdb1 does not exist
[09:00] <Flannel> Mantice: yeah, switch tta back
[09:00] <SilentDis> blueone: if you have the full samba package installed, you should have a command called smbmount, i believe
[09:00] <Mantice> Flannel: here it goes :)
[09:01] <SilentDis> blueone:  if you're missing samba.... sudo apt-get install samba.  then you should have everything you need to mount that share :)
[09:02] <neil__> SilentDis: is smbmount in samba or something like smbutils/smbtools?
[09:04] <neil__> SilentDis: it's in package smbfs
[09:04] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: haha,  sudo mount /dev/hda5 /media/location -t ntfs... that worked, thanks!
[09:04] <SilentDis> neil__: it's part of the 'complete' samba package.  ubuntu ships with the samba-common, you have to apt-get the rest
[09:05] <SilentDis> neil__:  ahh.  i knew I did it, just couldn't remember what i grabbed exactly.  thank you :)
[09:06] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  well, glad it worked... I have to ask, is this an old compaq computer or something?  lol
[09:06] <neil__> blueone: you need package smbfs for smbmount
[09:06] <kholerabbit> SilentDis:  new asus :) haha
[09:07] <kholerabbit> brand new
[09:07] <neil__> SilentDis: yes. samba does all its work without needing to mount smb filesystems
[09:07] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  I ask that because i've seen some REALLY funky hd configs on those old machines, with complete win3.1 installs that act as their BIOS control and the like :P
[09:07] <kholerabbit> hehe
[09:07] <june_> hi
[09:08] <ddifof> hello
[09:08] <june_> hi ddi fof
[09:08] <ddifof> Netbackup server 6 on ubuntu anyone?
[09:08] <kholerabbit>  SilentDis: at the moment it is only readable by nautilus running under root, any idea how I can change the permission so the normal user can read it?
[09:09] <Schalken> How come the text in the Terminal is blurred?
[09:09] <SilentDis> neil__: yes, i just remember wanting to actually mount one, grabbing samba and possibly some other tools, and using smbmount.  that must've been the 'other stuff' i grabbed lol
[09:09] <Schalken> :(
[09:10] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: that is I get this error when I try change the permissions via the gui: "Couldn't change the permissions of "location" because it is on a read-only disk"
[09:10] <midgetg0at> I HATE THAT ERROR - i get that all teh time kholerabbit :)
[09:10] <kholerabbit> midgetg0at: heheh
[09:10] <midgetg0at> but i messed up my partition table file - whatever that's called.
[09:10] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  yes, when you mount, use... aargh... -o umask=007... i think?  someone please help me on this one.
[09:10] <kholerabbit> I hope I don't mess up anything it isn't my computer :(
[09:11] <midgetg0at> k, well, dont delete that file then :)
[09:11] <kholerabbit> midgetg0at: I just want to be able too read the files with the normal user..
[09:11] <midgetg0at> yea, i'm not the guy to give advice, just throught i'd chime in...i hate read only disks!
[09:12] <Schalken> in fact, why is the text in both the Terminal AND Epiphany blurred?
[09:12] <SilentDis> kholerabbit: yes, that's normal, the disk is mounted for root and root alone.  you have to provide the option during mount to allow other users
[09:12] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  ntfs disk on /dev/hda5, right?
[09:12] <kholerabbit> yup
[09:12] <RVman> whazzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?
[09:13] <lakupuu> 8)
[09:13] <serici> whazaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[09:13] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  sudo mount /dev/hda5 /media/location -t ntfs -o=umask=007
[09:14] <RVman> hey, guys, im new to ubuntu :)
[09:14] <kholerabbit> SilentDis:  thanks...
[09:14] <RVman> so whats so good about this... "ubuntu" everyone's talking about :D?
[09:14] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: I need to unmount it first appereantly
[09:14] <blueone> SilentDis & neil__: I got smbmout. i will try get it working. thanks for your help :-)
[09:15] <SilentDis> kholerabbit: yes.  umount /media/location, then the command noted above
[09:15] <kholerabbit> cheers
[09:15] <SilentDis> blueone:  no troubles, i apologize for being so foggy headed and still trying to help people lol
[09:16] <kholerabbit> SilentDis:  get this error: "mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda5,"
[09:16] <inferiorpotassiu> what's this mean?
[09:16] <inferiorpotassiu> WARNING: kernel is not very fresh, upgrade is recommended.
[09:16] <inferiorpotassiu> i ahve the latest kerenl
[09:16] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  aargh.  i can not for the life of me remember the proper option
[09:16] <kholerabbit> OK, nevermind thanks :)
[09:17] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  one last try for me...
[09:17] <SilentDis> kholerabbit:  i'm pulling this from my /etc/fstab, where I have an NTFS drive mounted, so it SHOULD work just fine lol
[09:17] <midgetg0at> ah yes, thats the file i deleted :)
[09:18] <kholerabbit> SilentDis: haha ok lets try

[09:34] <nomin> whenever I play flash videos the audio is out of sync with the videos.  Why is this?
[09:34] <crimsun> nomin: are you using 7.0.68 or 9 beta?
[09:34] <nomin> probably 7
[09:34] <crimsun> nomin: so remove flashplugin-nonfree and install 9 beta in ~/.mozilla/plugins/
[09:34] <roland> hi people. is there some convention as to where to put JDBC driver jar files on ubuntu linux?
[09:35] <bradley> i installed the new nvidia beta drivers and my sound has stopped. how can i fix it?
[09:35] <RVman> hey all :) can someone please explain whats so good about this "ubuntu" thing? all of my friends are talking about it and saying how great it is, and i wanna understand some more about it...
[09:35] <nomin> crimsun:  do I download it straight from macromedia's site?
[09:35] <RVman> what is exactly that... "ubuntu" :D?
[09:35] <crimsun> nomin: sure
[09:35] <bradley> nomin, flash9?
[09:36] <ChaosFan> RVman: it's a linux distribution, aimed at being user-friendly
[09:36] <roland> RVman: it is free, and it '
[09:36] <roland> RVman: it is free, and it 'just works'
[09:36] <SilentDis> RVman:  ubuntu is a fairly easy to use linux distrobution.  unlike most of what I've seen from linux in the past, most everything 'just works'(TM) right away, with little to no configuration.
[09:36] <ChaosFan> RVman: lot of things are automated, it's debian-based
[09:36] <nomin> bradley, yes.  I'm tired of the audio and video being out of sync with flash videos.
[09:36] <bradley> nomin, there is a .deb that worked great for me in the forums. gdebi installs it.
[09:37] <roland> hi people. is there some convention as to where to put JDBC driver jar files on ubuntu linux?
[09:37] <RVman> hmm a lot of explenations
[09:37] <RVman> ermm
[09:37] <bradley> search flash beta, or flash 9 i forget.
[09:37] <RVman> i understood its an operating system... why is it better than windows?
[09:37] <MM2> which site had a lot of screenshots of different OSes?
[09:37] <ChaosFan> RVman: nothing is ``better'' than anything else
[09:38] <RVman> i dunno, everyone tells me windows sux and linux rulez
[09:38] <ChaosFan> RVman: choosing an operating system is a choice of personal taste and what you want to do with your machine
[09:38] <bradley> RvGaTe, it is better because it is non-proprietary
[09:38] <RVman> but i wanna understand WHY they tell me that :S
[09:38] <nomin> bradley, is this the one you used:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=280313
[09:38] <roland> RVman: no simple answer to that try for yourself
[09:38] <SilentDis> RVman:  it's free and rock-stable, for starters.  really, i don't consider it 'better' than windows, simply 'better suited' for people than windows is ;)
[09:38] <bradley> RVman, , it is better because it is non-proprietary
[09:38] <ChaosFan> RVman: first of all, linux is free, non-proprietary, open source. everyone may use it and you don't need to pay for licenses
[09:38] <RVman> aha :)
[09:39] <RVman> ok i understand :D
[09:39] <ChaosFan> RVman: one drawback is that there are still many apps that you simply don't have when you use linux
[09:39] <RVman> as the matter of fact, im on ubuntu right now (my computer is so fucked up that i get blue sreens each time i try to install windows lol)
[09:39] <RVman> so i had no choice but to move to ubuntu
[09:39] <RVman> its like... a SIGH :D
[09:39] <RVman> sign*
[09:40] <ChaosFan> RVman: and under windows, the ``device driver thing'' is a lot easier
[09:40] <ChaosFan> because companies write and verify the windows-drivers themselves
[09:40] <RVman> yes i understood that there's something called "wine" that helps opening EXE files but still needs to go through a lot of development
[09:40] <bradley> nomin, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279990&highlight=flash+beta
[09:40] <SilentDis> RVman:  for a long time, linux used to be the 'esperanto' of the operating system world. I firmly believe it's finally comming around to being a viable OS for the standard 'idiot user' out there, and no longer just the domain of the elite :)
[09:41] <ChaosFan> RVman: wine is, as a matter of fact, still in beta state, not really finished
[09:41] <RVman> lol
[09:41] <bradley> i installed the new nvidia beta drivers and my sound has stopped. how can i fix it?
[09:41] <RVman> eek
[09:41] <RVman> sorry
[09:41] <M_Fatih> hi all..
[09:41] <RVman> SilentDis, are you an idiot user your an elite?
[09:41] <RVman> or*
[09:42] <midgetg0at> same issue bradley...
[09:42] <RVman> OH
[09:42] <nomin> bradley, thanks alot.  There are a lot of hits for flash 9.  Also that flash player looks pretty good.  Thanks for the link.
[09:42] <RVman> i have one more question to you all
[09:42] <midgetg0at> SilentDis: I think you mean, domain of the unproductive.
[09:42] <RVman> 1 sec
[09:42] <M_Fatih> i want to use my macosx applications in ubuntu, how can i do that? (macosx is working under a unix based kernel, so i think it is possible..)
[09:42] <SilentDis> RVman:  neither.  i know my way around 'puters, but I would NEVER consider myself at the top eschilon.  i simply feel i always have something new to learn, therefore it's an unacchevable goal for me :)
[09:43] <SilentDis> M_Faith:  probably won't be possible, as most mac apps are setup to run under the mac GUI.
[09:43] <RVman> hehe
=== scott_ is now known as Harnak
[09:43] <RVman> errm
[09:43] <RVman> one sec, im having some trouble with terminal :)
[09:43] <RVman> ermm
[09:43] <ChaosFan> M_Fatih: the mac OS X kernel is a MACH kernel called darwin, but mac OS X itself is based on FreeBSD, you have to get the sources and try to compile it yourself in ubuntu
[09:44] <RVman> if i have more than 5 line i wanna post for a question from terminal, should i post them here or post them on a webpage and just put a link here?
[09:44] <M_Fatih> SilentDis, yes but it must be some emulatorsi like wine for windoz
[09:44] <RVman> lines*
[09:44] <M_Fatih> ChaosFan, is it possible?
[09:44] <ChaosFan> RVman: better pastebot it
[09:44] <ChaosFan> M_Fatih: that depends on the app, if you're lucky it works
[09:44] <RVman> ok one sec then, i will post it :)
[09:44] <M_Fatih> because macosx app needs carbon or aqua interface libraries, how can i compile width success
[09:45] <SilentDis> M_Fatih:  none that i've seen yet... and WINE isn't an emulator anyway ;)
[09:45] <ChaosFan> M_Fatih: if you have bad luck you have to rewrite the GUI parts, then it maybe works ;)
[09:45] <MM2> which site had a lot of screenshots of different OSes?
[09:45] <M_Fatih> SilentDis, :) sorry.. (like emulator)
[09:45] <SilentDis> M_Fatih:  no worries, my comment was purely toungue-in-cheek :)
[09:45] <M_Fatih> :..( i want my some applications in macosx :(
[09:46] <ChaosFan> MM2: a screenshot of a OS is bullshit, sorry, as you can configure your graphical environment in about 1 million ways in every linux-distro and *BSD
[09:46] <RVman> what do i do in this case? -> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/xsdynU88.html
[09:46] <M_Fatih> ubuntu's performance is awesome
[09:46] <SilentDis> M_Fatih:  what app, in particular, are you looking for?  there might be a linux equivilant
[09:46] <MM2> ChaosFan: ty yours opinion, I'm looking screeshots of other OSes than linux
[09:46] <ChaosFan> RVman: do you have aptitude or synaptic running?
[09:47] <RVman> ChaosFan, no
[09:47] <SilentDis> MM2:  i dare say you'd recognize my 'look' for windows.  even then, windowblinds causes it to look different.  a 'screenshot' is meaningless, really.
[09:47] <ChaosFan> MM2: it still shows nothing about how to handle the OS... and google might find some...
[09:47] <rwoes> I have been looking around all night for help.  I am new to linux and need to know how to change ALL of my icons for a specific filetype in nautilus.  For example, if I had a cool icon and wanted to change all my .mp3 files to have that icon, how do I do it?
[09:48] <ChaosFan> RVman: hm, but looks like it... one moment
[09:48] <M_Fatih> :( hmm.. i want to use my "bussiness card designer" and i can't remember but i writing html codes in this application.. actually i'm using ubuntu about 3 years :) after osx86 i turned to macosx, but i don't like it's performance but macosx applications are very easy and increse productivity (sorry bad english)
[09:48] <jazzrocker> anyone know the answer to my question?
[09:48] <MM2> I also have different theme fow xp, but still looking for that site, which had a lot of screenshots. Ubuntu once had it linked to them site, but it is not anymore there. Id had shots of install process etc
[09:49] <jazzrocker> how do i get my apt to stop saying "this is an untrusted source"
[09:49] <SilentDis> MM2:  oh!  you're looking for a walkthru or the like for something?
[09:49] <MM2> SilentDis: It had that too
[09:50] <MM2> SilentDis: from many os'es
[09:50] <midgetg0at> so, any fix for the nVidia driver update issue?
[09:50] <ChaosFan> RVman: if you really don't have anything running, you could `sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock`
[09:50] <midgetg0at> It's affecting my Steam install on wine also...telling me driver version conflict or something.
[09:50] <ChaosFan> RVman: and then try again
[09:50] <SilentDis> MM2:  what, exactly, are you looking to do?  we can help you with any problems you might have with Ubuntu.  most of us tend to revert to terminal stuff anyway lol
[09:50] <nomin> flash 9 works better but the audio is not perfectly in sync with the video.  It's still good though.
[09:51] <RVman> ChaosFan, wait i will try
[09:51] <RVman> ChaosFan, the truth is i can't even run synaptic, everytime i open it, it gets closed by itself
[09:51] <M_Fatih> anyway, thanks for discuss/ideas, ChaosFan  SilentDis see you again.. :)
[09:51] <rwoes> hmm
[09:51] <ChaosFan> RVman: while that lock-file exists no front-end to apt-get will start
[09:52] <morphir> anyone configured apache with mod_rewrite on ubuntu here?
[09:52] <ChaosFan> except aptitude which lets you browse the packages but not install anything, yay... ;)
[09:53] <RVman> ChaosFan, thanks, it works now

[10:08] <ChaosFan> wtf is CentOS?
[10:08] <SilentDis> Kaiyang:  what does the server do?
[10:08] <sc4ttrbrain> ChaosFan, centOS is well known for its security for servers
[10:09] <Kaiyang> well for hosting customer's beta website etc.
[10:09] <ChaosFan> so is openBSD...
[10:09] <Kaiyang> sql querying etc
[10:09] <Kaiyang> file server
[10:09] <SilentDis> Kaiyang:  i'd stick with CentOS or BSD on such an environment, personally.
[10:10] <sc4ttrbrain> Kaiyang, i would stick to debian or debian based distro personally, imo, its depend on how you configure it
[10:10] <Kaiyang> I see.
[10:10] <SilentDis> Kaiyang:  ubuntu works great for desktops... I still run FreeBSD on my server environments though.  just a personal opinion on it :)

[10:12] <Kaiyang> Well I am new to linux. To me Ubuntu has been working very well.. kind of user-friendly. Very close to windows operating methods. But changing to CENTOS I'm losing confident

[10:12] <sc4ttrbrain> PwcrLinux, i was hoping like somekind of webcam
[10:12] <bokey> Kaiyang# why ?
[10:13] <Kaiyang> CENTOS as user friendly as UBUNTU?
[10:13] <iwaterball> Kaiyang: If you want to run a proper server, you're gonna have to at-least learn some unix
[10:13] <dorto> Kaiyang, I don't think so
[10:13] <iwaterball> Kaiyang: not really
[10:13] <sc4ttrbrain> PwcrLinux, i have this webcam ,but can only hear voices, no way to broadcast mine
[10:13] <Kaiyang> easy to operate? and is the CENTOS community as big as UBUNTU?

[10:15] <rihui> does anybody know why is that when i try to open lets say 10 music files by rightclicking->open, my default media player open up 10 times and not queue the files into the playlist?
[10:15] <ifireball> Kaiyang: if you want to run a linux server, I'd recommand going the Debian way, that way you cat at-least stay in a familier "apt" environment
[10:15] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, have you tried recording through the mic on Ubuntu?
[10:16] <ChaosFan> rihui: depends on your default media player and how to configure it.
[10:16] <wutison> would anyone like to share web site to check all ubuntu linux  aplication`s rates, popularity and ... all info about them how many times it has been downloaded ?  please ?
[10:16] <Delkster> It might just be that some recording volumes are low or muted or something else like that if it doesn't seem to work at all.
[10:16] <Trist_an> how can I know the time of creation of a file in the format HH:MM:SS
[10:16] <Trist_an> ?
[10:16] <ifireball> Kaiyang: use centos only if you have a 3rd pary application that really needs a redhat-like distro, e.g. Oracle
[10:16] <SilentDis> nomin:  check this website for info on converting them: http://digg.com/linux_unix/Convert_FLV_s_(Google_Video)_to_MPEG,_AVI,_etc._on_Linux
[10:16] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, , questions, do i have to change from alsa to camera when recording
[10:16] <rihui> no matter what media i use, they all act the same
[10:16] <Kaiyang> does LAMP work well on CENTOS?
[10:16] <ifireball> Kaiyang: and only if you intebd to eventually but a RedHat licence
[10:16] <Kaiyang> mysql and php
[10:17] <rihui> from beep mp to xmms to vlc to mplayer to exaile to banshee to listen
[10:17] <nomin> SilentDis, thanks
[10:17] <SilentDis> nomin:  nt :)
[10:17] <nomin> SilentDis, but aren't youtube and google videos really just avi's that are manipulated somehow with macromedia?
[10:18] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, I don't know exactly what you mean. What options do you have? Do you mean switching from a separate ALSA-supported sound card to something integrated in the camera?
[10:18] <ifireball> Kaiyang: LAMP works well with any Linux-based OS, from my poersonal experiance Debian-based distros are easy in that respect (apt-get install mysql is alot easyer that trying to manually figure out the RPM dependencies)
[10:18] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, what options do you have for the recording device?
[10:18] <po0f> rihui: It's only doing what you told it to do.  I think you are looking for an "add to queue" option.
[10:18] <SilentDis> nomin:  from what I understand, yes.  they instruct you to compile ffmpeg from source, btw... don't bother.  just sudo apt-get install ffmpeg :)
[10:18] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, do you mean option> record from input?
[10:18] <GarethMB> Hi, i'm having a boot problem, i've described it at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1735055#post1735055 but it's yet to get any real attention. If anyone thinks they can help i would apreciate it.
[10:19] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, i meant on the open volume control
[10:19] <nomin> SilentDis, but isn't there a way to get a url that gives the location of the avi's on websites?
[10:19] <rihui> but sometimes it  queue the files but sometimes it opens in separate window.
[10:19] <Delkster> Kaiyang, LAMP should work fine on any Linux distribution as far as I can tell, but it will probably require some effort to configure it on any of them.
[10:19] <SilentDis> nomin:  once apt-get is done, you can just run it like this:  ffmpeg -i video.flv -ab 56 -ar 22050 -b 500  -s 320x240 test.mpg
[10:19] <SilentDis> nomin:  you can use http://www.keepvid.com/ to get the video file, once it's on your drive, you can use ffmpeg to convert it
[10:20] <rihui> po0f: sometimes they open in separate window and sometimes they queue in the player.
[10:20] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, should i change from intel (alsa mixer) to camera(alsamixer)?
[10:20] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, that shouldn't have effect on which device is actually used for recording. It's only there so you can select which device's volume levels you adjust. Try the one you think you're using for recording.
[10:21] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, trying now,will tell u the result
[10:21] <Kaiyang> well seems... I can't shake off my boss's request as I do not have a critercial advantage over CENTOS for Ubuntu
[10:21] <tengil> i have a text file with a bunch of lines and i want to remove everything after a ) and keep what comes before. how do i do that
[10:21] <nomin> SilentDis, this page makes it look easy.  I'll try it out.
[10:21] <Kaiyang> HAve to try out CENTOS on VMWARE
[10:21] <SilentDis> nomin:  it is.  been doing it for a while ;)
[10:21] <nomin> cool
[10:21] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, if you have to change which device is actually used for recording, try "gstreamer-properties" on the terminal (that'll only affect applications that use gstreamer, though)
[10:21] <Kaiyang> to find out how difficult it can be
[10:21] <sersci> hei,  I have a problem when trying to install ubuntu on  Optiplex 745 machine. First tg3 driver doesn*t work, solved that by using official Interl's driver (will report a bug). More problematic, Video card is not supported (GMA 3000). As Intel as released the drivers as open source, I wonder if there's a way for me to get these drivers into Dapper or Edgy without having to recompile X & all
[10:22] <Kaiyang> Thanks guys
[10:22] <ifireball> Kaiyang: I can give you a hint that might help you alot with centos
[10:22] <Kaiyang> good
[10:22] <Kaiyang> what's it?
[10:22] <ifireball> Kaiyang: do you know apt-get?
[10:23] <Kaiyang> no... I am using GUI installation with synotic manager
[10:23] <Kaiyang> but i think i can understand the apt-get concept
[10:24] <ifireball> Kaiyang: o.k. but I suppose you're familier with to concept of repositories and an automatic package manager
[10:24] <RVman> hey
[10:24] <Hoxzer> hey
[10:24] <Kaiyang> I'm not sure about that
[10:24] <RVman> ChaosFan, what do i do when a program tells me "Could not open /dev/sequencer. and another program is probably using it"?
[10:25] <Hoxzer> I dunno but I would do fuser /dev/sequencer
[10:25] <RVman> weh well i think i will just restart my PC, it needs it anyway
[10:25] <ifireball> Kaiyang: e.g. that fact that you install software by selecting it in some tool rather then downloading it your self and running a "setup.exe" program
[10:26] <achandra> has anyone used dvdrip before?
[10:26] <Trist_an> how can I know the time of creation of a file in the format HH:MM:SS?
[10:26] <achandra> how do you re-assemble the copied dvd to cdrom and have it autoplay in a dvd player?
[10:26] <McMadd> I'm in desperate need of help with a startup script. What's the policy on asking help? Do I just throw it in the channel?
[10:26] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, there are about 7 choices in record from input option,like line-in,aux,video,phone,etc but none of them producing my voices
[10:26] <Kaiyang> yup ok... tht's what i am doing
[10:26] <SilentDis> !ask McMadd
[10:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask McMadd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:27] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, maybe u wanna know my lsusb...
[10:27] <SilentDis> whoops, wrong command to the bot rofl
[10:27] <McMadd> oops, there's probably also a !help
[10:27] <McMadd> !help
[10:27] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl  -  Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[10:27] <achandra> Trist_an: how about ls -lah
[10:27] <ifireball> Kaiyang: essencially, what I'm trying to say is that centos has a tool similar to apt-get called yum (I don't think it has a GUI front-end though), learning it can save you hours of trying to manullay resolve package dependecies
[10:27] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, Bus 004 Device 002: ID 046d:08f0 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Messenger
[10:27] <SilentDis> McMadd:  just ask.  I can't remember the command to make the bot chide you ;)
[10:28] <boink> hullo
[10:28] <Trist_an> achandra, it gives me day, hour and minutes but not seconds...
[10:28] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, I don't know much about webcams (never used one myself) but have you checked if this device is supposed to work in Ubuntu?
[10:28] <ailean> SilentDis, !ask :)
[10:28] <Kaiyang> may I know what are the basic command for yum? like?
[10:28] <ailean> Kaiyang, yum install *, but ubuntu usually uses apt
[10:28] <SilentDis> ailean, there's what I was looking for...
[10:29] <ailean> SilentDis, np :)
[10:29] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, the thing is,i can broadcast and receive video as in ymesenger
[10:29] <SilentDis> !ask > McMadd
[10:29] <achandra> Trist_an: ls -lavh
[10:29] <RVman> didn't work :(
[10:29] <ifireball> Kaiyang: the basic command is "yum"... the rest you're gonna have to learn from the manual page...
[10:29] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, i can even hear they're talkin
[10:29] <RVman> ermm
[10:29] <RVman> where is that dude that tried to help me earlier?
[10:29] <SilentDis> McMadd:  now that Ubotu has had his say, what's your question?  lol
[10:29] <armstrong80> Has anyone had any problems after installing Edgy where when downloading torrents after the first one they get an error 'Address already in use'?
[10:29] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, but cant broadcast mine
[10:29] <achandra> v for vandetta...errm...verbose...
[10:29] <McMadd> Ok, I have disabled gdm and need to start my own xsession. I have created a script that works when I run it as root from the console but it won't work when I make a symbolic link in rc2.d.
[10:29] <RVman> does anyone know what to do when a program tells me "Could not open /dev/sequencer.
[10:29] <RVman> Probably there is another program using it."?
[10:29] <Kaiyang> oh thanks. Certainly I hope it's not going to be a nightmare for me
[10:30] <zoetrope666> hi all :) can someone help me > i've been downloading different login window themes and trying them out, however in the process i appear to have lost the 'restart' and 'shutdown' options from both my login window at startup, and from my quit menu at shutdown. is this fixable?
[10:30] <Trist_an> archangelpetro, still no seconds
[10:30] <nomin> SilentDis, works like a charm :)
[10:30] <SilentDis> nomin:  :D
[10:30] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, the thing is few ppl on forum ehich has the same lsusb output as mine,manage to use this webcam to talk two ways
[10:30] <McMadd> Can I paste it here? It's only 6 lines
[10:30] <ailean> McMadd, no
[10:30] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, sorry, hard to help much further since I neither have a webcam nor use Yahoo.
[10:30] <SilentDis> nomin:  good, now go get the video for White and Nerdy and watch it on loop for the next 4 hours.  :D  rofl
[10:31] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, ok thanks anyway
[10:31] <Delkster> However, what I'd do is check out if you can get recording to work in some other application, for example the Gnome sound recorder.
[10:31] <ifireball> hare is an interesting idea I thought of this morning, suppose I get and install a webcamera, does any body knows a sotware that can detect and record motion with the camera? (e.g don't record anything until something actually moves in ther room?)
[10:31] <ailean> !pastebin > McMadd
[10:31] <Delkster> If you can get it working there but not on Yahoo, the problem is somehow with the later
[10:31] <nomin> SilentDis, I saw it under comedy earlier.  I'll check it out lol
[10:31] <Delkster> latter
[10:31] <rausb0> Trist_an: ls -l --full-time
[10:31] <Delkster> If you can't get it working anywhere, it's somewhere deeper, possibly with the mixer settings.
[10:31] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, could u suggest solution...possibly cheap devices...
[10:31] <McMadd> ailean: ok. ( I realy need a list of commands :) ... feel kinda lost )
[10:31] <SilentDis> nomin:  weird al is god.  *to mods* I'll stop being off topic now ;)
[10:32] <zoetrope666> hi all :) can someone help me > i've been downloading different login window themes and trying them out, however in the process i appear to have lost the 'restart' and 'shutdown' options from both my login window at startup, and from my quit menu at shutdown. is this fixable?
[10:32] <McMadd> !pastebin
[10:32] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[10:32] <ailean> McMadd, I wish i could help you
[10:32] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, you could also try "alsamixer" on the terminal instead of the Gnome volume control. It usually has more options.
[10:32] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, not really, because I have zero experience with webcams
[10:32] <jazzrocker> how can i determine what my processor is?
[10:32] <Kaiyang> crap! CENTOS channel don't seems to respond...
[10:32] <jazzrocker> this is a VPS i'm not sure
[10:32] <ailean> McMadd, of course, Google is your friend too
[10:32] <jazzrocker> i didn't buy it, i'm just the admin
[10:32] <Kaiyang> a big minus in impression so far
[10:32] <rausb0> jazzrocker: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[10:33] <netpython> jazzrocker, uname -a
[10:33] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, no,i mean any devide so i can talk in skype...
[10:33] <jazzrocker> uname didn't do it
[10:33] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, device
[10:33] <Trist_an> rausb0, yes it works, thank you
[10:33] <ifireball> Kaiyang: it may not be on freenode, try their website 1st
[10:33] <McMadd> ailean: believe me I've googled like crazy..
[10:33] <jazzrocker> ok it's an opteron
[10:33] <Kaiyang> it's on freenode
[10:33] <jazzrocker> does that qualify as x86_64?
[10:33] <netpython> if you have xchat you could use the sysinfo plugin like this:
[10:33] <Kaiyang> that's written on their web
[10:33] <netpython> os[Linux 2.6.18.2-petnython i686]  distro[Debian testing/unstable]  cpu[1 x AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3000+ @ 2.20GHz]  mem[Physical : 1010MB, 79.7% free]  disk[Total : 146.99GB, 88.60% Free]  video[nVidia Corporation NV36.2 [GeForce FX 5700] ]  sound[] 
[10:33] <jazzrocker> sorry, i don't know much about the server CPU market
[10:34] <ailean> McMadd, i'm sure you have :)  some folks don't think of it though. ask again in 10 mins mibbe someone can help
[10:34] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, ah... well, I have a standard headset that plugs in to my sound card's microphone jack. That works fine but getting sound recording to work in Linux may still take some tweaking with the mixer settings, unfortunately.
[10:34] <Kaiyang> maybe u can check out #centos. There's so many people, and none reply to my question
[10:34] <armstrong80> I have installed Edgy and now when I try and attempt a second torrent I get an 'address already in use' error. Anyone have any ideas? What does the default torrent client show up as in System Monitor?
[10:34] <achandra> Trist_an: this i think works too - ls -lavh --time-style=full-iso
[10:34] <Terminus> jazzrocker: cat /proc/cpu
[10:34] <ifireball> McMadd: scripts in /etc/init.d need to accept varion command line parameters and act accordingly, there are alot easyer ways to do what you want
[10:34] <Kaiyang> they are so "COLD" to me... start to miss ubuntu
[10:34] <Terminus> jazzrocker: errr... cat /proc/cpuinfo i mean.
[10:34] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, do u have to install some driver or...
[10:34] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, I don't know about USB headsets -- they should work, too, but I don't know what you need to do to select one as your input/output device over the default sound card (perhaps nothing nowadays but I don't have one)
[10:35] <Ox41464b> How do i check for CPU Temp ?
[10:35] <SilentDis> Kaiyang:  i have to admit, of all the various distros i've messed with, the Ubuntu community is just about the warmest, most knowledgable one I've ever come across.  VERY refreshing :)
[10:35] <achandra> anyone familiar with dvdrip?
[10:35] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, thanks i ll try it later
[10:35] <Delkster> sc4ttrbrain, that probably depends on your sound card. If your sound card generally works with Linux, then probably no. For USB audio devices, no.
[10:35] <McMadd> ifireball: enlighten me please, I'm a linux newbie and the dude that helped is not available today...
[10:35] <Kaiyang> SilentDis, I totally agree
[10:36] <McMadd> It's the last step in a project that needs to finish today
[10:36] <jazzrocker> are opterons 64 bit?
[10:36] <dorto> what is the name of open source version of kqemu(qemu accelerator)?
[10:36] <jazzrocker> Terminus, yeh i know i just did that, someone else said that too
[10:36] <ifireball> McMadd: 1st try to explain to me what are you trying to accomplish, so I can directo you properly
[10:37] <dorto> it was sth like vbemu...
[10:37] <sc4ttrbrain> Delkster, well this is the last thing that make me keeps my windows partition :p thanks anyway
[10:37] <armstrong80> I'll approach this at a different angle then. Has everyone been able to download multiple torrent files under Edgy?
[10:37] <Terminus> jazzrocker: sorry. too many messages to read. didn't notice.
[10:37] <noiesmo> achandra, if your interested I just use dvdshrink and dvddycrypter running under wine heres the howto http://mrbass.org/linux/ubuntu/dvdshrink/
[10:37] <rausb0> dorto: qvm86?
[10:37] <slinky_> hello folks, does anyone answer a question about wine or tell me where I may be able to ask elsewhere?
[10:38] <McMadd> Can you see what I've put in the pastebin? (Still learning the ins and outs of this channel to)
[10:38] <SilentDis> slinky_:  ask away.  if we can't answer, we'll send you off elsewhere, otherwise, we'll try :)
[10:38] <ifireball> McMadd: you need to pase a link to the patebin page you've made here
[10:38] <netpython> noiesmo, what about dvdrip?
[10:38] <Delkster> armstrong80, I've used Azureus instead of the default client, and that way yes. I don't know much about the default client.
[10:38] <McMadd> ifireball: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30821/
[10:38] <allabulle> hi
[10:39] <McMadd> nice concept
[10:39] <achandra> noiesmo: thnx...ill take a look at it. I have the dvd portion svaed in individual directories of chapters or whatever...but the re-compilation into a single cd is what I dont understand how to do .
[10:39] <armstrong80> Ty Delkster I'll give it a try
[10:39] <McMadd> ifireball: It's that simple... I've disabled gdm and need this script to execute
[10:39] <dorto> rausb0, yep, that was it. been googling for such a while, thx :)
[10:40] <slinky_> SilentDis: I have winME installed on drive C across a LAN and Diablo II installed on drive D also across the LAN, any chance in this world of being able to run diablo under dapper drake :)
[10:40] <dorto> none of them(kqemu, qvm86) seem to be available for ubuntu :(
[10:40] <SilentDis> slinky_: oh yes :)
[10:41] <SilentDis> slinky_: you'll need a package called Cedega for that, i believe.  costs $15 for 3-month 'membership', i have nothing but platitudes for it :)
[10:41] <slinky_> SilentDis: could you open a window with me and explain the basics, so I may try it?
[10:41] <McMadd> ifireball: when i run it from the konsole it works flawlessly but like I said before, when I put it in rc2.d it only start X, not the DISPLAY part
[10:41] <SilentDis> slinky_:  check out http://www.transgaming.com/
[10:42] <bunnu> has ne one of u used OSSIM on ubuntu
[10:42] <netpython> dorto, qemu is available,correct me if i'm wrong but isn't kqemu a accelerator module?
[10:43] <McMadd> ifireball: some additional info: I've created an autologin and the machine should start like the script sais on boot
[10:43] <SilentDis> slinky_: Cedega wraps wine as well as DirectX stuff, and allows games to 'just run'.  I play Dreamfall, SWG, KOTOR2 with it :)
[10:43] <yukio> is there a way to take Wesnoth to latest version to play online?
[10:43] <ifireball> McMadd: because manually loading X and hoping that it'll be up by the time you get to the client lines is the wrong way to go about this, it alos probably gives you trouble with X security permissions
[10:43] <dorto> netpython, yes; when i start qemu, it says /dev/kqemu not found; i searched for kqemu but couldn't find it with apt-cache search
[10:43] <slinky_> SilentDis: I have a fat32 format drive /hda on this dapper system, i could move the diablo directory over to it, would that help any?
[10:44] <SilentDis> slinky_:  Cedega creates a games directory to install do in your home directory.  it handles all of it for you.
[10:44] <netpython> dorto, you can compile the kqemu module
[10:44] <ifireball> McMadd: I think a better way to do tihs is to configure GDM to auto-login a certain user and then put a .xsession file in his home dir to run the Xclients you want
[10:44] <crow> Hi all, I download FULL install of Ubuntu 6.10, i try to boot with it and i get Boot CD or Install, but it wont load ... i take ages, and then only ctr+alt+del help...
[10:45] <Trist_an> I have uninstalled powernowd and I want to reinstall it. But now, synaptic tells me he will uninstall kubuntu-desktop. How can I just tell him to just reinstall powernowd without uninstalling kubuntu-desktop?
[10:45] <rausb0> dorto: qemu still runs without the kernel module. it will just be slower.
[10:45] <SilentDis> crow:  how much memory on the system?
[10:45] <dorto> netpython, you mean configure & make? won't that interfere with apt's file organisation?
[10:45] <McMadd> ifireball: That sounds exactly like my needs, but why still use gdm?
[10:45] <slinky_> SilentDis: I copied all of that down and will check it out, I just love playing Diablo, and I thank you very much for you help, one other question if i may ask?
[10:45] <crow> SilentDis 512MB
=== _Er1K_ is now known as Daeley
[10:45] <SilentDis> slinky_: ask away
[10:46] <netpython> dorto, not intefere but you loose the funtionality yes
[10:46] <dorto> rausb0, yeah, I know, but it should be slightly faster with accelerator module. I would go with Xen if I want top performance but qemu is so easy to install and use ;)
[10:46] <netpython> +cc
[10:46] <SilentDis> crow:  odd hardware or some such?  does it let you pick an option at all?  does it start the boot?
[10:46] <netpython> http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/kqemu-doc.html
[10:46] <slinky_> SilentDis: If i install winXP using qemu, can i then install diablo there?
[10:46] <dorto> netpython, I assume kqemu files get copied in proper folders then. will give it a try.
[10:46] <rausb0> dorto: i wouldnt use a partly closed source kernel module just to get qemu faster
[10:46] <SilentDis> slinky_: I'm not versed in qemu, sorry :(
[10:46] <netpython> dorto, can hurt
[10:46] <netpython> can't
[10:47] <ifireball> McMadd: because there is a lot of various work that needs to be done in order to properly initialise an X session, its a whole lot easyer to have GDM do it for you then try to do it manually with a script
[10:47] <McMadd> ifireball: So if I put a Xsession script in someones homedir it will be executed? (I'm that new to linux) No symbolic startup links needed?
[10:47] <slinky_> SilentDis: well thanks anyways, it might be interesting to have a look at it :), have a nice day
[10:47] <crow> SilentDis it load kernel, then other screen, it come (to i think 90%) and then stop.... i pres ctr+alt+del and it tell me to pres enter to restart
[10:48] <dorto> rausb0, netpython, I better use qemu only then. let them create an open accelerate
[10:48] <dorto> soon
[10:48] <ifireball> McMadd: I'm still looking into what exact name of the script should be, the answer is somewhere in /etc/gdm, I'll find it soon enough
[10:48] <McMadd> ifireball: But, if I autolgin a certain user I still get the gdm login screen. The tty1 is sitting there logged in.
[10:48] <rausb0> slinky_: i think diablo in winxp under qemu will be too slow (if it runs at all). qemu does not emulate any 3d accelerated gfx card.
[10:48] <crow> SilentDis i dont know about odd hardware (xp,vista) working fine...
[10:48] <netpython> dorto, yep
[10:49] <McMadd> ifireball: Offcourse (duh) I added the autologin to the tty1 service
[10:49] <ifireball> McMadd: you need to have GDM auto-login not the tty
[10:49] <slinky_> rausb0: thank you for the info
[10:49] <progek> hello fellow community, is there someone who can help me with a tomcat/servlet question? I have a permissions issue within the servlet if anyone can help.
[10:49] <McMadd> ifireball: Right, I realised it
[10:49] <dorto> it is strange to see even help.ubuntu.com, which i consider as official ubuntu help, having instructions on manaully installing qemu and kqemu.
[10:49] <SilentDis> crow:  i BELIEVE you can hit ctrl-alt-f1 and check out the console behind the ubuntu load screen.  not so sure if that's possible with the edgy livecd, though (running dapper here)
[10:50] <dorto> progek, #tomcat
[10:50] <ifireball> McMadd: actally disabling the TTY autologin or even the TTY itself might be a smart move here security-wise
[10:50] <progek> dorto: thanks, but everyone seems to ignore me there :/ so, thought I would try here
[10:50] <crow> SilentDis cant get the console, i tried f1 till f7.... just stop responding. checked memory test working fine 0 errors.
[10:51] <slinky_> bye folks
[10:51] <dorto> progek, try there some other time; that's life on irc ;)
[10:51] <trondare> i'd like to use nvidia's installer instead of the ubuntu packaged drivers, how should i proceed? any packages i should remove first in order to avoid conflicts?
[10:51] <SilentDis> crow: you got me baffled.  I've installed dapper on quite a few machines too.  sorry :(
[10:51] <trondare> running edgy
[10:52] <trondare> and currently using the ubuntu packaged nvidia drivers
[10:52] <McMadd> ifireball: that's not necessary. This machine will be running 2 touchscreens which will disable any unauthorised access. Only real smart people who really want to get in might be able to (doubt it though) but it doesn't matter because there's nothing to gain for them in the final setup
[10:52] <progek> trondare: you just want to install nvidia video drivers?
[10:52] <trondare> progek: correct
[10:52] <McMadd> ifireball: no keyboard either...
[10:52] <progek> I think just a sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx should do
[10:52] <trondare> and if possible, avoid that an upgrade will break everything
[10:52] <progek> one minute
[10:52] <SilentDis> crow:  gotta be something hanging waiting... no idea where the console output is going though.  have you tried booting in 'safe video' mode or some such?  (if it's an option on the menu)
[10:52] <trondare> progek: well, i'd like to install them using nvidia's installer, to get the latest driver
[10:53] <McMadd> ifireball: I just dove into the way I created the autologin for tty1 but can't figure out quickly how to do that for gdm. Any hints?
[10:53] <ifireball> McMadd: the rule with security is "be paraniod"
[10:53] <SilentDis> !nvidia > SilentDis
[10:54] <crow> SilentDis jes there is option, i didnt tried, i just wonna install it not run...
[10:54] <McMadd> ifireball: I know, and I agree but in this situation it's really not necessary.
[10:54] <trondare> i wish there was something similar to make-jpkg and java for nvidia drivers...
[10:55] <rausb0> McMadd: looks like the script has to be run as root (because X must run as root). so firefox is also run as root. very bad. even with touch pad only you will be able to overwrite /etc/passwd or something by simply saving a web page with "save as..."
[10:55] <trondare> anyone has experience using the nvidia installer on edgy?
[10:55] <ifireball> McMadd: you probably need to make some changes in /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf I suppose the cpmments in the file will give you enough hints, I'll look into that when I'm done figuring out what the file in the home-dir shuold be called, I suppose setting up the auto-login should be the last step after you've got your custom-session running
[10:56] <McMadd> ifireball: ok, that'll get get me going...
[10:56] <SilentDis> trondare:  did you check out the help info?
[10:56] <SilentDis> !nvidia > trondare
[10:56] <trondare> SilentDis: the help info?
[10:56] <hume> i have a problem with a printer, HP business inkjet 1200. I had in installed, using hpijs, but it stopped working, and when trying to reinstall, what is automatically found is a canon and an epson on the lpt where the HP is... anyone can advice me on this?
[10:56] <hume> running edgy on an amd64-system
[10:56] <trondare> SilentDis: yeah, that doesn't answer my question
[10:57] <trondare> i want to use nvidia's installer
[10:57] <trondare> _not_ the ubuntu packaged drivers
[10:57] <McMadd> rausb0: You are right but it will only mess up the users screens and he will have gained nothing but a screen that won't do what it's supposed to. There's no inet involved whatsoever.
[10:58] <yuky2314> irc.hanirc.org
[10:59] <ifireball> McMadd: ok. thwe file can either be called .xsession or .Xsession in the user's home dir and you need the line "allow-user-xsession" to appear in the /etc/X11/Xsession.options file
[11:00] <ifireball> McMadd: (it seems to be there by default but check anyway)
[11:00] <McMadd> Ah men, I wish I came here 4 days ago when I started this build with another n00b....
[11:03] <SilentDis> beddie bye time for me.  g'night all
[11:03] <xerath2> After upgrading from dapper to edgy on two machines (one desktop and one server), I'm experiencing a weird issue... The servers locales have been preserved, but on my desktop they have changed (default locale is suddenly ANSI, and no matter what I do I can't get the two boxes locales to match). Any tips?
[11:04] <jazzrocker> is there any way to dist upgrade from breezy to dapper?
[11:05] <ifireball> McMadd: I think "AutomaticLogin" in your /etc/gdm/gdm.conf file should be set to the name of the user you want to login, not sure though, this might be easyer to setup with "sudo gdmsetup"
[11:06] <McMadd> ifireball: autologin like that appears to be not working but I'm still playing with your (very usefull) sugestions..
=== _Er1K_ is now known as Daelenn
[11:08] <rickyfingers> how's everybody doing?
[11:08] <McMadd> ifireball: before I try the Xsession script, I'm guessing the line 'X' is not necessary anymore?
[11:08] <Derek__> any guys know that how to upgrade dapper to edgy from cd-rom?
[11:09] <McMadd> ifireball: autologin works!
[11:09] <rickyfingers> Derek - where are you having problems?
[11:09] <ifireball> McMadd: no, and niether is manually setting the DISPLAY variable
[11:09] <AdamKili> i know it a really simple answer, but what which package do i need to fix this?: configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[11:09] <ifireball> McMadd: or playing with PATH
[11:09] <rickyfingers> I just installed edgy on a 64 bit amd
[11:09] <rickyfingers> but I did an install from scratch.
[11:10] <rickyfingers> I had to update my bios before I could start the installer
[11:10] <McMadd> ifireball: I think I do need to. I shortned the script. Theres anothe set of DISPLAY lines that will put another browser on a second screen
[11:10] <Derek__> rickyfingers: hi , i don;t know how to start  hehe
[11:10] <rickyfingers> (am2 m2npv-vm
[11:10] <rickyfingers> Ok, well, have you downloaed the installer CD image yet
[11:10] <AdamKili> configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[11:11] <AdamKili> which package do i need to fix this?
[11:11] <Derek__> rickyfingers: yes, i have download already
[11:11] <sky123> !sparc
[11:11] <ubotu> Have a look here for Docs http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/install/sparc/ KnownIssues and TODO are on the wiki.
[11:11] <AdamKili> i know its really simple. just forgot which one it was.
[11:11] <Derek__> rickyfingers: and burn it
[11:12] <Derek__> rickyfingers: but i don't know what's the next step
[11:12] <rickyfingers> Ok now just use the cd buring program to burn the image
[11:12] <ifireball> McMadd: those are 2 xscreens connected to the same PC? one is called :0.0 and the other :0.1 ?
[11:12] <rickyfingers> but don't burn a data cd with the image on it, burn a copy of the image
[11:12] <Derek__> rickyfingers: yeap , the cd is available now
[11:12] <rickyfingers> That was fast.  You mean you already burnt the cd?
[11:13] <noiesmo> build-essential i think  AdamKili
[11:13] <McMadd> ifireball: Correct.
[11:13] <Derek__> rickyfingers: yes, i can boot from this cd
[11:13] <rickyfingers> OK that was really fast.  My cd burner takes a few minutes to burn an image.
[11:13] <Derek__> rickyfingers: so may know what's the next step , i have no idea about it
[11:13] <McMadd> ifireball: I had a hard time configuring xorg.conf bu it works great.
[11:14] <ifireball> McMadd: are you sure you need to "-CreateProfile" every time? also I suppose that command returns Immediately rather then openning up the firefox gui?
[11:14] <rickyfingers> OK, so now, you might just want to navigate your file browser to the cd, and make sure it looks right
[11:14] <McMadd> ifireball: Like I said before, my last problem was getting it all started automatically on boot
[11:14] <rickyfingers> You should see a few directories, and not just one file name that ends in .iso
[11:14] <Schalken> whats the standard thats supposed to define the way application menus (Graphics, Office etc...) are made?
[11:14] <RVman> zomg
[11:14] <Derek__> rickyfingers: yes,  it's a bootable cd
[11:14] <Derek__> rickyfingers: then?
[11:15] <McMadd> ifireball: you're right, it isn't needed everytime, it overwrites the previous one
[11:15] <RVman> woof.
[11:15] <rickyfingers> OK, so now you need to leave the cd in the tray
[11:15] <Hali_301> hi
[11:15] <rickyfingers> and reboot
[11:15] <rickyfingers> you may need to adjust your bios settings so you can boot off cd
[11:15] <sky123> anyone familiar with edgy install on Sun Sparc ?
[11:15] <ifireball> McMadd: I never thought I'd see that kind of setup nowdays... it was common in workstation in the 80s... nowdays you just make the saem xserver control all the screen with xinerama and play aroung with the -geometry parameter...
[11:15] <Hali_301> help! :) I'm looking for an application, by which i can chat and transfer files on a local network! (i dont wanna install samba, and an irc server, some simple integrated solution?)
[11:16] <Derek__> rickyfingers: ok , i can login the new system from cd
[11:16] <ifireball> McMadd: but I suppose its ok if you want seperate mice, etc.
[11:16] <rickyfingers> So now update existing system should be an option
[11:16] <AdamKili> yep that was it noiesmo thanks
[11:16] <Derek__> rickyfingers: and also can install the new one from desktop
[11:16] <noiesmo> AdamKili, np
[11:16] <rickyfingers> I don't remember exactly what the menu has for options, s
[11:17] <xerath2> After upgrading from dapper to edgy on two machines (one desktop and one server), I'm experiencing a weird issue... The servers locales have been preserved, but on my desktop they have changed (default locale is suddenly ANSI, and no matter what I do I can't get the two boxes locales to match). Any tips?
[11:17] <Derek__> rickyfingers: well , may i know your concept?
[11:17] <ifireball> Hali_301: ssh/scp and the write/chat command on the shell
[11:17] <rickyfingers> Derek, I'm not sure...like I said, I've only done a clean install
[11:17] <rickyfingers> so I'm not sure about the upgrade
[11:18] <rickyfingers> But I would think the best way to do it would be to run the update off the booted cd
[11:18] <Derek__> rickyfingers: OK , IC , i want to upgrade my dapper
[11:18] <rickyfingers> in stead of just from the desktop
[11:18] <McMadd> ifireball: I'm sure there are lots of better ways to do this. This setup has a bit of a history where an old colleague of mine created a distro on an old KNOPPIX version. This worked great untill the day our client decided to buy other hardware with SATA disks on which the (old) KNOPPIX wouldn't run. The colleague is long gone and I have to fix the problem....
[11:18] <Derek__> rickyfingers: any way , thank you all the same
[11:18] <rickyfingers> Derek: you should make sure you have a good backup of your system before you do the update
[11:19] <rickyfingers> I've heard that some people have had trouble doing the update
[11:19] <rickyfingers> there was a slashdot article about it when they first announced edgy
[11:19] <abhinay> hi there
[11:19] <Derek__> rickyfingers: heehee, thank you ,i will
[11:19] <abhinay> does anybody provide me howto for AIGLX+compiz for edgy ?
[11:19] <incorrect> i take it there is not 'server' edition for version 6.10 ?
[11:20] <incorrect> err whats good engrish
[11:20] <rickyfingers> incorrect: I just installed server edition for 6.10
[11:20] <ifireball> McMadd: you seem to be well on your way of getting it to work; I hope you enjoyed the experiance (the true difference between a Liux user and a guy that just doesn't want to use windws) good luck!
[11:20] <Mantice> Any one know where azureus does when it goes to the system tray ?
[11:21] <PuGz> hey guys. i have installed the firestarter firewall... but now i can't open the gtk window anymore (since I enabled the firewall)... is it blocking root's access to the X server so i cant open the firestarter window with sudo?
[11:21] <kissfire> hellow , i want to ask a problem : why does my ubuntu  have a diffrent time about windows?
[11:21] <incorrect> i must be blind i can't see where to get it from
[11:21] <PuGz> Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
[11:21] <McMadd> ifireball: I surely enjoyd the experience. I learned very much the last few days.
[11:21] <rickyfingers> PuGz, are you trying to start firestarter from the command prompt?
[11:21] <incorrect> oh i see it!
[11:22] <neil__> kissfire: probably because windows is using local time and ubuntu is using UTC
[11:22] <ifireball> PuGz: becasue windows likes to keep the hardware clock set to your local time an Linux likes it to be set to UTC
[11:22] <rickyfingers> Because I've never had a problem starting it from the System->Administration menu
[11:22] <kissfire> neil__: thankyou
[11:22] <incorrect> there just isn't enough blood in my caffeine system
[11:22] <rickyfingers> it just asks me for admin password after I click on it.
[11:22] <ifireball> kissfire: becasue windows likes to keep the hardware clock set to your local time an Linux likes it to be set to UTC
[11:22] <neil__> ifireball: linux gives you the choice
[11:22] <Delkster> PuGz, did you try with with sudo on the command line or with gksudo?
[11:22] <ifireball> neil__: I know that, I wish windows did
[11:23] <kissfire> thankyou
[11:23] <progek> any tomcat/servlet gurus here?
[11:23] <PuGz> rickyfingers: yes
[11:23] <PuGz> ifireball: huh?
[11:24] <PACHON> FIDEL SERRANO MOLLANO
[11:24] <ifireball> PuGz: wrong tabbing, ignore plz.
[11:24] <PuGz> Delkster: it was with sudo
[11:24] <PuGz> ifireball: no probs
[11:24] <wilddragon> hello
[11:24] <kissfire> but what should i do ?
[11:24] <PuGz> Delkster: i will try gksudo
[11:24] <wilddragon> people
[11:24] <wilddragon> can someone help this newbie?
[11:24] <rickyfingers> what's your question, wilddragon?
[11:24] <wilddragon> hello there
[11:24] <wilddragon> hold
[11:25] <PuGz> Delkster: just tried with gksudo... no luck... same error
[11:25] <wilddragon> I just finishedn installing my Ubuntu
[11:25] <wilddragon> I try to dual boot with window xp
[11:25] <neil__> kissfire: i'd say leave it alone. you don't run both OSes at the same time do you?
[11:25] <wilddragon> I read the GAG thing
[11:25] <PuGz> rickyfingers: i just tried from the Administration menu... no luck
[11:25] <PuGz> i am using ubuntu edgy
[11:25] <wilddragon> but I DON't have a floopy drive
[11:25] <wilddragon> now when I restart my system I can't choose to go to XP anymore
[11:25] <Mantice> Any one know where azureus does when it goes to the system tray ?????
[11:25] <McMadd> ifireball: There seems to be no respons on the Xsession file
[11:26] <rickyfingers> wild: You can make a bootable memory sitck but it's not for the faint of heart!
[11:26] <Delkster> PuGz, I don't know... "it should work". Nothing comes to my mind immediately but if your problem is that you now can't connect to something because of the firewall config and can't turn the fw off because it won't let you connect, you can disable the firewall from the command line
[11:26] <PuGz> Mantice: what do you mean?
[11:26] <trondare> hm, after enabling compiz i can't login to gnome, anyone know how to get back to metacity again?
[11:26] <rickyfingers> I just had to make on this morning.
[11:26] <maxb> Is there any documentation on what the new "-generic" kernel actually is and how it is supposed to be used? I have a hyperthreading-capable machine, which would normally mean I'd want a SMP kernel, but there don't seem tp be any kernels explicitly labelled "smp" in the edgy archive.
[11:26] <Delkster> PuGz, if that's what you need,  sudo /etc/init.d/firestarter stop
[11:26] <ifireball> McMadd: what do you mean? also note it should be called ".Xsession" (beginning with a dot)
[11:26] <Delkster> maxb, it already comes with SMP support, afaik
[11:26] <wilddragon> are there instructions on how to make a bootable USB>
[11:27] <neil__> trondare: choose gnome failsafe from the sessions menu of the greeter
[11:27] <PuGz> Delkster: but if i just /etc/init.d/firestarter stop the firewall... does it actually take the commands out of iptables?
[11:27] <crimsun> maxb: -generic has 586 optimizations (as opposed to -386 which has 486) and is smp-enabled. HT is disabled by default due to a security issue.
[11:27] <neil__> trondare: then you can fix the startup in your session
[11:27] <rickyfingers> yep, here's how to do it, but you need a stick that doesn't have anything on it, because
[11:27] <trondare> neil__: ok, will try that, thanks
[11:27] <rickyfingers> you'll need to reformat the stick
[11:27] <Delkster> PuGz, you can try  "sudo iptables -L -n"  to list the currently applied iptables rules
[11:27] <PuGz> Delkster: i just stopped the firewall... no luck
[11:27] <PuGz> Delkster: ok.. will try that
[11:27] <McMadd> ifireball: Ah, that's it. I missread that like ./ meaning it needs to be executable....
[11:27] <maxb> crimsun: .... so it's called generic to stop uniprocessor people wondering why they have a smp kernel installed?
[11:28] <Delkster> PuGz, if it lists no rules and all policies are listed as "accept", there's no firewalling
[11:28] <crimsun> maxb: no, it's called -generic because it's generic for the common modern computer
[11:28] <Delkster> If it lists a lot of stuff, or anything more than the policies, there are at least some rules.
[11:28] <PuGz> Delkster: yep... stopping the firewall sure does remove the policies in iptables
[11:28] <rickyfingers> wild: answer your pm - it'll be easier to chat without the other conversations going on.
[11:28] <neil__> maxb: and it does away with all the pentium, athlon etc. variants too :)
[11:28] <PuGz> Delkster: so problem is not that the firewall is blocking X
[11:28] <trondare> neil__: not even failsafe gnome works :(
[11:29] <PuGz> Delkster: or lo
[11:29] <Delkster> PuGz, apparently not
[11:29] <Delkster> PuGz, does sudo generally work? Does it generally work for GUI applications?
[11:29] <PuGz> Delkster: hmm... maybe i will try deleting the user preferences for it
[11:29] <maxb> I do know about the security issue, but it's not an issue for a single user desktop workstation, AFAIK.
[11:29] <trondare> neil__: the command i used was 'compiz --replace --indirect-rendering --strict-binding'
[11:29] <neil__> trondare: i've never broken gnome that much. sorry, i can't help more
[11:29] <PuGz> Delkster: yep... sudo gedit works fine
[11:29] <trondare> ok, thanks anyways :(
[11:29] <rickyfingers> PuGZ, I had an idea:
[11:29] <PuGz> Delkster: must be the program
[11:30] <coz_> morning morning
[11:30] <trondare> anyone else know how to fix gnome after it being borked by compiz?
[11:30] <neil__> trondare: and you didn't put it into your session startup programs?
[11:30] <PuGz> trondare: i think i do... what have u done exactly?
[11:30] <trondare> pugz: the command i used was 'compiz --replace --indirect-rendering --strict-binding'
[11:30] <crimsun> maxb: we can't take that chance.
[11:30] <trondare> straight from the ubuntu wiki
[11:30] <crimsun> maxb: in any case, you can boot with ht=on
[11:30] <PuGz> trondare: and it failed and now ur gnome looks silly with no window titles?
[11:30] <trondare> now when i try to log in to gnome, nothing happens
[11:30] <Delkster> trondare, did you put the compiz command somewhere so that it would be automatically run on every login?
[11:31] <neil__> trondare: you probably forgot to add "gconf" to the end of the command
[11:31] <trondare> neil__: no, gconf was there as well
[11:31] <trondare> straight from the wiki
[11:31] <PuGz> trondare: oh... u have logged out and cant log in properly
[11:31] <trondare> exactly
[11:31] <PuGz> trondare: different problem from what i thought
[11:31] <wilddragon> hey
[11:31] <maxb> crimsun: Yes, I understand - I meant that I can safely ht=on locally, not that the default should be changed.
[11:31] <wilddragon> how do I Private message with someone
[11:31] <PuGz> trondare: like Delkster said... did u put compiz in the gnome sessions so it automatically gets run when u log in?
[11:31] <wilddragon> rickyfingers: can you help me ?
[11:32] <progek> wilddragon: /msg nick message
[11:32] <wilddragon> or neil: ?
[11:32] <trondare> PuGz: i guess that's what the command does?
[11:32] <progek> what irc client are you using?
[11:32] <PuGz> trondare: no... just running that command at the console doesnt do that i dont think
[11:32] <trondare> PuGz: apparently :)
[11:32] <trondare> at least something is foobared
[11:32] <McMadd> ifireball: Succes! I'm very gratefull!
[11:32] <PuGz> hmm
[11:32] <PuGz> rickyfingers: you have an idea?
[11:33] <trondare> PuGz: well actually, first i did just a 'compiz --replace gconf'
[11:33] <trondare> then i added the indirect thing for aiglx according to the wiki
[11:33] <PuGz> hmmm... that one might save it...
[11:33] <Mantice_> PuGz: wheres does your azureus go when you minimise it ?
[11:33] <ifireball> McMadd: you welcome ;)
[11:33] <PuGz> Mantice_: you using ubuntu and gnome?
[11:33] <Mantice_> Pugz: yeah
[11:34] <wilddragon> Gnome
[11:34] <wilddragon> I guess
[11:34] <trondare> PuGz: when i log in, gnome-settings-daemon is started, looks like that's what's hanging
[11:34] <wilddragon> I dont' even know
[11:34] <neil__> trondare: you might find something relating to compiz in ~/.config/autostart/
[11:34] <PuGz> Mantice_: it should either go to the task bar at the bottom, or the system tray at the top right
[11:34] <Delkster> trondare, the command changes to compiz for the current session but shouldn't change any settings so that the change would also be automatically applied on subsequent sessions.
[11:34] <McMadd> ifireball: where did you find that info on the 'local' xsession file? Maybe I can find some more tweaks from there.
[11:34] <trondare> Delkster, PuGz: i've removed all compiz packages from my system, and i still can't get into gnome
[11:34] <trondare> neil__: will check that now
[11:34] <Mantice_> Pugz: mine should go to the tray but it dont :(
[11:34] <tryggvib> Is anyone here having a problems reading mail with Evolution after upgrading to Edgy. Everytime I want to read mail it scrolls down to the end of the message, so I must always start my scrolling back up. Any idea on how to fix that?
[11:34] <trondare> neil__: no autostart in there
[11:35] <sqeezer> Help please... I have winxp installed in VMWare in ubuntu, when I try to access a shared directory in ubuntu from windows it asks for user and password but does not accept them even though I know they are correct...what am I doing wrong or not doing?
[11:35] <PuGz> trondare: you could try installing another window manager and using it to access the gconf-editor to fix any settings
[11:35] <PuGz> ?
[11:35] <neil__> trondare: where did you put the compiz command?
[11:35] <PuGz> Mantice_: where does it go?
[11:35] <Mantice_> Pugz: it looks like it gets minimised to the workspace :)
[11:35] <trondare> neil__: in a terminal
[11:35] <trondare> PuGz: what would i fix in the editor?
[11:35] <Mantice_> ....
[11:35] <PuGz> trondare: i dunno... perhaps search for some compiz stuff?
[11:35] <neil__> trondare: then i can't see that it would have broken gnome permanently
[11:36] <trondare> neil__: neither can i, but so it did :)
[11:36] <Mantice_> pugz: it runs in the backround but I cant get to it unless I open it up via ubuntu start menu again.
[11:36] <PuGz> Mantice_: is it up in the tray at the top right near you clock?
[11:36] <blinky> hey can anyone give me a link to installing flash player for firefox? I can't find it in the ubuntu wiki
[11:36] <Mantice_> Pugz: no
[11:37] <Delkster> trondare, if you're desperate, you could try deleting or renaming the gnome or gconf configuration directories, but that'd cause the preferences and settings for most of your applications to reset
[11:37] <ifireball> McMadd: essentially its classc Xwindows black-magic... plenty of manpages with "man X" begin a good place to start (uts rather long), also you can read exactly what GDM does when you login in /etc/gdm/Xsession (and the tons of other scripts it invokes)
[11:37] <PuGz> blinky: sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[11:37] <trondare> PuGz / neil__ : any way i could reset _just_ the session settings?
[11:37] <blinky> PuGz, thanks heaps
[11:37] <trondare> i can't afford losing my application settings
[11:37] <PuGz> trondare: dunno sorry
[11:37] <trondare> ok, thanks anyways
[11:37] <neil__> trondare: that's what i've been looking for
[11:37] <Delkster> Mantice_, the Azureus package that comes with Ubuntu does that for me, too: the notification area icon doesn't work. If you manually install Azureus from the original project's site, it works.
[11:37] <Delkster> But that's of course more effort.
[11:38] <PuGz> Delkster: cheers... there ya go
[11:38] <neil__> trondare: does your .xsession-errors file give any clue?
[11:38] <Mantice_> man that's lame they should make every one auto update to latest version.
[11:39] <Mantice_> Delkster: do you have a link to were you got it ?
[11:39] <trondare> neil__: nope :(
[11:39] <trondare> neil__: gnome-settings-daemon starts, but nothing happens after that
[11:39] <trondare> where is the gnome session config stored?
[11:39] <trondare> in gconf?
[11:40] <Delkster> trondare, I can't really help very much with the issue right now because I don't remember the exact filenames and I'm not on my Ubuntu computer now, but you could also check if there's something interesting in /var/log/user.log (or something like that) after a login attempt
[11:40] <wilddragon> hey
[11:40] <wilddragon> how can I chat with someone
[11:40] <wilddragon> privately?
[11:41] <trondare> Delkster: nothing :(
[11:41] <wilddragon> can anyone help me
[11:41] <wilddragon> to set up dual boot thing
[11:41] <trondare> what's the official gnome irc channel?
[11:41] <ifireball> trondare: its mostly stored in your home dir under the .gnome and .gconf hidden directories
[11:41] <Delkster> Mantice_, http://azureus.sf.net
[11:41] <Delkster> It's not as easy to install, though.
[11:41] <trondare> ifireball: you know specifically where in .gnome/.gconf?
[11:42] <Mantice_> Delkster: Thank you.
[11:42] <McMadd> ifireball: I'll start reading man X as bedtime staries :).   One thing that annoys me but is not a problem is a dialog that says "Your session lasted less than 10 seconds yada, yada...." any hints on how to get rid off that?
[11:42] <Delkster> You'll have to manually extract the contents of the archive, place them somewhere and create a shortcut icon to your liking.
[11:43] <Charles> is there anyone here that is on the ubuntu team that will take constructive critism seriously???? Ubuntu decieded to remove ext_skel from the packages becuase of some project called pecl_gen the books i have and tutorials are using ext_skel and i assume there is considerably less documentation for pecl_gen please put ext_skel back in the php-dev package.

[11:45] <Delkster> Charles, since you seem to be knowledgeable about the issue, have you tried reporting a bug? If there's a particular reason for removing it, someone will probably comment on that following the bug report, and if not, it might even produce some results.

[11:46] <bayzider> Well how would I hook up just usb to my computer? cause when I tryed that it didnt work ether
[11:46] <Charles> Delkster, the reason they called it obsolete was becuase of a replacement for it that was in pecl but the books and documentation are out for the other it just seems stupid to remove it when you can have both its made what would be simple some what annoying I will try find the webpage to submit the bug

[12:06] <wilddragon> on 2 other partition
[12:06] <allen2003> Package unrar-free is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[12:06] <allen2003> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[12:06] <allen2003> is only available from another source
[12:06] <allen2003> E: Package unrar-free has no installation candidate
[12:06] <wilddragon> how do I make my system bootable to the screen where I can select what OS I wan to go in
[12:06] <allen2003> woops sorry bout that
[12:06] <turboliv> cge,  okay so u confirm theses options can be use for ubuntu live ?
[12:07] <variant> backtick: you might have to modprobe loop before it will work
[12:07] <cge> turboliv: I don't know, I haven't used a livecd in a long time.
[12:07] <wilddragon> thanks in advance Coz:
=== zen-afk is now known as zenrox
[12:07] <allen2003> gnomefreak i can't install it
[12:07] <gnomefreak> allen2003: what does it say?
[12:07] <torpor> hi can someone help me .. something has happened to my system and i no longer have apps like telinit, shutdown, or reboot .. what package are these in, and how can i find out what package an app is in by searching the repository?
[12:07] <wilddragon> Coz: can we PM?
[12:07] <allen2003> pasted above
[12:07] <variant> wilddragon: the default is to wait for 3 seconds while  you boot so that you can decide, you can change that in /boot/grub.conf (or /boot/menu.lst)
[12:08] <coz_> wilddragon, grub should have been installed when you installed ubuntu, Ubuntu must be installed LAST after windows
[12:08] <allen2003> it sez it's obsolete or wahtever reason
[12:08] <variant> torpor: what did you do to cause this?
[12:08] <turboliv> okay cge  me too but dont have choice 'cause my computer is at university and my girlfriend computer under windows :s
[12:08] <gnomefreak> allen2003: yesterday you had the repos enabled what happened?
[12:08] <Delkster> PuGz, I have no ideas right now either. It works for me.
[12:08] <wilddragon> in the order of
[12:08] <wilddragon> partition?
[12:08] <allen2003> o.o i don't think it work yesterday
[12:08] <torpor> variant: i have no idea .. the last thing i tried to do was remove libmjpeg ..
[12:08] <Delkster> I can't really investigate it right now either.
[12:08] <wilddragon> aw I mess up bad this time
[12:08] <allen2003>  sudo apt-get install unrar <-- how about this one does it do the same thing?
[12:09] <cge> allen2003: Try it!
[12:09] <variant> allen2003: yes, that is the non free package though
[12:09] <wilddragon> coz: can you help me fix?
[12:09] <gnomefreak> allen2003: it will error too but try it
[12:09] <variant> torpor: why were you removing it?
[12:09] <coz_> wilddragon, you have to install windows or any other os BEFORE you instll ubuntu, that wasy grub will pick up on the other OS's you have and when you boot you will get a menu to choose which OS you want to boot into
[12:09] <PuGz> Delkster: hmm... i might be onto something here... will let u know how i go... i think it might be to do with my sudoers file... i have set up a special command for firestarter so i dont need to enter a password to load it (so that i can have it load at gnome start without a password)
[12:09] <torpor> so how do i get my reboot/telinit/shutdown stuff back .. its in some base package, right?  i'm worried that i have destroyed my sysinstall somehow (edgy)
[12:09] <allen2003> installation done gnomefreak....now what to do?
[12:09] <gnomefreak> allen2003: you need to make sure universe is enabled. but has to been since you installed java
[12:09] <variant> coz_: it's is not essential, but reccomended
[12:09] <wilddragon> coz: I did
[12:09] <torpor> variant: because it was not installing properly .. but why would shutdown/reboot have a dependency on libmjpeg?
[12:09] <turboliv> cge,  thanks and i'll retry toram after upgrading ram of my girlfriend's computer
[12:09] <gnomefreak> allen2003: use it on a .rar package
[12:10] <allen2003> ok
[12:10] <wilddragon> coz: I installed Window XP before Edubuntu
[12:10] <variant> torpor: because apt is not perfect
[12:10] <coz_> variant, right but certainly esiest for beginners
[12:10] <variant> coz_: indeed
[12:10] <yuvalz> hi, I'm trying to build a xen0 kernel image from edgy's xen-source-2.6.16 package. I can get the modules to build, but no bzImage
[12:10] <torpor> variant: ARGH!
[12:10] <wilddragon> which I just finished installed 2 hours ago
[12:10] <allen2003> w0000t
[12:10] <variant> torpor: are you sure it has uninstalled them?
[12:10] <coz_> wilddragon, ok and did you install edubuntu as workstation?
[12:10] <allen2003> it work thanks gnomefreak
[12:10] <allen2003> :D
[12:10] <variant> torpor: it would have warned you, you should have said no
[12:10] <torpor> variant: pretty sure: find / -name "reboot" returns nothing ..
[12:10] <gnomefreak> !info unrar
[12:10] <ubotu> unrar: Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version). In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:3.5.4-0.1 (edgy), package size 84 kB, installed size 216 kB
[12:10] <yuvalz> any ideads what I'm missing ?
[12:10] <wilddragon> coz: no
[12:10] <wilddragon> I think I insatlled it as a desktop
[12:10] <torpor> is there a log of apt-get activity i can use somehwere to find out where this went wrong?
[12:10] <gnomefreak> allen2003: you do have universe enabled right?
[12:11] <wilddragon> I was installing it in the graphic safe moed
[12:11] <wilddragon> I don't actually know
[12:11] <wilddragon> coz: whether it's a workstation
[12:11] <allen2003> yes gnomefreak it i can extract it now
[12:11] <wilddragon> or something else
[12:11] <coz_> wilddragon, well I havn't tried edubuntu as a client install, so i have no idea if grub is installed during that process, however, the worksation install I believe does install grub, perhaps someone here wouold know if that is true
[12:11] <wilddragon> GRUB
[12:11] <wilddragon> is that an application?
[12:12] <variant> torpor: apt-get install libmjpeg again
[12:12] <Delkster> PuGz, you know, you shouldn't need to have the Firestarter GUI running under Gnome just to have firewalling enabled
[12:12] <cge> wilddragon: The Grand Unified Boot Loader. The thing that lets you select what you want to boot into. It is an application, but not as most people know it.
[12:12] <jesus\> variant: I changed permissions on /etc/skel and all subfolders, but that didn't affect the existing users
[12:12] <wilddragon> thanks
[12:12] <torpor> variant: but wtf, shutdown et al use libmjpeg?
[12:12] <wilddragon> how can I insatlled it now
[12:13] <jesus\> deleting the users (and their homedir) and recreating them has no effect either
[12:13] <Delkster> The firestarter script in /etc/init.d/ should enable the rules on every boot regardless of whether you have the GUI started.
[12:13] <variant> torpor: no it does not
[12:13] <Delkster> (it doesn't work for me, though, but I haven't had time to look into it)
[12:13] <allen2003> now i can unrar! woot
[12:13] <variant> jesus\: no, it wouldnt
[12:13] <coz_> wilddragon, someone here can help with that
[12:13] <variant> jesus\: that file is copied to the new /home/ directorys when creating users only
[12:13] <backtick> variant: which image should I use? the cdrom image or the one in the "casper/" folder on the live cd?
[12:13] <allen2003> hey gnomefreak
[12:13] <torpor> but what i want to know is how can i search the repositories for shutdown/halt/reboot/telinit?
[12:13] <variant> backtick: the cdrom i presume
[12:14] <allen2003> why i can't download the latest software list on add/remove it always fails?
[12:14] <cge> Does anyone know when #ubuntu+1 will be back?
[12:14] <jesus\> variant: well, i deleted the user, removed the homedir, created the user again, and i can still access his files
[12:14] <wilddragon> thanks coz
[12:14] <Delkster> torpor, you mean searching the repositories for files?
[12:14] <variant> jesus\: how did you change the permissions
[12:14] <Delkster> That is, for packages that contain certain files?
[12:14] <wilddragon> cge: can you help me?
[12:14] <variant> jesus\: what permissions exactly did you set
[12:14] <torpor> Delkster: yeah .. i want to know what to re-install to get halt/shutdown/reboot. ..
[12:14] <cge> wilddragon: What is the problem?
[12:14] <jesus\> variant: 700
[12:15] <gnomefreak> allen2003: what up?
[12:15] <coz_> wilddragon, well ididn't give too much info but i hope things work out, I also have used edubuntu and find it is a real great version
[12:15] <Delkster> torpor, you can use the web package browser at http://packages.ubuntu.com to search for packages containing certain files
[12:15] <Delkster> You could also check out the apt-file package
[12:15] <backtick> variant: i'm downloaded the xubuntu iso.. same image cd boot goes for ubuntu and xubuntu?
[12:15] <cge> torpor: Are you running Dapper or Edgy?
[12:16] <cge> torpor: Or feisty? :)
[12:16] <Delkster> torpor, if you have the package already installed, you can also do  "dpkg --search filename" in the terminal to see what package has installed that file
[12:16] <jesus\> i really don't get why adding a user would let him access all user's files
[12:16] <jesus\> that's just not logical
[12:16] <torpor> cge: edgy
[12:16] <allen2003> gnomefreak:  im keep getting error on my add/remove
[12:16] <cheste> ko ai algien por ei
[12:16] <Delkster> But that won't work if you don't have it installed, so in that case you need either apt-file or the web-based search.
[12:16] <fassfjai> j #ubuntu-it
[12:16] <allen2003> it ask me to get latest software list then it fails
[12:17] <gnomefreak> allen2003: what is the error?
[12:17] <cge> torpor: Run sudo apt-get install --reinstall upstart
[12:17] <allen2003> cannot get the package.tgz or .gz
[12:17] <torpor> cge thanks
[12:17] <torpor> but i guess is hould be worried about doing a reboot now ..
[12:17] <cheste> algien KE ABLE ESPAOL
[12:17] <gnomefreak> allen2003: in terminal run sudo apt-get update
[12:17] <torpor> is there a way to re-install the base system packages?
[12:18] <cge> torpor: Not really. Now that upstart is there, those commands aren't really that important any more.
[12:18] <variant> torpor: did you try remerging base-install ?
[12:18] <torpor> variant: no.
[12:18] <allen2003> ok
[12:18] <variant> torpor: sorrym wrong distro.. re apt-getting i mean
[12:18] <torpor> so is that apt-get install --reinstall base-instsall?
[12:18] <variant> torpor: see what it wants to isntall int he list of package first
[12:19] <torpor> apt-get install --reinstall base-install < == no such package?
[12:19] <Lathiat> try ubuntu-minimal ?
[12:20] <variant> torpor: sorry again, thats base-config
[12:20] <Lathiat> hrm no nevermind
[12:20] <Lathiat> youd need to generate a list of packages if you want to reinstall "all" of the packages
[12:20] <minimec> Hi folks. I am playing around with baryl and emerald. Can you tell me how to use the gnome theme widgets with Baryl. I only get the gnome ddefault theme with the 'ugly' default icons.
[12:20] <allen2003> gnomefreak:
[12:20] <allen2003> Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
[12:20] <torpor> okay i'm going to reboot now ...
[12:20] <Lathiat> perhaps: dpkg --get-selections | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n32 apt-get install --reinstall
[12:20] <torpor> if this doesn't survive i don't know what i do..
[12:20] <variant> torpor: apt-get install --reinstall upstart
[12:21] <variant> torpor: that will fix it
[12:21] <torpor> okay, ive got reboot now .. and i'm rebooting this machine
[12:21] <torpor> lets see if it survives.

[12:21] <torpor> to be honest i'm pretty much ready to give up and do a full system re-install .. stupid fucking NVIDIA driver shits.
[12:21] <variant>  torpor watch your language please
[12:22] <linuxwolf> hi
[12:22] <allen2003> gnomefreak:  >_>

[12:26] <sobersabre> hi, I need 2 things to do: 1. to optimize my laptop to boot faster, 2. to fix a usplash setup.
[12:27] <sobersabre> let's start with 2.
[12:27] <sobersabre> :)
[12:27] <sobersabre> I once installed a package named 'kubuntu-desktop'
[12:27] <sobersabre> this made the usplash image to be blue.
[12:27] <sobersabre> by default it has been brown.
[12:27] <allen2003> berb
[12:27] <sobersabre> then I did the same with xubuntu-desktop
[12:28] <sobersabre> then the boot image was gray
[12:28] <sobersabre> I want the boot image to be brown again.
[12:28] <sobersabre> how do I achieve this ?
[12:28] <torpor> whats the name of the ubuntu disk manager (for adding a new disk to my system) again?  i always fortget ..
[12:28] <sobersabre> torpor fdisk ?
[12:28] <torpor> i don't want to use fdisk if i can get a GUI-based one ..
[12:28] <gnomefreak> allen2003: you need to enable universe
[12:28] <gnomefreak> !universe | allen2003
[12:28] <torpor> i have to show this to other users, and would prefer not to have them use terminal, ever ..
[12:28] <ubotu> allen2003: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[12:29] <sobersabre> torpor r do you mean the 'logical volume manager' ?
[12:29] <torpor> sobersabre: i don't know what i mean, i just remember that there was some GUI tool for formatting a newly added disk to the system ..
[12:29] <cge> torpor: In edgy, there is only GParted.
[12:29] <sobersabre> torpor there's gparted - a partition editor with GUI
[12:29] <torpor> and this lets me format, etc?
[12:29] <sobersabre> it also allows to format the partitions you create with it
[12:29] <cge> torpor: Yes
[12:29] <wilddrago3> Hellow Everyone
[12:29] <_Rappy_> when I boot my laptop with dual WinXP and Ubuntu, ubuntu is always the default choice starting when time runs out. How/where do I change this, so that Win is default?
[12:29] <torpor> thanks.
[12:29] <wilddrago3> Can anyone help me
[12:29] <torpor> i'll look it up and use it ..
[12:29] <wilddrago3> with
[12:30] <wilddrago3> Dual boot problem
[12:30] <sobersabre> torpor apt-get install gparted
[12:30] <cge> sobersabre: Hah, you're just like me. You come here with a question, and no one answers, but you get pulled into answering other people :)
[12:30] <snerge> _Rappy_: look in /boot/grub/menu.lst or something like that
[12:30] <_Rappy_> snerge : tahnks alot :D
[12:30] <snerge> _Rappy_:  you can change the "default" value
[12:30] <sobersabre> cge, I don't know if I am like you... are you a good thing to be alike ?
[12:30] <sobersabre> :)
[12:30] <torpor> ok
[12:30] <torpor> thanks for the help everyone, i really appreciate it ..
[12:30] <snerge> _Rappy_: make sure you don't mess the file or you might have problem booting :P
[12:31] <sobersabre> torpor paypal, donate ... duh
[12:31] <sobersabre> :)
[12:31] <snerge> _Rappy_: always good to keep a copy before making a change
[12:31] <_Rappy_> snerge, ok will to! Thanks again :)
[12:31] <torpor> sobersabre: already bought ubuntu a few times!
[12:31] <snerge> _Rappy_: pleasure
[12:31] <sobersabre> hmm... he gave me no  choice to explain it is a joke.
[12:31] <cge> sobersabre: Well, it isn't a very good way to be, because you're questions usually don't get answered, and you end up spending too much time helping people here. But as for you second question, you want to run "sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so"
[12:31] <B|nTaRa> !ntfs-3g
[12:31] <gnomefreak> allen2003: ill be right back i need to see if something is fixed

[12:32] <PuGz> Delkster: i don't know why... but i have fixed it. i just added "xhost +local:" to my sessions file before i start firestarter. i dont know why this works considering that sudo gedit worked fine... but i wont complain :)

[12:46] <Mantice_> I tried to get Audiance or something like that working but it had no media plug-ins
[12:46] <Paulio-at_work> Hi, does anyone know about logical partitions and devices greater than sdb10?
[12:46] <sobersabre> Paulio-at_work ... que passo ? what do you mean ?
[12:47] <ajax4> My sound was working today and all of a sudden stopped working (Dapper). Anyone hear of recent reports of this problem?
[12:47] <sobersabre> ajax4 ... have you muted the master channel ?
[12:48] <ajax4> sobersabre: Nope, plus I created a new user and logged on. Same problem. Plus it occurs even on the GDM startup/login page.
[12:49] <sobersabre> ajax4 .... is this sound device an on-board device ?
[12:49] <Paulio-at_work> cheers,  have a secondary scsi disk partitioned with 8 partitions, 1 primary and 7 logical (sda5 - sda11) there is no problem mounting and making a filesytem up to sdb10, but sdb11 just says no device
[12:49] <ajax4> sobersabre: No, its an add-on card with the on-board diabled.
[12:49] <ajax4> (disabled)
[12:49] <MM2> sobersabre: I rebooted and usb kbd and mouse are still dead...
[12:50] <sobersabre> Paulio-at_work it doesn't matter how many partitions you have on sdb. it also matters how many device files you have in /dev
[12:50] <MM2> sobersabre: grub worked fine with kbd
[12:50] <sobersabre> Paulio-at_work  maybe you need to add more block devices sdb11 etc.
[12:50] <sobersabre> read about mknod usage
[12:50] <sobersabre> or, maybe read about udev usage.
[12:51] <sobersabre> MM2, so windows also has problem with this wireless gear ?
[12:51] <Paulio-at_work> yep, the partition is created fine using cfdisk,  but have added the block device (with correct params?) and still no joy
[12:51] <MM2> sobersabre: no, just Ubuntu
[12:51] <gonzoism> i'm having the problem with eth0 and eth1 switching.  the mac addresses on the cards are the same, so i can't use /etc/iftab to fix it.  anyone have a suggestion ?
[12:51] <ajax4> gonzoism: The MAC addresses on the cards can't be the same.
[12:52] <sobersabre> MM2, I asked you to reboot into windows - to see if after the problem occured in ubuntu it is replicated or not in windows.
[12:52] <Mantice_> Wow I found a good media player.
[12:52] <sobersabre> gonzoism you are dunny :)
[12:52] <sobersabre> Mantice_ amarok ?
[12:52] <MM2> sobersabre: I rebooted to windows, and no problems
[12:52] <sobersabre> hmm... s/dunny/funny/
[12:52] <ajax4> sobersabre: Any thoughts on my problem?
[12:52] <sobersabre> MM2 then there needs to be done some tuning.
[12:52] <gonzoism> also, how do i load the lice script in epic ?
[12:52] <Mantice_> Its something that deserves to be in the repository's  its called Audacious.
[12:53] <baastrup> will the new nvidia drivers be added to the restricted modules in edgy ?
[12:53] <MM2> sobersabre: I know, but what kind of tuning?
[12:53] <ketsugi> mmm, lice
[12:53] <gonzoism> or any script
[12:53] <PecisDarbs> anyone else very crashy Firefox when accessing some Flash animation using sites?
[12:53] <gonzoism> sobersabre: dunny ?
[12:53] <ajax4> PecisDarbs: It happens to me sometimes, but not often.
[12:54] <gonzoism> ajax4: the mac addresses on the cards ARE the same.  i'm sure
[12:54] <Paulio-at_work> the command I used was "mknod -m660 sdb11 b 8 27".  However i noticed the default group was root and changed this to 'disk'
[12:55] <sobersabre> d is close to f
[12:55] <bimberi> PecisDarbs: try adding "export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" to /etc/firefox/firefoxrc (ref: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 )
[12:55] <Mantice_> sobersaber: amarok looks nice.
[12:55] <sobersabre> MM2 look for misc repeat rates, and serial protocols related to usb
[12:56] <sobersabre> Mantice_ amarok is the player.
[12:56] <sobersabre> i mean THE player.
[12:56] <Mantice_> THE player ?
[12:56] <sobersabre> has a few glitches
[12:56] <sobersabre> but it is a good one.

[12:56] <ajax4> gonzoism: No two networking cards, no matter what brand or model will ever have the same MAC address.
[12:56] <Mantice_> I hate itunes I love winamp
[12:56] <MM2> sobersabre: where to start? howtos?
[12:56] <gonzoism> sobersabre lol, what is duffy ?
[12:56] <sobersabre> especially if you have a large collection ( of several tens of GB ) and you run an exernal DB ( not SQLite )
[12:57] <Mantice_> I dont like most of the winamp clones.
[12:57] <gonzoism> ajax4: mine do...  would you like to see the output from ifconfig ?
[12:57] <sobersabre> gonzoism I said "dunny"... it is "funny" with a typo
[12:57] <gonzoism> ah. :)
[12:57] <Mantice_> does amarok tag ?
[12:57] <Lord_Dicranius> no two NICs, will ever have the same address? there's only a certain amount of combinations available
[12:58] <sobersabre> Lord_Dicranius MAC address is something that can be configured.
[12:58] <Lord_Dicranius> true, but ajax4 didn't say that
[12:58] <gonzoism> Mantice_: yeah, and there is a plugin to tag them automatically from musicbrainz or somewhere.
[12:58] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: the amount is large enough it seems
[12:59] <Lord_Dicranius> ifireball: what's large enough?
[12:59] <gonzoism> every mac address on every nic in this building is the same... :)
=== pc3 is now known as cw
[12:59] <Mantice_> gonzoism: Music brainz was good to tag most of my collection but the scroll feature is bugged in windows id be scrolling down so much just to tag one song.
[12:59] <McMadd> ifireball: any idea how to "hide" the mouse cursor? Apart from touchscreen calibration that's my last problem..
[01:00] <ajax4> I'm not an expert at networking...but my understanding was that every NIC you buy will have a different MAC address. That's not true?
[01:00] <Lord_Dicranius> ajax4: nope, I ran into this problem when I bought new NICs for the place I worked at
[01:00] <gonzoism> ajax4: yeah, by default.  i set the mac address in them using ifconfig.
[01:00] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: 42bit afaik; alos different manufacturere have different numeric ranges so they won't collide
[01:01] <deepak> how to use drawing tools in openoffice.org writer
[01:01] <adam_> wazzah
[01:01] <ajax4> According to Wikipedia, there are 281,474,976,710,656 possible MAC addresses...is that not enough so we have to repeat them?
[01:01] <gonzoism> so anyone know another way to keep eth0 and eth1 from switching across reboots other than /etc/iftab ?
[01:01] <Lord_Dicranius> ifireball: true that each manufacturer is given a range, but that just goes to show how narrow their scope is.  eventually they're going to have to start repeating if they wanna stay in business
[01:02] <deff> y
=== cw is now known as CO_COOL_SMA17
[01:02] <deepak> where drawing tools options in writer?
[01:02] <ifireball> McMadd: I suppose you can setup a transparent cursor with one tool or another, I never tried that though
[01:02] <gonzoism> or even to keep the modules for the eth cards from being automatically loaded at boot ?
[01:03] <ajax4> gonzoism: Post your ifconfig files on pastebin
[01:03] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: as long as they make sure that NICs with similar number don't end up on the same line we're sdafe
[01:03] <gonzoism> McMadd: yeah, the unclutter command can make the cursor disappear unless its moving
[01:03] <jazzrocker> php compile is not working now that i actually told it to try building the apache2 module...
[01:03] <jazzrocker> http://pastebin.ca/244932
[01:03] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: I meen LAN
[01:03] <jazzrocker> any ideas?
[01:03] <jazzrocker> i did a dist upgrade from breezy to dapper
[01:03] <gonzoism> ajax4: ifconfig eth0 hw ether 34:52:8C:F3:D0:B8
[01:04] <gonzoism> ajax4:  that does it.  any address would work as long as its valid
[01:04] <ajax4> gonzoism: Pastebin the output
[01:04] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: also not the so far, a 23bit range of number has been enough for the whoel world, LANs tend to be considerably smaller
[01:04] <gonzoism> ajax4: why do you want the output ?  i guess i will..  what is pastebin url ?
[01:05] <ajax4> Lord_Dicranius: If you're a networking guru, you may disagree...I am not...but the Wikipedia article says that every NIC has a unique "burned in" MAC address, which can be overrided on a LAN by the administrator.
[01:05] <McMadd> gonzoism: how, when where do I find, execute that 'unclutter' ?
[01:05] <ajax4> !pastebin
[01:05] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[01:05] <Lord_Dicranius> ifireball: unless you speak with a representative everytime you buy a NIC, and verify with them that they're not going to send you a NIC with the same MAC as any other NIC that's already on your network, it's not impossible to get a NIC with the same MAC
[01:05] <gonzoism> McMadd:  apt-get install unclutter
[01:05] <Lord_Dicranius> ajax4: I'm not trying to put you down or anything, I'm telling you from experience that it happens
[01:06] <gonzoism> McMadd: i think its in the regular ubuntu repos.  did it install ?
[01:06] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: NICs sold on the private market are but a fraction compared to the amount of NICs sold in bulk to organisations
[01:06] <gonzoism> Lord_Dicranius: they are already recycling the mac addresses ?
[01:07] <ajax4> Lord_Dicranius: And I'm not trying to be argumentative, but I don't think NICs are ever burned in with the same MAC address...they may be changed locally, though.
[01:07] <Lord_Dicranius> ajax4: you're right, they can be changed, but there are dupes out there straight from the factory
[01:07] <Lord_Dicranius> gonzoism: some companies are yes
[01:08] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: I've worked with many LANs for a few years now, some of them rather big, I've never ever seen a MAC collision, worst case, like its been said, you acn manullay change a MAC loaclly if you want to
[01:08] <McMadd> gonzoism: need to change networking first
[01:08] <ajax4> Lord_Dicranius: I suppose manufacturing errors are possible, but I've never heard of that happening.
[01:08] <gonzoism> ajax4: done.  under name duplicate_mac_address
[01:08] <ajax4> gonzoism: What's the URL
[01:08] <ajax4> ?
[01:08] <Lord_Dicranius> ifireball: I ran into 2 cases with bulk purchases in the last 4 years
[01:08] <ifireball> Lord_Dicranius: luckey you :P
[01:09] <ajax4> ifireball: Do you know how to change the MAC locally under Linux?
[01:09] <Lord_Dicranius> ifireball: lol it was an experience, good and bad....we were waiting on those for some time....

[01:09] <pjk384> in connecting ubuntu to netware
[01:09] <ifireball> ajax4: its ususally a hardware thing afaik. i think you can change it with ifconfig thouh
[01:10] <gonzoism> ajax4: i pasted the command to do it above.  the command i use
[01:10] <ajax4> ifireball: Can you look at Gonzo's pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30833/

[01:12] <ifireball> gonzoism: wrong tabbing, that last line was ment for you...
[01:12] <gonzoism> ifireball: yeah
[01:12] <ajax4> ifireball: He says they are, but if so why does the first one have the address of 10.0.0.1?

=== satu_aja is now known as CW
[01:13] <gonzoism> oh
[01:13] <[GuS] > Bonjour...
[01:13] <gonzoism> no.  those are different networks.    but every other machine on the lan has the same mac
[01:13] <McMadd> gonzoism: it installed, I'm now checking the options. I have to have it hidden all the time (using it on a touchscreen)
[01:13] <ifireball> gonzoism, ajax4: anctually its common on sun machines to have one MAC address for all the NICs in the box set by the system controller, maybe your hardware/os here is trying to behave in a smiliar fashion
[01:14] <gonzoism> McMadd: how did it do ?
[01:14] <ifireball> gonzoism: are thos wired or wireless cards?
[01:14] <gonzoism> wired
[01:14] <gonzoism> i'll do the same with wireless when i get wireless this week
[01:15] <gonzoism> so, no one has an alternative method for keeping eth1 and eth0 from switching across reboots ?
[01:15] <McMadd> gonzoism: I think it will work. I'm now adding it to my .xsession.
[01:15] <erUSUL> gonzoism: man iftab
[01:15] <ifireball> gonzoism: w8 you set thos MACs yourself? why oh why?
[01:16] <kraudio> hi all
[01:16] <gonzoism> ifireball: why the hell not ?  (go kinky !)
[01:16] <ajax4> erUSUL: He syas he can't use iftab cuz both NICs have the same MAC address
[01:17] <McMadd> gonzoism: works like a charm...
[01:17] <gonzoism> :)
[01:17] <erUSUL> ajax4: !!!??? MAC adresses are hardware specific in teary is unique for every single chip
[01:17] <ifireball> gonzoism: well, its gonan be troubl if you actually want the machine talking to each other, also this is brobably a good way to reduce a good switch to behaving like a hub ad causing network collisions
[01:17] <gonzoism> erUSUL:   thanks,  i can specify by which driver and other ways too.
[01:17] <ajax4> erUSUL: That's what I told 'em :) We're having a running "discussion" about that.
[01:18] <gonzoism> ifireball: i don't have a switch, only hubs, and they all talk fine. i get 1 mb/sec across them
[01:18] <ajax4> erUSUL: His ifconfig file is posted at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30833/ if you want to see
[01:19] <ifireball> gonzoism: do you also get it when transmitting simutaniously between 2 pairs of machines?
[01:19] <gonzoism> ifireball:  yes
[01:19] <erUSUL> gonzoism: have you posted your lspci -v ??
[01:20] <wildchild> which program is playing files like mediaplayer on the internet: x-mplayer2 maybe?
[01:20] <gonzoism> erUSUL: no.  what would you want to see in it ?
[01:20] <ifireball> gonzoism:  "collisions:17887" there it is right on your ifconfig...
[01:21] <erUSUL> gonzoism: the two eth cards that have the same MAC adress
[01:21] <gonzoism> ifireball: yeah, but its a hub.  everything is a collision
[01:22] <ifireball> gonzoism: actually many modern hubs support full duplex, e.g. they at least manage to not have one machine collide with the other that is answering it, kind of a shame to lose that
[01:23] <gonzoism> ifireball: i'll check it out right now
[01:23] <ifireball> gonzoism: I really can't see a purpose to that setup of yours, but if you're happy with the performance... well... have it your way
[01:25] <gonzoism> ifireball: i'll check and see if changing it is any better.  i've never noticed a slowdown though.  but i'm checking...  i am glad you pointed it out to me.
[01:26] <ajax4> gonzoism: Check out the man page for iftab...look for the "arp" selector...could that be of any help?
[01:26] <ifireball> gonzoism: i think there is some switch-combo to netstat to let you track collisions in real-time, look into it
[01:27] <gonzoism> ajax4:  yeah, i saw in the man page i can identify them by driver.  i'm gonna do that.  also you can id them by other stuff
[01:28] <gonzoism> thanks yall
[01:28] <gonzoism> and i'm glad i got a chance to amuse yall. :)
[01:28] <ajax4> gonzoism: good luck :)
[01:28] <NET||abuse> hmm, i killed a shell session by mistake (just closed the gnome-terminal tab) was in the middle of doing an lftp mirror -R,,, can i get that session back off theremote machine?
[01:29] <NET||abuse> now this was me ssh'd to a remote server then lftp'ing from that server to a 3rd machine
[01:29] <allen2003> hey ubuntu
[01:29] <gonzoism> i got another one yall will probably be able to answer easily.  i want to add kde.  do i have to apt-get every single one, (kde-base, etc etc) or is there a bundle ?

[01:30] <NET||abuse> i shoulda screen'd it :(
[01:30] <gonzoism> NET||abuse: were you in screen ?  i use screen.  i love it
[01:30] <gonzoism> :)
[01:30] <NET||abuse> no :( i just didn't bother this time.. stupid
[01:30] <NET||abuse> but it's sitting in the process list like it's still running
[01:31] <ajax4> Anyone know of where I can find a log that shows which updates I recently got from the "update manager" ?
[01:31] <gonzoism> here is something i like.  i installed aterm, and for a shell, i use the command: aterm -trsb -tr -tn xterm -sr -sl 5000 -fn 12x24 -fade 30% +sk -sh 70 -fg red -e screen -D -RR
[01:31] <gonzoism> but gnome-terminal -e screen -D -RR  would do the same  or konsole or whatever

[01:35] <gonzoism> ajax4:   how come ?
[01:36] <fishsticks> its a quick fix more than anything, and its broken my system
[01:36] <robod2> i have added the repositories as explained here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingCompiz
[01:36] <ajax4> gonzoism: Probably something to do with what fishsticks said.
[01:36] <robod2> but ... apt-get install compiz compiz-gnome complains about failed dependencies
[01:36] <robod2> and it won't work
[01:36] <fishsticks> if you are n00b, its good - but its better to learn how to do the things that automatix does vs having it do it for youy
[01:36] <robod2> anyone/
[01:36] <gonzoism> ah.  i like it because its simple and fast, but i've only used a few out of it.
[01:36] <ajax4> robod2: Go to #ubuntu-xgl for help with compiz
[01:36] <robod2> ajax4: thanks
[01:36] <ajax4> robod2: np...also look into Beryl instead
[01:37] <fishsticks> gonzoism: some people have complained that you can't dist-upgrade with it, too

[01:37] <TritonX> xgm: alt-f1
[01:37] <Mando> small problem here
[01:38] <mike1o> i cant access my sshfs mounted folder without root permissions...
[01:38] <gonzoism> xgm  use aterm ! :) its great
[01:38] <borked> are any of you willing to help me with partitioning/recovery?
[01:38] <Mando> i've upgraded to edgy
[01:38] <mike1o> !sshfs
[01:38] <ubotu> sshfs: filesystem client based on SSH File Transfer Protocol. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.6-1 (edgy), package size 29 kB, installed size 116 kB
[01:38] <Mando> and now my x server doesnt start
[01:38] <ajax4> borked: I'd recommend downloading gparted and making a boot cd
[01:38] <Mando> my laptop screen turns off
[01:38] <Mando> and i get sometimes an error saying no monitor found or something like that
[01:39] <tombott> Mando : can you load recovery mode ?
[01:39] <Mando> yeah
[01:39] <tombott> Mando: load recovery mode, then at prompt type startx
[01:40] <Mando> well x doesnt start.. i get a black screen..
[01:40] <Mando> no output to the monitor
[01:40] <tombott> ok
[01:40] <Mando> i used to solve this problem in dapper by adding a line to xorg.cong
[01:40] <Mando> conf*
[01:40] <robod2> ajax4: yes, xgl and beryl work on geforce 2 and geforce 4
[01:40] <Mando> MonitorLayout  "LVDS,Auto"
[01:40] <robod2> ajax4: but aixgl (which is different) do not
[01:41] <Mando> but not there seems to be a problem with that line in edgy
[01:41] <tombott> in recovery mode : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:41] <borked> I tried upgrading from dapper to edgy and in the middle of apt-get --dist-upgrade I got a multitude of errors, re-ran dist upgrade and in the middle of that the power went out, now I can only boot to my machine using an old kernel version, no x
[01:41] <tombott> this will reconfigure xerver
[01:41] <Mando> yeah i did that.. no use
[01:41] <ajax4> robod2: I didn't have any luck getting xgl/compiz to work...so I used xgl/beryl and it worked. But #ubuntu-xgl are the guys to talk to about that stuff.
[01:41] <borked> and can't run any aps like locate etc..
[01:41] <tombott> Mando: what make model is your laptop ? what graphics card does it have?
[01:41] <Mando> acer aspire 1692WLMi.. ATI X700 Mobility Radeon
[01:42] <borked> I need to figure out how to save my music and work data, put them on a partition and do a fresh install
[01:42] <tombott> Mando: right same as me
[01:42] <Mando> do you have edgy working?
[01:42] <tombott> Mando: you need to install the fglrx drivers
[01:42] <fiveiron> if ubuntu is going to detect my wifi card, would it do it when booting the liveCD, or do i have to install it to make sure that works
[01:42] <fiveiron> ?
[01:42] <tombott> Mando: yeah took a while though
[01:42] <gonzoism> can anyone suggest like a tutorial for building packages for ubuntu so i can share the stuff i'm doing with everyone ?  and also make packages for apt-get that i'm not able to find ?
[01:42] <Mando> i used to have the fglrx drivers installed on dapper
[01:43] <tombott> madno: sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
[01:43] <ajax4> borked: Do you have your home files on their own partition separate from the root partition?
[01:43] <tombott> sorry Mando: sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
[01:43] <borked> ajax4: no they are all in my home dir
[01:43] <fiveiron> anyone?
[01:43] <Mando> i think i have the ati driver installer
[01:43] <borked> I just used the default partition scheme
[01:43] <Mando> that should work too right?
[01:43] <gonzoism> does anyone know about making packages for ubuntu community, or for ubuntu ?
[01:43] <tombott> Mando : it won't work
[01:44] <ajax4> borked: But is your home dir on the same partition as the root partition?
[01:44] <tombott> Mando : but fglrx does
[01:44] <borked> ajax4 as far as I know, yes
[01:44] <gonzoism> i want to make packages
[01:44] <tombott> Mando: so install fglrx then  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:44] <Mando> ok will try this and be back soon
[01:44] <ajax4> borked: Post your fstab file to the pastebin website and let me check it out
[01:45] <borked> ajax4 that is going to be difficult: i popped in a new HD to come here to seek help
[01:45] <tombott> fiveiron : yes you should see in live
[01:45] <borked> err, old HD rather
[01:45] <ajax4> borked: Why not just boot off the livecd?
[01:45] <tombott> fiveiron : but edgy network tool for wifi is crap
[01:45] <borked> ajax4 I hadn't though of that
[01:45] <borked> I do not have the live cd
[01:46] <borked> I'll need to dl/burn it
[01:46] <ajax4> borked: Well the Dapper installation CD is a livecd, if you have that.
[01:46] <tombott> fiveiron : your better off installing NetworkManager - it detects wireless connections and lets you connect
[01:46] <ajax4> ajax4: Anyway, can't you copy all your home files to that old hard drive?
[01:46] <borked> i've been using ubuntu since breezy preview.. never had a problem until now
[01:47] <borked> ajax4; no I only have one hd cable
[01:47] <borked> it's a real old machine
[01:47] <poopscoop> hey... I've messed up my GRUB... badly... problem is, I messed up the server grub and the server is not within reach :S
[01:47] <poopscoop> Anyone here with remote server experience who could shed some light?
[01:47] <TritonX> poopscoop : ohoh
[01:47] <apokryphos> !grub | poopscoop
[01:47] <ubotu> poopscoop: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[01:47] <Majic> Oh god I love Beryl.  I was just watching yall chat while I was zoomed out and rotating through workspaces.
[01:47] <borked> does not have a plug for master/slave only master
[01:47] <TritonX> poopscoop : do you know what state the server is in ?
[01:47] <Majic> It's like a fraking theater!
[01:48] <TritonX> poopscoop: try pinging it first
[01:48] <ajax4> borked: On my system I have a partition that I store all the root (system) files on...then a separate partition everything under /home...if disaster strikes I can just format and reinstall the system on the root partition and the home files aren't touched.
[01:48] <poopscoop> TritonX, I can acess the server through the DRAC5 card
[01:48] <hakrzcode> poopscoop, I would put in a few prayers before sleep. Lesson learned: Do not do remote reboots while doing maintenance.
[01:48] <borked> ajax4 good idea, that is what I need to do but I have avoided learning how to partition
[01:49] <borked> ajax4 is it possible to partition my existing drive and move things around so I can effectively do the same?
[01:49] <poopscoop> I did that prayer a few days ago :S hakrzcode
[01:49] <ajax4> borked: If all your stuff is on a single partition you have to copy them off to a different one somehow. The easiest would be to get another drive cable and hook up your other HD.
[01:49] <TritonX> poopscoop: have no idea what this is
[01:49] <xgm> how to configure a term ?
[01:49] <xgm> how to configure aterm ?
[01:49] <poopscoop> I get a error 21 message and than the whole thing just stops
[01:50] <poopscoop> I'm starting to think I have to physically godown there and reinstall
[01:50] <hakrzcode> poopscoop: error 21 from grub?
[01:50] <sobersabre> hmm... how do I append to each text line of a file a given string with vim ?
[01:50] <poopscoop> yea, and after I tried to fix it, it got worse ...
[01:50] <sobersabre> I am trying to:
[01:50] <borked> ajax4 the other prob I have is 30+ GB of data and music on that HD.. this is the only other HD I have and it is 20GB
[01:50] <borked> :(
[01:50] <sobersabre> :%s/.^*$/bla-&/g
[01:51] <sobersabre> which isn't correct
[01:51] <poopscoop> error 21 is for a disk it can't find or something rather
[01:51] <ajax4> borked: Got a lot of blank DVD-R/RWs handy :)
[01:51] <ajax4> ?
[01:51] <mike1o> i cant access my sshfs mounted folder without root permissions...
[01:51] <hakrzcode> poopscoop: is your hd in a hardware raid slot?
[01:51] <borked> ajax4 have a 4x cdrom burner
[01:51] <borked> lol
[01:51] <TritonX> poop: can you remote ssh ? did you tried to reboot the server after screwing grub, if so you can't do ....
[01:51] <borked> <-- screwed
[01:52] <ajax4> borked: You could burn them, though its a pain in the ass.
[01:52] <poopscoop> hakrzcode: not sure, its a dell PowerEdge 1950. Pretty new fancy stuff
[01:52] <borked> not to mention the fact that I can't use any apps on that HD now
[01:52] <TritonX> poop: error 21 sound like no host found... could it be
[01:52] <hakrzcode> poopscoop: I am currently looking at ->https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/grub/+bug/8978
[01:52] <borked> ajax4: is there any way that if I burned edgy and did an install it would keep my music files intact and just upgrade everything?
[01:53] <poopscoop> TritonX: yes. But before it sent me to the GRUB menu, but since i ffed it up, it doesn't even go there anymore
[01:53] <Tsingi> Can anyone tell me how to set an archive password in Archive Managr?
[01:53] <mokhtar> hello
[01:53] <ajax4> borked: What happens when you try to boot from that drive?
[01:53] <mokhtar> slt les amis je uis nouveau
[01:53] <borked> well using the latest kernel for edgy it simply dies..
[01:53] <Tsingi> the popup tells me to use Edit->password, but it's greyed with no archive loaded, and it refuses to open a pwded archive.
[01:54] <borked> using the last dapper it gets a thousand errors and the dapper before that i can get to my home dir without x, just can't really use anything except ls and the like
[01:54] <ajax4> borked: Doesn't the boot menu give you the option of booting to the older kernels?
[01:54] <borked> ajax4 yes, but the prob is nothing works or so it would seem
[01:54] <sc4ttrbrain> Tsingi,  i used to have the same problem, then i use unrar from terminal,but forgot now
[01:55] <xgm> How to configure a term ?
[01:55] <borked> like I tried using 'locate' and I am unable to use it
[01:55] <borked> and the hardware drivers do not load in the older versions
[01:55] <borked> so I doubt I could even burn anything
[01:55] <borked> I can't even use lynx
[01:56] <ajax4> borked: This is a problem that is difficult to diagnose through chat, especially without your hard drive hooked up.
[01:56] <borked> agreed, but the prob is: I couldn't even get here via IRSSI on that other drive
[01:56] <B|nTaRa> !FAT32
[01:56] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:56] <ajax4> borked: I'd burn as many DVD's of your stuff from the drive, then copy the rest to the old drive. Use a liveCD if you need to.
[01:56] <B|nTaRa> !fat
[01:56] <mman> hi all
[01:57] <borked> ajax, from a live cd I should be able to burn stuff off that drive?
[01:57] <poopscoop> hakrzcode: thanks for the link btw! readin it now
[01:57] <mman> anyone knows why workspaces can't be switched by keyboard while dragging windows with <alt>+<LMB> ?
[01:57] <mman> in dapper, worked fine before
[01:57] <Tsingi> sc4ttrbrain: got it, thank you.
[01:58] <hakrzcode> poopscoop: np..
[01:58] <ajax4> borked: do you have 2 CD drives?
[01:58] <borked> one
[01:58] <ajax4> borked: See, you'd need one drive to hold the LiveCD and one to burn to.
[01:59] <hakrzcode> borked: yes, use the live cd to do the maintance of pulling out your files, and then you can burn. Best bet is to invest into another harddrive for backup purposes.
[01:59] <borked> bah! hw idiotic of me
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[02:00] <ajax4> borked: You could also copy the files to this old drive (that your on now)...and burn from here.
[02:00] <ajax4> borked: But you'd need that second drive cable.
[02:00] <borked> yeah, I am going to need to get a cable
[02:00] <ajax4> borked: Yeah
[02:01] <borked> drats what a pain
[02:01] <ajax4> borked: I got to go but good luck. Make sure next time when you install, you put all the system files on one partition and your home files on a separate parition. It makes it so much easier :)
[02:01] <borked> will do, thanks for the help
[02:01] <ajax4> np good luck
[02:01] <frandavid100> hiya
[02:02] <frandavid100> is there a way to reset ALL gconf settings?
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[02:02] <ThomasPorter> Hey all, I need to copy a .htaccess file using a skel folder (the folder is providered by VHCS called 'domain_default_page')... But it doesn't seem to copy. I assume this is because of the nature of the filename... the dot infront of htaccess makes it root readable only.. how would I overcome this problem?
[02:02] <hakrzcode> frandavid100: "rm -rf .gconf*" But for safety do a backup first. This will remove all settings in gnome.
[02:03] <red_> #chalmers
[02:03] <frandavid100> hakrzcode: will it erase for example my evolution contacts etc?
[02:03] <frandavid100> or just the app options?
[02:04] <hakrzcode> frandavid100: your contacts and emails are safe, but accounts will have to be resetup again.
[02:04] <borked> man, if i could only get dist-upgrade to work
[02:04] <ThomasPorter> Don't make any typo's with that rm -rf command :|
[02:04] <frandavid100> OK that's acceptable
[02:04] <frandavid100> just one more question
[02:04] <borked> anyone have any ideas on how to get dist-upgrade to work after losing power in the middle?
[02:05] <frandavid100> do you happen to know what gconf key deals with the shutdown menu?
[02:05] <frandavid100> in order not to have to erase everything
[02:05] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, try ls -lia in the directory
=== pc3 is now known as CW
[02:06] <hakrzcode> borked: do an "apt-get -f install", and then followup with "apt-get dist-upgrade" That will clean any unresolved issues, then continue with your dist upgrad.
=== CW is now known as CW_MULIA
[02:06] <borked> hakrzcode thanks much, i'll hope it works
[02:06] <mike1o> i cant access my sshfs mounted folder without root permissions...
[02:06] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: Its there: 3190951 -rw-r--r--   1 root     root      111 2006-11-10 23:36 .htaccess
[02:06] <borked> hakrzcode can I do that from recovery mode?
[02:06] <McMadd> ifireball: I've got one more :-) Is it possible to execute a script as 'sudo' from the .xsession file?
[02:06] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, there you can see it :D
[02:06] <poopscoop> hakrzcode: someone on that page mentions that the hdd should be turned to AUTO instead of OFF at setup... reckon that SATA port A is the hdd? I'm not best with some of these terms :S
[02:06] <hakrzcode> frandavid100: do not know that one. You are doing some major tweaking, huh?
[02:07] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: But I want to copy it from that dir, to another dir ;)
[02:07] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, cant you copy it ?
[02:07] <hakrzcode> borked: recovery mode is pre network, user, etc... need to be in a real runlevel to be effective.
[02:07] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: No, cp doesn't allow it.
[02:07] <frandavid100> not really, I have some trouble with the shutdown menu. It behaves like a normal window, and I assume I must have screwed somthing in gconf
[02:07] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: Nor does using the skel directory
[02:08] <borked> hakrzcode ok, but the prob I have is when I boot into an old kernel version seems like I can not run anything
[02:08] <borked> any ideas?
[02:08] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: I think because .something is root only, and the skel directory (for my isp cp) uses the user nobody
[02:08] <frandavid100> I reinstalled and all, and it keeps happening. but other users don't get the error
[02:08] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, chown --help
[02:08] <frandavid100> so the problem is in ~
[02:09] <hakrzcode> frandavid100: sounds like you enabled tear off menus, and tore it off.
[02:09] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, chown username .htaccess
[02:09] <frandavid100> you think so?
[02:09] <frandavid100> I'm gonna give it a look
[02:09] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: Ah, how can I find out the username owning a file?
[02:10] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, you have root access dont u?
[02:10] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: Yes I do
[02:10] <JosefK> ThomasPorter: ls -l *filename*, if it's numeric then the username isn't in your /etc/passwd anymore
[02:10] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, whoami
[02:10] <hakrzcode> borked: you cannot get out of maintenance mode? hmmm Well boot from the live cd, and fix the installation from there.
[02:10] <borked> rgr that, tryiing
[02:11] <ThomasPorter> Thanks
[02:11] <borked> downloading the live cd now
[02:11] <marltu> how to kill X?
[02:11] <hakrzcode> haha, scatterbrained: ls -l will be more effective for what he is wanting.
[02:11] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter, chown username .htaccess  the username is your username

[02:12] <borked> where is the live cd?
[02:12] <feydin> hi there, im trying to record my desktop with xvidcap. all is fine except i got no sound recorded :(
[02:12] <feydin> its enabled in config... any one has a clue?
[02:12] <borked> !live cd
[02:12] <ubotu> Ubuntu Dapper 'Desktop' CD contains a Live CD (Ubuntu that runs straight off the CD and RAM) with an install option. Breezy's Live CD contained no install.
[02:12] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: -rw-r--r--  1 www-data root 111 2006-11-10 23:36 .htaccess So it should copy now right?
[02:13] <hakrzcode> borked: How did you do your install in the first place? I would call a friend, be very nice and ask him/her if they will download ubuntu and burn the disk for you.
[02:13] <McMadd> This is probably a Faq but I can't find it... How can I execute something from a script as root (sudo)?
[02:13] <hakrzcode> borked: if it is a her, then also dinner will be better.
[02:13] <sc4ttrbrain> ThomasPorter,  have u chown the file? if u have,then it should be your file,not root file anymore
[02:13] <borked> I switched from suse to ubuntu just before breezy came out
[02:13] <borked> and been using it ever since
[02:14] <feydin> sounddevice ist /dev/dsp
[02:14] <poopscoop> General Q: for a server, what would you recommend? Fedora Core or Ubuntu Server?
[02:14] <borked> fesh install^
[02:14] <borked> fresh
[02:14] <hakrzcode> borked: you need to get a copy of the live cd to do a quick fix to your installation, if you cannot get out of mainenance mode.
[02:15] <sc4ttrbrain> poopscoop, i would use ubuntu between that2,but will use gentoo
[02:15] <borked> hakrzcode i am downloading it now
[02:15] <borked> need to get a burn prog for this hd, then burn it, then switch hd's then run
[02:15] <McMadd> poopscoop: ask it in here, people wil vote for Ubuntu, Ask it in #Fedora .... you'l get the picture
[02:15] <borked> hopefully it'll work
[02:15] <hakrzcode> borked: did you do the safe thing, and ensure that your home directory is a seperate partition?
[02:15] <borked> hakrzcode no, of course not
[02:15] <borked> lol that would have been too simple
[02:15] <borked> and too easy to fix
[02:16] <borked> I need to make life as hard as possible on myself, always
[02:16] <hakrzcode> borked: you need to be taken behind the shed and slapped with a wet noodle.
[02:16] <borked> agreed
[02:16] <poopscoop> McMadd: true, but there will always be people who will just give a straight up answer :D I love ubuntu for work purposes, but I'm starting to doubt about the server version?! Only problems so far....
[02:16] <frandavid100> bye guys, thanks for your help hakrzcode!!
[02:17] <borked> if I wasn't broke, I would just go ge an external hd, copy all of my stuff and do a fresh install the RIGHT way this time
[02:17] <hakrzcode> poopscoop: your problems are SATA.
[02:17] <hakrzcode> frandavid100: no problem.. take care.
[02:17] <poopscoop> hakrzcode: in setup, my sata port a is set to off... reckon setting that to auto might help?
[02:19] <hakrzcode> poopscoop: possibly. I am not sure of that. But, I would be safe and try fiddling directly, not remotely from this point. unless you moved your box across country.
[02:19] <traskbtrojanek> In Window Maker, when I maximize a window it goes underneath my clip(and the docked icons I have on it). Does anyone know how to make it stay from underneath my clip?
[02:20] <borked> hakrzcode how do you suggest i fix the the upgrade from the livecd?
[02:20] <poopscoop> hakrzcode: maybe i'll move the box here for the time being so i can mess with it in person
[02:20] <ThomasPorter> sc4ttrbrain: 4 drwxr-xr-x   2 www-data root     4096 2006-11-11 09:42 .layout How would I change it so it says www-data www-data instead of www-data root, because it doesn't copy as is.
[02:22] <hakrzcode> borked: move the home files to another drive. I saw you mentioned another drive, but no cable. Invest in a cheap USB case and move your home directory files to the other drive, and do a fresh install. Tweak for a couple of days. Worth it in the end. This is your home computer?
[02:22] <borked> yes, home machine
[02:22] <hardaway> hello?
[02:23] <hardaway> somebody read me?
[02:23] <borked> what about re-running apt-get --dist-upgrade in the meantime
[02:23] <borked> think it might work?
[02:23] <hakrzcode> borked: fresh install will be tedious at first, but it will be worth it in the end.
[02:23] <hakrzcode> hardaway: loud and clear.
[02:23] <hardaway> First time using a terminal irc client...
[02:24] <borked> hakrzcode; agreed, that is what I need to do.. for now I would just like to get it somewhat running till I get some extra cash to buy the stuff I need
[02:24] <hardaway> I need help: When I put in the command line "man lstat" there's no answe
[02:24] <borked> <-- broke
[02:24] <morphycs> Is there a project management software with great features?
[02:24] <hakrzcode> traskbtrojanek: check the window maker settings. I believe there is an option for iconized windows. The clip should also have a right click option to magnitize.
[02:24] <hardaway> it's a function from the library sys/stat.h
[02:25] <hardaway> In knoppix works "man lstat" and works but not in ubuntu
[02:26] <hakrzcode> borked: Well somewhat running, will take you fsking your filesystem, if your files are corrupted, and then with possible major losses. Depends on how important those mp3s are.
[02:26] <borked> well the mp3's not so much

[02:34] <drega> change the xorg.conf file TritonX..
[02:34] <TritonX> drega: .... can you be more precise ? I can do a lot of stuff to xorg.conf
[02:35] <drega> eh, yep, just trying to locate the setting now.
[02:35] <TritonX> my display section is set to 1024x768
[02:36] <drega> ok, do you have multiple depths?
[02:37] <dcypherd> tritonx sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:37] <dcypherd> down about the middle
[02:37] <drega> you should be able to scroll through supported resolutions in X with ctrl/alt/+
[02:37] <dcypherd> will be the posibble resolutions
[02:37] <dcypherd> add in 1024x768
[02:37] <dcypherd> restart the computer
[02:38] <dcypherd> change the settings in the system panel
[02:38] <variant> dcypherd: what? restart the computer? what?
[02:38] <TritonX> this is below "scree" SubSection     "Display"
[02:38] <TritonX>         Depth       1
[02:38] <TritonX>         Modes      "1024x768"
[02:38] <variant> dcypherd: he is not using windows i though
[02:38] <variant> t
[02:38] <TritonX> depth of 1, strange
[02:38] <hardaway> quit
[02:38] <hardaway> /quit
[02:38] <hardaway> suputamadre
[02:38] <Homer_Linux> hiya ppl
[02:38] <variant> TritonX: change that to 16 or 24
[02:39] <dcypherd> hes using windows?
[02:39] <hakrzcode> variant: Yes, we are all linux power users, but please remember this a newbies room. Let them reboot the computer.
[02:39] <variant> dcypherd: why else would you advise him to reboot?
[02:39] <variant> hakrzcode: rubbish
[02:39] <TritonX> defaultdepth in "Screen" is set to 24
[02:39] <Homer_Linux> every time i try to mount a drive i get this mount: /dev/hdc1 already mounted or /mnt/hdc1 busy which it not mounted
[02:39] <variant> TritonX: instead of rebooting which is absurd type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[02:39] <dcypherd> i'm not a power use
[02:39] <dcypherd> r
[02:39] <TritonX> variant: I know that, I'm not that newbie
[02:40] <TritonX> is a rare problem I got only with this laptop with Go420 chipset
[02:40] <variant> TritonX: good, unlike some of the people advising you it seems :)
[02:40] <hakrzcode> variant: what seems like childs play to regular users, will confuse others. Remember remote controls when they came out?
[02:40] <hakrzcode> Or maybe that is before your time.
[02:40] <TritonX> work calling, cya l8r
[02:41] <drega> or ctrl->alt->backspace
[02:41] <variant> hakrzcode: you can not argue that rebooting is better than educating people on how to do things properly. this isint the windows "reboot, it sometimes helps" world. and if your going to be smarmy and offensive you can go somwhere else
[02:41] <drega> is the kiss method
[02:41] <dcypherd> so tritonx
[02:41] <variant> drega: that too :)
[02:41] <vellu> :) hi
[02:41] <dcypherd> you are using linux
[02:42] <dcypherd> and you wanted to edit your xorg.conf
[02:42] <dcypherd> correct?
[02:42] <hakrzcode> Variant: Somethings are done in gradual steps. You must learn to walk, before you run. Before you start giving all of the keyboard shortcuts to everyone that cannot type without using a mouse, will surely turn people away quickly.
[02:43] <hakrzcode> variant: smarmy and offensive is not me. rubbish, might be taken as smarmy
[02:43] <variant> hakrzcode: not as fast as telling them that actualy you have to reboot just as often as in windows... anyway, feel free to have the last comment on this subject as i have no intention of arguing
[02:43] <hakrzcode> go back to sleep my little british friend.

[02:45] <hakrzcode> Koala, question?
[02:46] <hhhjr> can some one tell me please how do i fix this bash: make: command not found? sorry complete nubie
[02:47] <hakrzcode> hhhjr: apt-get install automake
[02:47] <hhhjr> ok thankyou
[02:47] <Koala> 
[02:47] <variant> hakrzcode: you sure you dont want to advise him to use synaptic :)
[02:48] <hakrzcode> hhhjr: even better would be to install gnome-devel. It will give you all of the common toolsets.
[02:48] <alluc> is there a command line to resize and add a border to a svg image ?
[02:49] <hakrzcode> variant: Want to be my friend? I will give you a pretty flower.
[02:49] <jack_> how are u guys at ppc
[02:49] <jack_> ok
[02:50] <plesnivec> help!! i cant connect to ubuntu sharefolder from windows because login/pass dialogue wont let me in i am using ubuntu user to connect
[02:50] <jack_> yas talk a good game tho
[02:51] <jack_> me smarmies
[02:51] <variant> jack_: you got a ppc problem?
[02:51] <drega> plenivec: I believe your linux user has to match your windows one.
[02:51] <TritonX> variant: back to my video problem, I have to use this Option "UseDisplayDevice" "DFP" to get something ont he screen
[02:51] <jazzrocker> ok i know it's more of an annoyance than anything, but how do i get those "could not determine FQDN" messages to go away upon restarting apache?
[02:52] <drega> eh or rather in your case possibly you'll need to smbpasswd -a to create a samba user to match your windows account.
[02:52] <drega> cant ever remember which way around.
[02:52] <rambo3> fully quilfyed domain name
[02:52] <jack_> var: yes sir
[02:52] <jack_> a few but one is ubuntu related
[02:52] <rambo3> jazzrocker, any virtual domains ?
[02:53] <hakrzcode> plesnivec: If you are using windows xp that was preinstalled, then it is probably passing over a username of user, instead of what you are using. Check the samba logs in /var/log
[02:53] <jack_> my sound quit a few weeks back
[02:53] <jazzrocker> rambo3, none yet, just an ip and the default vhost config
[02:53] <rambo3> jazzrocker, same problem here
[02:53] <plesnivec> thanx for tips i`ll check it again
[02:54] <rambo3> using 127.0.0.1 as domain name
[02:54] <jack_> also linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-27-powerpc is returning exit status 135
[02:54] <jack_> you know how it does that
[02:55] <hakrzcode> rambo3, change the hostname in your apache conf.
[02:55] <jack_> o wait
[02:55] <rambo3> hakrzcode, it didnt work
[02:55] <hakrzcode> or make sure that your machine has a domain, and hostname: hostname.domain.{org com biz...etc}
[02:56] <rambo3> hakrzcode, it didnt work
[02:56] <jack_> the real problem is i m a single parent .: no time
[02:56] <jack_> like my makeshift "therefore" symbol?
[02:56] <rambo3> hakrzcode, if you mean buy aditing /etc/host and /etc/apache2/*conf
[02:56] <jack_> .:
[02:56] <jack_> y'know?
[02:56] <rambo3> s/host/hosts
[02:56] <poopscoop> thanks again guys... I'm off!
[02:56] <Shaka> hey all, any c++ compilers that come with ubuntu that you guys would recommend?
[02:56] <jrib> Shaka: g++
[02:57] <cartucho> morning lunatics
[02:57] <Shaka> jrib: cheers
[02:57] <jack_> cartucho
[02:57] <jrib> Shaka: install build-essential and you get g++ as well as other things you'll need
[02:57] <hakrzcode> rambo3: apache by default will use your machine name, but by default a machine name will look like userbox.ubuntumachine, not userbox.ubuntumachine.org
[02:58] <hakrzcode> rambo3: therefore there is the messages about fully qualified host name
[02:58] <jack_> .:  there is the messages about fully qualified host name
[02:58] <jack_> get it?
[02:58] <eshv> I have a dynamic ip address, does anyone know a way to still host pages using Apache without the address changing all the time?
[02:59] <McMadd> This is probably a Faq but I can't find it... How can I execute something from a script as root (sudo)?
[02:59] <TritonX> eshv: no-ip.com dyn-ip.com , etc
[02:59] <jack_> i can't b helped
[02:59] <CokeNCode> Is there a command to find out the version of ubuntu that ur running ?
[02:59] <hakrzcode> eshv: dynamicdns
[02:59] <CokeNCode> or do you have to check a file or something
[02:59] <jack_> laters
[02:59] <Majic> uname -a   right?
[02:59] <eshv> thanks Triton and hakrzcode
[02:59] <salome> uname -a
[02:59] <Majic> Or is that the kernal info?
[02:59] <salome> yup
[02:59] <jrib> CokeNCode: lsb_release -a
[02:59] <salome> lsb_release?
[02:59] <CokeNCode> ok k, cool thanks
[03:00] <wells> hissite.org
[03:00] <malix0> hi all how do I apt-get --build packege with debug enabled?
[03:00] <salome> huh
[03:00] <salome> everyone else sticks that in uname.
[03:00] <CokeNCode> is that specific to ubuntu ... or will that work on any linux distro ?
[03:00] <salome> ubuntu just HAS to be different.
[03:00] <rambo3> hakrzcode, how does that help me
[03:00] <salome> :)
[03:00] <jrib> salome: uname gives you the kernel
[03:00] <salome> yes, I realize that.

[03:02] <Majic> Hmm, I have a problem with Audacious.

[03:03] <hakrzcode> hhhjr: still make command not found? Sounds like you have changed your path settings?
[03:03] <hhhjr> does anyone know where I can find a help file that will help a newbie install the firmware and drivers for dvb and analog tuner
[03:03] <variant> hhhjr: apt-get install build-essential
[03:03] <Majic> I put in an Audio CD and Ubuntu wants to open Sound Juicer CD Extractor to play it.  And Audacious says there isn't even a CD that it can play in the drive.
[03:04] <hakrzcode> rambo3: yes
[03:04] <Majic> And I've tried multiple CDs...
[03:04] <rambo3> hakrzcode, so what else do i need to change
[03:04] <rambo3> since its already there
[03:04] <hhhjr> hakrzcode sorry for my ignorance but i havent changed anything that I know of
[03:04] <variant> Majic: is audacious that xmms clone?
[03:04] <Majic> yes

[03:05] <Legendre> Hi all. Has a fix been found for the PDF / PS printing problems in Edgy? So far, I think they only affect HP LaserJet printers using the older LJ2, LJ3, LJ4 drivers..
[03:06] <Syrra> Thank you~
[03:06] <M0E^lnx> Does checkinstall and makepkg work in ubuntu?
[03:06] <Shaye> It is possible at all?
[03:06] <marltu> how to turn off X?
[03:06] <Legendre> Shaye - split a .rar?
[03:06] <Legendre> you do it at the time the .rar is created.
[03:07] <Legendre> there is a switch to split the archive into multiple pieces
[03:07] <hakrzcode> MOE: checkinstall does work. Use it myself.
[03:07] <Shaye> Legendre, I have a rar file, I want to split it.
[03:07] <Shaye> It's been "rared" already
[03:07] <M0E^lnx> hakrzcode: where did you get it?... when I try it tells me command not found... to I guess I don't have it installed
[03:07] <M0E^lnx> and I can't find it via apt-get
[03:07] <jrib> Shaye: you can use 'split'
[03:08] <McMadd> Shaye: rar or zip it again with multispawn?
[03:08] <Shaye> No I don't wanna rar it again
[03:08] <zoy> how can i add a user ?
[03:08] <hakrzcode> MOE: It should be in apt.
[03:08] <Legendre> I'd not use split on it, unless it was just for my own use.
[03:08] <jrib> zoy: system > administration > users and groups
[03:08] <Shaye> Just trying to find a way to split a rar file that's it
[03:08] <fridge> How do I interrogate loaded modules to find out what options they were loaded with?
[03:08] <zoy> jrib i want to use terminal
[03:08] <jrib> zoy: adduser
[03:08] <M0E^lnx> it's not finding it for some reason hakrzcode.. I must need some sources
[03:09] <zoy> jrib adduser _username here_ ?
[03:09] <jrib> zoy: sudo adduser username_here,  but  man adduser  for more info
[03:09] <hakrzcode> maybe uncomment the universe, and multiverse repositories in your /etc/apt/sources @MOE
[03:09] <zoy> jrib ok thank you
[03:10] <morphycs> Is there a project management software like the MS one?
[03:10] <h1st0> hakrzcode, they can use System > Administration > Software Sources to do it via checkboxing.
[03:10] <Shaka> sorry to be a both again jrib new to linux hehe but does g++ go by anyother name?
[03:10] <Shaka> i cant seem to find it in the add programs file
[03:10] <Gwildor> gcc
[03:10] <h1st0> Shaka, are you trying to compile something?
[03:10] <variant> Shaka: apt-get install build-essential
[03:10] <Gwildor> Shaka, install build-essentials
[03:11] <Shaka> ah tanks
[03:11] <hakrzcode> h1st0: I figured a debian user, since asking about checkinstall..
[03:11] <Shaka> ill give it ago now
[03:11] <variant> Shaka: that includes gcc, gnu compiler collection
[03:11] <h1st0> Shaka, build-essential is your best bet.
[03:11] <anders9034> i tried using the getch() function defined in curses.h (yes included the header file), but  the compiler complains undefined reference to: `stdscr', `wgetch',  `stdscr', `wgetch'

[03:20] <variant> graveson: run file /path/to/file.iso
[03:20] <variant> graveson: it will tell you if it is an iso or some other file thats just been renamed
[03:20] <jstarcher> guys I need some help :( I have linux installed on three logical partitions and I installed windows on one of my primary partitions. Now when I boot it doesnt show grub, it just goes to windows
[03:20] <variant> graveson: or if it just says "data" it might be corrupt
[03:20] <jstarcher> How can I get my grub back?
[03:21] <variant> jstarcher: reboot to the live cd, chroot your root partition and run grub
[03:21] <variant> jstarcher: start by rebooting to the ubuntu cd and gimmie a shout when you are there
[03:21] <jstarcher> variant: okay sweet, I'll give it a shot. Thanks!
[03:22] <graveson> variant: it just says data .does this mean it is corrupted
[03:22] <variant> graveson: either that or it was never a valid iso to start with
[03:22] <paul71> did anyone get any of what I just said?
[03:22] <graveson> variant: thanks for that

[03:24] <paul71> does anyone know why?
[03:24] <variant> paul71: how long did you wait?
[03:24] <ailean> Lahey
[03:24] <Shaka> well this seems a tad weird installed build-essential but there's nothing new that i can see in programming section
[03:24] <hakrzcode> paul71: I believe ctl-alt-F3 is the debug screen. 15% seems like corrupted cd.
[03:25] <Shaka> could this be down installing it using sudo?
[03:25] <Miccagrassu> i really love ubuntu =)
[03:25] <variant> Shaka: there wouldnt be, compiler wouldnt be added to the menu as it's command line too;l
[03:25] <ailean> paul71, you're downgrading?
[03:25] <Shaka> ah ic
[03:25] <paul71> variant: I left it running overnight
[03:25] <Miccagrassu> i used to be on Mandriva, but now i can't leave this distrib
[03:25] <paul71> yes i'm downgraging
[03:25] <paul71> i have tried burining new live cd's
[03:25] <ailean> paul71, i don't think that's supported
[03:25] <variant> paul71: did you choose to format all the partitions?
[03:26] <variant> ailean: it's not, but he is wipeing the disk and starting again so it's a clean install
[03:26] <paul71> variant: i just chose the wipe disk, and write 6.06 command
[03:26] <paul71> so a clean install
[03:26] <variant> paul71: automatic parititoning?
[03:26] <ailean> paul71, ok :)
[03:26] <hakrzcode> variant:15% is past the formating and into the installing.
[03:26] <variant> hakrzcode: and?
[03:27] <paul71> variant: um, yeah, i didn't choose to use the partitioner
[03:27] <paul71> thing is, my 6.10 installation still works :S
[03:27] <tkp> hi guys
[03:27] <hakrzcode> variant: if the cd is corrupted, it will not be able to read the files. Even if they show in the directory read.
[03:27] <variant> paul71: ok, try booting in to the live cd again and manualy formatting the whole disk, then run the installer again
[03:27] <tkp> I'm trying to get apache/php working in my ubuntu, but I'm getting the following:
[03:27] <tkp> The following packages have unmet dependencies.

[03:27] <tkp> E: Broken packages
[03:27] <variant> hakrzcode: he said allready that he has used several cd's
[03:28] <tkp> what is that all about?
[03:28] <paul71> varient: can you tell me what i'd need to enter to format the disk?
[03:28] <variant> paul71: but as hakrzcode says, you should also runt he disk checker int he startup menu of the live cd
[03:28] <variant> paul71: sure
[03:28] <paul71> thank you
[03:28] <variant> paul71: sudo mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda1/2/3
[03:28] <paul71> thanks, i'll be back in a sec
[03:28] <variant> paul71: be carefull though
[03:28] <variant> paul71: wait
[03:29] <variant> paul71: if you have any data on the partiitons that you runt hat command on it will be wiped
[03:29] <hakrzcode> I have a eide cdburner, and if I write too quickly, the cd will come out abnormal, even if is says all was good. 10 CDs into it told me the truth.
[03:30] <paul71> variant: so if i don't want to keep any data, i can go ahead and do it?

[03:35] <tkp> constrictor: Attemting to mark apache2 for installation results in dependency errors
[03:35] <tkp> (even tho I already have apache2 installed)
[03:36] <hakrzcode> tkp: walk through the dependencies, sometimes that helps. Is yours an upgrade dist?
[03:36] <salim> help
[03:36] <salim> I'm on live cd now, and fdisk -l is empty, but mount /dev/hda5 works
[03:37] <tkp> It's complaining that it depends on apache-2-common, yet apache2-common is already installed
[03:37] <salim> gparted doesnt show anything too, it says there are no partitions
[03:37] <tkp> Depends: apache2-common (=2.0.55-4ubuntu2) but 2.0.55-4ubuntu2.1 is to be installed
[03:39] <tkp> if I uninstall apache2-common and try to reinstall it, am I going to loose all my apache configuration stuff?
[03:39] <hakrzcode> tkp: no, unless you ask for full removal.
[03:39] <constrictor> tkp: so don't so you need to install PHP?
[03:39] <salim> how can I repair my partitiontable?
[03:39] <tkp> constrictor: yes... php is what I'm trying to get working
[03:39] <tkp> I already installed php4
[03:40] <tkp> but it's libapache2-mod-php4 that won't install
[03:40] <constrictor> tkp: are you trying to install PHP5
[03:40] <tkp> no. I'm trying to install libapache2-mod-php4
[03:40] <ekimus> salim:  have a backup, boot from cd and rewrite a new partition table (pay attention to the first part of the sentence)
[03:41] <tkp> but it rewuires apache2-mpm-prefork.. which will not install
[03:41] <constrictor> one moment tkp
[03:41] <niksoron> hi. trying to get my wifi working on edgy. i have a pcmcia card that uses the orinco_cs driver
[03:41] <tkp> constrictor: np... thanks man
[03:41] <niksoron> when i do a iwconfig
[03:41] <tomnix> afternoon all
[03:42] <niksoron> i can see eth1
[03:42] <niksoron> correct essid, correct AP mac
[03:42] <niksoron> the AP uses WEP128
[03:42] <CarinArr> niksoron, but?
[03:42] <niksoron> but when i ping, i can't ping the AP
[03:43] <CarinArr> niksoron, using dhcp?
[03:43] <tkp> I don't understand the errror: Depends: apache2-common (=2.0.55-4ubuntu2) but 2.0.55-4ubuntu2.1 is to be installed.
[03:43] <constrictor> tkp: the difference between my setup and yours is that i'm using libapache2-mod-PHP5 which installed without any problems
[03:43] <niksoron> CarinArr, i set static ip
[03:43] <tkp> it's saying that the version I have installed is later than the one it requires?
[03:43] <tkp> ok... I'll try with PHP5
[03:43] <niksoron> i see no pkts in ifconfig eth1
[03:43] <CarinArr> niksoron, yeah but are you allowed to define the ip yourself?
[03:43] <niksoron> rq = 0, tx = 0
[03:43] <jstarcher> variant: do I need to download the live CD for edgy since I upgraded to it? Or can I use my old 6.06 CD?
[03:43] <cyzie> niksoran, ping localhost ?
[03:44] <niksoron> CarinArr, yes, i set it to what the ip was for when the laptop was in windows
[03:44] <CarinArr> niksoron, and the ip was static in windows?
[03:44] <tkp> nope... libapache2-mod-php5: Depends: apache2-mpm-prefork (> 2.0.52) but it is not going to be installed
[03:44] <niksoron> ping localhost gives 64 bytes from localhost
[03:44] <niksoron> CarinArr, yes, static ip in windows
[03:44] <CarinArr> niksoron, okay just checking
[03:44] <cyzie> niksoron, do u set gw ip in your laptop ?
[03:44] <niksoron> iwconfig says Security mode:open
[03:45] <niksoron> shouldn't that say WEP128?
[03:45] <niksoron> cyzie, yes, got gw ip, also not even trying to go out, just trying to ping ap
[03:45] <niksoron> but ping yahoo.com also doesn't work
[03:45] <cyzie> niksoron, to ping yahoo.com, u need DNS ip in your laptop
[03:45] <niksoron> cyzie, yes, i have dns ip
[03:46] <niksoron> can't ping the dns ip either
[03:46] <hou5ton> Any ideas why my volume just up and quit working on this laptop running Edgy ... between when I shut it down yesterday and booted it back up this morning?
[03:46] <cyzie> niksoron, can u try open up your network access point and connect again ?
[03:46] <CarinArr> niksoron, does ifconfig look right?
[03:46] <CarinArr> i'm assuming it does
[03:46] <niksoron> cyzie, can't. don't have password to AP
[03:46] <hhhjr_> ok I need some more help. I am trying to install the ivtv drivers and now this is the command I am trying to use. make && makeinstall and this is what I get back make -C/lib/modules/2.6.17-10 server/build M=/home/hhhjr/ivtv-0.7/driver modules  make: Entering a unknown directory  make: ***/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-server/build: no such file or directory.

[03:46] <niksoron> CarinArr, ifconfig shows eth1 but rx/tx = 0
[03:46] <cyzie> niksoron, what is yoru command to connect to the ap ?
[03:46] <niksoron> rx pkts, tx pkts
[03:47] <niksoron> cyzie, command to connect to ap?
[03:47] <niksoron> ping 192.168.0.1
[03:47] <cyzie> niksoron, what about iwconfig -a ? paste me in Private Message
[03:47] <niksoron> cyzie, i can't paste. i'm irc-ing from a diff win box
[03:47] <niksoron> i can type it
[03:47] <cyzie> niksoron, yes, i use command line to connect to the linksys AP
[03:47] <cyzie> niksoron, please do so.
[03:47] <niksoron> cyzie, also, there's no such thing as iwconfig -a
[03:47] <tkp> constrictor: removing apache2-common and reinstalling it seemed to fix... thanks for your help
[03:48] <niksoron> only ifconfig -a
[03:48] <psynaps3> Hi, Can someone recommend me a small and easy to use IDE for C++. I don't want to go for KDevelop/Anjuta/Eclipse or the likes.
[03:48] <cyzie> niksoron, paset me ifconfig -a then
[03:48] <CarinArr> niksoron, might be best off to type it into pastebin and show all of us
[03:48] <CarinArr> !paste
[03:48] <cyzie> and iwconfig
[03:48] <niksoron> cyzie, ok, what's the command line you want me to try
[03:48] <variant> hhhjr_: when you ran the configure were there any warnings?
[03:48] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[03:48] <cyzie> niksoron, ifconfig -a and iwconfig
[03:48] <variant> psynaps3: emacs, easy to use once you learn how
[03:48] <constrictor> tkp: glad you fixed it np
[03:48] <niksoron> CarinArr, can't paste, no network on the laptop in concern
[03:48] <variant> psynaps3: hard enough to learn though
[03:48] <hhhjr_> no that is exactly what  I received after the command
[03:48] <CarinArr> niksoron, i know, you said you were going to type it out;)
[03:48] <niksoron> cyzie, ok, done, what specific field should i type out
[03:49] <CarinArr> so i was just saying you could type it into pastebin instead of private message;)
[03:49] <variant> hhhjr_: when you ran ./configure i mean
[03:49] <niksoron> i can't type out all 100 lines
[03:49] <CarinArr> 100 lines?!
[03:49] <niksoron> yeah, irda0, lo, sit0
[03:49] <niksoron> all that stuff
[03:49] <CarinArr> just type the wireless one
[03:49] <niksoron> ok, for ifconfig -a
[03:50] <cyzie> niksoron, is it eth1/0 up ?
[03:50] <hhhjr_> ok I thiink I need to learn more but the doc I have about installing the drivers does not state anything about configure
[03:50] <niksoron> eth1 link ethernet hwaddr 00:60..j0

[03:51] <jstarcher> YES
[03:51] <cyzie> CarinArr, provisioning of IP MUST come with netmask
[03:51] <cyzie> niksoron, is it eth1/0 up ?
[03:51] <variant> jstarcher: mount your ubuntu partition
[03:51] <afflux> hi all. does anybody of you have experiences with "Philips SPE3040CC" (3,5" external hdd, 400gb)? My shop says it is compatible with windows 2k and xp. What about linux?
[03:51] <niksoron> cyzie, yes, eth1 is up
[03:51] <niksoron> that's why it shows in ifconfig
[03:51] <variant> jstarcher: on /mnt
[03:52] <cyzie> niksoron, what about iwconfig ?
[03:52] <niksoron> what should "Security mode:" show for WEP128? mine shows open
[03:52] <niksoron> cyzie, yes, eth1 shows up in iwconfig
[03:52] <shriphani> guys can i find a page listing vendors who ship ubuntu edgy worldwide
[03:52] <niksoron> correct essid and AP mac address
[03:52] <variant> jstarcher: scratch that. you dont need to
[03:52] <cyzie> niksoron, so your driver shoudl isntalled correctly.
[03:52] <niksoron> link quality: 19/92
[03:53] <cyzie> niksoron, how do u connect to the AP ? using command line or GUI ?
[03:53] <niksoron> cyzie, ping
[03:53] <niksoron> i use ping
[03:53] <CarinArr> niksoron, mine says open and i'm using 128bit wep and it's working fine
[03:53] <cyzie> niksoron, u cant... u must connect ot the AP first THEN u ping
[03:53] <niksoron> CarinArr, cool
[03:53] <jstarcher> variant: i type sudo grub right?
[03:53] <niksoron> cyzie, what do you mean by "connect to the AP". i don't understand
[03:53] <feydin> hey there im trying to get beagle to run, but beagle does not index all of my files
[03:53] <CarinArr> cyzie, if the wireless point shows up in iwconfig he should be connected to it
[03:54] <feydin> is there any config i need to change for it?
[03:54] <cyzie> niksoron, if your AP has WEP128, then u need to provide password to connect to it
[03:54] <netpython> niksoron, acess point
[03:54] <variant> jstarcher: sudo grub-install hd0
[03:54] <netpython> +c
[03:54] <Chamber> i got an error while trying to manually edit the partition table
[03:54] <niksoron> cyzie, yes, i set the password in networking
[03:54] <Chamber> as in like, i can't resize it
[03:54] <Chamber> why is that so?
[03:54] <variant> Chamber: what were you doing to resize it?
[03:54] <cyzie> CarinArr, what make u said so ?
[03:54] <jstarcher> variant: what if ubuntu isnt on hd0?
[03:54] <niksoron> and i see it if i do iwconfig eth1. and look at Encryption key: xxxx-nnn...
[03:54] <variant> jstarcher: what disk is it on?
[03:55] <cyzie> niksoron, okay, just checking
[03:55] <Chamber> variant, i used gparted
[03:55] <Chamber> if that's what you mean
[03:55] <variant> jstarcher: whatever your boot disk is in the bios, that is where you want grub
[03:55] <jstarcher> variant: hda3 iirc
[03:55] <variant> jstarcher: hd0 then
[03:55] <niksoron> any suggestions?
[03:56] <jstarcher> variant: okay lemme give it a shot
[03:56] <cyzie> niksoron, the AP is DHCP where it assign IP to yoru laptop right ?
[03:56] <niksoron> cyzie, no DHCP. i said static ip
[03:57] <CarinArr> niksoron, not sure if it makes a difference but try setting the key manually without the dashes
[03:57] <jstarcher> variant: errored out. "could not find device for /boot: not found or not a block device."
[03:57] <salim> where is testdisk in ubuntu
[03:57] <niksoron> CarinArr, ok, trying that now. iwconfig eth1 enc s:mypassword right?
[03:57] <variant> jstarcher: sorry, include --root-directory=/boot
[03:57] <CarinArr> iwconfig eth1 key xxxxxxx
[03:58] <niksoron> ok
[03:58] <datrite> hi all, some file on one of my partitions seems damaged but I cannot get it fixed or removed
[03:58] <variant> jstarcher: so the full command is: grub-install --root-directory=/boot hd0
[03:58] <h1st0> Is there any chat program that supports webcam and yahoo chatrooms?
[03:58] <CarinArr> niksoron, not sure about the ins and outs of iwconfig, but that works for me;)
[03:59] <gor1> hi there, got a small network probleme, if i detach the cable and reatach it the system recogniceses the connection but no other program do, is there anything to do about it?
[03:59] <niksoron> CarinArr, ok, just did it. can't ping
[03:59] <niksoron> ifconfig still rx/tx pkts=0
[04:00] <niksoron> ok, in dmesg it says, WEP supported, 104-bit key
[04:00] <niksoron> is that a problem?
[04:00] <jstarcher> variant: is this the same thing? http://tinyurl.com/jha3s "using the desktop/livecd and overwriting windows bootloader"
[04:00] <cyzie> niksoron, is your wireless card ipw2100 ?
[04:00] <niksoron> cyzie, no, it is orinoco_cs
[04:01] <CarinArr> niksoron, i don't use the networking tool cause it's messed up for me but all i need to do to connect is: sudo iwconfig eth1 key xxxxxx, sudo iwconfig eth1 essid xxxxxx, sudo dhclient3 eth1
[04:01] <variant> jstarcher: yes, but that wont work with the edgy cd, i dont know about hte dapper cd. did the command i told you fail?
[04:01] <CarinArr> last one because i'm using dhcp
[04:01] <niksoron> CarinArr, ok, will try that
[04:02] <CarinArr> i'm not sure how low a signal quality you can work with
[04:02] <jstarcher> variant: im on the dapper liveCD and my ubuntu install i have upgraded to edgy... i will try the command now
[04:02] <CarinArr> my link quality says 100/100
[04:02] <Chamber> the english on partitioning options is a bit confusing for me
[04:02] <Chamber> i'm not sure what "Free Space Following" means
[04:02] <niksoron> CarinArr, mine says 43/92
[04:02] <Chamber> is that the space for installtion?
[04:02] <CarinArr> at home it goes down as far as 45/100
[04:02] <niksoron> but it changes from time to time
[04:03] <gor1> hi there, got a small network probleme, if i detach the cable and reatach it the system recogniceses the connection but no other program do, is there anything to do about it?

[04:08] <ubotu> Package dblatex does not exist in dapper
[04:08] <lupine_85> nope
[04:08] <wwweasel> jrib: that's for auto-opening on entry
[04:09] <lupine_85> different libc versions so attempting to install the package from edgy could be... painful
[04:09] <niksoron> what should Mode: be? mine says Managed
[04:09] <netpython> iturk, i think dapper has the package too,so you don't have to upgrade
[04:09] <CarinArr> niksoron, put it back up then;)
[04:09] <jrib> wwweasel: true... hmmm can you right click, then click on "properties", then go to the "open with" tab?

[04:10] <netpython> it's in universe
[04:11] <iturk> netpython: i have universe active in dapper !!
[04:11] <wwweasel> iturk: Ah, so not as straightforward. You could build it from source
[04:11] <phaedrus44> ogionnj:  thanks
[04:12] <iturk> wwweasel: instead of that isnt possible to add take it using deb-src from sources.list ??
[04:12] <ogionnj> Can anyone help me with sound issues?  Sound skips and voices sound like chipmunks.  All players.  (Edgy)
[04:12] <netpython> iturk, wwweasel is right you could compile dblatex from source,it's pretty straightforward
[04:13] <wwweasel> iturk: It is. I know it's possible as someone guided me through it once, I just don't know how.
[04:13] <iturk> netpython: i understand i can download the tar.gz and installed but i prefer to have it has a apt package easy to uninstall
[04:13] <wwweasel> jrib: Any ideas on the Audio CD thing?
[04:13] <wwweasel> iturk: Check out "checkinstall"
[04:13] <netpython> iturk, true
[04:14] <hangfire> <j-_>, do you know where the diveintopython book is located in the file structure? I want to check it out myself
[04:14] <wwweasel> iturk: I build debs of all the things I build from source using checkinstall.
[04:14] <jrib> wwweasel: no but I have a cd in now and am looking
[04:14] <wwweasel> jrib: Thanks :) These things really should be more straightforward...
[04:15] <iturk> wwweasel: i see checkinstall its usefull
[04:16] <niksoron> time to call it quits. thanks for trying to help

[04:23] <jstarcher> argh i hate opera. why cant they give it out for free :-(
[04:23] <noviac> Hmm, can anyone tell me why ubuntu (during installation) forces my screen out_of_sync? I mean, whats the point forcing 143hz in VGA-mode, or even 265hz in 1280x1024. Even what's named as "Safe graphic mode" seems to be on top of my low-performance monitor. Ubuntu desktop 6.10 CD-image, if that enlighten somebody.
[04:24] <Glock9> old computer?
[04:25] <noviac> not really
[04:25] <Glock9> old monitor?
[04:25] <skript> what wifi pci card would you suggest for dapper ? which has the best ease of install/kernel drivers support ?
[04:25] <jstarcher> wtf i cant boot anymore :(
[04:25] <noviac> amd xp 3200 512 19" monitor @ 1280x1024 (100hz)
[04:25] <noviac> samsung syncmaster 19"  959nf
[04:26] <wwweasel> skript: Many/most will work with a bit of tweaking, not too hard.
[04:26] <Glock9> Use Ndiswrapper
[04:26] <Glock9> skript
[04:26] <gor1> variant tryed the networkmanager, but seems not to work either
[04:26] <wwweasel> skript; I can't think of one that hasn't required a bit of tweaking for me.
[04:26] <variant> Glock9: it would be better to advise him to get one that will work out of the box rather than one that wont
[04:27] <variant> skript: avoid ndiswrapper requireing cards at all cost, it's much better to get a fully supported one
[04:27] <wwweasel> variant: What do you have against ndiswrapper?
[04:27] <jstarcher> what is all this crap in fstab edgy put in there? UUID and stuff
[04:28] <variant> wwweasel: nothing, but when advising on what card to buy its best to advise against one that requires proprietry windows drivers
[04:28] <variant> jstarcher: it is sysfs/udev stuff
[04:28] <erUSUL> jstarcher: ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
[04:28] <wwweasel> variant: makes sense
[04:28] <variant> jstarcher: you can take it out or use it
[04:28] <skript> variant: so... which chipsets are 'fully' supported then ? is there a list maybe somewhere ;) ?
[04:28] <jstarcher> ic
[04:29] <gor1> variant: tryed the networkmanager, but seems not to work either
[04:29] <variant> skript: this is some good information: http://users.linpro.no/janl/hardware/wifi.html
[04:29] <snowshoefox> how do  I get java to work in firefox so i can login into TopCoder?
[04:29] <erUSUL> jstarcher: it have been made in preparation for the switch to the new, libata based, pata drivers of the linux kernel
[04:29] <snowshoefox> !java
[04:29] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[04:29] <skript> varinat: wow! thanks for the link !!
[04:29] <der0b> erusul: if I did a ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/ while a certain usb device is installed, I could get the UUID and set up a permanent mount for that device in fstab?
[04:30] <variant> skript: no problem, skript in irc type var and press the tab key
[04:30] <variant> der0b: correct
[04:30] <der0b> neato keen
[04:30] <SonikBoom> gah.
[04:30] <der0b> thanks :)
[04:30] <SonikBoom> i have a noobish problem.
[04:30] <variant> der0b: there are alternatives to the uuid too, like the device name
[04:31] <erUSUL> der0b: hotplug devices are better handled by udev+pmount imho
[04:31] <skript> variant: heh... var+tab... seems to work ;)
[04:31] <jstarcher> if i want to check a jfs partition what do i change thos numbers to in fstab so it will run a ckeck on boot? something like 0 2 if i recall
[04:31] <variant> skript: yep :)
[04:31] <SonikBoom> why is it that i can only get my resolution on my lcd up to 800x600 on the livecd of edgy eft?
[04:32] <sizzam> i'm using the default kernel in edgy (generic), i'm trying to install VMWare Workstation, and it needs to know "What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel?"
[04:32] <variant> jstarcher: i dont rememebr the exact digits but check man fstab
[04:32] <linuxnewb> is it posible to burn a cd from the terminal?  I killed my GUI trying to install XGL. :(
[04:32] <skript> variant:off to some background wi-fi reading then... thanks again :)
[04:32] <jbroome> linuxnewb: cdrecord -dao -eject -data <isofile>
[04:33] <linuxnewb> jbroome thanks, I'll give it a try.

[04:42] <bowman> heya. anyone know where on the system I can define "open .doc with openoffice"?
[04:43] <variant> TheReconHunter: this is a problem with the old version of gparted that ships with ubuntu
[04:44] <variant> TheReconHunter: is this a live cd or you installed system your using?
[04:44] <TheReconHunter> this is an edgy live cd
[04:44] <TheReconHunter> i just got it, but when i had a similar problem wtih my dapper cd
[04:44] <variant> TheReconHunter: ok, thats a shame as i was going to sugest installing the upgraded version but you would have to compile it at the momment
[04:44] <TheReconHunter> :-(
[04:44] <TheReconHunter> so
[04:44] <variant> TheReconHunter: its like 10x better, supports more file systems and actualy can move, resize etc partitions
[04:45] <TheReconHunter> o0o
[04:45] <variant> TheReconHunter: use the commmand like parted
[04:45] <variant> TheReconHunter: it's not that hard as long as your carefull with what you type
[04:45] <TheReconHunter> hrm
[04:45] <variant> TheReconHunter: start with the man page "man parted"
[04:45] <fyrestrtr> bowman: right click on file, open with other application...
[04:46] <TheReconHunter> variant: rephase please, i dont quite understand
[04:46] <variant> fyrestrtr: how do you make that permanent?
[04:46] <grndslm> how can i reset nvram if i can't connect to the router...is it possible?
[04:46] <grndslm> oops...wrong channel
[04:47] <variant> TheReconHunter: there is a command called parted, gparted is just a graphical interface to this command. you can run parted by opening a command prompt and entering the command with the correct options. the first thing you should do is type "man parted" and learn the basics of using it. it wont take long
[04:47] <TheReconHunter> oh, i see
[04:47] <TheReconHunter> well
[04:47] <TheReconHunter> i got a package from the internet
[04:47] <TheReconHunter> for the latest build of gparted
[04:47] <fyrestrtr> variant: I think gconf-editor can do that.
[04:47] <TheReconHunter> can i install/use that?
[04:47] <fyrestrtr> TheReconHunter:  if its a .deb for ubuntu, then yes. Just install it :)
[04:48] <TheReconHunter> its a tar.gz
[04:48] <TheReconHunter> and im on livecd
[04:48] <fyrestrtr> then its source, and you must compile it. However, the livecd has gparted on it.
[04:48] <TheReconHunter> but the livecd im currently using
[04:48] <albacker> hey what do i need to play .wma ?
[04:48] <TheReconHunter> wont let me do much to teh hard drive
[04:49] <fyrestrtr> albacker: windows codecs from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[04:49] <albacker> thanks fyrestrtr
[04:49] <fyrestrtr> TheReconHunter: what do you want to do with it?
[04:49] <TheReconHunter> well, how would i compile gparted?
[04:49] <TheReconHunter> fyrestrtr- i want to move a fat 32 partition
[04:49] <fyrestrtr> TheReconHunter: you can't compile if you are on the livecd.
[04:49] <variant> TheReconHunter: if you have a lot of ram you can installl a corresponding amount of software on the live environment (minus the space used by the live cd)
[04:49] <TheReconHunter> howevr
[04:49] <albacker> fyrestrtr, it doesnt talk about .wma ther !
[04:49] <TheReconHunter> ive got 2 gigs of ram
[04:49] <fyrestrtr> albacker: you need the w32codecs package, that includes wma.
[04:50] <variant> fyrestrtr: you can
[04:50] <netpython> albacker, http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf
[04:50] <TheReconHunter> so, how would i compile the tar.gz package?
[04:50] <albacker> fyrestrtr, thnx
[04:50] <bretzel> Hi there, is there a known glitch on beryl+ aiglx ? because I changed my Nvidia card from Gfx 6200 128mb to a Nvidia 7600GS 256MB and Beryl is slow, cpu angry ( yes - angry + hungry ) and there a regular lag in animations ( every  ~ 0.25sec ) ... With my previous edgy installation using gfx 6200 it was by far faster.. ( #ubuntu-xgl none respond to me :-( )
[04:50] <fyrestrtr> variant: I don't think the problem is getting solved by a new version of gparted.
[04:50] <variant> fyrestrtr: you just need enough free ram to install build-essential and the package being installed
[04:50] <netpython> TheReconHunter, first you have to unpack it:-0
[04:50] <variant> fyrestrtr: it would, as this is a known bug in the version of gparted that he is using
[04:50] <TheReconHunter> okay, then what
[04:51] <variant> TheReconHunter: do you have a lot of ram?
[04:51] <TheReconHunter> 2 gigs
[04:51] <netpython> TheReconHunter, Read the included README
[04:51] <variant> TheReconHunter: in that case your sorted
[04:51] <fyrestrtr> bretzel: beryl is beta software, so yes, there are plenty of 'known glitches'.
[04:51] <variant> TheReconHunter: in a command prompt type sudo apt-get install build-essential
[04:52] <bretzel> fyrestrtr: I know but why that now I have a better nvidia card, I am slower than the previous installation ?
[04:52] <TheReconHunter> alright variant. Now what?
[04:52] <arepie> how to hide icons on desktop?
[04:53] <TheReconHunter> do i select
[04:53] <TheReconHunter> create archive
[04:53] <TheReconHunter> and archive it as a .deb?
[04:53] <fyrestrtr> bretzel: there could be many reasons for it -- drivers, incompatibility, you discovered a new bug, etc. etc.

[04:53] <fyrestrtr> CarinArr: what do you want to know about pine?
[04:53] <CarinArr> does anyone know if there's a package for pine?
[04:53] <variant> TheReconHunter: did you download the gparted latest version?
[04:53] <CarinArr> fyrestrtr, just want to install it
[04:53] <fyrestrtr> !info pine
[04:53] <TheReconHunter> dreg: for some reason i had the same problem yesteray
[04:53] <ubotu> Package pine does not exist in any distro I know
[04:53] <CarinArr> heh
[04:53] <fyrestrtr> !info pico
[04:53] <TheReconHunter> variant: yes, it is a tar.gz and i extracted it
[04:53] <ubotu> Package pico does not exist in any distro I know
[04:54] <CarinArr> o.O
[04:54] <fyrestrtr> hrmm ... that's strange.
[04:54] <dreg> TheReconHunter, it is driving me completely insane haha, what did you do to repair it?
[04:54] <Kingsqueak> pine has an odd license as I recall and that is why
[04:54] <TheReconHunter> dreg: yeah, im just installing edgy, because i messed more than that up when trying to fix it
[04:54] <netpython> !pico
[04:54] <TheReconHunter> dreg: sry man, i had no idea as to what to do
[04:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pico - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:54] <dreg> TheReconHunter, ah, that's dissapointing... I remember reading about it before, that it's an actual bug in the window manager
[04:55] <TheReconHunter> variant: do i just compile it as a .deb?
[04:55] <TheReconHunter> nvm i cant
[04:55] <fyrestrtr> CarinArr: heh, when you search for pine, it comes up with nano, fetchmail and mutt. Maybe its trying to tell you something :P
[04:55] <dreg> Going to have to alt+tab until I can reinstall I guess
[04:55] <CarinArr> well i hate mutt with a passion
[04:55] <CarinArr> ;)
[04:55] <fyrestrtr> CarinArr: just install it from source if you must. I can't imagine pine having very difficult requirements.
[04:56] <salome> pine is out of development, highly insecure, posesses a license that is not compatable with GPL, and is quite buggy.
[04:56] <TheReconHunter> Now that i have the tar.gz and the build-essential package, what do i do to install the package
[04:56] <arepie> how to hide icons on desktop?
[04:56] <fyrestrtr> TheReconHunter: uncompress the tarball ( tar -xvvzf somefile.tar.gz then cd into somefile and then type ./configure )
[04:56] <CarinArr> salome, it might be, but i've used it for a decade, it's my security blanket
[04:57] <salome> yeah, im the same way about tin
[04:57] <salome> ive used it since 1.0
[04:57] <Ubunturookie> is it possible to run the live cd on a raid array?
[04:57] <TheReconHunter> cd?
[04:57] <TheReconHunter> i followed you up to uncompressing the archive
[04:57] <Ubunturookie> i get to where it says loading kernal and it stops responding
[04:57] <TheReconHunter> so i just have a folder
[04:57] <TheReconHunter> then what

[04:57] <TheReconHunter> aight

[05:00] <Ubunturookie> yeah

[05:00] <salome> yup, kitche
[05:00] <coz_> Ubunturookie, and which version of ubuntu are you trying toinstall
[05:00] <piggyg1> variant: any ideas on how to fix that?

[05:03] <Ubunturookie> so not sure if it will work on that

[05:04] <Akuma_> kitche: hmm.. would have been nice ..
[05:04] <Trixsey> I downloaded the CD ISO and burned it on a DVD (didn't have any CDs), changed boot-order in BIOS to CD/DVD first.. boosted.. got to a menue where I could choose "Install ubuntu now" or something, so I tried it out. A loading screen came up, the computer played some sounds after it finnished loading and my screen went black :P
[05:04] <kitche> Nikolas according tot hat it's libglade not glib
[05:04] <coz_> Ubunturookie, ah i see, well i am not the right person to talk to baout that however, you want to donwload the alternative cd with more options, but that doesn't seem to be th prblem... someone here can help with the reaid issues ... but let me check the net to see if people have solved theo problems assoiciated with this , if any
[05:04] <Paddy_EIRE> what is the command to install the K7 kernal in edgy
[05:04] <Trixsey> So I tried CD-Test (0 checksums failed) and Memory test (0 errors)
[05:05] <Trixsey> What can be wrong? Why does my screen go black trying to install Ubuntu 6.1?
[05:05] <Nikolas> kitche, I've gotten this with anjuta and it complained that gnomevfs has undefined references to glib functions
[05:05] <factorx> My notebook hangs while shutting down, why so, and what can I do against that?

[05:06] <Ubunturookie> thanks man
[05:06] <piggyg1> Trixsey: what kind of notebook you have?
[05:07] <Trixsey> Acer
[05:07] <piggyg1> Trixsey: model?
[05:07] <Ubunturookie> i have to go to work but i will play with this tonight
[05:07] <Trixsey> travel mate
[05:07] <TheReconHunter> Hey. I just compiled a gparted package sucessfully, but for some reason, when i try using gparted, it brings me to the old version. anyone know why?
[05:07] <piggyg1> Trixsey: a little more specific would be nice
[05:07] <Trixsey> 8101 WLMI
[05:07] <Trixsey> sorry, had to check :p
[05:07] <piggyg1> k
[05:07] <coz_> Ubunturookie, look for the alternative cd download on this  page http://www.gtlib.gatech.edu/pub/ubuntu-releases/edgy/
[05:07] <Ubunturookie> thanks man
[05:08] <jrib> TheReconHunter: how did you install it?
[05:08] <Ubunturookie> see you later
[05:08] <Ubunturookie> off to work
[05:08] <TheReconHunter> i cded to the unextracted package
[05:08] <Ubunturookie> thanks for the help
[05:08] <TheReconHunter> and idd ./configure
[05:08] <Ubunturookie> ;o)
[05:09] <TheReconHunter> adn got all the necessary packages
[05:09] <jrib> !enter
[05:09] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[05:09] <Trixsey> Tried to install Ubuntu and screen went all black -_-
[05:09] <Trixsey> Really a mystery :(
[05:09] <piggyg1> Trixsey: still reading the specs, but when mine went blank it was because of a bad cd
[05:10] <Trixsey> piggyg1: my cd works fine with anything else :/
[05:10] <Trixsey> oh you mean the ubuntu cd
[05:10] <piggyg1> Trixsey: I re-downloaded the iso, burned a new copy and BOOM it worked
[05:10] <Trixsey> thought you ment the drtive
[05:10] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, make  then sudo checkinstall
[05:10] <Trixsey> oh okay
[05:10] <Trixsey> I'll try it out, perhaps on a CD this time too.. and not a DVD
[05:10] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, what are you trying to install by the way?
[05:10] <TheReconHunter> the newer version of gparted via the live cd
[05:11] <TheReconHunter> because i cant do much with the one that it came with
[05:11] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, ahh.  well after ./configure now you need to run make  so at the terminal in the folder just type make
[05:12] <TheReconHunter> o0o
[05:12] <TheReconHunter> okay
[05:12] <TheReconHunter> and do i have to be cded into the folder to do this?
[05:12] <piggyg1> Trixsey: yeah, ubuntu don't work on Virtual PC for some crazy reason :( thats my problem too
[05:12] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, yeah you should still be in the folder after you ran ./configure
[05:13] <jrib> ubotu: tell TheReconHunter about compiling
[05:13] <h1st0> jrib, won't work I already sent him instructions
[05:14] <TheReconHunter> after make is completed, i should be able to use gparted, correct?
[05:14] <jrib> TheReconHunter: no, then use checkinstall (you'll need to install it)
[05:14] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, no  make just builds it
[05:14] <koke> o.laa
[05:14] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, make compiles it then we run checkinstall to install it.
[05:14] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, sudo checkinstall actually.
[05:15] <jrib> TheReconHunter: though if you are on the livecd it doesn't matter much if you just do 'sudo make install'
[05:15] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, whats wrong with the gparted on the live cd?
[05:15] <piggyg1> Why doesn't ubuntu work on Virtual PC 2004?
[05:15] <lmosher> Ok I'm finally upgrading to Edgy. Is it better to upgrade (from Dapper) or to re-install? Dapper was my first Ubuntu, before I used Fedora and that crew always suggested a fresh install.
[05:15] <h1st0> piggyg1, ask them.
[05:15] <piggyg1> i know eh'
[05:15] <bretzel> btw, I have the same results using Beryl + XGL ( lag @every ~0.25sec ) same as in aiglx... might be the NVidia driver or misconfig in xorg.conf ...?
[05:15] <TheReconHunter> well, it will not let my move my ext3 partition
[05:15] <piggyg1> if it did man it would rock
[05:15] <TheReconHunter> and it keeps doing nothing and freezing
[05:15] <h1st0> !upgrade | lmosher
[05:15] <ubotu> lmosher: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[05:15] <lmosher> bretzel, isn't it possible to use beryl w/out xgl anf aiglx using the newest X?
[05:16] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, are you currently on the live cd or your base system?
[05:16] <TheReconHunter> live cd atm
=== methodone is now known as MethodOne
[05:16] <bretzel> lmosher: how to get the last X ? ( 7.1.1 ? )
[05:16] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, so you are trying to install the new version from source while booted on the live cd?  well then after make is done just do sudo make install
[05:16] <segfault_> lmosher, it is possible with the latest nvidia driver
[05:16] <TheReconHunter> okay
[05:16] <TheReconHunter> thank you
[05:16] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, did you remove the old version?
[05:17] <TheReconHunter> not yet
[05:17] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, well you might want to do that.  befor einstalling the new one.
[05:17] <ailean> lahey
[05:17] <bretzel> segfault_: latest nvidia driver has bugs ?
[05:17] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, if it removes the dependencies for gparted you could always install those with out installing gparted.
[05:17] <bretzel> -- of course if it is beta :-)
[05:17] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, with build-dep
[05:18] <segfault_> bretzel, i tried it when it was in beta and everything was good except suspend/hibernate, i have not tried it since it was released non beta
[05:18] <ailean> bretzel, i haven't seen any bugs...
[05:18] <TheReconHunter> how would i do that
[05:18] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, i.e. sudo apt-get remove gparted && sudo apt-get build-dep gparted
[05:18] <TheReconHunter> because it did delete the dependencies lol
[05:18] <lmosher> bretzel, I'm not sure of the details as I haven't tried. Watch the Beryl forms they post some useful information and how-tos there
[05:18] <segfault_> !nvnida-beta | bretzel
[05:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvnida-beta - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:18] <bretzel> is it possible that the latest driver is slower than the previous rel. ?
[05:18] <h1st0> TheReconHunter, well just apt-get build-dep gparted  should just install the dependencies
[05:18] <segfault_> !nvidia-beta | bretzel
[05:18] <ubotu> bretzel: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) Beta version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[05:19] <bretzel> segfault_: I did use the amaranth repo to get the driver  ( nvidia-glx )
[05:19] <TheReconHunter> okay
[05:20] <TheReconHunter> im done with all of that, and now im starting up gparted, but it doesnt seem to be doing much
[05:20] <segfault_> bretzel, then u can use beryl without xgl
[05:20] <TheReconHunter> darn, its stuck at scanning all devices
[05:21] <TheReconHunter> w/e, ill just restart and do what i can
[05:21] <bretzel> I do use ( I am actually with aiglx + beryl ) -- this is the installed version: 1.0.9629+2.6.17.6-2~amaranth
[05:21] <bretzel> version of nvidia-glx of course :-)
[05:21] <segfault_> bretzel, with that nvidia driver u dont need aiglx either (ucan use, but dont need to)
=== dv__ is now known as dv_
[05:23] <bretzel> segfault_: oops you lost me here, How do I know I am using aiglx ( by not explicitly using Xgl  ) ??
[05:24] <kitche> bretzel: you will have to look at your Xorg.0.log and see if it says anything about aiglx in there
[05:24] <bretzel> kitche: thanks seeking it now :-)

[05:25] <Noah0504> Does anyone happen to have an orkut account?
[05:25] <Vuen> hey guys, i'm setting up ubuntu on an old laptop. it's a pentium 2 333mhz, with 64 mb of ram and a 6 gig hard drive. is this enough to run kubuntu? should i put xubuntu on it?
[05:25] <temba> sys requirements searched ?
[05:25] <bretzel> cool : X is 7.1.1 :-)
[05:26] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, id go for a server install and xfce (or perhaps even fluxbox)
[05:26] <nolimitsoya> server install to cut down the extra fat...
[05:26] <temba> any1 here knows good tuts about , how to crypt partitions with 2fish ?
[05:26] <nolimitsoya> ehm... i think it might be called command line install, and not server, in edgy...
[05:27] <nolimitsoya> temba, man 2fish?
[05:27] <easytiger> my upgrade to 6.1 broke my vmware.. how do i fix?
[05:27] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: yeah, i'm already doing a server install, it doesn't have enough memory to boot the livecd
[05:27] <bretzel> backing store disabled ....
[05:28] <brosioz> how could i allow my user to write into /var/www ??
[05:28] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: it's for a friend who's migrating from windows; i'd much rather have kubuntu on it, because it's easier to make it look like windows. do you think it would run well? is there somewhere a list of hardware requirements/suggestions for kde?
[05:28] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, good :) but are you installing a command line system, or just doing a command line install? those things are not the same, and its the formar that is to be preferred in your case
[05:28] <mots> how can i mount ufs2 on ubuntu?
[05:29] <mots> and: does ubuntus grub support ufs2?
[05:29] <Vuen> installing a command line system? on a laptop?
[05:29] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, kde can run on quite slow hw, but id still suggest a more lightweighwm
[05:29] <bretzel> segfault_: nothing about aiglx then I don't use it it means ... do you know if using it may be faster ?  and how to  ?
[05:29] <temba> any crypt experts here ? how do i crypt partitions? in suse i can do in installa ( setup)
[05:29] <godmachine81> ifireball:: what was you talking about earlier?
[05:29] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: mm. well, i've got nothing to do all day, so i'll throw kubuntu on it, and if it's too slow i'll just apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[05:29] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: thanks
[05:29] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, just select 'install commandlinesystem' or the like from the alternate cd boot :) then fetch all packages you want manualy after install
[05:30] <Vuen> temba: look up TrueCrypt for full drive encryption
[05:30] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, dont install the -desktoppackages
[05:30] <factorx> crazy netsplit
[05:30] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: oh. how come?
[05:30] <kitche> factorx: no they are rehubbing the europe servers
[05:30] <Vuen> aargh
[05:31] <Gwildor> let things settle
[05:31] <segfault_> bretzel, i dont use aiglx and havent tried it, i dont recall how to tell if u r using it or not.  I am using xgl and nvidia 8776 currently for suspend/hibernate (it may work in latest nvidia release i havent tried), as far performance between with/without xgl i didnt notice much of a diff
=== zorro is now known as zoral
[05:32] <mots> well
[05:32] <earthian> how do you tell if you are using aiglx ?
[05:32] <mots> guess its normal again...
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, did you get my last messages about what packets to install and what not to install?
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> *packages
[05:33] <mots> in case nobody read it, i asked if its possible to mount ufs2 and if ubuntus grub can read it
[05:33] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: nope, just the message about not installing -desktop packages
[05:33] <kitche> mots: not that I m aware of
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, dont install the -desktoppackages
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> they will bog you down
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> just apt-get install kde-core
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> or, apt-get install xfce
[05:33] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: :/
[05:34] <soccio> Hi everybody
[05:34] <foomanchew> Under XGL and beryl... anyone know how I can make terminal  server client applet to not use a transparent window ?
[05:34] <nolimitsoya> and install xserver-xorg-core xfonts-base
[05:34] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: ordinarily i'd agree, but it's for a friend who's afraid of command lines or installing things. if i forget to install something important she'll freak out
[05:34] <foomanchew> its very annoying
[05:34] <foomanchew> cant see my windows servers
[05:34] <bretzel> ooh! I just read that AIGLX works with "dri" -- trying it
[05:34] <soccio> Is there any application to create backup bootable disks for very easy and fast recover?
[05:34] <foomanchew> desktops
[05:34] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, then you can come help her out :) and btw, theres always synaptic ;)
[05:34] <bretzel> cya
[05:34] <Gent> Well, firefox didn't like that version of chatzilla
[05:35] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, at least its better than an unusable system weighted down with bloat :)
[05:35] <Vuen> soccio: not to my knowledge, but there a lot of variations of floppy-disk linux distributions with which you could recover.
[05:35] <Gent> so, as I was saying.  Anyone here got nvidia raid-1 working with edgy?
[05:35] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: mkay. that's a good idea
[05:35] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: i'll do that
[05:35] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: thanks for the help
[05:35] <soccio> Vuen: I know... but what if I only have one CD drive and the backup is on the same CD?
[05:36] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, no problem :)
[05:36] <Vuen> i'll probably be back in a couple hours for help installing the wireless card :(
[05:36] <Gent> I'm getting this really screwy problem at boot... there's about 9,000 others with the same issue it seems (when I search google), but no one has the answer for me
[05:36] <madman91> hey all... i want ubuntu to be my friend, but i doubt it wants to be mine... i downloaded 4 diff cd's ... ubuntu 6.06 6.10 (regular) and ubuntu 6.06 6.10 (alternate, which i used to try to install with text) .... both text installs only did the first 2 loading things... the safe graphics in 6.06 worked and 6.10 safe graphics didnt... i loaded into 6.06 safe .. and I went through the installer.. but if finished without really in
[05:36] <madman91> stalling anything.. i went through the 5? steps and no errors... and then it pooped..
[05:36] <Gent> I get the ubuntu splash, and then it konks out and busybox starts complaining can't find tty; job control turned off
[05:36] <nolimitsoya> soccio, then get another one, or boot into a ramdrive, or of a usb pendrive
[05:36] <Vuen> soccio: not livecds, floppy disk distributions. so you run linux off the floppy and put in your backup cd.
[05:36] <nolimitsoya> !wireless | Vuen
[05:36] <ubotu> Vuen: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:37] <Vuen> soccio: alternatively, you can just install DSL on a usb key
[05:37] <Damon> 'evening ^
[05:37] <Damon> ^^*
[05:37] <soccio> Vuen, nolimitsoya: Ok thanks, but I was looking for something more similar to the old versions of Norton Ghost... and I have no floppy driver...
[05:37] <Al_lA> hey, just wondering what's a good size to give my boot partition?
[05:38] <Gent> every fix for the problem tells me to edit my inittab, but it doesn't look like edgy has one
[05:38] <Vuen> soccio: ah. do you have a usb key? DSL is apparently pretty easy to set up on one
[05:38] <nolimitsoya> soccio, as said, you dont need a floppy driver. ghosting can be done by just dumping the filesystem to a file, but there is no need on a unix system. just build a tar ball
[05:38] <Jimbo53> hello
[05:38] <kitche> soccio: you might want to look up sysrescd if your looking for something like ghost since it has partimage on a livecd
[05:39] <nolimitsoya> still, a tar ball only has advantages over a disk image :)
[05:39] <Jimbo53> total n00b here trying to install gparted
[05:39] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo53, sudo apt-get install gparted
[05:39] <Gent> anyone?
[05:40] <nolimitsoya> Gent, man upstart
[05:40] <soccio> kitche: could you give me the sysrescd address?
[05:40] <Gent> nolimitsoya, well that'd be nice, but I can't boot in
[05:40] <Al_lA> how much should I give my boot partition? Say 50meg?
[05:40] <Jimbo53> nolimitsoya: thats not what the instructions said
[05:40] <nolimitsoya> Gent, use a live cd then :) what problem are you having?
[05:40] <sotcommy> Hi there, i've got a problem with my ubuntu 6.10 edgy (actually for testing beryl). I cant get the swiss keyboard layout completely to work... the Alt Gr key and the windows key don't work. Any1 in here who can help me?
[05:40] <Jimbo53> all I ever used before was windows
[05:40] <kitche> nolimitsoya: umm partimage makes a disk image just that it uses .tar.gz but uses an extension of like 100 and such instead of .tar.gz|bz2
[05:40] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo53, what instructions? anyway, installation of sortware is done as i said :)
[05:40] <Gent> nolimitsoya, busybox is saying can't access tty; job controlled turned off
[05:41] <salim> Jimbo53 what did the instruction say? what instructions?
[05:41] <Gent> and dropping to a shell
[05:41] <Jimbo53> one sed
[05:41] <kitche> soccio: it's sysrescd.org or you can go to partiamge.org and at the bottom of the page the link for sysrescd should be there
[05:41] <Gent> I figured I would have device issues, but I thought it would be with the raid stuff.... that stuff seems to work fine
[05:41] <Jimbo53> salim: 1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
[05:41] <Jimbo53>      `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
[05:41] <Jimbo53>      using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
[05:41] <Jimbo53>      `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
[05:41] <Jimbo53>      `configure' itself.
[05:41] <Jimbo53>      Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
[05:41] <nolimitsoya> kitche, but still, a disk image is inferior to a tarball :)
[05:41] <Jimbo53>      messages telling which features it is checking for.
[05:42] <Jimbo53>   2. Type `make' to compile the package.
[05:42] <Jimbo53>   3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
[05:42] <Jimbo53>      the package.

[05:42] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo53, forget instructions, and do as i say ;)
[05:43] <Jimbo53> with the install file i downloaded from the web
[05:43] <nolimitsoya> no
[05:43] <sotcommy> can someone help me with the swiss-german keyboard layout?
[05:43] <Jimbo53> it was in the zip

[05:43] <boink> sotcommy: what do you need that
[05:43] <sotcommy> hmm?
[05:43] <sotcommy> :)
[05:43] <boink> just use the alt keys to make the umlauts
[05:44] <salim> @Jimbo53 do you know where to find/start synaptic?
[05:44] <Jimbo53> no
[05:44] <sotcommy> i need it for the (at)'s and stuff like that
[05:44] <nolimitsoya> Jimbo53, its in your system menu, though i fint the terminal command faster and easier to remember
[05:44] <Jimbo53> i just loaded this yesterday

[05:46] <Jimbo53> im in the pm window
[05:46] <ac2n> hello-goodbye
[05:46] <Solarion> with edgy, I'm having a problem with sensors -s.  I get the following error: Can't access procfs/sysfs file
[05:46] <Solarion> Unable to find i2c bus information;
[05:46] <Solarion> For 2.6 kernels, make sure you have mounted sysfs and libsensors
[05:47] <Jimbo53> salim can you see my typing in the pm?
[05:47] <Gent> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-263432.html
[05:47] <Gent> I NEED some answers to that
[05:47] <tylerl> Could someone explain to me the difference between GTK, Metacity, etc?
[05:47] <Al_lA> would 100meg be the right size for a boot partition?
[05:47] <salim> no I cant
[05:47] <Gent> GTK is a toolkit, Metacity is a window manager
[05:47] <Al_lA> it's not exactly going to use up a lot, right?
[05:47] <salim> I didnt get any message of you
[05:48] <Jimbo53> i have been responding in the pm
[05:48] <nolimitsoya> Al_lA, 50mb is two times tomuch :)
[05:48] <salim> that's strange
[05:48] <tylerl> Gent: I keep downloading themes etc (GTK and Metacity), and the borders and my desktop look right, but all of my buttons and tabs and things look very "legacy".  What am I most likely missing
[05:48] <Jimbo53> wonder why the text doesnt come through as i can see your messages
[05:48] <salim> but you get mine?
[05:48] <Al_lA> ah cool, okay nolimitsoya.. thanks :)
[05:48] <Jimbo53> yes i get yours
[05:48] <salim> well I will explain you there then, and you can write to me here, but write my name when you adress me, so I know this message was for me
[05:49] <Jimbo53> try joining #jimbo
[05:49] <Jimbo53> ?
[05:49] <earthian> hello how do i rebuild a fontcache?
[05:50] <brad_> Hi  all.  for some unknown reason, my kopete and gaim disconnect from msn and google talk without warning.  All my contacts look like they're online, and the icon shows me as being online, but i am not.  any ideas
[05:50] <nolimitsoya> Al_lA, its a good idea to have some headroom forkernel updates and switches, so make it about 40-60mb :)
[05:51] <Poromenos> does anyone have experience with hardware raid in ubuntu?
[05:52] <psusi> this wouldn't happen to be one of those sata ones would it?
[05:52] <psusi> or are we talking a $400 scsi raid card?
[05:53] <n00mz> hi, is sound delay in games a common issue on ubuntu?
[05:53] <mandelum> I HAVE A NE3W BUG IN EDGY
[05:53] <Solarion> n00mz: what game?
[05:53] <mandelum> sorry for caps lock
[05:53] <Poromenos> it's a motherboard with an onboard raid controller and two sata disks
[05:53] <n00mz> Solarion: Quake 3
[05:53] <mandelum> apps keep on shtting down just like that
[05:53] <psusi> Poromenos: ok.. it's a fake hardware raid then... read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto
[05:53] <Poromenos> psusi: great, thanks
[05:53] <Solarion> n00mz: native?
=== mostafa_as3ad is now known as afandina
[05:54] <Gent> psusi, have you set that stuff up?
[05:54] <mandelum> it happened with firefox and now, a couple of times with inkscape
[05:54] <psusi> Gent: yes... I wrote the howto
[05:54] <[sYn] > Poromenos, I used http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2557 to get mine working
[05:54] <n00mz> Solarion: yeah used the linux installer
[05:54] <Gent> Oh, maybe you can help me then
[05:54] <Gent> btw, great howto
[05:54] <psusi> thanks
[05:54] <mandelum> anyone know what it is?
[05:54] <Solarion> n00mz: dunno then.  *should* work fine, but I don't know much about what quake is using for sound.
[05:54] <Gent> but I've run into an issue, and perhaps you can't help me as I think this is more edgy/upstart related than anything to do with the raid
[05:54] <psusi> shoot
[05:55] <Solarion> stupid sensors
[05:55] <Gent> I've got the system all fully installed and what not by mounting and chrooting and all that.... and the dmraid stuff is in fine, and all is well with the devices...
[05:55] <n00mz> Solarion: yeah it *should*, other people don't seem to have an issue
[05:55] <Gent> but when I try and boot the actual system buxybox is dropping out telling me that it can't access the tty
[05:55] <Poromenos> psusi: wait, i see here that it won't read the data from the other disk in case of corruption in RAID1
[05:55] <Poromenos> then what is it good for?
[05:55] <Solarion> n00mz: sound working fine elsewhere?
[05:55] <brad_> could my google talk being dropped be a ubuntu problem, or the IM app problem?
[05:56] <n00mz> Solarion: yeah, though I havn't had the chance to test other games
[05:56] <daniel05> I'm trying to configure the Evolution email client for a MS Exchange account. I type in the OWA URL and my username on the setup page, but they cannot be authenticated. I can access the mail fine from the Web. What could I be doing wrong?
[05:56] <Solarion> n00mz: you now how to config the sound in quake?  I've unfortunately not got a copy.  :(
[05:57] <psusi> Gent: please pastebin your menu.lst and fdisk -l on the raid device
[05:57] <n00mz> Solarion: I 'fixed' the issue by using s_useopenal within the game, but something's gone wrong even with that and it no longer fixes the delay
[05:57] <Solarion> n00mz: weird
[05:57] <Gent> psusi, unfortunately, I can't... this is a system at work that I'm building for a customer, and I'm at home
[05:57] <Solarion> dunno what s_usopenal is (arg to quake4?)
[05:57] <Gent> I can tell you this for certain though, I only have 4 partitions
[05:57] <Gent> Linux root is the 3rd
[05:57] <psusi> Poromenos: currently I think the dm won't auto failover... you can still bring down the system and boot up just off the good drive though, so you don't loose any data
[05:57] <Gent> in grub I'm using (hd0,2)
[05:58] <psusi> Poromenos: thouhg they may have fixed that recently actually....
[05:58] <Gent> and for root I'm pointing at /dev/mapper/nvidia_bc...3
[05:58] <Gent> the ... is the other seemingly random letters
[05:58] <captine> anyone had a similar prob with IM app on edgy, where they just disconnect, but still appear connected?
[05:58] <Poromenos> psusi: ah, good
[05:58] <psusi> Gent: hrm.... looks good...
[05:59] <psusi> Poromenos: I use raid0 myself...
[05:59] <Gent> Yeah... and it's weird, when it drops to buxybox
[05:59] <Poromenos> psusi: i am installing the ubuntu server cd, any idea how the instructions work there? or is it not possible to do that?
[05:59] <Gent> everything seems sorta in check
[05:59] <Iceman_B^Ltop> yay support \o/
[05:59] <psusi> Poromenos: not possible.. you must use the livecd and install manually
[05:59] <Gent> in busybox I can execute varying commands and I can see the nvidia raid devices in /dev/mapper
[05:59] <Gent> and all that looks good
[05:59] <kitche> Gent well the busybox is in the initrd image
[05:59] <Poromenos> psusi: oh, okay, thanks
[05:59] <Gent> I'm fairly certain it's not related to disk issues/raid not configured/booting right...
[05:59] <Gent> kitchen, I'm aware, either way, I need those devices
[06:00] <Gent> without them the system ain't booting to raid
[06:00] <psusi> Gent: what exactly does it complain about again?
[06:00] <Gent> psusi, says:  can't access tty; job control turned off
[06:00] <Noah0504> Does anyone happen to have an orkut account?
[06:00] <Gent> lots of people seem to be having the issue, but none of their fixes/ideas worked for me
[06:00] <Vuen> hey all, i just booted from a kubuntu alternate cd. what do all these options mean? "install in text mode" "install in oem mode" "install a command-line system"
[06:00] <psusi> Gent: that's normal once it decides to go into a shell... what does it say before that?  that's when something goes wrong
[06:01] <Gent> Oh... hrm... I'm not sure I ever noticed anything before that
[06:01] <psusi> Gent: ohh, by the way... are you using the updated package attached to the bug report?
[06:01] <kitche> Vuen: install in text mode is liek th debian installer install in oem mode is if you want to make an oem install and install a command-line ysstem will just install command-line
[06:01] <shingalated> does anyone know why I am unable to download packages? apt gets stuck at "0% [Connecting to 192.168 (192.0.0.168)] "
[06:01] <Vuen> kitche: what's an oem install?
[06:01] <Gent> It begins the splash screen and then just drops to busybox
[06:01] <Gent> psusi, which bug report? the one in your article?
[06:01] <kitche> Vuen: it's like Dell installs and such when you buy a new windows machine
[06:01] <psusi> shingalated: because you have it configured to use a repository or proxy in your local network that is not responding?
[06:01] <Vuen> shingalated: it says connecting to 192.0.0.168, which is a local address on your home network.
[06:02] <psusi> Gent: yes
[06:02] <nolimitsoya> how do i edit the menu? xfce menu editor doesnt let me edit sorting or add programs in fex the network submenu; its on a diffrent level...
[06:02] <Vuen> kitche: what's the difference between that and text mode?
[06:02] <psusi> Gent: remove the splash and quiet options from the kernel command line
[06:02] <Vuen> kitche: is text mode like for a server?
[06:02] <kitche> Vuen: oem will let you choose what is installed while a text mode will install the full system and command-line is for servers pretty much or for someone that wants to start off with a base system
[06:02] <salim> nolimitsoya: I wouldn't use XFCE, it just makes probs and isnt that much faster, use gnome or KDE
[06:02] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, text mode is what you want
[06:02] <shingalated> psusi, how do I tell it not use a proxy?
[06:03] <psusi> actually, 192.0.0.168 is a valid Internet Ip address.. 192.168.1.0/24 is the local reserved class C
[06:03] <nolimitsoya> salim, thats not my experience, nor my question :)
[06:03] <Gent> psusi, that's a good idea... and I will do that as soon as I'm at the computer again
[06:03] <Gent> not sure why I didn't think of that before
[06:03] <badi> hi^^
[06:03] <Vuen> nolimitsoya, kitche, thanks
[06:03] <shingalated> psusi, why would it be getting stuck there?
[06:03] <Gent> I guess I just thought the TTY stuff was the error
[06:03] <salim> nolimitsoya I used xubuntu before, and somehow wasn't really happy with it
[06:03] <psusi> shingalated: undo whatever you did in the first place to set it to use a proxy?
[06:03] <nolimitsoya> salim, xubuntu != xfce
[06:03] <Gent> so I figured it had something to do with a tty device missing
[06:03] <psusi> shingalated: because it can't contact the proxy... probably because you entered the wrong address
[06:04] <nolimitsoya> still, where does the menu configs reside so i can edit them manualy?
[06:04] <badi> can anyone help me?
[06:04] <Gent> I use slackware at home... so all this busybox/bootsplash stuff is foreign to me :(
[06:04] <nolimitsoya> !anyone badi
[06:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about anyone badi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:04] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | badi
[06:04] <ubotu> badi: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[06:04] <psusi> Gent: naw.. busybox allways complains about that once it is invoked in the initramfs
[06:04] <Skyrail> anyone know where I can find instructions for installing apache specifically on ubuntu?
[06:04] <Gent> psusi, well that clears that up
[06:04] <Gent> I guess I just need to find the REAL error now
[06:04] <badi> i search for a .deb file for the pache 2.2
[06:04] <badi> apache 2.2
[06:05] <psusi> Skyrail: sudo apt-get install apache2
[06:05] <Skyrail> ok thanks heh
[06:05] <Gent> psusi, I'll be heading to work later, and certainly will get back with any info I find if I can't conquer it
[06:05] <psusi> Gent: are you using the deb attached to the bug report?
[06:05] <Gent> thanks for all the help so far, and thanks for the excellent howto
[06:05] <daxxar> How would I disable the feature that makes my ubuntu machine set the monitor to 'power save', i.e. only a hardware event like a keyboard-perss wakes it up again?
[06:05] <daxxar> (The screen is blank / black)
[06:05] <Gent> psusi, yes, I followed the howto to the T
[06:05] <psusi> Gent: you are installing edgy right?  ok
[06:05] <Solarion> heh.  had to modprobe the stuff.  What a silly error
[06:05] <Gent> if you mean the one that's listed in your howto
[06:05] <psusi> yea
[06:06] <Gent> you said that earlier and I wasn't sure what bug report you were talking about, cause I was linking to several others earlier
[06:06] <name_> how to install the kernel headers?
[06:06] <simosgin> i want to install beryl on edgy, i'm running an athlon xp and an nvidia card. currently i'm trying to install the nvidia driver but it says it can't load the kernel driver
[06:06] <POVaddct> name_: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[06:06] <simosgin> i was wondering if there's an up to date FAQ to do this stuff
[06:06] <badi> i search for a deb file of the apache 2.2 webserver
[06:06] <name_> thnx
[06:07] <psusi> Gent: once you chrooted into the hard disk, you installed the working deb from the bug report there as well right?
[06:07] <mandelum> should you always unmount a usb pen before taking it out?
[06:07] <Gent> psusi, yes
[06:07] <nolimitsoya> ok, trying a rephrase then: if i want to edit my menu from command line, how do i do that?
[06:07] <psusi> Gent: you end up installing it twice... once on the livecd, then again in the chroot
[06:07] <psusi> ok
[06:07] <POVaddct> mandelum: yes
[06:07] <Gent> I've been working in the chroot environment for 3 days with various tweaks, workarounds, and bug fixes
[06:07] <name_> POVaddct: where are they stored then?
[06:07] <psusi> mandelum: absolutely
=== Spec[x]  is now known as Spec
[06:08] <POVaddct> name_: usually in /usr/src/linux-<VERSION>/include
[06:08] <Skyrail> psusi: I've done that, now how do I configure it and access it?
[06:09] <psusi> Skyrail: fire up a browser and point it to http://127.0.0.1
[06:09] <POVaddct> name_: where <VERSION> is your kernel version
[06:09] <salim> name_: you can get your kernel version with "uname -r"
[06:10] <name_> i do know that
[06:10] <Skyrail> psusi: awesome ok, I see now, how would other people access this computer and see a 'web page' of some sort on there? would they type in my IP address if its static?
[06:11] <psusi> Skyrail: yes, but for now all they are goign to see is the Congradulations, you have installed apache! page, and the online help files
[06:11] <name_> POVaddct: you did not gimmi the right pkg
[06:11] <Skyrail> psusi: yup I see that, I just need to find the apache folder to put my own index page there
[06:11] <POVaddct> name_: build-essential has kernel-headers as dependency
[06:11] <sonja> good day Y'all, new install of Ubuntu one disc, no other O/S on my mobo, system monitor says ,, network history, received 1.1 MiB , sent 8.8KiB, its road runner direct conected , ethernet, but I cant get any programs online like Firefox,, Any Ideas ??
[06:12] <psusi> Skyrail: you should configure it... the config files are in /etc/apache2... the help pages explain all the settings
[06:12] <dreg> You can fix the window focus problem by reinstalling the Ubuntu metacity package just FYI
[06:12] <name_> i dont have a 2.4 kernel
[06:12] <nolimitsoya> sonja, dns problems? can you ping the outside world?
[06:12] <Skyrail> psusi: ok thanks, I'll do that
[06:12] <name_> it tells me to chose
[06:12] <what_if> sonja: have you tried pinging an internet ip address ??
[06:12] <sonja> nolimitsoya--> I am new to ubuntu and linux I have no idea
[06:12] <what_if> sonja: like ' ping www.google.com '
[06:13] <sonja> What_if in a shell ? term ??
[06:13] <andreas__> hi, i need to know which version of the rt2500 third party drivers ubuntu 5.10 shipped with. any idea where i could find such an information?(besides downloading the iso, of course)
[06:13] <what_if> sonja: yes indeed
[06:13] <name_> binary kernels suck :)
[06:13] <POVaddct> name_: the build-essential package never told me to choose kernel version. are you on dapper of edgy?
[06:13] <arjun> anyone here used ffmpeg2theora?
[06:13] <name_> i always used self built
[06:13] <name_> edgy
[06:13] <Skyrail> actually psusi when I go to that IP it gives me a page with the apache folder, I then click on that and it takes me to that page
[06:13] <name_> linux-headers-2.6.17-10-386
[06:13] <name_> that's it
[06:14] <nolimitsoya> sonja, try 'ifconfig eth0' in a terminal and se what falls out :) use pastebin!

[06:14] <salim> sonja: applications->accessories->Terminal
[06:15] <nolimitsoya> sonja, alt+f2 and type xterm
[06:15] <psusi> ick.... the gnome terminal is way nicer
[06:15] <nolimitsoya> psusi, but i wasnt sure she was using gnome ;)
[06:15] <nolimitsoya> xterm is universal :)
[06:16] <POVaddct> nolimitsoya: right
[06:16] <psusi> applications->accessories->terminal is too ;)
[06:16] <name_> and how to install the includes
[06:16] <nolimitsoya> psusi, not in xfce, fluxbox or icewm ;)
[06:16] <POVaddct> psusi: only on ubuntu, not on kubuntu or xubuntu
[06:16] <psusi> doesn't kde have a similar menu that runs konsole instead?
[06:16] <nolimitsoya> doesnt matter, since its still not universal
[06:16] <cyzie> anybody has xgl/compiz install properly in ubuntu? any workable quick howto?

[06:21] <kitche> cirvin_fox it's looking in a different spot for the libraries most likely
[06:21] <Skyrail> psusi: so how do I get my webpage showing there?
[06:21] <tonyyarusso> Chimera_: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/6.06.0/MD5SUMS
[06:21] <Chimera_> I have also been having problems while installing the 6.06 LTS desktop iso. It jams-freezes at the point of selecting the language and clicking next.
[06:21] <psusi> Skyrail: read the help files and learn to configure apache ;)
[06:21] <cirvin_fox> how can i redirect it to /usr/lib/?
[06:22] <Skyrail> psusi: ohnoes, ah well ok :)
[06:22] <psusi> Skyrail: the config files are in /etc/apache2
[06:22] <zspada15> off topic

[06:22] <zspada15> off topic: anyone like the traveling wilburys?
[06:22] <Vuen> Chimera_: boot from the cd and choose the Check CD for Defects. i had the same thing the first time i burned dapper, and the cd was screwed up
[06:22] <psusi> Chimera_: the cd has a boot option to check its own sum
[06:22] <Chimera_>  tony, yeah... thats why i was looking for the sums, i think my problem might have been the burn speed 52x and sums.
[06:23] <Skyrail> psusi: yeah I'm looking in apache2.conf and can't see anything obvious yet
[06:23] <cirvin_fox> it claims that std::cout is undefined, its not finding a certain library i think, i tried reinstalling gcc from source last night, but it didnt help anything
[06:23] <Chimera_> Vuen, lol it freezes on the squashfs
[06:23] <livingdaylight> anyone heard of Freemind?
[06:23] <Vuen> Chimera_: haha, yeah, 52x might do it. i usually burn my linux cds at 8x, just in case
[06:23] <psusi> cirvin_fox: you need to use g++
[06:23] <tonyyarusso> livingdaylight: Yeah, it's decent.
[06:23] <cirvin_fox> its different?
[06:23] <Chimera_> Ah, is 6.10 any better?
[06:23] <Vuen> Chimera_: i had the same problem when i tried to check the cd. that means the cd is bad.
[06:23] <psusi> Skyrail: it doesn't use one big .conf in ubuntu, it is broken up into several files for maintainability
[06:23] <livingdaylight> tonyyarusso, i added repos for freemind but its not there? :(
[06:24] <Chimera_> I want to try it out, but i don't want to download the cd :)
[06:24] <Vuen> Chimera_: burn it at 8x or 16x and have your burner verify the cd
[06:24] <Vuen> Chimera_: do you have limited bandwidth?
[06:24] <Skyrail> psusi: ah ok...
[06:24] <psaczew> hi
[06:24] <cirvin_fox> psusi, Thank you!
[06:24] <psaczew> i have an question
[06:24] <livingdaylight> tonyyarusso, deb http://eric.lavar.de/comp/linux/debian/ experimental/
[06:24] <livingdaylight>     deb-src http://eric.lavar.de/comp/linux/debian/ experimenta
[06:24] <sonja> when i reboot my pc with a live Slax cd rom , it finds online and An IP, what have i done wrong, its a direct connect to a road runner modem using ethernet not even usb ?
[06:24] <psusi> cirvin_fox: yes.... g++ links to the C++ runtlime library, gcc does not
[06:24] <cappe___> where is sources-omatic??
[06:25] <The_Machine> Any idea why i can't change my font in evolution using gnome?
[06:25] <The_Machine> i mean, it's like..  there *is no option* to do this!
[06:25] <psaczew> i want to change partitions i my computer
[06:25] <salim> yeah, it is because evolution is shi**
[06:25] <cappe___> or what you called it. the reportories site
[06:25] <Vuen> hey guys, i'm installing text-mode from the alternate cd. it's asking me how it wants the drive partitioned. i want it to erase the whole drive and partition it however it likes. it gives two options, "Erase entire disk" and "Erase entire disk and use LVM". what's the difference between these two?
[06:25] <sonja> i cant get a fresh install of ubuntu online , but network is showing some movement , but NO ping from a term ?
[06:25] <Chimera_> Vuen, i don't have a limit on what i can download, but i do have the 512bit/s
[06:25] <Chimera_> limit.
[06:25] <salim> yup, you can hardly do anything with evolution, just forget evolution, either live with what evolution tells you to be or use "kontact"
[06:25] <jrib> !easysource | cappe___
[06:25] <ubotu> cappe___: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[06:25] <variant> Vuen: lvm is not somthing you want if you dont know what it is
[06:25] <cappe___> ubotu: thx
[06:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thx - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:25] <Chimera_> Vuen, i think that LVM is for RAID configurations???
[06:25] <Vuen> Chimera_: you mean 512 kilobit? that's fine, it should only take like an hour or two, tops, to download a cd
[06:25] <variant> Vuen: it wont benefit you at all
[06:26] <psaczew> do you know any good program for this?
[06:26] <Vuen> variant: ah, thanks
[06:26] <psaczew> and basic in ubuntu
[06:26] <psusi> Vuen: LVM is an advanced partitioning scheme.... if you don't know what it is, you don't need it
[06:26] <tonyyarusso> livingdaylight: There are some Ubuntu-specific notes at http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FreeMind_on_Linux#Some_notes_on_.28K.29Ubuntu, not sure if that helps.  (Sorry, I have to run to class; good luck)
[06:26] <Chimera_> Vuen, lol i think, don't take it for granted. Listen to them :)
[06:26] <sonja> wow love all these fix it links , if I could get the pc online < i would be in heaven
[06:26] <variant> psusi: change how? without losing data or by creating a new parititon table?

[06:27] <daxxar> After I upgraded to Edgy, when I try to startx (or startxfce4), it hangs for ~30 seconds, then it fails out. Anyone know where I should look for what causes this error?
[06:27] <sonja> in a term variant ?
[06:27] <salim> psaczew: gparted

[06:27] <variant> daxxar: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[06:28] <sonja> variant ,sir where do i check that and find it ?
[06:28] <Vaske_Car> what to use to read/write Floppy?
[06:28] <salim> psaczew: with gparted you can change your partitions, qtparted is also very nice, both are same for me though, but be careful when working with partitions
[06:28] <daxxar> Except for the line that says "(WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.", ofcourse.
[06:28] <variant> sonja: to connect to your network? do sudo dhclient eth0
[06:28] <variant> sonja: in a terminal
[06:28] <c_lisp> how can u unmount a cd drive the is buffering overfollowing and remount it?
[06:28] <salim> psaczew: removing partitions could change the numbering
[06:28] <daxxar> The end of Xorg.0.log says: "*** If unresolved symbols were reported above, they might not" "*** be the reason for the server aborting." "Backtrace:" .. then nothing more.
[06:29] <variant> ciaron: mount -o remount /dev/diskhere

[06:31] <variant> sonja: in that case i dont see how slax can connect if there is no dhcp server, did you specify the ip address manualy in slax
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> Vaske_Car, why would you? fat16 is mkdosfs
[06:31] <variant> ?
[06:31] <sonja> variant no Sir, its all auto,, i also had the pc online same line etc, using winsucks XP
[06:31] <c_lisp> how can u see what cd roms u have mounted?
[06:31] <Vaske_Car> nolimitsoya, I need it to copy something for Windows machine
[06:31] <highneko> beryl-vidcap; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7UbHq2rdRs
[06:31] <nolimitsoya> Vaske_Car, yes, but diskettes should be formatted with fat16, not 32
[06:32] <sonja> variant--> sir I also have this pc online in the same MODEM, but as USB it is also linux ? could that be my fault ?
[06:32] <Vaske_Car> ok
[06:32] <soundray_> Vaske_Car: if you're familiar with DOS, look at the mtools package
[06:32] <nolimitsoya> Vaske_Car, mkdosfs /dev/fd0
[06:33] <Vuen> :(
[06:33] <Vuen> i just got a rather unhelpful error message from the alternative installer
[06:33] <Vuen> An installation step failed: Install the base system
[06:33] <nux> hi all.. i need some help
[06:34] <Vuen> !ask|nux
[06:34] <ubotu> nux: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, do you have enough drive space?
[06:34] <soundray_> Vuen: see if you have any more detailed messages on any of the virtual consoles (Alt-F2, Alt-F3, Alt-F4...)
[06:34] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: 8 gigs?
[06:34] <c_lisp> how can u see what cd roms u have mounted
[06:35] <nolimitsoya> c_lisp, fstab -l
[06:35] <nolimitsoya> perhaps
[06:35] <Vuen> i'm gonna check the cd for defects, do a memory test... is there a way i can check the hard drive for errors?
[06:35] <Vaske_Car> nolimitsoya, when I mount floppy and in the meantime I take it out and add some files from another box, put it back to linux box and it does not see new files. I tried Refresh but with no sucess. I have to unmount and mouunt it again to be able to see new files with nautilus. Is there any other way?
[06:35] <nolimitsoya> c_lisp, mount -l
[06:36] <Vuen> they stopped using this computer because windows 2000 complained about a corrupt system file. so i'm thinking the hard drive may be damaged. what's the easiest way to check it?
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> Vaske_Car, no, you should alwaysunmount before removing'
[06:36] <orion> .
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, s.m.a.r.t data, if the drive has that capability
[06:36] <Vaske_Car> nolimitsoya, but its time consuming.....
[06:36] <sioux> hi who had experiences with zd1211 and g220
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> Vaske_Car, no, it isnt, and if it is you need another hobby
[06:36] <Vuen> Vaske_Car: yes, you can set up your fstab to have it immediately flush the data to the floppy so that you don't have to unmount it
[06:37] <Vuen> Vaske_Car: but i don't know how to do that :/
[06:37] <sonja> Vaske_Car--> make a a desktop link to unmount it, thats what I did
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> Vuen, you still need to tell nautilus that its been removed and inserted again
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> there fore the unmount/mount
[06:37] <salim> sioux I had a bit
[06:37] <Vuen> nolimitsoya: hmm, it occurs to me that i have a MaxBlast cd lying around, which has utilities for checking disks. i'll try that out.
[06:38] <salim> sioux: you mean wlan right?
[06:39] <sioux> salim yes wlan
[06:40] <salim> sioux: what isnt working?
[06:40] <lnxactvst> Vuen, I have had a LOT of good luck with Spinrite.  I have used it to recover data on everthing from zip disks to hard drives.  It gives a real good indicator on the health of the drive as well.  I have ruled out hard drive problems that were actually controller problems using it as well.  It is pricey at $90, but when it works, it is worth it.  If it doesn't help, they have a 100% money back guarantee, I think.
[06:40] <sioux> I load the driver zd1211rw but when I plug the usb nothing happen
[06:40] <Otacon22> where can i see the ip of my dns server?
[06:40] <Vuen> lnxactvst: i'm not interested in recovering the data. i just erased the partition table :p. i just want to check the drive for defects to see if it's useable.
[06:41] <zspada15> Otacon22: try viewing the stats of ur router
[06:41] <lnxactvst> Vuen, I know.  It does that as well, somewhat definitively.
[06:41] <sioux> according to this post that I found http://www.nabble.com/zd1211-on-edgy-t2531889.html seems the problem is the id of my usb but... i have some doubt
[06:41] <Otacon22> no, I haven't router
[06:41] <salim> sioux: I dont know that driver: zd1211rw - where did you get it from?
[06:41] <zspada15> type your local gateway address, 192.168.1.1 or something to that effect
[06:41] <soundray_> Vuen: when you create a filesystem for Linux, do it with the -c option to check for bad blocks (man mkfs)
[06:41] <Otacon22> zspada15, I haven't a router
[06:41] <jessica_> ola
[06:41] <lnxactvst> Vuen, it exercises every sector and block on the desk, so you can be sure that the thing is good, bad or dieing.
[06:41] <zspada15> Otacon22: what do you have?
[06:41] <sioux> salim that driver is in default on the kernel
[06:41] <Vuen> soundray_: mm, that's a good idea. but i'm using the text-based installer, where do i put this -c?
[06:41] <salim> I see
[06:41] <Otacon22> I am connected to a residental gateway
[06:42] <Otacon22> but not router
[06:42] <zspada15> pppoe?
[06:42] <Otacon22> no
[06:42] <Otacon22> ethernet
[06:42] <sonja> i am connected direct to the modwm and cant get it online, good luck
[06:42] <DerekS> can someone explain to me what "markauto" in aptitude does? i don't really understand
[06:42] <salim> does sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning do sth? (or eth1 or whatever your wlan device is called)
[06:42] <soundray_> Vuen: in the partitioner, on the screen where you enter the mount point, there is also a checkbox for checking bad blocks.
=== jessica_ is now known as morenaza
[06:43] <Otacon22> zspada15, it was in /etc/resolv.conf

[06:43] <sonja> ola jessica
[06:43] <Chimera_> Or will i get lucky and be successfull.
[06:44] <Vuen> Chimera_: boot from the cd and Check the CD for defects

[06:44] <trappist> Chimera_: md5sum /dev/cdrom

[06:48] <salim> sioux: ok, try it
[06:48] <Chimera_> Intel Integrated Graphics 5255/5855 or something real similar.
[06:48] <Vuen> Chimera_: laptop video card drivers are not typically as well supported under linux :(. for ati cards, and to a slightly lesser extend nvidia cards, it's pretty much as fast in linux as windows

[06:52] <salim> sioux: what does it show when you type "iwconfig"? which one is recognized as wireless device?
[06:52] <salim> sioux type lsmod and look whether the driver is in it or not

[06:54] <sioux> salim ndiswrapper?
[06:54] <Vuen> Chimera_: i programmed a game all summer using Irrlicht. i figured one day i'd try it in linux, and it magically worked
[06:54] <Vuen> Chimera_: multiplatform 3d engines are pretty awesome.
[06:54] <soundray> Vuen: you can switch to another console (Alt-F2) and run the formatting with a command like 'mke2fs -j -c /dev/hda9'
[06:54] <Chimera_> Vuen, lol i like it when it's installed :), but i liked 5.10 much more because it was a 1 2 3 install, not a 111111111111 withthe current 6.06 version.

[06:55] <Vuen> Chimera_: hmm, i think you're just unlucky. i started with 5.10 as well, and i had a lot less problems installing 6.06, as did most people
[06:55] <Poromenos> fakeRAID, anyone?
[06:55] <Vuen> Chimera_: it's probably not frozen at the squashfs step. the cd is 600 megs, it takes a long time to check it all
[06:55] <Chimera_> Vuen, i prefer G**** not irlich. G is the letter that starts this cool enigne.
[06:55] <nolimitsoya> Poromenos, what about it?
[06:55] <Vuen> Chimera_: just let it sit for a while
[06:55] <MenZa> If I were to install drivers for a PCMCIA wlan card (802.11g), where would I start?
[06:55] <Poromenos> nolimitsoya: i have partitioned the /mapper, but the partitions don't show up so i can format them
[06:56] <cappe___> I find libwine but not wine for AMD64. I have every reportory, why cant i find wine??
[06:56] <trappist> cappe___: wine runs win32 (as in 32 bit) windows apps.
[06:57] <Chimera_> It said it finished with 0 checksum failes.
[06:57] <cappe___> are there any programs that run win programs with an amd 64 processor?
[06:57] <Vuen> Chimera_: rejoice!
[06:57] <MenZa> !wireless
[06:57] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:57] <Chimera_> Vuen, does that mean its ok, but still GUI install takes forever, ill let it run for a whiel.
[06:57] <Nikolas> wine? I preffer Mountain Dew
[06:57] <trappist> cappe___: you can run wine in a 32bit chroot.  it takes some work, but that's what I do.
[06:58] <Chimera_> Vuen, see why i wanted to check if it installed :)
[06:58] <Chimera_> I knew the disk was fine :P
[06:58] <navaladi> hi all..I have totem with no sound
[06:58] <Vuen> Chimera_: how much memory does the laptop have? i'm in the middle of a laptop install as well, and i'm not using the desktop install cd because this thing doesn't have enough memory to start it up
[06:58] <cappe___> ok thx for your time and answers , catch u later
[06:58] <Poromenos> does anyone know why the partitions don't appear anywhere when i create them with fdisk in a fakeRAID setup?
[06:58] <navaladi> I have Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
[06:59] <navaladi> i have installed xine & sound working but totem video is comming without sound
[06:59] <Vuen> Chimera_: the cd will take forever to start up, even on a fast computer, that's normal. one of the downsides of having it not scary like a text-based installer is that it's slowwwwww
[07:03] <salim> ok gotta go, sry, bye
[07:04] <navaladi> does any one have idea
[07:04] <jrib> navaladi: does this happen with all videos?  Does totem every give you sound?
=== ok67_ is now known as ok67
[07:05] <jrib> navaladi: try  totem /etc/skel/Examples/Experience\ ubuntu.ogg' as a test
[07:06] <Poromenos> is ext3 or reiserfs better?
[07:06] <Drfalkor> can someone look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297001 ? :)
[07:06] <teclo> When I type sensors, I get "Unable to find i2c bus information;For 2.6 kernels, make sure you have mounted sysfs and libsensors" ... but /sys is there and libsensors too
[07:06] <teclo> ... any idea ?
[07:06] <izm99> hi all.  having trouble using "import javax.*" on eclipse.  Can anyone help?
[07:07] <Vuen> argh
[07:07] <what_if> teclo: have you run sensors-detect yet?
[07:07] <Vuen> i'd really like it if the alternate install cd could check the hard drive
[07:07] <Vuen> i have no other way of checking this hard drive
[07:07] <spyderpie> Hi everyone ... I am having trouble with cedega .. anyone here help?  (i tried the cedega channel - no luck)
[07:07] <Poromenos> which is better, ext3 or reiserfs?
[07:08] <Vuen> does anyone know what boot options i can give it to do this for me?
[07:08] <Vuen> Poromenos: depends what you're using it for. for an ordinary desktop computer, use ext3
[07:08] <Poromenos> Vuen: what's reiserfs better for?
=== pyro262 is now known as bus-mechanic
[07:08] <teclo> what_if: several times
[07:08] <Vuen> Poromenos: servers that handle millions of files
[07:08] <teclo> what_if: look what it says:
[07:08] <teclo>  Sorry, no chips were detected.
[07:08] <teclo>  Either your sensors are not supported, or they are
[07:08] <teclo>  connected to an I2C bus adapter that we do not support.
[07:08] <Poromenos> Vuen: ah, ok, thanks a lot :)
[07:09] <Vuen> Poromenos: no problem. ext3 is basically ext2+journaling. ext2 is ridiculously stable, and so is ext3.
[07:09] <frailty> hi
[07:09] <mariusk> i'd like to enable a user to have automatic login with gdm setup, but the program won't save the changes ... which textfile does gdm setup modify?
[07:10] <roryy> mariusk: I think it's /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
[07:10] <zero742> i think I just had a semi-major oopsy
[07:11] <holzmodem> hi, i compiled successfull the network manager CVS, now i want to compile the openVPN Plugin... but the configure script searches for the Network Manager Package... how can i Create a DEV Package of the Network Manager (CVS)
[07:11] <zero742> what does it mean when it says "failed to initialize HAL"?
[07:11] <syntaxx> whats the name of the gnome torrent in packages?
[07:11] <Vuen> syntaxx: apt-cache search torrent
[07:12] <mariusk> roryy, found it .. thanks!
[07:13] <zero742> does anyone know what it means when ubuntu gives the message "failed to initialize HAL"?
[07:13] <Vuen> zero742: hardware acceleration afaik
[07:14] <zero742> thanks
[07:14] <jvolkman> no
[07:14] <zero742> when I booted up, i was also told I have a whole bunch of damaged sectors too
[07:14] <jvolkman> HAL is the hardware abstraction layer
[07:15] <zero742> that makes a bit more sense
[07:15] <Mus1cman> Humm, ok, Ive been looking at the FAQ all day to increase my screen resolution.. ive tried the steps it showed, but ive made no progress regardless =/
[07:15] <zero742> either way, is there a way to fix bad sectors?
[07:15] <zero742> it won't boot up to graphical ubuntu by itself
[07:16] <jvolkman> fix bad sectors?
[07:16] <zero742> sure
[07:16] <zero742> i think that would help
[07:16] <zero742> that seems to be where it was getting stuck while booting
[07:16] <Minty> I have to reinstall grub on my HD as  had to do a fixmbr in XP, /dev/hda1 is XP /dev/hda2 is my ubuntu, from the live CD what is the command to reinstall grub ?
[07:17] <jvolkman> do yourself a favor and get a new drive
[07:17] <jvolkman> =)
[07:17] <zero742> seriosuly?
[07:17] <zero742> this is like 2 months old??
[07:17] <jvolkman> bad sectors are usually a sign of hardware failure
[07:17] <jvolkman> well then you've got a warranty
[07:17] <zero742> crap
[07:17] <bus-mechanic> yea bad sectors = hd fail
[07:17] <zero742> and no money for a new one until it gets back
[07:17] <zero742> crapola
[07:18] <zero742> will seagate actually accept that as a valid reason for returning it?
[07:18] <jvolkman> zero742, manufacturers will usually send you the new one before you send the old one back
[07:18] <Vuen> argh
[07:18] <jvolkman> most definitely
[07:18] <zero742> excellent
[07:18] <zero742> thanks
[07:18] <Vuen> speaking of bad drives, this laptop is giving me an installation erro
[07:18] <Vuen> r
[07:18] <Vuen> i/o error while installing
[07:18] <Vuen> and i can't find an option for it to just check the drive
[07:18] <zero742> well...I suppose that will be me having fun the rest of the day
[07:18] <Vuen> how can i make it check the drive?
[07:18] <zero742> thanks all
[07:18] <jvolkman> zero742, you should backup anything important now
[07:19] <roryy> !tell Minty about grub
[07:19] <zero742> i just did, as soon as I was able to get back into ubuntu
[07:19] <Vuen> !grup|Minty
[07:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about grup - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[07:19] <zidoen> hmm, i've tried to get "Network Connection" to work, i got "SIOCGIFFLAGS error: No such device" when pressing it, but when i go to properties and manually write "eth0" it works somewhat ok.. problem now is that apt-get doesn't want to use the internet connection, but asks for a cd.. anybody know how to make it use the internet again? :P
[07:19] <bus-mechanic> is it wired or wireless?
[07:20] <zidoen> bus-mechanic: tried both, atm i'm using wired
[07:20] <bus-mechanic> so you're saying eth0 works if you access it from cli?
[07:20] <mcphail> zidoen: use "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and put a "#" in front of the line with the cdrom
[07:21] <MenZa> I'd like to install drivers for my generic 802.11g wireless PCMCIA card, but I have no idea where to start. Can anyone point me in the right direction :\?
[07:21] <zidoen> mcphail: impressive :) thanks
[07:21] <mcphail> zidoen: run "sudo apt-get update" after this and it _should_ use you net connection
[07:22] <[set] > anyone know why i get a permission denied when i type in su
[07:22] <Chimera_> Does anyone know what DTP means in the imunisations jargon? I am puzzled to know, even though it's off topic :)
[07:22] <[set] > i enter the pass correctly
[07:22] <Shaezsche> im trying to change the permissions of a directory and its just hanging
[07:22] <Shaezsche> been hanging for 15 minutes, ive tried this twice
[07:22] <Shaezsche> its after i click apply to all files in directory that it happens
[07:22] <roryy> [set] : i think 'su' requires the root password; try 'sudo' instead (that requires your user's password)
[07:23] <scott_> hey guys, can anyone help me out with something?
[07:23] <Otacon22> exist a graphical program to set start commands at specifics time?
[07:23] <jvolkman> [set] : try 'sudo su'
[07:23] <Vuen> [set] : su requires the root password, which is disabled in ubuntu. use sudo -i
[07:23] <[set] > oh ok i see
[07:24] <bus-mechanic> you can set the root pw
[07:24] <bus-mechanic> and then use su
[07:24] <jorgp> Otacon22, cron is the best
[07:24] <jorgp> Otacon22, but its not graphica
[07:24] <apokryphos> bus-mechanic: please do not recommend that for new users. Ubuntu uses and recommends sudo.
[07:24] <Otacon22> uff...
[07:24] <apokryphos> [set] : check the FAQ for this stuff :)
[07:24] <apokryphos> !root
[07:24] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:25] <navaladi> jrib - problem solved thx
[07:25] <Mus1cman> can someone help me with my screen resolution?
[07:25] <roryy> Otacon22: there seem to be some graphical editors for crontab in the repositories -- i see gcrontab and kcrontab
[07:25] <scott_> hey guys im having a problem with getting a program to run
[07:25] <apokryphos> Mus1cman: have you checked the FAQ?
[07:25] <Mus1cman> apo: yes
[07:25] <Vuen> [set] : as far as using a root terminal though, you're better off sudoing everything. doing things in a root terminal doesn't leave any nice audit trail. it seems like a pain to sudo at first, but you'll get used to it.
[07:25] <roryy> Otacon22: I have no idea if they are any good
[07:25] <Mus1cman> Ive done as it showed, ive yet to make progress =/
[07:26] <apokryphos> Mus1cman: well let us know the problem, and what card you've got
[07:26] <scott_> can someone help me out with getting this program to run
[07:26] <apokryphos> !helpme
[07:26] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[07:26] <ubotu> scott_: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:26] <TheReconHunter> Hey, for soem reason, the maximum resolution i can get is 1024x728, but i want the supported 1280x1024 that my monitor supports. anyone know how i can do this?
[07:26] <snowshoefox> can anyone point me to a good source of the standard library documentation for GNU?
[07:26] <snowshoefox> !std
[07:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about std - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[07:27] <eugman> Is there a way I can attach a description to a wav file?
[07:27] <crimsun> snowshoefox: do you have manpages-dev installed?
[07:27] <roryy> scott_: you need to be more specific
[07:27] <snowshoefox> no
[07:27] <keeb> good afternoon :)
[07:27] <Mus1cman> Ive been trying to get my resolutoin to 1280x1024, yet it still does not have that option, and my card is 82865G Integrated Graphics Controller by Intel
[07:27] <scott_> i installed maple 10 on ubuntu dapper, and the whole installation went fine. its intalled in my home folder but i dont know how to actually run the program
[07:27] <apokryphos> Mus1cman: if you sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and select that option it doesn't work? Are you sure?
[07:27] <keeb> Mus1: did you run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg then restart gdm ?
[07:27] <Chimera_> Vuen, lol, even though the disk has 0 errors it still freezes.
[07:28] <TheReconHunter> apokryphos, no i diddnt, is there a link to it?
[07:28] <apokryphos> TheReconHunter: yes, in the Channel topic
[07:28] <apokryphos> !faq
[07:28] <ubotu> faq is http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions Official documentation is at http://help.ubuntu.com IRC FAQ: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRCResourcePage
[07:28] <apokryphos> or there
[07:28] <Vuen> Chimera_: yeah, the hardware is probably just not good enough to run the livecd. running an entire operating system without a hard drive takes a lot of ram :p
[07:28] <snowshoefox> !manpages-dev
[07:28] <Vuen> Chimera_: do a server install instead, then apt-get ubuntu-desktop
[07:28] <ubotu> manpages-dev: Manual pages about using GNU/Linux for development. In component main, is optional. Version 2.34-1 (edgy), package size 1183 kB, installed size 2908 kB
[07:28] <Mus1cman> keeb: yeah, but im not sure which driver to use.
[07:28] <apokryphos> Mus1cman: vesa should be good enough
[07:28] <Mus1cman> thats what it has
[07:29] <Mus1cman> ill go through it again to make sure
[07:29] <roryy> scott_: do you know where it's installed itself in your home dir?
[07:29] <keeb> make sure to choose that resolution in monitor setup
[07:29] <Chimera_> Vuen, lol thats a bit too much..
[07:29] <Mus1cman> video card bus identifier, leave that the way it is?
[07:29] <scott_> its in my home directory under the folder "maple10"
[07:30] <scott_> /home/scott/maple10
[07:30] <roryy> scott_: ok, and if you look in that folder? (e.g., using Places -> Home Folder -> maple10)
[07:30] <jrib> scott_: you should have maple10/bin/maple  (or at least this is how maple 9.5 does it)
[07:31] <Vuen> Chimera_: nah, it should be easy. boot from the cd, then hit escape, then type server
[07:31] <novaterata> does anyone know how get another wine program to recognize ie4linux is installed
[07:31] <Vuen> Chimera_: it will install a base cli system, from which you can apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[07:31] <scott_> ok yea i see that
[07:31] <Vuen> or ubuntu-desktop
[07:31] <novaterata> like andale's lister pro for example?
[07:31] <Poromenos> i am having trouble with a fakeraid setup, should i just use software raid instead?
[07:31] <Vuen> Chimera_: i'm doing exactly the same thing as we speak. i also have a laptop that's too old to run the livecd.
[07:32] <Chimera_> lol, 2.4ghz, 256 mb ram, 40 gb hdd.
[07:32] <Vuen> Chimera_: and, ironically, i JUST burned a bad alternate cd, and i'm stuck with no blank cds left, so i have to use the desktop cd i have
[07:32] <jrib> scott_: you can double click on that, or run it in a terminal
[07:32] <Vuen> Chimera_: are you sure you're not, like, alternate me?
[07:32] <Vuen> bizzaro me
[07:32] <Chimera_> lol wtf?
[07:32] <Vuen> Chimera_: it's just eerie is all
[07:32] <Vuen> lol
[07:32] <Chimera_> I don't understand.
[07:32] <Vuen> nevermind
[07:33] <Chimera_> ah... !!! LOL
[07:33] <Vuen> hahaha
[07:33] <Mus1cman> ok, I went through the xorg config thing again, was I supposed to restart something?
[07:33] <Chimera_> No, we are living in the same universe, it has to be another one.
[07:33] <pder> does anyone know of any VOIP software for ubuntu that is also crossplatform?  I'd also like to be able to use hardware such as a usb phone, or adapter that connects an ordinary phone.
[07:33] <Chimera_> The "dark" one.
[07:33] <Vuen> lol
[07:33] <MenZa> How do I mount my cdrom drive?
[07:33] <eugman> Is there a way I can attach a description to a wav file?
[07:33] <Chimera_> So, do you have any idea to what is happening?
[07:34] <scott_> is there any way that i can run it with like the GUI that it runs on with say a mac or windows, instead of running it in a terminal?
[07:34] <Vuen> Chimera_: nope. some systems just can't run the livecd :(. try the server install. i'm going to try it right now
[07:34] <Poromenos> is there a guide on software raid?
[07:34] <scott_> cuz when i double click it it either says run or run in terminal, but when i click run by itself, nothing happens
[07:34] <jrib> eugman: nautilus lets you add notes to file if you right click and go to properties, don't know much about wav files in particular
[07:34] <Mus1cman> whats the command to restart gdm?
[07:34] <Vuen> Mus1cman: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[07:34] <jvolkman> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[07:34] <Mus1cman> thanks
[07:34] <Kingsqueak> Mus1cman: all system startup scripts are in /etc/init.d/
[07:34] <jrib> scott_: ok, type '/home/scott/maple10/bin/maple' in a terminal and tell me the output
[07:34] <Mus1cman> ah, ok
=== CreativeEmbassy is now known as Cre[a] tiveEmb[a] 
[07:35] <Kingsqueak> Mus1cman: generally if you run any of them they tell you what options they take, if they are written right
[07:36] <jrib> scott_: if it is long, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:36] <scott_> a version of maple comes up and runs
[07:36] <scott_> but its all in text
[07:36] <scott_> and no graphics like the mac one i run on my friends mac
[07:37] <jrib> scott_: oh right, you want xmaple, not maple :)
[07:37] <scott_> oh
[07:37] <scott_> ok
[07:37] <scott_> lol
[07:37] <Chimera_> Vuen, lol, i don't think you comprende. I ran it once, i had all these problems before, and i found a solution. Burn it slower and it went blazing fast installing. Now the same trick isn't working, should i power up the laptop?
[07:37] <jrib> scott_: you may have some maple's running in the background now that you can't see... feel free to kill them
[07:37] <watson540> does nyone here know why my stsem would hard lock after switching from a tty to an already running X session?
[07:38] <Vuen> Chimera_: hmm. yeah, i really have no idea what the problem is :(
[07:38] <Vuen> watson540: are you running beryl?
[07:38] <watson540> Vuen:: yes.
[07:38] <Chimera_> Since life cd came to my life it has been a pain, also in my desktop it is the same. My desktop is gaming.
[07:38] <Vuen> watson540: there you have it.
[07:38] <watson540> Vuen:: and aiglx with the free radeon drivers
[07:38] <Vuen> watson540: yep.
[07:38] <watson540> it never did it running xgl and fglx though
[07:39] <Vuen> watson540: thats a long-standing bug in beryl+aiglx
[07:39] <Kingsqueak> watson540: yeah that's all super alpha stuff, it's not nearly stable yet
[07:39] <Vuen> watson540: doesn't happen in xgl
[07:39] <watson540> I see
[07:39] <scott_> ok
[07:39] <watson540> thats a big sacrifice to make giving up my tty's  :), I'll keep up with svnhopefully it will be addressed
[07:39] <watson540> anyone know if there has been a bug report filed?
[07:39] <rambo3> !lanchpad

[07:40] <Vuen> watson540: i'm sure there's a bug report. go reply to it, complain, go to #beryl-dev and complain. it will get fixed eventually
[07:40] <Poromenos> why is there no LAMP option in the edgy server cd?
[07:40] <Vuen> watson540: or you could fix it yourself :)
[07:40] <gnomefreak> watson540: would be better asked in #ubuntu-xgl and beryl bugs are not reported on launchpad
[07:40] <rambo3> o beryl
[07:40] <scott_> is there a way for me to be able to get xmaple with ubuntu?
[07:40] <jrib> scott_: don't you have it in that same folder?
[07:41] <scott_> oooh
[07:41] <watson540> well i could always switch back to XGL , but man I reall y think this aiglx is about 10% faster/smoother
[07:41] <snowshoefox> Anyone have a link to a commercial linux developer environment?
[07:41] <scott_> ok cool, it works now
[07:41] <scott_> thank you
[07:41] <godmachine81> watson540:: aiglx is a lot faster than xgl+compiz
[07:41] <jrib> scott_: np, you can create a launcher for it in your menu now
[07:42] <Poromenos> why is there no LAMP option in the edgy server cd?
[07:42] <scott_> how? lol
[07:42] <Skyrail> Apache is driving me around the bend, I can't find anything obvious to do with trying to setup a server now

[07:43] <godmachine81> watson540:: endo602
[07:43] <Skyrail> ambimom: er, ok :)
[07:43] <watson540> 233...........................................
[07:43] <ROBOd> hello guys
[07:44] <watson540> godmachine81:: yummy :)
=== [2] wenko is now known as wenko
[07:44] <ambimom> skyrail: lugradio has lots of good info; as does linux reality
[07:44] <ROBOd> i want to upgrade two ubuntu installs, over the same connection
[07:44] <watson540> perky
[07:44] <ROBOd> i have done so with the first
[07:44] <ROBOd> but i want to speed up things on the second system
[07:44] <godmachine81> yea.. some yellow school buses too
[07:44] <ambimom> Robod...don't upgrade...do fresh install...
[07:44] <ROBOd> i want to skip the downloading part
[07:44] <ROBOd> upgrade went properly
[07:44] <watson540> godmachine81:: lol, send some my way too
[07:45] <ambimom> robod:  you must be the one, ROFL
[07:45] <ROBOd> ambimom: how do i copy the downloaded packages onto the second system?
[07:45] <godmachine81> watson540:: i dont have any problems switching between tty's and X while running beryl
[07:45] <TheReconHunter> Hey. I just tried to correct my screen resolution, but when i did, the screen would flicker and bring me back to the login screen. and now, it seems as if nvidia support is gone too
[07:45] <ambimom> robod:  try partimage
[07:45] <ROBOd> ambimom: define "properly" :). i didn't
[07:45] <Vuen> ROBOd: for future reference, the best way to do that would have been to download the edgy alternate cd, which can be used as an upgrade
[07:45] <Skyrail> ambimom: ok, I'll give it a shot, I'm just not sure what I have to configure, I've looked through the file a couple of times and failed
[07:45] <godmachine81> watson540:: what video chipset you got?
[07:45] <ROBOd> Vuen: i have already done that, of course
[07:45] <ROBOd> Vuen: but there are more downloads to run
[07:45] <Vuen> ROBOd: oh.
[07:46] <ROBOd> *packages to be downloaded
[07:46] <godmachine81> watson540:: i have heard that beryl doesnt play well with nvidia, if even at all..
[07:46] <watson540> godmachine81:: it's probably in the video driver, im running an ati radeon 9800 aiw using radeon drivers
[07:46] <ROBOd> Vuen: how to cache those debs/
[07:46] <Vuen> ROBOd: um, hold on
[07:46] <godmachine81> ROBOd:: are there like 30 packages held back?
[07:46] <scott_> thank you jrib
[07:46] <iter> ROBOd: scp /var/cache/apt over to new machine
[07:46] <ROBOd> i'm using sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade
[07:46] <godmachine81> ROBOd:: if its a bunch of python stuff i know what to do.. just sudo aptitude dist-upgrade  accept the resolution
[07:46] <ROBOd> yes
[07:47] <slick_nick> gents, noob question: apparently i have too many partitions on my hdd to be able to create another one, so i'm working without swap space right now. i have read i can add a swap *file*, but other than that, do i have any other options?
[07:47] <ROBOd> iter: i did that, hehe
[07:47] <ROBOd> iter: for some reason, it still wants to download the debs!
[07:47] <iter> ROBOd: did you move stuff from /var/cache/apt/archives to ../ ?
[07:47] <[sYn] > Does anyone know a way of getting only the programs running on the screen the panel is on to show in the window list? (I'm running in twinview btw..)
[07:47] <ROBOd> iter: yes
[07:47] <ROBOd> iter: however, i didn't copy the *.bin
[07:48] <ROBOd> ONLY archives/*
[07:48] <Vuen> ROBOd: are you sure it wants to download them? it probably just shows the total size the debs will take up. does it actually start the downloads, or does it ask you whether it can download them?
[07:48] <ROBOd> Vuen: i agreed, it started downloading
[07:48] <ROBOd> i am VERY sure
[07:48] <ROBOd> and the servers are quite slow...
[07:48] <godmachine81> ROBOd:: the *.bin is for the specific system.. they get updated everything there is an apt-get update  done anyway
[07:48] <iter> ROBOd: hmm sounds like what I would've done
[07:48] <Vuen> ROBOd: :(
[07:48] <Vuen> ROBOd: that's very strange.
[07:49] <godmachine81> ROBOd:: so you have the install up and running but just have a few packages that need upgraded. right?
[07:49] <ROBOd> my internet connection can download as fast as 150 kb/s
[07:49] <ROBOd> (1.5 mbps0
[07:49] <ROBOd> godmachine81: yeah
[07:49] <ROBOd> and i want to skip the download for those debs
[07:49] <ROBOd> i just want to install them directly, eh
[07:49] <ambimom> robod: vuen:  edgy is strange....it never worked right for me...I upgrade and fresh install..neither worked right
[07:49] <godmachine81> ROBOd:: do you have the packages on the cd?
[07:49] <Rolando2424> hello
[07:50] <ambimom> hello rolando
[07:50] <iter> ROBOd: try running apt-get check first
[07:50] <ambimom> phone brb
[07:50] <ROBOd> godmachine81: i have those "default" in ubuntu-6.10-alternate AND those new from the internet, on HDD
[07:50] <Rolando2424> I have a question about the edgy
[07:50] <godmachine81> cp all the new ones to a dir
[07:50] <ROBOd> iter: i ran apt-cache check
[07:50] <ROBOd> iter: and apt-cache gencaches
[07:50] <godmachine81> and do sudo dpkg -i /path/to/debs/*
[07:50] <iter> haha dang
[07:50] <Rolando2424> When I try to run the live cd it begins to send bugs about buffer error on logical something
[07:50] <Otacon22> there is something for crypting that is'nt gpg?
[07:51] <ROBOd> godmachine81: nah, that's not precisely my coup of tea
[07:51] <Chimera_> Vuen, hey thanks to all your help, i will go to uni, i will be back later on, hoping you are here :) With a batch of new cds :)
[07:51] <Rolando2424> I'll see if I can find the exact words
[07:51] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: you could use MIME/SSL
[07:51] <godmachine81> well if you just downloaded the debs then you probably dont have the packagelist info you need to do it with apt or aptitude
[07:51] <Otacon22> Kingsqueak, for crypting files i was saying
[07:52] <godmachine81> not sure what your cup of tea is. but it will work out fine when you decide to start using the network
[07:52] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: I would just stick with gpg
[07:52] <Otacon22> <Otacon22> there is something for crypting that is'nt gpg?
[07:52] <Rolando2424> [171799702.068000]  Buffer I/O error on device hdd, logical block 322225
[07:52] <pontusen> heya. Is any burning app included w/ ubuntu?
[07:52] <cbgb> hi *, anyone around who has lirc knowledge?
[07:52] <Pelo> pontusen,  several
[07:52] <Rolando2424> It just continues to give that error, only changing the numbers
[07:52] <Pelo> depending on what you want to do
[07:52] <pontusen> Pelo, preinstalled?
[07:53] <godmachine81> pontusen:: there arent several pre installed
[07:53] <livingdaylight> anyone use wajig install in lieu of apt-get install? never came across it before
[07:53] <Rolando2424> Does anyone know what to do?
[07:53] <pontusen> I want to burn an .avi to a dvd. What's the simplest proggie for that?(Helping gf over phone)
[07:53] <Pelo> pontusen,  yes   nautilus will handle  cd/dvd data burning
[07:53] <psusi> Otacon22: what's wrong with gpg?
[07:53] <godmachine81> pontusen:: you might be biting off more than you can chew
[07:53] <iter> ROBOd: aha
[07:53] <godmachine81> pontusen:: converting avi to a vcd/dvd isnt quiet simple
[07:53] <Pelo> pontusen,  do you want to burn it dvd format to use in a stand alone player ?
[07:53] <psusi> Otacon22: you could try openssl
[07:53] <iter> ROBOd: try moving the stuff from archive back to archive
[07:54] <pontusen> godmachine81, nono, making it a data cd, not converting anything
[07:54] <pontusen> Pelo, no, just add it to the cd
[07:54] <pontusen> add, as in burn
[07:54] <pontusen> =)
[07:54] <iter> ROBOd: then apt-cache check && apt-get dist-upgrade
[07:54] <godmachine81> ohhh
[07:54] <Otacon22> psusi, when I am creating a key, it stop and give an error that I have to do random actions(mouse, presso bottons...) I had done it, but nothing had happened
[07:54] <Rolando2424> Can somebody help me?
[07:54] <Rolando2424> Because I would really like to install Edgy :D
[07:54] <Pelo> godmachine81,  pontusen   to make a dvd  just use devede from synaptic ,  quite easy and nice
[07:54] <godmachine81> pontusen:: does she have internet access?
[07:54] <psusi> Otacon22: keep doing it
[07:54] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: you have to keep going until it finishes
[07:54] <pontusen> godmachine81, yes
[07:54] <psusi> Otacon22: just keep mashing random keys
[07:54] <Pelo> pontusen,  just pop a blank cd/dvd in the drive and the appropriate app will start
[07:55] <godmachine81> pontusen:: the easiest method would be open a terminal and do sudo apt-get install k3b
[07:55] <Otacon22> psusi, I had done it for an hour yesterday
[07:55] <godmachine81> after that gets done run k3b
[07:55] <iter> an hour haha
[07:55] <pontusen> didn't nautilus handle burning?
[07:55] <iter> ouch
[07:55] <psusi> Otacon22: hrm... shouldn't take but 2-3 minutes
[07:55] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: what size key did you tell it to do?
[07:55] <godmachine81> pontusen:: or you can do sudo apt-get install gnomebaker
[07:55] <Otacon22> Kingsqueak, 1024
[07:55] <Pelo> pontusen,  yes it does ,  just put a blank disk in the burner and it will start
[07:55] <godmachine81> pontusen:: nautilus-cd-burner
[07:55] <Kingsqueak> yeah try again, that should be quick
[07:56] <pontusen> Pelo, godmachine81, i will try that then
[07:56] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: you aren't using some severely old machine right?
[07:56] <Rolando2424> So, can anybody help me?
[07:56] <Otacon22> ya
[07:56] <Rolando2424> Please? :D
[07:56] <godmachine81> Pelo:: but that file is autoloaded when a blank disc is inserted like Pelo said
[07:56] <Kingsqueak> as in P90 or something
[07:56] <godmachine81> oops
[07:56] <godmachine81> i meant pontusen
[07:57] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: what speed CPU is it?
[07:57] <Pelo> Rolando2424,   try looking up your error message on the ubuntu forum , maybe you'll have some help there ( but my guess is that your cd is borked )
[07:57] <ToxicSun> is there a default root password for ubuntu livecd
[07:57] <Otacon22> Kingsqueak, 2,5 ghtz
[07:57] <Kingsqueak> oh that's not old heh
[07:57] <Rolando2424> Pelo, I think the stuuf in the forum say is about a SATA disk, and I think mine isn't sata
[07:58] <infidel> anyone have a ti flashmedia controller i see in dmesg the card i inserted is found but how do i mount it?
[07:58] <Pelo> ToxicSun,  try  user ubuntu pswd blank
[07:58] <ToxicSun> oh
[07:58] <Rolando2424> Also, I can install stuff from the cd on windows
[07:58] <ToxicSun> ok
[07:58] <ToxicSun> thank you pelo
[07:58] <ToxicSun> any other suggestions
[07:58] <Rolando2424> Installed the Firefox from it
[07:58] <Kingsqueak> Otacon22: yeah that machine should be fast, try doing it again
[07:58] <ToxicSun> im not using my livecd now but i dont remember if ive tried that before
[07:58] <shwag> who is the maintainer of the ruby on rails packages ?
[07:58] <Pelo> Rolando2424,  hold on I'll read up and see what your problem is in more detail
[07:58] <Otacon22> uff...
[07:59] <gnomefreak> shwag: try asking in #ubuntu-motu
[07:59] <Warbo> infidel: Don't have one of those, but do you know it's device name (/dev/<something>)?
[07:59] <gnomefreak> shwag: apt-cache show packagename might tell you too
[07:59] <Pelo> Rolando2424,   how many hdd do you have plugged in ?
[07:59] <Rolando2424> only one
[07:59] <Rolando2424> one hard disk
[08:00] <Pelo> Rolando2424,  when do you get that error message ?  can you load up the live cd portion ?
[08:00] <Pelo> Rolando2424,  the live cd desktop I mean
[08:00] <infidel> Warbo, no but that would make it a lot easier i agree
[08:00] <Rolando2424> I get ot the menu part
[08:00] <Rolando2424> But I can't get ot the desktop
[08:00] <Warbo> I am trying to use a BTTV-based TV capture card ("PCTV Rave") but it's composite signal is only showing black and white. Any ideas?
[08:01] <Warbo> infidel: I am guessing nothing comes up in System>Admin>Discs?
[08:01] <Pelo> Rolando2424,  did you select any alternate options from the menu or are you just going ahead from the default settings ?
[08:01] <Rolando2424> I tryed th safe mode
[08:01] <Rolando2424> and the check for errors mode
[08:01] <Rolando2424> they all give the same error
[08:02] <infidel> Warbo, hmmm i don't have a disks in system>>admin
[08:02] <Pelo> roland-erau,  I am guessing you might have a borked cd,  try downloading again and burning a new one
[08:02] <roland-erau> i what?
[08:02] <Warbo> infidel: Oh. It is there in Daper. I know it isn't in Breezy, and have no idea about Edgy
[08:02] <Warbo> infidel: never mind
[08:02] <roland-erau> ohh. hi Rolando2424
[08:02] <Pelo> roland-erau,  sorry  ,  nick complete you understand
[08:02] <roland-erau> :) i do.
[08:02] <Pelo> Rolando2424,   I'm guessing you might have a borked cd ,  dl again and burn a new one
[08:02] <Rolando2424> ok pelo
[08:03] <Rolando2424> I'll try
[08:03] <gnomefreak> infidel: its there but its under a new name
[08:03] <Warbo> infidel: My first question was actually going to be how much do you know about Ubuntu, because I could help if it was just a simple mount command, but obviously this is out of my depth :)
[08:03] <Rolando2424> By the way Pelo are portuguese or something?
[08:03] <fbsder> tried to upgrade ubuntu brokey brokey
[08:03] <Pelo> Rolando2424,  old french
[08:03] <Rolando2424> lol
[08:03] <Rolando2424> ok
[08:03] <Rolando2424> I'll try to burn a new cd
[08:04] <fbsder> i no like the edgy
[08:04] <fbsder> bad bad
[08:04] <infidel> gnomefreak, Warbo i have device manager and i see the controller but it's not linked to a /dev/
[08:04] <Pelo> Rolando2424,  similar meaning , it's a linguistical root word
[08:04] <Innoruuk> I tried copying a file using cp <file> <directory>, apparently the file was already in the directory and my system crashed.
[08:04] <Dink>  Anyone know if feisty channel is up ??
[08:04] <Warbo> infidel: Is there a card in? Maybe it only puts the device node there when it has something to mount
[08:05] <infidel> Warbo, yeah i have a card in
[08:05] <Pelo> later folks
[08:05] <infidel> Warbo, tifm_7xx1: sd card detected in socket 3
[08:05] <Warbo> Innoruuk: It should ask I think. If you use the option "cp -i <file> <folder>" it will ask if you want to overwrite
[08:06] <Innoruuk> I didn't use -i that's the thing.
[08:06] <Warbo> Innoruuk: Just that the default behaviour seems to be different on different distros, and I can't remember Ubuntu's
[08:06] <Innoruuk> Asking to overwrite should have been defaulted :(
=== bus-mechanic is now known as PYR2
[08:07] <Innoruuk> And is there a way to find out if a lib is being depended on by anything?
[08:07] <socomm> Innoruuk: ldd, I believe.
[08:07] <socomm> Oh wait, nevermind.
[08:08] <Innoruuk> ldd works on libs?
[08:08] <Innoruuk> Hehe I want a reverse ldd.
[08:08] <serrand> Hello. May I ask a question?
[08:09] <Warbo> serrand: Go ahead, it's what we're here for :)
[08:09] <Slim^snief^schu> dito, I have a very basic question
[08:09] <TGPO> just fire em off
[08:10] <serrand> Well, this might sound completely idiotic. I have downloaded the newest version of the live/desktop cd, but I can't seem to be able to figure out how to get to the install itself, I don't want to test the live-system, I've already decided I want to install ubuntu...
[08:10] <cbgb> hi *, anyone around who has lirc knowledge?
[08:10] <bimberi> Innoruuk: sudo apt-get remove -s <package>    (will simulate its removal and you'll see if anything it wants to go with it)
[08:10] <serrand> installation*
[08:10] <Warbo> serrand: The installer runs from inside the live CD
[08:10] <Innoruuk> Thanks bimberi.
[08:10] <bimberi> serrand: there should be an install icon on the desktop
[08:10] <Warbo> serrand: There should be a desktop icon saying "Install"
[08:10] <Slim^snief^schu> How long might it take to get to the install screen with a ubuntu 6.10 cd?
[08:11] <serrand> Ah, I have to load the live system and then install from there?
[08:11] <bimberi> serrand: yep :)
[08:11] <TGPO> serrand yes
[08:11] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: Depends what CD. Do you mean the regular "desktop" CD?
[08:11] <Slim^snief^schu> oO
[08:11] <Slim^snief^schu> that could also be an answer to my question
[08:11] <serrand> I see... thanks a lot. Well, gonna do that...
[08:11] <Slim^snief^schu> launch live and then install oO
[08:11] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: Because that should come up with a live system, then you install from there
[08:11] <Slim^snief^schu> is that correct?
[08:11] <Slim^snief^schu> ok
[08:11] <TGPO> Slim^snief^schu yes
[08:11] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: yes
[08:11] <Slim^snief^schu> thanks
[08:11] <quaint> hrmm
[08:11] <_chris_> what's the command line tool that can list all of the installed packages?  i'm looking for the equivalent of gentoo's "equery list" and redhat's "rpm -qa".
[08:12] <bimberi> _chris_: dpkg -l
[08:12] <Warbo> _chris_: "sudo dpkg -l | grep "ii""
[08:12] <_chris_> bimberi: thank ye much
[08:12] <quaint> I got a very big problem with installing ubuntu on my new machine (I'm now on my old laptop)
[08:12] <bimberi> _chris_: dpkg -l | grep ^ii   (more precisely)
[08:12] <za1b0t> Hey, I cant find Opera in my repos. Should I download it from opera.com? Its the dapper version, but I guess its the latest opera so maybe it doesnt matter if I use it?
[08:12] <Warbo> (mine will not list the ones which have config files left over)
[08:12] <quaint> it has problems loading my videocard, I tried both vesa as ati bith both won't work
[08:12] <Warbo> za1b0t: Try looking in Applications>Add/Remove and turning on commercial ones
[08:12] <quaint> any clue on what I can try?
[08:13] <bimberi> Warbo: i did both :)
[08:13] <Warbo> quaint: vesa doesn't work? That's pretty serious (sorry I can't actually be of any help :) )
[08:13] <Slim^snief^schu> Uhm, theres only an option "Start or install Ubuntu", I tried that several times but the machine seems to freeze
[08:14] <quaint> warbo it says x driver doesn't work (or something) and it disabled it for me
[08:14] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: OK, looks like the live CD isn't running properly. There is a solution though
[08:14] <yemu> anyone knows how to fix ati fglrx problem? i can't get 3d acceleration to work, fglrxinfo still reports using mesa driver
[08:14] <quaint> I used lspci, and it came up with ATI unknown device
[08:14] <yemu> i have fglrx driver loaded
[08:14] <za1b0t> Warbo, Thanks but I have a pretty big repo list from ubuntuguide (says it should have Opera) but it isnt there.
[08:14] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: Since the Live CD is read-only there is no point trying to fix it, but you can install without it. Look for the "alternate" CD on releases.ubuntu.com
[08:15] <Slim^snief^schu> Well, theres a ubuntu logo with that orange loading bar
[08:15] <Warbo> za1b0t: Are you on AMD64 by any chance? Loads of stuff isn't available on that architecture
[08:15] <TGPO> za1b0t apt-get --reinstall opera
[08:15] <Warbo> yemu: What card do you have?
[08:15] <quaint> nope intel
[08:16] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: what does the last line say that it gets up to?
[08:16] <yemu> ait mobility x700
[08:16] <Slim^snief^schu> I cant see any lines
[08:16] <za1b0t> Warbo, i386
[08:16] <Slim^snief^schu> there was a overlay screen saying loading linux kernel
[08:16] <Slim^snief^schu> then some dots .................. :-D
[08:16] <Slim^snief^schu> now wait
[08:16] <Ubootno> Slim^snief^schu, whats your hardware setup
[08:16] <Slim^snief^schu> "Buffer I/o error on device
[08:16] <Warbo> za1b0t: Hmm, maybe just doesn't know about edgy. You can either get the Dapper deb from Opera.com then, or visit one of you repos with a web browser and look for it in the "pool" folder
[08:17] <TGPO> Slim^snief^schu try adding noacpi to the boot command
[08:17] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: oooo, that sounds nasty
[08:17] <za1b0t> Warbo, my firefox crashes from time to time. And I generally like opera better. But cant I use the dapper version from opera.com?
[08:17] <Slim^snief^schu> outsch
[08:17] <Warbo> I only ever got I/O errors when my hard drives failed :(
[08:17] <Slim^snief^schu> many bad lines now
[08:17] <bimberi> !fffc za1b0t

[08:18] <snowshoefox> it should add (Beat out commercial developers for top linux ide)

[08:18] <tylersmith> Hi. Web browsing for my 64 amd with broadband is very, very slow. I did the ipv6 tweeks (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4) and the other tweeks to Firefox. Still very, very slow. Is there something else I need to do?

[08:19] <za1b0t> ubotu, Thanks. I will try that. Thou I believe its not only on sites using flash.

[08:19] <Ubootno> pretty weak feces to have to do that every time ubuntu is installed
[08:19] <gizmo_the_great1> jrib: thanks. Is the ## part of the address to use?
[08:19] <Slim^snief^schu> May I completely formatt my dard drive before installing ubuntu?
[08:19] <jrib> gizmo_the_great1: yes, just  /join ##c++
[08:19] <user-land> tylersmith, try a different browser and try wget
[08:19] <Ubootno> and that slow browsing/ipv6 has been an issue for the last two release cycles
[08:20] <TGPO> Slim^snief^schu yes, it gives you that option during install
[08:20] <quaint> no-one knows about x driver problem? :(
[08:20] <bimberi> Slim^snief^schu: if you don't need anything on it, sure
[08:20] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: I generally do that anyway before installing, then set up the partitions manually, but that is because I am 1337 :)
[08:20] <Ubootno> Slim^snief^schu, considering you havent even gotten the livecd to load the kernel - is that smart?
[08:20] <Slim^snief^schu> rofl, n1
[08:20] <tylersmith> ubotu: Thank you. I did just that and not much happened. Nothing improved.

[08:21] <yemu> anyone knows how to fix ati fglrx problem? i can't get 3d acceleration to work, fglrxinfo still reports using mesa driver
[08:21] <VonGuard> god damn, what happened to Open Office in Edgy?
[08:21] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: I would recommend getting the alternate CD personally, and seeing if you can at least install it (ie. don't really care about the live system)
[08:21] <yemu> i've followed th guides
[08:21] <yemu> and installed the newest ati driver
[08:21] <VonGuard> It is so buggy! constantly crashing. and that copy paste bug is KILLING me
[08:21] <user-land> tylersmith, what do you get with wget ?
[08:21] <yemu> but still have problems
[08:21] <Slim^snief^schu> < downloading the alternate atm
[08:22] <Warbo> yemu: Check if your card is supported. ATI don't support some of their own cards (like mine), and also check on help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver to see if the Open Source 3D driver will work for you
[08:22] <yemu> Xoerg log reprts problems with dri
[08:22] <tylersmith> user-land: I'm not sure what you mean by wget. wget what?
[08:22] <Slim^snief^schu> Anyone know how to format my hard drive without ubuntu?
[08:22] <yemu> Warbo: i'm afraid open source driver will not work
[08:22] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: 1) get a magnet, 2).......
[08:23] <Slim^snief^schu> dont make fun of me
[08:23] <Slim^snief^schu> ^^
[08:23] <yemu> Warbo: i think that x700 is supported by closed driver
[08:23] <Warbo> yemu: OK, just that it works for me when fglrx doesn't (but alpha/compositing is still done by mesa, so Compiz runs far too slow to be usable)
[08:23] <Dred_furst> Are the KDE4 testing packages on apt the KDE4 technical preview stuff?
[08:23] <user-land> tylersmith: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download
[08:23] <ompaul> Slim^snief^schu, you need some operating system or you need to get into bios programming
[08:24] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: Maybe you could find a crappy little system that boots from floppy and do it from there? Maybe FreeDOS or MenuetOS or something?
[08:24] <tylersmith> user-land: You must have me confused with somebody else. I'm asking about slow web browsing.
[08:24] <yemu> Warbo: i've been using compiz long time ago in gentoo with fglrs driver so it works
[08:24] <nasragiel> there 2 intel videocard drivers in the repository, which one performs better with beryl/xgl?
[08:24] <Warbo> Slim^snief^schu: Obviously the easiest thing to do would be to plug it into another PC
[08:24] <user-land> tylersmith, what speed do you get with wget ?
[08:24] <yemu> Warbo: now i tried to make it work in ubuntu and realized that 3d doesn't work
[08:25] <Slim^snief^schu> dont want to destroy that cumputer, sry :-D Im not really into hardware
[08:25] <Kassah> I just upgraded to Edgy... and now I don't hear any sound... when I open Volume Control... it shows that I have 3 Sound Devices (VIA, Audigy [the one I want]  and Reltek)
[08:25] <Warbo> Ooops, I've got to go. Back later (and I hope someone knows how to fix my video capture problem)
[08:25] <tylersmith> user-land: 384kbps
[08:25] <tag> why do I feel like edgy was rushed out to accomidate firefox 2.
[08:25] <Ubootno> Slim^snief^schu, you can format your hard drive using the manufacturers disk or any linux livecd , but if you cannot even get ubuntu to boot, why are you wiping your hard drive ?
[08:25] <Kassah> I am using RythemBox
[08:25] <bimberi> tag: Edgy's release date was decided long before Firefox 2's.
[08:25] <user-land> great. what page is slow for you, tylersmith ?
[08:26] <Slim^snief^schu> I was wiping my hard drive before testing ubuntu
[08:26] <tylersmith> user-land: all web pages
[08:26] <Slim^snief^schu> knoppix live was working
[08:26] <TGPO> Slim^snief^schu not necessary
[08:26] <Slim^snief^schu> so was linux 6.1 :-D
[08:26] <user-land> example ?
[08:26] <ompaul> Slim^snief^schu, is it a laptop?
[08:26] <tag> bimberi: this new version of evo seems terribly less than stable
[08:26] <Slim^snief^schu> nope
[08:26] <tag> bimberi: any chance I can move it back a version without breaking anything?  It's hindering my productivity
[08:26] <ompaul> Slim^snief^schu, then I suggest the following
[08:26] <TGPO> Slim^snief^schu is it x64?
[08:26] <Slim^snief^schu> 400 Mhz, esa II graphics, 30 gigs hdd, 256 mb ram
[08:26] <infidel> Warbo, i got it thanks
[08:27] <Dred_furst> I have to say if you end up with an RM laptop thats about 3 years old, edgy WILL ionstall :)
[08:27] <Dred_furst> and run perfectly
[08:27] <Slim^snief^schu> uhm, if x64 means 64 bit prozessor then no, that thingy is some years old
[08:27] <Slim^snief^schu> ^^
[08:27] <ompaul> Slim^snief^schu, ahh that would be well slow, you would be better with fluxubuntu try #fluxubuntu or xubuntu try #xubuntu it would run faster
[08:27] <bimberi> tag: actually it's one of the more stable things on my install.  Not sure about downgrade - you could try uninstalling it and installing dappers package manually - but .. well .. ewww
[08:28] <Slim^snief^schu> coool, never heard of that
[08:28] <[sYn] > What version of GTK does edgy ship with?
[08:28] <ompaul> Slim^snief^schu, typo #fluxbuntu
[08:28] <tag> bimberi: I'm not totally convinced that it's not OWAs problem in our local environment

[08:29] <tag> bimberi: something is wrong though, and I need to fix it -- I can't even respond to emails without evo freezing up and the first thing I noticed when I installed edgy is evo *crashes* when I click the close button and bug buddy pops up...every time.

[08:31] <TGPO> !downgrade

[08:36] <rexy> dont know how to install it, mostly working with suse these days
[08:36] <rexy> ubuntu uses apt right?
[08:36] <quaint> hrmm

[08:36] <rexy> k
[08:36] <Dred_furst> rexy yes
[08:36] <quaint> so I can just give up using ubuntu and an ati graphics card?
[08:36] <rexy> might have to fiddle with you sound setup

[08:44] <rexy> long day at work, bit slow, must compensate quickly with beer
[08:44] <tag> perhaps
[08:44] <tag> that would definitely explain things

If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[08:44] <tag> I sat here through the upgrade though and ensured I waited until it prompted me to restart my machine
=== SeamusLP_ is now known as SeamusLP
[08:46] <bimberi> tag: i personally haven't done an upgrade, there have been some issues reported though.  People with fresh installs seem to have a better time.
[08:47] <bimberi> tag: no issues specifically with evo that i've heard (i should say)
[08:47] <Adnarim> hi
[08:47] <Pelo> bimberi,  tag  I tried to upgrade and I ended up haveing to do a clean install from dvd,  go for the fresh install
[08:47] <Adnarim> is there a shortcut in ubuntu to change between the different desktops?
[08:47] <tag> bimberi: so should I install over?  Can I do that safely?
[08:47] <bimberi> tag: if it's still happening after this, get into https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash and report bugs
[08:47] <bimberi> tag: no
[08:47] <tag> my system is relatively precariously configured in order to sit in our corporate environment (they hand out linux boxes of another kind here)
[08:48] <tag> ok.
[08:48] <Pelo> Adnarim,  you mean between  gnome and kde ? or between workspaces ?
[08:48] <tag> There she goes again!
[08:48] <Adnarim> between the workspaces (sry for my bad english ;) )
[08:48] <bimberi> tag: it's back up and start from scratch really
[08:48] <bimberi> tag: :/
[08:48] <tag> I really need to be able to respond to email...this isn't cool, at all.
[08:49] <tag> wish i would have never upgraded.
[08:49] <bimberi> can you use owa via a browser as a workaround?
[08:50] <tag> bimberi: that's completely unsufficient..I mean I can, but I'm the type that has everything tied into evo and manages my todo list, daily schedule etc through exchange
[08:50] <cartucho> why is evolution eating so much memory i pissed
[08:50] <Pelo> Adnarim, look under system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts,  if there isn'T one you can specify your own

[08:50] <tag> wait
[08:50] <tag> what version of evo am I supposed to have?

[08:51] <za1b0t> k31th, what do you mean for audio work?
[08:51] <yemu> anyone knows how to fix ati fglrx problem? i can't get 3d acceleration to work, fglrxinfo still reports using mesa driver

[08:53] <agent> Beta_M, if you are using Ubuntu, double click on the deb file
[08:53] <yemu> i rebooted
[08:53] <Pelo> Beta_M, http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[08:54] <keeb> yemu: christ, hmm.. Probably what happened is you need to edit the conf file manually, or rerun.
[08:54] <ladydoor> hey all...for some reason (under dapper) when i try to start emacs in X it doesn't recognize the adobe font (its default)--i don't usually run the non-TTY version, but i'm checking it out for the sake of images in w3m-el. anyway, i've found that by specifying MiscFixed or miscfixed as the font, it actually displays characters (instead of meaningless blocks), but it still gives an error about the font not being defined (regardles
[08:54] <ladydoor> s of whether i specify the full font or not). is this some kind of bug unique to dapper (i haven't seen this before) and if so, how can i fix it? And let's leave the "use vi/m" comments as said so we can skip that part, thanks.
[08:54] <socomm> whatis ubuntu
[08:54] <keeb> yemu: what ati card do you have?
[08:54] <ladydoor> !ubuntu
[08:54] <ubotu> Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuHowCome
[08:54] <ladydoor> socomm: ^^^
[08:55] <yemu> keeb: ati x700
[08:55] <yemu> in notebook
[08:55] <kraut> moin
[08:55] <fuffe> ubuntu not good :(
[08:55] <keeb> the x* series isnt really working yet with 3d accel, yet
[08:55] <fuffe> http://fasmz.org/~pterjan/blog/?date=20060609
[08:55] <jbroome> BOO!
[08:55] <keeb> at least for my x1300 pro
[08:55] <keeb> what you can try to do is get the drivers from ATI.com for them, and see if that helps, but it didnt help for me.
[08:56] <fuffe> why does ubuntu insists on having non free software within it?
[08:56] <rc-1> my monitor is making loud high pitched noises, any ideas to fix?
[08:56] <yemu> i have installed newest drivers from ati
[08:56] <jatt> When I click an url in x-chat, konqeror is opened instead of firefox. How can I configure x-chat to use firefox as default browser?
[08:56] <keeb> however, my radeon9700 works perfectly.
[08:56] <yemu> and nothng helped
[08:56] <navaladi> hi frnds how to use the fonts given by the specific websites that is in ttf format
[08:56] <socomm> rc-1: shut it off and go have lunch.
[08:56] <keeb> i think you just have to wait :\
[08:56] <keeb> or!
[08:56] <ladydoor> fuffe: you don't *have* to use it. that's why it's put into the multiverse and restricted repos
[08:56] <keeb> spend $70 on a decent nvidia card.
[08:56] <kitche> fuffe: why do most distros do it to make users happy
[08:56] <ladydoor> fuffe: don't enable them, and you've no non-free software. problem solved
[08:57] <rc-1> socomm, did, its been doing it for a few days!
[08:57] <erUSUL> fuffe: it does not 'insist' it jus have choosed to do so in exercise of its liberty. if you have a problem with it just use other distro
[08:57] <ladydoor> rc-1: is it doing this constantly, or just occasionally?
[08:57] <rc-1> keeb, i have a brand new 512 its not the video card is too old! :)
[08:57] <tecky-wrk> so why does ubuntu not have root enabled by default ?
[08:57] <erUSUL> !sudo
[08:57] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:57] <rc-1> ladydoor, about 30 percent of use time

[08:57] <_raf> hi is someone can help about the zd1211 on Edgy ?
[08:58] <navaladi> i have downloaded a single font file from one website i don't know how to use that .ttf file to better view that site..pls help
[08:58] <tecky-wrk> that i know ... i'm just asking why you cant use the root user just like every other OS
[08:58] <socomm> rc-1: x might be using too high frequency
[08:58] <erUSUL> !fonts | navaladi
[08:58] <ubotu> navaladi: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto
[08:58] <ubotu> navaladi: No fonts in flash? Install msttcorefonts, gsfonts, and gsfonts-x11 , No fonts in mplayer? see !mplayer
[08:58] <fuffe> well, but ubuntu shouldn't include them by default and promote themself as an innocent free software promoter
[08:58] <ladydoor> fuffe: by default, it doesn't
[08:58] <rc-1> ah ok thanks, ill try setting form 80 to 65
[08:58] <njan> tecky-wrk, integrating the ability to run commands as a superuser with the regular user's shell, and not having a communal password, lead to a better desktop experience and a securer system.
[08:59] <kitche> fuffe: debian does it yet they promote it and yet fsf is happy with debian
[08:59] <ladydoor> fuffe: by default, the Main repository is enabled
[08:59] <tecky-wrk> njan: but they neglect the root user all together
[08:59] <infidel> anyone know where i can find some cool looking themes?
[08:59] <navaladi> ubotu - not for media player i need only for websites thanks
[08:59] <njan> tecky-wrk, they don't, it's still there, you just can't login using it.
[08:59] <tecky-wrk> its quite a disturbing feature of the distro
[08:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about not for media player i need only for websites thanks - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:59] <Trixsey> I can't install ubuntu, screen goes pitch black right when I started installing...
[08:59] <Trixsey> What do I do?
[08:59] <njan> tecky-wrk, when you use sudo or gksudo, you run commands in the context of the root user, you just don't do it in the way you're used to doing it.
[08:59] <orkid> run in text mode
[08:59] <linuxwolf> hi
[08:59] <tecky-wrk> can you switch the default gui from gnome to flux ?

[09:00] <_raf> hi is someone can help about the zd1211 on Edgy ?
[09:00] <linuxwolf> i have just upgraded to dapper
[09:00] <njan> tecky-wrk, try it out for a bit, I'm sure you'll get used to it, and you'll have a securer / easier to use system.
[09:00] <roryy> _raf: what's a zd1211 ?
[09:00] <ladydoor> tecky-wrk: and yeah; just install fluxbox and if you start from G(K/X)DM, choose that in the Sessions menu there
[09:01] <tecky-wrk> k
[09:01] <CarlFK> file says "45390.flv: Macromedia Flash Video" - how do I play it?
[09:01] <ladydoor> tecky-wrk: if you boot to a console, specify fluxbox in your .xinitrc
[09:01] <_raf> zd1211 kernel module (wifi usb key)
[09:01] <linuxwolf> how can i know if the upgrade is ok ?
[09:01] <CarlFK> linuxwolf: you can't.
[09:01] <linuxwolf> versions of applications for example ?
[09:01] <roryy> _raf: the best I can do is point you to the help pages: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:02] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: how exactly do you mean "ok?" functional or completed?
[09:02] <Amadeus> hello
[09:02] <linuxwolf> i see that the updater manager icon is different
[09:02] <linuxwolf> completed
[09:02] <jbroome> rock me Amadeus
[09:02] <CarlFK> linuxwolf: you can just trust that the smart people that are driving the buss did a good job
[09:02] <Amadeus> heheh
[09:02] <Trixsey> How can I install Ubuntu? As soon as I click "Install" screen goes pitch black? What's wrong and how do I get around it? I've tried with burning 1 CD with the ISO and one DVD with the ISO
[09:02] <_raf> roryy: ok i read this thank u
[09:02] <timo90> 8-)
[09:02] <linuxwolf> i trust , but i don't trust me
[09:02] <lucien> hi
[09:02] <Amadeus> Question: Where is mkinitd in Ubuntu? I can't seem to find it
[09:02] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: cat /etc/lsb-release
[09:02] <linuxwolf> is the first time i do
[09:02] <linuxwolf> ok
[09:02] <CarlFK> Trixsey: use the alternate CD.
[09:02] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: what's the output of that?
[09:03] <timo90> !ANTERNATE
[09:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ANTERNATE - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:03] <infidel> anyway to resize a partition without destroying data?
[09:03] <Trixsey> CarlFK: Which is that?
[09:03] <Amadeus> !initrd
[09:03] <timo90> !ALTERNATE
[09:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about initrd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:03] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.

[09:04] <lucien> how do you install ATI X800 i cant get the drivers working something about not being able to open the file? what program can i use??
[09:04] <Amadeus> Hi guys! How do I make an initrd image?
[09:04] <roryy> linuxwolf: what are you trying to upgrade to? 6.06 or 6.10 ?
[09:04] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: a) were you trying to upgrade to dapper or to edgy? b) for future reference, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org is the ideal place for multi-line posts :-)
[09:04] <linuxwolf> i had 5.10
[09:04] <lucien> how do you install ATI X800 i cant get the drivers working something about not being able to open the file? what program can i use?
[09:04] <linuxwolf> and i have upgraded to dapper

[09:05] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: ok, cool. it looks like it's succeeded--note that your distrib_description is 6.06.1--that means it did complete the upgrade
[09:05] <linuxwolf> ok
[09:05] <linuxwolf> ok
[09:05] <Amadeus> initrd, anyone?
[09:05] <linuxwolf> thanks
[09:05] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: as to functionality, just try to use it and you'll quickly see whether it worked in that respect
[09:05] <Pelo> lucien,  make sure you have a linux driver ,   if you do , try opening it in gedit and read the first portion for installation instructions
[09:05] <ladydoor> linuxwolf: np
[09:05] <Trixsey> CarlFK: I'm a "Windows"-user, Is using the alternate-cd hard for a complete newbie?
[09:06] <lucien> yeh i do it says it can read the file format
[09:06] <CarlFK> Trixsey: no.  just keep hitting enter
[09:06] <lucien> even tho i got the .rpm and .run
[09:06] <ladydoor> Trixsey: when i first used ubuntu (first time in linux) there was no livecd...and it wasn't that bad even then
[09:06] <timo90> !alternate install
[09:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alternate install - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:06] <CarlFK> Trixsey: it is like your basic setup.exe - lots of "Next" :)
[09:06] <Trixsey> ok
[09:06] <linuxwolf> the aptitude -s dist-upgrade say that all is ok
[09:06] <Ubootno> ladydoor, imho it was better before
[09:06] <lucien> have any idea?
[09:07] <linuxwolf> nothing to install  or update
[09:07] <rc-1> just installed beryl, and everything seems to work except keyboard commands, ideas? i asked in #beryl (note only ones not already in ubuntu, such as cntrl alt left dont work)
[09:07] <linuxwolf> :)
[09:07] <Trixsey> I installed ubuntu like 1-2 years ago
[09:07] <sp_> hola
[09:07] <Trixsey> maybe I used the text install then aswell?
[09:07] <ladydoor> Ubootno: well...i'm afraid we're the exception to the rule. fortunately, there's always the alternate install
[09:07] <Ubootno> yay :(
[09:08] <Trixsey> Alternate install is anoter ISO?
[09:08] <Pelo> lucien,  read here for instructions on installing rpm   http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[09:08] <Trixsey> or the same ISO but another option?
[09:08] <ladydoor> Trixsey: it's a lot smaller, but yeah
[09:08] <lucien> Thanks alot much appreciated
[09:09] <honk> Fast and awesome app launcher?
[09:09] <lucien> btw can linux read .exe?
[09:09] <Trixsey> ladydoor: alternate install was also 700MB, same as my CD ISO :p
[09:09] <Kingsqueak> !mkinitramfs
[09:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mkinitramfs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:09] <Trixsey> lucien: only with WINE
[09:09] <Trixsey> right? :o
[09:09] <lucien> kk thanks
[09:10] <ladydoor> Trixsey: oh...hm. i'd assumed it was smaller without all the GNOME/KDE/XFCE stuff. i guess not
[09:10] <Pelo> lucien,  not off the cuff,  .exe are dos/windows apps,  you need an emulator
[09:10] <Trixsey> ladydoor: this install is without gnome??!? :(
[09:10] <roryy> the alternate cd still has gnome, doesn't it?
[09:10] <ladydoor> Trixsey: i meant without the livecd component, sorry
[09:10] <lucien> oh really so how would i be able to get this?
[09:10] <Trixsey> puh
[09:10] <serrand> Hi again.
[09:10] <ladydoor> lucien: what distro are you using? dapper or edgy?
[09:10] <Trixsey> without gnome I'm lost :p
[09:10] <Pelo> lucien,  www.winehq.com
[09:10] <lucien> sorry i just got this all working on dual boot yesterday
[09:11] <lucien> kk thaniks
[09:11] <Pelo> lucien,  www.winehq.org , sorry
[09:11] <Trixsey> I don't know THAT many commands to get by without gnome or KDE
[09:11] <ladydoor> Trixsey: it's installed, just not part of the ttext-based install
[09:11] <Trixsey> which one do you prefer anyway?
[09:11] <Trixsey> gnome or kDE?
[09:11] <ladydoor> Trixsey: moi?
=== _Er1K_ is now known as BunnyKitten
[09:11] <jeeves_Moss> all:  has any one heard of libgal15 that gnuCash is built on?
[09:11] <Trixsey> ladydoor yeah
[09:11] <TGPO> Trixsey, either are equally horrid IMHO
[09:11] <Pelo> lucien,   no problem  several of us are one app away from ditching windows alltogether, we understand
[09:11] <ladydoor> Trixsey: lol...http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison
[09:11] <Trixsey> oh
[09:11] <Trixsey> I dont like KDE :P
[09:11] <Trixsey> LOL
[09:11] <serrand> I kinda gave up on getting ubuntu installed. I have 256 ram on a Celeron 1.50GHz laptop. Any reason it would run so slowly?
[09:12] <jonwallace> gnome all the way
[09:12] <Trixsey> which one do you guys use?
[09:12] <jeeves_Moss> all:  any one on this strange package?
[09:12] <honk> Is there a tutorial to get suspend2 working with ubuntu and how to use it?
[09:12] <serrand> Other than the relatively low ram...
[09:12] <rogue780> serrand, use xubuntu
[09:12] <serrand> what's that?
[09:12] <TGPO> serrand, yes, 256 meg of memory, use fluxbuntu or xubuntu
[09:12] <Trixsey> http://www.xubuntu.org/
[09:12] <lucien> Pelo cheers yeh well once i get the hang of it il be alot more happy
[09:12] <Kingsqueak> serrand: on an older box like that, don't run gnome and use fluxbox or xfce4
[09:12] <ejer> what problems would I have sharing my /home/username directory between a gentoo install and an edgy install?
[09:12] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  look it up in synaptic
[09:12] <rogue780> it's ubuntu with the xFe(sp) gui. much easier on the ram
[09:13] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  I did, it's not in there.
[09:13] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo: I googled it as well
[09:13] <rogue780> Xfce*
[09:13] <Kingsqueak> ah so that's what xubuntu is
[09:13] <rogue780> http://www.xubuntu.org/
[09:13] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  enable all the repos in synaptic
[09:13] <zerosmoke> ok do any of you guys ever dabble in subspace/continuum?
[09:13] <serrand> hmm. Is ubuntu heavier than windows? windows runs just perfectly here...
[09:13] <ladydoor> ejer: you might if they used different versions of a program which added/subtracted features
[09:14] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  I did
[09:14] <psusi> Q!
[09:14] <kostas> serrand, you may want to try the alternate CD install for ubuntu
[09:14] <rogue780> linux is lighter than windows, but gnome can be heavier than explorer depending on your exact system setup.
[09:14] <serrand> I mean I don't want to sound disparaging, but the graphical interface in ubuntu didn't look that much more impressive than windows...
[09:14] <serrand> ah
[09:14] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  can'T find it either ,  installing gnucash using synaptic should install all the dependencies you need
[09:14] <zerosmoke> got the patched version of wine and continuum but can't seem to get the patched version to run it...
[09:14] <ladydoor> serrand: it can range from *extremely* light (twm, ratpoison) to pretty heavy but eyecandiful (KDE)
[09:14] <kostas> I had the same problem, but installation was really smooth with text graphics install
[09:15] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  ok, I'll recheck
[09:15] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  or alternatively you might want to consider kmymoney, I like it much better
[09:15] <kostas> but at the end you have the normal ubuntu
[09:15] <rogue780> does anyone in here run ubuntu on a sempron64 processor?
[09:15] <psusi> serrand: what did you expect?  it isn't supposed to be all this glitz and windowdressing that is supposed to blow your taste for eye candy away
[09:15] <psusi> it's supposed to _work_
[09:15] <TehUni> i have a seperate drive that i use for important data storage only (no OS files). i'd like the hdd to last as long as possible. is there a way to disable writecaches, indexing, etc... so that the drive is ONLY used when i'm actively viewing\editing the files on it?
[09:15] <Lie-Algebra> serrand, try e17 if u want a fast explorer and more..., its blazingly fast
[09:15] <serrand> well, it doesn't even do that...
[09:15] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  will it import from M$ money?  I'm also running Gnome.  I don't like KDE
[09:15] <serrand> what's e17?
[09:16] <kitche> serrand: a window manager
[09:16] <ladydoor> serrand: the enlightenment window manager
[09:16] <psusi> rogue780: I run on an amd64
[09:16] <highneko> serrand: What I hate about windows, is simple things are hard to do, and nothing's customizable.
[09:16] <rogue780> does kmymoney or gnucash update account information automatically over the internet?
[09:16] <kitche> serrand: while kde and gnome and xfce is desktop enviroments
[09:16] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  I don'T like kde either but installnig it from synaptic  will install the appropriate dependencies,  not sure about the  ms money import, let me check
[09:16] <serrand> does it come with xubuntu or do I install it separately?
[09:16] <psusi> TehUni: you mean you want it to actually power off?
[09:17] <serrand> (e17)
[09:17] <ladydoor> serrand: you can either use a xubuntu install cd or do sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop
[09:17] <kitche> serrand: you will have to install it seperate since it's still in development
[09:17] <Crankymonky> rogue780, I run ubuntu on a sempron 64
[09:17] <psusi> TehUni: you do realize that disk drives fail most often as a result of being turned on/off rather than just continuously running right?
[09:17] <TehUni> psusi: no, just not used. i know in windows even if it's not being used, it can still be accessed all the time
[09:17] <ladydoor> serrand: the xubuntu cd will *only* install the xfce4 DE, whereas installing it post-install will install it in addition to GNOME or KDE
[09:17] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  ok.  Thanks.  the goal is to move compleatly to Linux, but I still can't give up my games, and my PPC conectivity.  I don't feel like mounting, and unmounting my PPC every time I want to sync it.
[09:18] <psusi> TehUni: you can unmount it when you don't want to use it
[09:18] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,   kmymoney will import QIT files
[09:18] <teclo> Hello, sensors-detect says "Sorry, no chips were detected." on Ubuntu 6.10, but it did detect the chips on Ubuntu 6.06 ... any idea ?
[09:18] <serrand> I see. Well, I don't want an eyecandy, just something that is stable and light, I am new to linux, but I always had the impression from other people that it was lighter than windows.
[09:18] <TehUni> mmm... that's a good idea.
[09:18] <isai> hi
[09:18] <zcat[1] > serrand: try xubuntu
[09:18] <Crankymonky> serrand, It depends on what DE / WM you choose
[09:18] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  well, it installed it, now I don't have an icon for it.  God I hate Ubunut most days!!!!!
[09:18] <TehUni> any way to auto-unmount if not in use?
[09:18] <ViennaLinux> sayes try it
[09:18] <Crankymonky> But try xubuntu
[09:18] <serrand> DE? Desktop Environment?
[09:18] <rogue780> Crankymonky: how hot does your processor run? mine's runnint at 1.6ghz, and idles at 47 degrees c
[09:18] <serrand> Ok, I will
[09:18] <psusi> serrand: if you want a lightweight desktop, try xubuntu... fluxbox is supposedly might lighter than gnome
[09:18] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,   look in the office submenu
[09:18] <Ubootno> jeeves_Moss, you could try another distro.
[09:19] <kostas> it IS much lighter, though normal installation may give you some problems
[09:19] <ViennaLinux> fluxbox starts in about 0.000 seconds *g*
[09:19] <ladydoor> psusi: for future reference, xubuntu is XFCE4...fluxbox is a different window manager
[09:19] <Crankymonky> rogue780, my motherboard doesn't support measuring temperature, so I can't tell you
[09:19] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  I've only got the mail client in there.
[09:19] <psusi> TehUni: I'm sure there is a way, just not an easy one or one I know of off the top of my head
[09:19] <Crankymonky> But I haven't had any lock-ups or the like
[09:19] <FlyingSquirrel32> is there any good site to get daily ubuntu news?
[09:19] <kitche> xfce4 is a DE but it's one of the lighter ones
[09:19] <Ubootno> DE?
[09:19] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  ???
[09:19] <jeeves_Moss> Ubootno:  I've tried others, and Ubuntu is the only one that gives me enough of the differn't parts of the system.  IEverything else I've tried is a pain in the butt to get to work.l
[09:19] <rogue780> Crankymonky: thanks

[09:20] <isai> i am using ubuntu 6.06 LTS and would like to know where the print manager applet (on the desktop panel) went to? I thought it was really handy to cancel print jobs.
[09:20] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  the only thing I have in that submenu is the mail program
[09:20] <serrand> I only use this computer to surf the Internet / study and music, occasionally videos. So I just need something lighten than windows, since it's getting on my nerves.
[09:20] <Crankymonky> rogue780, I'm running a 32 bit version of ubuntu, mainly because of lack of 64 bit apps and I had no real need for it
[09:20] <serrand> lighter*
[09:20] <rogue780> Pelo: do you know a lot about kmymoney and gnucash? I'm trying to figure out if either of them update account info from the internet
[09:20] <Pelo> jeeves_Moss,  you can make a launcher  , rightclick on the desktop  ,  the command line is simply kmymoney
[09:21] <ladydoor> TehUni: i suppose you could set up some kind of daemon process (like (ana)cron) to run a script that check for use somehow (i'd google for that) and unmount it if it finds it unused
[09:21] <jeeves_Moss> Pelo:  how do I creat a quick launch in that submenu?
[09:21] <rogue780> Crankymonky: I'm running 32bit version also, mainly because of lack of flash player for 64 bit. have you noticed that cpu usage will go to 100% if you're watching dvd, or streaming audio?
[09:21] <Pelo> rogue780,  the package from the edgy is a bit borked and doesn'T handle the otx updates, ( or whatever the extension is) ,  I am waiting fro someone to fix it
[09:22] <Crankymonky> rogue780, Let me check:P  But I haven't as of now
[09:22] <rogue780> Pelo: I've got dapper drake.
[09:22] <ViennaLinux> is there a way to defragment a reiserfs 3.6 ? it says 14 % non contignoues

[09:23] <rogue780> cbgb: I've got some lirc knowledge. if anything, I might be able to point you in the right direction
[09:24] <ladydoor> so i'm getting this error on starting emacs:  error: "Font `miscfixed' is not defined" . This is only when i'm using it non-tty (in an X-Window), and is an improvement on meaningless squares (which is what i got before setting the font to miscfixed). anyone know how to make this go away? i know miscfixed/MiscFixed exists, as it's my xterm font

[09:24] <cbgb> rogue780, I don't even know where to start
[09:24] <kitche> GabrielVieira: it's on the website I suggest at least 128mb
[09:24] <remu> I have a question, I was thinking of switching over from Windows to ubuntu, and I have been looking into it for a while, and I was waiting on Edgy to come out, now that it has, I am wondering if it comes with either ntfs-3g or xgl capabilities built in?
[09:24] <rogue780> does anyone know why DVD playback with xine has a/v sync issues with edgy?
[09:24] <cbgb> rogue780, it seems to be completely broken in dapper
[09:25] <ViennaLinux> can i free swap somehow?
[09:25] <lucien> hey how to i get to root?
[09:25] <freeomen> xine always have issues
[09:25] <rogue780> cbgd: I havne't used it in dapper, but I have used it with fedora, about a month ago when I was trying to break into the linux world
[09:25] <ladydoor> !root | lucien
[09:25] <ubotu> lucien: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:25] <kitche> remu: edgy has aiglx if you want xgl you will have to install the package for it ntfs-3g you have to install that as well
[09:25] <GabrielVieira> kitche i didnt find anything at website
[09:25] <lucien> i type 'su'
[09:25] <Pelo> lucien,   sudo command ,  they you give you pswd
[09:25] <lucien> then how to you enter a password
[09:25] <GabrielVieira> kitche i mean hard disk space
[09:25] <cbgb> rogue780, I've installed all debs but even lircd don't comes up
[09:25] <psusi> remu: ViennaLinux define 'free'
[09:25] <Pelo> lucien,  you will be asked
[09:25] <ladydoor> lucien: it doesn't show the little *'s, but you're still typing it
[09:25] <rogue780> if you reallywant root you can go to the users dialog and reset the root password. then you can use su
[09:26] <lucien> oh ok
[09:26] <godmachine81> lucien:: sudo passwd  to enable root password
[09:26] <ViennaLinux> remu: i use 180 mb swap ... and want to write it either to disk or back to ram?!
[09:26] <Crankymonky> rogue780, Seems my dvd drive isn't working
[09:26] <ladydoor> lucien: but for future reference that's not suggested! if you *must* su to root, do sudo -i
[09:26] <lucien> right ok
[09:26] <psusi> don't mess with root, use sudo
[09:26] <Crankymonky> rogue780, Sorry I can't tell you><
[09:26] <ladydoor> rogue780: please see my last post to lucien
[09:26] <psusi> sudo -s if you want a persistent root shell
[09:26] <lucien> ok
[09:26] <lucien> thanks
[09:26] <clearze1> ladydoor: shy not sudo -s ??
[09:26] <rogue780> cbgb: let me try to install it real quick. while I do, have you done anything with the lirc.conf or lircrc files?
[09:27] <remu> kitche: aiglx, will that do the funky effects that xgl does, such as the videos on youtube?
[09:27] <ViennaLinux> why is it not okay to be root with su root - ?
[09:27] <godmachine81> clearze1:: its just one assumes the users home dir.. the other doesnt
[09:27] <remu> ViennaLinux: pardon?
[09:27] <rogue780> lucien: (from ladydoor) but for future reference that's not suggested! if you *must* su to root, do sudo -i
[09:27] <psusi> ViennaLinux: it is a bad idea to set a root password... what if you forget it?  now you can't boot into recovery mode
[09:27] <bimberi> ViennaLinux: it's fine but you need to have a root password set.  Use "sudo -i" instead
[09:27] <kitche> remu: that is compiz or beryl which is not xgl
[09:27] <roll> seems that php channel has been attacked, ir what's hapenning ?
[09:27] <cbgb> rogue780, nope nothing yet
[09:28] <ladydoor> clearze1: as far as i can tell both work
[09:28] <ViennaLinux> okay and whats this sudo password?
[09:28] <remu> kitche: are either of those built into edgy?
[09:28] <psusi> ViennaLinux: it's just your password
[09:28] <Kingsqueak> ViennaLinux: your own
[09:28] <godmachine81> psusi:: is that really an issue when you could use a live cd to mount the partition and then disable the root passwd
[09:28] <bimberi> ViennaLinux: your own password
[09:28] <ViennaLinux> where?
[09:28] <kitche> remu: compiz and berl you need to insall since they are window managers
[09:28] <ladydoor> ViennaLinux: whatever your password is
[09:28] <remu> kitche: because before edgy came out, i read somewhere that they might be
[09:28] <Noah0504> If Xvid is OSS, why isn't it supported by Ubuntu?  Does it have something to do with it being a MPEG-4 codec?
[09:28] <psusi> godmachine81: sure... just makes things harder on you... what if you don't have the livecd handy?
[09:28] <remu> kitch: hmm, okay, i tried doing that when i was running dapper briefly, but i failed and went back to windows
[09:28] <rogue780> cbgb: I remember having issues when I was first using lirc, I'd do service lircd start and nothing would happen. finally I figured out that it was because of no lirc.conf and lircrc file
=== SportChick is now known as LagChick
[09:28] <godmachine81> psusi:: you shouldnt set your root passwd to something your going to forget..
[09:29] <rogue780> a good resource for you might be to look for people trying to set up a mythbox, or mythtv, on a ubuntu box. they will probably be able to help you more than I.
[09:29] <cbgb> rogue780, Im not able to start lircd (bash don't find it)
[09:29] <remu> kitche: hmm, okay, i tried doing that when i was running dapper briefly, but i failed and went back to windows, thanks anyways
[09:30] <rogue780> cbgb: I'm installing it now
[09:30] <cbgb> rogue780, actually thats a good point, thx
[09:31] <calabaza> having lots of trouble with nvidia driver on Geforce4 420, any luck?
[09:31] <rogue780> cbgb: that's how I found out how to do it for fedora. I was originally building this computer to be a mythbox for my tv.
[09:31] <cbgb> rogue780, I think I'll j the mythtv channel
[09:31] <rogue780> cbgb: you should try reading /usr/share/doc/lirc/html/configure.html
[09:31] <ShadeT> Is there a way to have inetd log to a file?
[09:31] <rogue780> cbgb: good luck
[09:31] <GabrielVieira> hello there.. which is min hw configuration i need to install ubuntu? disc space?
[09:32] <cbgb> rogue780, thx again bfn
[09:32] <bimberi> GabrielVieira: at least 2GB for a desktop install, less for server/minimal
[09:32] <godmachine81> cbgb:: do you have a windows media center remote?
[09:32] <leafw> GabrielVieira : something like 400 Mb for a min server install.
[09:33] <ladydoor> GabrielVieira: you need at least a couple (pref. 3+) GB for your / partition, and then as much as you feel is appropriate for, say, /home, etc. you also need about 500MB for swap
[09:33] <cbgb> godmachine81, nope logitech harmony 885
[09:33] <GabrielVieira> hummm
[09:33] <jvolkman> nice remote
[09:33] <GabrielVieira> i have here a 2gb hd.. =(
[09:33] <GabrielVieira> :P
[09:33] <godmachine81> you should be able to find some config files for mythtv if thats what your using
[09:34] <leafw> GabrielVieira : if your PC is really oold and small, consider Damm Small Linux or OpenBSD
[09:34] <rogue780> GabrielVieira: not sure the minimum but I have an AMD sempron 1.6ghz, 1gig of ram, a geforce fx5200 128mb, and a 120gb hd and everything works super smooth
[09:34] <erUSUL> GabrielVieira: or puppy linux
[09:34] <opexoc> Can yout tell me what should I do if I want to write some data to the flash disk from user account? Default, I can not do this.
[09:34] <cbgb> godmachine81, as long as lircd is not running, no need for conf files :(
[09:34] <GabrielVieira> hehe
[09:34] <godmachine81> cbgb:: you need some rules though
[09:34] <ladydoor> opexoc: can you write to it as root (using sudo)?
[09:34] <godmachine81> cbgb:: for the program your trying to control with the remote
[09:34] <godmachine81> thats what i meant by config
[09:35] <cbgb> godmachine81, kdelirc is doing that for me (I guess)
[09:35] <GabrielVieira> thank u dudes
[09:35] <GabrielVieira> :)
[09:35] <opexoc> ladydoor: but I don't want using sudo... For example I want copy some files in my file manager...
[09:35] <godmachine81> cbgb:: is the remote working any at all?
[09:36] <ViennaLinux> where is sudo password stored?
[09:36] <calabaza> anyone has managed to install nvidia-glx on 6.10?
[09:36] <psusi> ViennaLinux: it is YOUR user password
[09:36] <cbgb> godmachine81, Its controlling everything but my laptop - but lircd is not running yet, so ...
[09:36] <psusi> opexoc: pastebin your /etc/fstab
[09:36] <roll> does somebody knows what's hapenning with #php channel ???
[09:36] <ladydoor> opexoc: right...i'm just wondering whether it's possible *period*. is it?
[09:37] <leafw> psusi , ViennaLinux : the sudo password is your admin account password (the default) unless a root user has been enabled.
[09:37] <caffiend> Can anyone tell me how well MSI MOBO's work with Linux?  I have a 865PE Neo2 Plat with a p4 2.6 an 1G ram..
[09:37] <godmachine81> cbgb:: what do you mean "everything"
[09:37] <opexoc> ladydoor: yes.
[09:37] <erUSUL> caffiend: it depends on the chipset
[09:37] <cbgb> godmachine81, tv, receiver, set top box and so on ...
[09:37] <psusi> caffiend: boot up the livecd and see for yourself
[09:38] <ladydoor> opexoc: ok, would you mind posting your /etc/fstab to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org ?
[09:38] <godmachine81> cbgb:: oh so its not working at all with your kernel
[09:38] <opexoc> ladydoor: yes... w8 a second.
[09:38] <cbgb> godmachine81, it is supposed to work with my laptop (inbuild IR)
[09:38] <godmachine81> cbgb:: you need to have lircd running.. and im not sure what you want it to do to the laptop.. but you have to provide rules to it just like multimedia keys on your laptop
[09:38] <zero742> does anyone know of an app to fix bad secotrs?
[09:39] <cbgb> godmachine81, exactly, dapper seems to be broken in that point
[09:39] <leafw> zero742 : fsck can label them at least.
[09:39] <caffiend> psusi:  I have and it seems to hang somewhat.  It gets 6% into the install and stops
[09:39] <godmachine81> cbgb:: afaik you have to edit the config files for lirc by hand.
[09:39] <zero742> leafw: do I just run that out of terminal?
[09:39] <rogue780> cbgb: before you can start the lirc daemon you have to have a lirc.conf and lircrc file created
[09:39] <opexoc> ladydoor: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30882/
[09:39] <cbgb> godmachine81, I know, but first the demon has to start, hasn't it?
[09:39] <psusi> caffiend: did you test the cd?
[09:40] <godmachine81> cbgb:: do you have /etc/init.d/lircd ?
[09:40] <caffiend> erUSUL: how do I determine the chipset? I think it is a Northwood if that makes sense
[09:40] <cbgb> rogue780, ah ok I see .. mom I give it a try
[09:40] <rogue780> cbgb: the lirc daemon won't start unless it's configured first.
[09:40] <cbgb> godmachine81, nope
[09:40] <leafw> zero742: reboot with proper flag to run fsck, or reboot into single user mode to do so. To label bad sectors in the root partition, you will need to boot from a CD.
[09:40] <ladydoor> opexoc: kk, do you know which is your device?
[09:40] <roll> can somebody tell me what's happening with #php ???
[09:40] <caffiend> psusi: I used the same DVD to install on 2 dell P3's and it had no errors
[09:40] <cbgb> rogue780, ok thx Ill try it
[09:40] <caffiend> It is 6.1 reliese
[09:40] <rogue780> can someone tell me the difference between the ubuntu dvd release and the cd release?
[09:40] <zero742> leafw: yeah they are in root I think...so if I boot from the live cd and then run fsck will that work ok?
[09:41] <opexoc> ladydoor: sorry... w8
[09:41] <plesnivec> hey there...i think my local lan between windows xp and ubuntu via samba server is too slow. I copy my dvd(7GB) through network 3MB/s is it ok??
[09:41] <godmachine81> cbgb:: im not sure with the name of the files for lircd b/c i havent used it in a few months.. but you have to edit the config files to run certain commands for each key press
[09:41] <leafw> zero742: when the drive is bad, there is no guarantee, but fsck does a nice job most of the times.
[09:41] <caffiend> are there any mobo manufactures that are linux friendly?
[09:41] <psusi> caffiend: when booting in this machine, have it do its disk test... might be the cdrom
[09:41] <ViennaLinux> psusi:so if i set up a root password --> how can i revert to ONLY sudo and no root pw?
[09:42] <opexoc> ladydoor: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30883/ look at this now...
[09:42] <leafw> caffiend : check debian's supported hardware list.
[09:42] <erUSUL> caffiend: well it seems a intel 865 doesn't it? you should not have any mayor problems. Also you can run 'lspci' and see all chips you have
[09:42] <tsoler> hi to all
[09:42] <psusi> ViennaLinux: clear the root pw
[09:42] <zero742> leafw: yeah I went most of the way through seagates rma service only to find that I have to pay them $25 for them to advance me the new hdd....and I don't havea spare laying around to use
[09:42] <rogue780> I reccomend ECS and MSI boards for linux
[09:42] <rogue780> never had a problem
[09:42] <ViennaLinux> psusi: command? file?
[09:42] <caffiend> ViennaLinuz: Thanks, I'll try that..
[09:42] <tsoler> does anybody has installed ubuntu as server?
[09:42] <psusi> ViennaLinux: passwd
[09:42] <zero742> leafw: so running fsck out of the live cd will work ok then?
[09:42] <Virtuall> tsoler, yes :)
[09:42] <Virtuall> i'd say many have
[09:43] <psusi> tsoler: many people... now ask your real question please
[09:43] <leafw> zero742: drives do go bad. But yes: boot from CD and run fsck on the harddrive partitions.
[09:43] <rogue780> anyone know when dapper will get firefox 2.0 support?
[09:43] <cbgb> godmachine81, thx for your help, I'll google for it - at least I know where to start now :-)
[09:43] <ViennaLinux> psusi: so i want passwd -d
[09:43] <ViennaLinux> psusi: thx a lot
[09:43] <sharperguy> anyone got a link for how to share folders on a windows network (samba)
[09:43] <leafw> read the 'man fsck' for details on labeling badn sectors
[09:43] <zero742> leafw:  Thanks.  I'll try that.
[09:43] <psusi> ViennaLinux: that disables the account iirc
[09:43] <rogue780> I had to install it a backassward way, but I'd rather have updated the current one
[09:43] <tsoler> what is the best for a beginner instalation dapper or edgy??
[09:43] <ladydoor> opexoc: kk, try adding ,user to the options column (the one with all the stuff in it) for the sda device, then adding yourself to the group users in /etc/group
[09:43] <psusi> ViennaLinux: you just want to enter an empty password
[09:43] <plesnivec> sharperguy w8
[09:43] <leafw> you're welcome.
[09:43] <rogue780> tsoler: dapper
[09:43] <ladydoor> opexoc: then you should be able to mount it as your user.
[09:43] <tsoler> why so rogue?
[09:44] <Virtuall> really, why so?
[09:44] <rogue780> tsoler: because it is less buggy, and it has more support
[09:44] <ViennaLinux> psusi: -d does the same :-) RTFM *g*
[09:44] <c0rt3z> what's a good program for reading and modifying microsoft access databases
[09:44] <Virtuall> rogue780, bud dapper sometimes doesn't install at all while edgy does
[09:44] <plesnivec> sharperguy http://www.hackorama.com/network/samba.shtml
[09:44] <ladydoor> opexoc: you may also need to add a ,uid=1000 to that column, but i'm not sure. and be sure to back it up first!
[09:44] <sharperguy> cheers
[09:44] <godmachine81> cbgb:: no prob
[09:45] <rogue780> Virtuall: I didn't have a problem installing dapper, but edgy I had lots of problems with media, and stability when it was trying to shut down
=== SeAofSleep is now known as SeAofSaRo
[09:45] <tsoler> the support is from canonical?
[09:45] <plesnivec> sharperguy..i should warn you..its just part of the story with ubuntu...
[09:45] <Virtuall> rogue780, you updated, right? ;) btw i din't have any problems ever
[09:45] <plesnivec> i did it after 2 days..shit
[09:45] <rogue780> tsoler: there are more howtos and articles written for it on the wiki, and in the documentation.
[09:46] <Virtuall> rogue780, dapper has serious problems with SATA RAIDS and newer MBs
[09:46] <sharperguy> I would prefer a link that actually deals with ubuntu
[09:46] <tsoler> iv eread that there is not gui for installing
[09:46] <Virtuall> BS :)
[09:46] <Crankymonky> rogue780, You still here?  I just got my dvd drive working
[09:46] <rogue780> Virtuall: I updated. I don't have a SATA drive for my linux box. I'm probably wrong about my suggestion, but it's just been my experience
[09:46] <opexoc> ladydoor: ok... wait...
[09:46] <rogue780> Crankymonky: I'm here
[09:46] <TehUni> Virtuall: i'm using sata on an intel975 w/ raid1.. no issues.
[09:46] <ladydoor> opexoc: no rush :-)
[09:46] <Crankymonky> I'm not getting 100% cpu usage
[09:46] <Virtuall> tsoler, there is a gui since 6.06
[09:46] <caffiend> what are some well supported MOBO manufacturers for linux?

[09:47] <psusi> Virtuall: dapper doesn't, but the dmraid package shipped with edgy was bugged.. update is attached to the bug report currently
[09:47] <rogue780> tsoler: Ubuntu has the easiest install gui I've ever used.

[09:47] <travkin> edgy work perfect
[09:47] <travkin> ;)
[09:47] <Virtuall> psusi, i didn't analize much. I have one thing: dapper didn't install on two machines, edgy did on both. fact.
[09:47] <tsoler> ok guys i will try it
[09:48] <psusi> Virtuall: with root on fakeraid?
[09:48] <travkin> use edgy
[09:48] <tsoler> I think its lamp ready , and tha solves almost eveything for me
[09:48] <rogue780> Crankymonky: thanks. not sure what my problem is then. might be something weird in the background, or it could be that I got arctic silver all over the pins on my processor and even after cleaning that it did something not so good.
[09:48] <Crankymonky> rogue780, my CPU usage goes up to around 65% when I change the location on the video

[09:50] <caffiend> One more Q, before I try installing..  I am interested in running virtual servers on my new install.  What is the best way to go about this?
[09:50] <ProN00b> ey, lol, wtf, why would you want to run that ?
[09:50] <rogue780> Crankymonky: cool cool, thanks
[09:50] <dusk> ey: if you have to ask, you shouldnt be using anything from packetstorm
[09:50] <Crankymonky> See what process is taking all your CPU
[09:50] <leafw> caffiend : ubuntuforums.org is your friend

[09:51] <Virtuall> psusi, i did not DO anything, i just inserted the live cd, and dapper didnt find a harddrive on machine a and didn't work at all on machine b. didn't have much time to investigate, so I might be wrong at all that it had something to do with RAID
[09:51] <moldy> hi
[09:51] <opexoc> ladydoor: but firstly... this entry in /etc/fstab was appeared when I plug flash disk to computer... so It means that when I plug out this disk the entry of sda will disappear ( I think so...) . Is it true? Moreover I don't know where I should write ,users exactly...
[09:51] <ey> pronoob i know what it does do
[09:52] <ey> leafw i know what does it do
[09:52] <dusk> knowing what something does, and knowing how to use it are two different things
[09:52] <ey> i just need to run it

[09:52] <dusk> i know what an M18 is, but I have no idea how to fly it
[09:52] <psusi> ey: take it elsewhere, it has nothing to do with ubuntu

[09:52] <Balaam> anyone have a favorite remote desktop solution that works well on Ubuntu?
[09:52] <leafw> ey: you trust someone else's description on what it does, and your own understanding of such explanation, which is different from what it may actually do.

[09:53] <Bade> Anyone got any knowledge about pcmcia cards and the freezing that happens durring boot???
[09:53] <Balaam> I'd prefer something with Linux , Mac and Windows clients
[09:53] <Crankymonky> vnc has all 3, Balaam
[09:53] <Balaam> My understanding is that vnc isn't very secure...
[09:53] <zcat[1] > vnc if you want the whole desktop, ssh -X if you just want to run an app or two on another box.
[09:53] <jwhitlark> Balaam: tightvnc just had a really good writeup in linux format, (won the shootout)
[09:53] <dusk> Bade: pcmcia was written by idiots
[09:53] <Crankymonky> ssh should also
[09:53] <leafw> Balaam : remote desktop? Just ssh -X username@yourmachineip and run nautilus...

[09:53] <Crankymonky> I thought

[09:54] <msid> playing videos with totem seems to be losing frames and it is kind of annoying. using mplayer with win32codecs the picture goes smooth. any solution to this problem ?
[09:54] <Balaam> Okay.. slightly off topic then.. but how does one create a secure tunnel with Putty?
[09:54] <rogue780> Crankymonky: well now, it's only hitting 20% max while streaming audio. I'm guessing it was just an isolated event
[09:54] <jwhitlark> Fatsobob: what's the problem?
[09:54] <dusk> msid: use mplayer
[09:54] <leafw> Balaam : openvpn will hive you secure tunneling, free off the box.
[09:54] <Crankymonky> rogue780, okay, also maybe try a different player if it happens again
[09:54] <zcat[1] > msid: check totem's settings, it might be using xv instead of sdl or gl for video ?
[09:54] <ey> pronoob this protects my irc channel and it can get me me auto op .so i dont have to cry to people to say "op me!!"
[09:55] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, well I got everything working and running with xgl, except the top bar is missing from every window

[09:55] <jwhitlark> Balaam: openvpn is a really nice setup, and easy to use.
[09:55] <Balaam> I'll have to look into that
[09:55] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, I have a screenshot to show what I mean
[09:55] <psusi> ladydoor: you do not need to add an entry to fstab... if there is no entry found in fstab, gnome-volume-manager automaticailly mounts it in /media with the correct uid option for the current user

[09:55] <Crankymonky> rogue780, I've never used realplayer, so can't help ya there, try doing it again with realplayer, see if you can replicate the problem

[09:55] <rogue780> Adios everyone
[09:55] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, because I have had this problem on multiple distros as well
[09:55] <ladydoor> psusi: this person is not having it mounted as his/her/hir/etc. user. that's the problem

[09:56] <msid> zcat[1] : where exactly do you configure the driver for totem ?

[09:57] <Balaam> caffiend: Actually no.. it should be disposed of.. You can send it to me.
[09:57] <zcat[1] > sun_: I usually just set up a cron job.. I think it can run as a daemon though. I guess put that in an /etc/init.d/fetchmail script and link from /etc/rc2.d/

[09:57] <ladydoor> sun_: you could start fetchmail when you start your window manager
[09:57] <jwhitlark> Fatsobob: It can help to switch to gnome through Beryl Manager, until you select a theme.
[09:57] <Jimbo53> if i format my second drive to ext3 will the windows ntfs machines on the network be able to read it?
[09:57] <ladydoor> sun_: most have an option to start a program when they start.

[09:58] <Akuma_> how can i rebind keys? is there an X conf file somewhere for that?
[09:58] <angryfirelord> al00: Sounds like a video driver issue to me. What is happening is Ubuntu is trying to load an ati driver, but they never really work. I don't know if this is possible, but try running a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg at the prompt and select vesa.
[09:58] <bruenig> Jimbo53, http://fs-driver.org/
[09:58] <ladydoor> Akuma_: check out xbindkeys. very useful
[09:58] <zim_> ladydoor good secret.
[09:58] <Jimbo53> bruenig...how bout if i make it fat32?
[09:58] <zim_> :)
[09:58] <Akuma_> ladydoor: thank you
[09:58] <ladydoor> zim_: isn't it, though?
[09:58] <psusi> ladydoor: it starts automatically on a default install
[09:58] <ladydoor> Akuma_: np
[09:58] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, I have restarted multiple times
[09:58] <bruenig> Jimbo53, yes fat32 would be able to be read by windows without drivers

[09:58] <gnomefreak> [g2] : mac uses its own bootloader (yaboot)
[09:58] <psusi> ey: no, it does something completely different from what you think and unrelated
[09:59] <jwhitlark> Fatsobob: hmmmm.  brb
[09:59] <ey> tell me then what does it do?
[09:59] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, despite the fact that I have a theme selected, the thing does not load

[09:59] <ey> cause i knwo waht it does do
[09:59] <Jimbo53> Bruenig: does fat32 work well with linux?
[09:59] <bruenig> Akuma_, make sure you get xbindkeys-config along with xbindkeys so as to allow a simple graphical way to set up your keybindings
[09:59] <ey> pronoob this protects my irc channel and it can get me me auto op .so i dont have to cry to people to say "op me!!"
[09:59] <leafw> [g2]  : use grub, not lilo, in the new intel macs. Plus be careful with bootcamp installs
[10:00] <bruenig> Jimbo53, works well, if you are just going to use it to store documents or other files, it should be fine
[10:00] <jwhitlark> Fatsobob: umm. I don't know.
[10:00] <[g2] > leafw I've seen some info about the A20 patch needed for grub to work
[10:00] <leafw> [g2]  : there are some threads on the ubuntuforums.org on intel macs running ubuntu
[10:00] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, want to see that screenshot now?
[10:00] <Jimbo53> k
[10:00] <DarkMageZ> baxter_kylie, possibly /etc/modules ?
[10:00] <angryfirelord> Linux can write to fat32 partitions. However, don't use it as your root partition.
[10:00] <opexoc> ladydoor: Unfortunately, I have tried if I plug out the flash disk, then this entry of /etc/fstab will disappear. I was right. It has disappeared.
[10:00] <zim_> any way my Q is this is there a launchpad for 7.04/ubuntu+1/Feisty Fawn
[10:00] <baxter_kylie> DarkMageZ: no dice. I'm looking for some alsa settings.

[10:02] <Jimbo53> i have been having problems accessing the second drive...i tried formating to ext3 rieserts, and fat32 but cannot write to it, and cant seem to mount it so it shows up in tree under "computer" so maybe just try re installing clean?
[10:02] <psusi> opexoc: what?  /etc/fstab should not change unles you edit it
=== rampAge is now known as rg
[10:02] <jwhitlark> Fatsobob: hmm.
[10:02] <bruenig> Jimbo53, you may need root priveleges to write to it
[10:02] <zim_> is there a deb repository for ifolder
[10:02] <ladydoor> opexoc: *sigh*...that's what's so annoying about gnome-volume-manager. i'm sorry, i don't know how to fix it in that case.
[10:02] <angryfirelord> make sure that it's in your /etc/fstab file first
[10:02] <jwhitlark> Fatsobob: quinn is here at the conference, I'll see if I can find him after lunch to take a look, k?
[10:02] <Jimbo53> how do i get root priveleges...bruenig
[10:02] <caffiend> My p3 is just an extra..  Maybe try some new programs out, firewall, snort, maybe a music server
[10:03] <ladydoor> sudo | Jimbo53
[10:03] <Fatsobob> jwhitlark, alright Thanks
[10:03] <psusi> ladydoor: g-v-m does not edit /etc/fstab
[10:03] <opexoc> ladydoor: ok... thx...
[10:03] <ladydoor> !sudo | Jimbo53
[10:03] <ubotu> Jimbo53: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:03] <ladydoor> psusi: whatever's automounting it, then...
[10:03] <zcat[1] > Jimbo53: chmod a+rwx the mountpoint, then mount it, then chmod a+rwx the filesystem.. or make a directory owned by a non-root user, perhaps? and make sure it's in /etc/fstab
[10:03] <zim_> if anyone has not seen ifolder have a look here http://www.ifolder.com/index.php/Main_Page WOW!!!
[10:03] <psusi> ladydoor: it runs pmount, which runs mount if the entry is in /etc/fstab, if not, it auto mounts it itself with the correct options for the desktop user to acces it
[10:03] <opexoc> psusi: when I plug in flash disk then the entry of /etc/fstab is changed.
[10:04] <Jimbo53> so use sudo | usename
[10:04] <raymond> regarding no sound, I had to open the mixure and unmute everthing
[10:04] <ladydoor> psusi: well...see...this person on here is having theirs mounted as belonging to root
[10:04] <ladydoor> psusi: so it's not automounting with the correct options for the desktop user to access it
[10:04] <bruenig> Jimbo53, no she was trying to fire off that factoid that linked you to the wiki Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[10:04] <Jimbo53> zcat..this is my first day with linux
[10:04] <ladydoor> psusi: i'm sure that in normal operation, that's how it works, however.
[10:04] <psusi> opexoc: you are running a stock ubuntu system right?
[10:05] <baxter_kylie> raymond: Not so easy here. It's an nvidia mcp51 ... there are /no/ sliders in mixer available.
[10:05] <bruenig> Jimbo53, generally, you just use sudo before your commands, so if you wanted to move something into the new drive, you would do sudo mv /path/to/whatever /path/to/newdrive/whatever
[10:05] <zcat[1] > How can I get the ubuntu 6.06 bootdisk to recognise raid on a Compaq DL380 ? I believe cpqarray conflicts with the symbios driver which is loaded first. Is there something I can tell it at bootup so it won't load that module?
[10:06] <Jimbo53> k
[10:06] <opexoc> psusi: no... mandriva now... I was thinking that the scheme is the same as in ubuntu... I usually use ubuntu dapper so I enter there.
[10:06] <Jimbo53> so theres no drag and drop to different location like windows?
[10:06] <raymond> The  mute thing was a common fix for a lot peoples sound problems. Sorry not for you.
[10:07] <psusi> opexoc: no... in ubuntu g-v-m runs pmount, so nothing ever touches /etc/fstab, as it should be... /etc/fstab is for YOU to tell the system how you want things to be... not for the system to decide how it wants things to be

[10:09] <psusi> opexoc: nope
[10:09] <jbroome> opexoc: nope.
[10:09] <opexoc> psusi: ok thx...
=== denki is now known as g0d
[10:10] <jbroome> try #mand{rake|riva}
[10:10] <prest1> new to the linux and ubuntu thing, ive got a few questions, an i at the right place
=== g0d is now known as denki
[10:10] <leafw> just ask, if someone can answer, he/she will.
[10:11] <prest1> ok
[10:11] <prest1> wasnt certian of the protocal
[10:11] <opexoc> jbroome: I know... my present there is a result of using ubuntu everyday and talking with people on this channel.
[10:11] <prest1> mispell sorry
[10:11] <Chief> Does somebody know if there is a debian package for SAX2?
[10:11] <leafw> no problem
[10:11] <psusi> please don't query if it would possibly be ok for you to consider maybe asking a question... just ask the question ;)
[10:11] <Intangir> how do i set up X Forwarding to use a port UNDER 6000
[10:11] <leafw> !anyone
[10:11] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:11] <Intangir> like i wasnt to use 5999 or something, instead of 6000
[10:12] <Intangir> cause our firewall seems to have some sort of hardcoded block of 6000+
[10:12] <psusi> Intangir: it wraps back around above port 65535, so give it a really big number
[10:12] <Intangir> lol
[10:13] <leafw> Intangir : man ssh , -D [bind_address:] port
[10:13] <psusi> Intangir: and yea... you should not be directly forwarding X sessions unencrypted through the firewall and over the public Internet
[10:14] <prest1> ok, im sampling live cd's ubuntu, mepis, knoppix, and im new to linux. ubuntu seems the easiest to learn am i right in assuming that now or will i get to a point where its not
[10:14] <zcat[1] > Intangir: tunnel it through ssh, then the firewall won't even see it..
[10:14] <bruenig> Intangir, you may clog the tubes
[10:14] <joshmo23> Ubuntu freezes everytime I try to install. I have tried using different versions, different pieces of hardware, about everything I can think of but it won't install. Other oses will install though including freebsd and windows. Any ideas?
[10:14] <keeb> What part is it freezing at?
[10:14] <psusi> prest1: that is a very subjective topic
[10:14] <leafw> prest1 : ubuntu is easy, but to each it's own. What ubuntu has is a pretty community that helps, see ubuntuforums.org
[10:15] <caffiend> joshmo23: I have a similar problem.  what error messages do you get when installing ubuntu or what % completion?
[10:15] <joshmo23> Once it 's booted into the livecd, it will freeze at any random time, usually pretty soon after its booted though
[10:15] <zcat[1] > you think you have problems.. 6.06 install cd won't recognise my raid array.. compaq dl380 :( and nobody has an answer :(
[10:15] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: try the alternative cd
[10:15] <leafw> joshmo23 : please report your hardware specs to the launchpad bug tracker, it will help
[10:15] <Intangir> i cant tunnel it over SSH, im shelling thru 'revsh' and it blows any forwarding
[10:15] <gnomefreak> alternate*
[10:15] <joshmo23> sometimes I don't even have time to double click installm it will already be frozen
[10:16] <Intangir> plus the shelling goes thru a slower host which cannot handle X traffic
[10:16] <prest1> part of why i like ubuntu is community size and the amount of help documentation
[10:16] <joshmo23> I just finished installing the alternate cd, check for cd defects etc but it still freezes after I log in
[10:16] <leafw> joshmo23 : when bootin the CD, there are several options. Have you tried the so-called "failsafe" ?
[10:16] <joshmo23> yes
[10:16] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: it installs than freezes?
[10:16] <caffiend> joshmo23: what MOBO do you have?
[10:17] <joshmo23> like I said, sometimes I don't even have time to double click install before it freezes
[10:17] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: what amount of ram is installed?
[10:17] <piggyg1> My intel proset wireless adapter is only picked up as a Ethernet card, how do I update my driver/
[10:17] <crsMooney> evening all
[10:17] <joshmo23> chaintech vnf3-250
[10:17] <joshmo23> and 1gb ram
[10:17] <raymond> copy a large file into my root directory I maxed the disk, now I get a disk full error regardless of what i delete
[10:17] <crsMooney> I'm having a bit of trouble with my edgy machine, the x server seems to have broke itself and i have no clue on how to get it going again
[10:18] <bruenig> !xconfig
[10:18] <ubotu> To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[10:18] <leafw> crsMooney : that, read ubotu's blurp
[10:18] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: and the alternate cd installs fine?
[10:18] <prest1> couple other questions i have is from the live cd i cant seem to see files from my hard drive is that normal and also i have a ati 9600xt will that pose a problem
[10:18] <psusi> raymond: how much space did you free up?
[10:18] <bruenig> prest1, have you mounted your hard drive? It is not mounted in the live cd unless you do it yourself
[10:19] <crsMooney> thank you, i'll give it a try
[10:19] <joshmo23> the alternate cd will isntall fine, but once it's installed I go to login and after it's done logging it it will freeze, but it won't always freeze at the same time
[10:19] <joshmo23> it won't freeze at the login screen though if that helps
[10:19] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: is all your memory good? and being used?
[10:19] <warkruid> joshmo23: burned the cd's yourself?
[10:19] <prest1> its a live cd the files im wanting to see are media files ect
[10:20] <joshmo23> I swaped the ram out but I'll check it again
[10:20] <joshmo23> and yes i burned the cds myself
[10:20] <raymond> I cant seem to free any, I asume the remain of the uncopied file is the, using du and adding it up the disk is not full
[10:20] <prest1> like mp3's ect
[10:20] <joshmo23> but I md5'd then checked inside ubuntu
[10:20] <leafw> joshmo23 : be sure to md5 the CD
[10:20] <joshmo23> all god
[10:20] <psusi> joshmo23: run the cd test and mem test options from the boot cd
[10:20] <joshmo23> good*
[10:20] <leafw> ok
[10:20] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: livecd runs in ram. same with system. the alternate cd doesnt use ram to run. thats whats making me think you have a  bad stick or something
[10:20] <Marcca> hi, i have a problem with booting the ubuntu 5.10 live-cd
[10:20] <bruenig> prest1, what I am telling you is that your hard drive is not mounted, therefore you cannot see your files, if you want to see your files you need to mount it. Your question was whether not being able to see the files in the live cd was normal, and the answer is yes because the live cd doesn't mount the hard drive
[10:20] <crsMooney> ubotu: that doesnt seem to have worked as I already have it installed to the latest version
[10:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about that doesnt seem to have worked as I already have it installed to the latest version - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:20] <psusi> gnomefreak: of course it uses ram... just not as much ;)
[10:20] <joshmo23> well I'll check it agian, how many passes should I let it go?
[10:21] <bruenig> !bot
[10:21] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl  -  Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[10:21] <gnomefreak> psusi: it doesnt run in ram though
[10:21] <warkruid> joshmo23: had a similar problem. Turned out i burned the cd's at too high a speed.  install froze at different points.
[10:21] <gnomefreak> livecd thats all it uses
[10:21] <joshmo23> hmm
[10:21] <psusi> gnomefreak: depends on your point of view.... everything is run in ram technically... the files have to be loaded into ram from the disk to run
[10:21] <Marcca> im trying to start live-cd from MSDOS, is that possible?
[10:21] <bruenig> crsMooney, did you try that command or are you just saying that you don't think it would work?
[10:21] <joshmo23> and your cd's still md5sum'd ok?
[10:22] <bruenig> crsMooney, as that command does not download the latest version, it just reconfigures the version you have
[10:22] <leafw> Marcca : I've never heard of so.
[10:22] <psusi> Marcca: what?  you BOOT from the livecd
[10:22] <gnomefreak> Marcca: just boot the livecd. change your boot options to boot from cd than stick livecd in and boot
[10:22] <jeeves_Moss> all:  does any one know of a QT player for Ubunut?
[10:22] <leafw> Marcca : if you can't boot from the CD, then a floppy may do
[10:22] <leafw> !mp3

[10:23] <jeeves_Moss> gnomefreek:  I was looking for something that'd play the QT streams form a website.
[10:23] <Marcca> i have an external cd-drive and floppydrive, and have a floppy that allows me to acces cd-drive trough MSDOS
[10:23] <bruenig> prest1, not sure, you probably will have to get some drivers and such, might want to check out ubotu's next comment
[10:23] <bruenig> !ati
[10:23] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:23] <gnomefreak> jeeves_Moss: read the link ubotu posted
[10:23] <Marcca> i can't make my pc to boot straight from cddrive
[10:23] <cheater_> My sound isn't working in my movies. It does work in my music. Could someone help me out
[10:24] <bakert> cheater_, you need to install the appropriate codec
[10:24] <psusi> Marcca: is this a really old laptop or something?
[10:24] <prest1> will do and thanks again
[10:24] <Marcca> yes
[10:24] <bakert> cheater_, different sound and video encodings require different codecs
[10:24] <beavis> is there a gnome-frontend for xsane?
[10:24] <psusi> Marcca: I think you are SOL then
[10:24] <bruenig> cheater_, do you have w32codecs?
[10:24] <Marcca> SOL?
[10:24] <cheater_> I have the right codec. It has played before. It just stopped working
[10:24] <psusi> Sh*t Out of Luck
[10:24] <Marcca> :D
[10:24] <bakert> cheater_, oh, perhaps try a different video player?
[10:24] <bruenig> cheater_, the same movie or the same filetype?
[10:24] <joshmo23> btw, sometimes it freezes with artifacts
[10:25] <cheater_> same filetype and movie
[10:25] <bakert> cheater_, what happens in totem, or mplayer?
[10:25] <cheater_> could you reccomend a player other than totem that can play mp4
[10:25] <bruenig> vlc
[10:25] <cheater_> totem plays it fine, but no audio
[10:25] <leafw> cheater_ : try vlc
[10:25] <TGPO> cheater xine
[10:25] <Marcca> is there a floppy version of ubuntu?
[10:25] <psusi> Marcca: nope
[10:25] <Marcca> right
[10:25] <bakert> cheater_, yeah vlc is good
[10:25] <warkruid> cheater_: mplayer
[10:25] <cheater_> k, i'll try them out and get back to you later
[10:25] <bruenig> cheater_, yeah have you installed totem-xine or are you with the totem-gstreamer?
[10:26] <Marcca> could you recommend any other OS that should work on my pc?
[10:26] <Marcca> something that comes on floppys
[10:26] <psusi> Marcca: theoretically you can use another machine to compile a custom kernel with the required drivers ( if they even exist ) and make a boot floppy... but that's a good deal of work
[10:26] <bakert> Marcca, you could try Damn Small Linux?
[10:26] <psusi> slackware maybe?
[10:27] <TGPO> Marcaa www.linux.org they have floppy distro's listed there
[10:27] <rogue780> Marcca, I know slackware has a 100mb zipslack edition
[10:27] <gnomefreak> whats wrong with net install ubuntu
[10:27] <rogue780> dsl might have a floppy edition
[10:27] <joshmo23> so if my ram comes back with any errors than it's bad?
[10:27] <gnomefreak> or mounting iso install method
[10:27] <psusi> gnomefreak: he can't boot from cd
[10:27] <lmosher> I have a core duo laptop, I just installed edgy... what do I need to do to configure the dual core and also set it to 686?
[10:27] <psusi> lmosher: nothing
[10:27] <TGPO> lmosher do uname -a
[10:27] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: normally yes
[10:27] <joshmo23> ok
[10:28] <gnomefreak> !install | Marcca
[10:28] <ubotu> Marcca: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[10:28] <TGPO> lmosher if you see SMP listed there your already rigged for dual core
[10:28] <niles> hi
[10:28] <gnomefreak> joshmo23: bad ram?
[10:28] <niles> can zombies be found via ps -el;  under the stat column as Z ?
[10:28] <noelferreira> anyone knows how to get flash working with edgy amd64?

[10:28] <psusi> noelferreira: you have to install the 32 bit firefox in a 32 bit chroot
[10:28] <lmosher> TGPO, I don't :/
[10:29] <psusi> noo_name: could you be more specific?
[10:29] <noelferreira> only way psusi'
[10:29] <noelferreira> ?
[10:29] <CarlFK> how can I apt-get debian's mplayer 1.0rc1 ?
[10:29] <TGPO> lmosher let me check something brb
[10:29] <leafw> Marcca : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot
[10:29] <psusi> noelferreira: yes
[10:29] <noelferreira> :)
[10:29] <gnomefreak> noelferreira: you can use gplflash but it has its times where it just doesnt want to work
[10:30] <noo_name> psusi, I want to install ubuntu amd64 on a raid0 sata2 with ich8r controller ?
[10:30] <lmosher> TGPO, /proc/acpi/processor also confirms only CPU0. In my previous 686 kernel under dapper I had CPU0 and CPU1.
[10:30] <noelferreira> how many times in 10 gnomefreak?
[10:30] <noelferreira> :)
[10:30] <rogue780> is there a deb packet for firefox 2.0 that will update dapper's 1.5?
=== Spec is now known as Spec[escape] 
[10:30] <gnomefreak> noelferreira: i have only heard horror stories about it.
[10:30] <caffiend> When running the CD/DVD check I get this message:   hdd: drive not ready for command,  irq169: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option),  Handlers......
[10:30] <noelferreira> ok
[10:30] <hou5ton> Any ideas why my volume just up and quit working on this laptop running Edgy ... between when I shut it down yesterday and booted it back up this morning?
[10:30] <gnomefreak> rogue780: not likely will 2.0 be officially backported
[10:31] <TGPO> lmosher right, for some reason it didnt set up right
[10:31] <psusi> noo_name: ok.. .that's a fake raid controller... see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto
[10:31] <rogue780> gnomefreak, that's sad. I thought dapper was supposed to have long term support, and I figured that meant updated packaged
[10:31] <rogue780> packages
[10:31] <gnomefreak> rogue780: see /msg ubotu firefox   and install it from tar. takes all of 3 minutes
[10:31] <gnomefreak> rogue780: ff2 not being in dapper is a good thing
[10:31] <noo_name> psusi, ok I'm checking it
[10:32] <psusi> rogue780: stable release means only the most critical bug fixes and security fixes are updated
[10:32] <rogue780> ah
[10:32] <TGPO> lmosher, you know how to do your own kernel compile?
[10:32] <CarlFK> rogue780: support = secure and stable, not new features
[10:32] <rogue780> I almost miss windows for that reason.
[10:33] <rogue780> how about adding better javascript support to firefox 1.5?
[10:33] <psusi> rogue780: though if you want, you can enable the -backports repository... sometimes new version of popular apps are backported
[10:33] <psusi> rogue780: or you can just upgrade to edgy
[10:33] <rogue780> I'm taking online classes through the university of maryland, and their online system requires javascript 1.5 or higher
[10:33] <noelferreira> can you give me a howto without flahs in it psusi?
[10:33] <bilss_> hi
[10:33] <lmosher> TGPO, Yes but I don't need to. Last time when I was able to configure it with apt. Just didn't remember what I needed to do.
[10:33] <rogue780> I had edgy, but there were issues with my printer and with video playback
[10:34] <salome> so install 1.5 or higher.
[10:34] <psusi> noelferreira: what?
[10:34] <rogue780> salome: I don't know how
[10:34] <noelferreira> i need a howto for install firefox 32 bits in amd64 without flash psusi
[10:34] <TGPO> lmosher I'd google for that then, I'v always built my kernel from scratch right after an install
[10:34] <bilss_> anyone can explain the comtents of  my /etc/inetd.conf file please i can pastebin it
[10:34] <apple-gunkies> hmm, trying to upgrade from dapper, 'gksu "update-manager -c"' just says no updates available
[10:34] <noo_name> psusi, just a question, I use ubuntu 6.10 and will it let me install dmraid ?
[10:35] <gnomefreak> apple-gunkies: click check
[10:35] <psusi> noelferreira: WITHOUT flash?  that's kind of the whole reason for installing the 32 bit ff is to get flash
[10:35] <rogue780> and also, any good howto's on installing flash on a 64bit system?
[10:35] <zerosmoke> anybody here run continuum-wine?
[10:35] <gnomefreak> apple-gunkies: when its done you should see new disto at top
[10:35] <noelferreira> ya but know i can't see pages with flash
[10:35] <gnomefreak> rogue780: 32bit chroot is only "working" way
[10:35] <noelferreira> so i need a howto without flash
[10:35] <apple-gunkies> oops, thanks, I feeel dumb
[10:35] <noelferreira> to install

[10:36] <salome> 1.4 is included with edgy, blackdown dist.

[10:38] <gnomefreak> PPAAUULL: we havent changed the name of the channel yet
[10:38] <user-land> was there a security update to firefox this week, after US-CERT published the vulnerabilities ?
[10:39] <Renan_s2> !checkinstall
[10:39] <ubotu> checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[10:39] <coz_> Acc\Deny, youare using alternative cd and default install
[10:39] <coz_> Acc\Deny, the drive was partigitoned ahead of time then windows installed is that it
[10:39] <coz_> Acc\Deny, patitioned
[10:39] <Acc\Deny> Well I Started the installation in text mode as I have the intel 845 and it is known to be problematic with linux...
[10:39] <gbutler69> Anyone know if Gnome 2.16.2 will be in Edgy as soon as it comes out?
[10:40] <Acc\Deny> Everything goes well...
[10:40] <msid> anybody experiencing frames dropping with totem during playback ? any solution ?
[10:40] <coz_> Acc\Deny, yes, ok....
[10:40] <VR_> how do i unrar an archive with a password?
[10:40] <psusi> gbutler69: no, edgy has been released
[10:40] <clop> hi, is there a way to tell what programs are using a kernel module?  i want to rmmod one but it says it's in use
[10:40] <gnomefreak> gbutler69: nope
[10:40] <psusi> VR_: by supplying the password?
[10:40] <enkidu> How to cut the borders of a SVG image ?
[10:40] <cappe___> hey peeps!! How do I mount a BSD-partition (ufs) ??
[10:40] <VR_> psusi: yes, but how
[10:40] <coz_> enkidu, install either inkscape or sodipodi
[10:40] <Acc\Deny> ...till ubuntu is almost done copying some 747 files... after that monitor blinks and the text menu/msg boxes are gone...
[10:40] <gbutler69> So, they won't release bug-fix releases of Gnome to Edgy?????
[10:41] <leafw> VR_ : 'man unrar'
[10:41] <VR_> archive manager won't let me input a password anywhere. (i have the rar package installed)
[10:41] <Acc\Deny> i press enter 2/3 times.... (hoping to press on the defaults)... and the system reboots with grub menu...
[10:41] <Acc\Deny> what i was hoping was that i would be prompted somewhere to be able to configure grub....
[10:41] <cappe___> Anyone knows how to mount a BSD-partition (/dev/hda1) ??
[10:42] <bakert> cappe___, depends on the filesystem on the partition
[10:42] <Acc\Deny> I am new to ubuntu but not to linux!
[10:42] <bakert> cappe___, you need "mount"
[10:42] <leafw> cappe___ : ufs2 is the type of fs you want
[10:42] <gbutler69> Reason I ask is that a "Lockdown" bug for Epiphany I reported has been fixed in CVS and back-ported to "Stable". It should be in the 2.16.2 release of gnome....
[10:42] <coz_> Acc\Deny, ok well My first inclination would be to try the install again, maybe twice, if that didn't work I would download the cd again...just in case... while googling... I apoligize for taking up your time this way, but unfortunately I tend to beone that needs to see the problem in situations  like this, but... someone else here may have a clue as to the problem from experience
[10:42] <|rt|> does linux support rw on ufs?
[10:42] <|rt|> last time I looked it only supported ufs read
[10:42] <leafw> |rt|: no
=== LagChick is now known as SportChick
[10:43] <leafw> |rt| : there is experimental rw, but use at your own risk (and it's not enabled by default_
[10:43] <Acc\Deny> coz_: u mean u can't help?
[10:43] <slick_nick> clop: fuser?
[10:43] <|rt|> leafw: i don't run any bsd systems here but i did once try to rescue a dying bsd disk but didn't have much luck due to the damage on the disk
[10:44] <leafw> |rt|: I rescued two ufs2 partitions with spinrite, it took 4 days but very much worth it.
[10:45] <leafw> |rt| : many files were left unreadable, but a good many were fine.
[10:45] <Martyo> how do I get the flash 9 beta working with edgy amd64?
[10:46] <coz_> Acc\Deny, no I don't think so but try another install just incasem while asking here more
[10:46] <Fletcheri> Do I need to add all int. hdds to fstab so as i don't need to mount them every time i reset linux?
[10:46] <psusi> Fletcheri: yes
[10:47] <Acc\Deny> Anyone who has an intel 845 board? :)
[10:47] <Fletcheri> Can anyone help me do so? =P
[10:47] <leafw> Fletcheri : man fstab
[10:47] <Fletcheri> kthanks
[10:48] <Fletcheri> whats the command to edit fstab?
[10:49] <TGPO> Fletcheri, your favorite text editor
[10:49] <leafw> Fletcheri : just open it in a text editor
[10:49] <Fletcheri> okay
[10:49] <rexsum> \o/ ed
[10:50] <leafw> since it requires root permissions, you ca use gksu gnome-text-editor /etc/fstab
[10:50] <sc0tt> is it possible for two programs to read from a single /dev/video device at once? :>
[10:50] <Fletcheri> whats the command to open it from terminal (using root)
[10:50] <leafw> Fletcheri :
[10:50] <leafw> since it requires root permissions, you ca use gksu gnome-text-editor /etc/fstab
[10:51] <TGPO> Fletcheri, sudo nano /etc/fstab

[11:06] <compilerwriter> So when apt-get gets done I will have kubuntu as well as ubuntu?
[11:06] <higi> how can i change the windows partition from extended to primary=?
[11:06] <apokryphos> Fletcheri: have you read the FAQ first?
[11:06] <TGPO> Fletcheri, are you running Edgy?
[11:06] <apokryphos> compilerwriter: precisely
[11:06] <Fletcheri> Im running dapper
[11:06] <Batmanuel> ubuntu: necesito la linea para montar el filesystem... parece que la configure mal y ahora no funciona
[11:07] <Fletcheri> i've read the man pages, and had a little help before, but im still not sure
[11:07] <apokryphos> Guys, no Spanish in here. English only.
[11:07] <caffiend> Can NTFS drives be mounted with 6.10?  I know it isn't the best but I need to copy data
[11:07] <apokryphos> for Spanish feel free to talk in #ubuntu-es
[11:07] <psusi> higi: by using fdisk and being VERY careful
[11:07] <ubuntu> ok ok
[11:07] <ubuntu> i understand
[11:07] <ubuntu> sorry
[11:07] <ubuntu> xD
[11:07] <apokryphos> caffiend: of course, you just can't write to them
[11:07] <Batmanuel> apokryphos: give us a sec here
[11:07] <apokryphos> Batmanuel: go to #ubuntu-es for it
[11:07] <bakert> caffiend, yes

[11:08] <geno_> How do I MANUALLY update to Edgy Eft?
[11:08] <compilerwriter> now apokryphos I will need some advice on email.  I guess the kde thing has its own mail program.  Will I have to have it leave the mail on the server so that I can get it all into evolution on gnome until I decide which one to stick with?
[11:08] <ubuntu> geno
[11:08] <apokryphos> geno_: check the link in the topic
[11:08] <ubuntu> manually....it depends
[11:08] <ubuntu> see this:
[11:08] <caffiend> what is an estimate time for the integrity check on the 6.10 DVD?
[11:08] <geno_> I tried the GUI thingy but it gives me an error
[11:08] <compilerwriter> Or is there some slick and dirty way to get the one to import mail from the other?
[11:08] <psusi> edit /etc/apt/sources.lst and change dapper to edgy, then sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:09] <TGPO> apok, dont you think RTFM as a stock answer isnt what peopple are looking for
[11:09] <j-swim> hey folks, i installed kubuntu-desktop and all it's deps on ubuntu, and would like to now remove kubuntu-desktop and everything that came with it, is there a way I can select all of those deps at once?
[11:09] <superkirbyartist> "/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip failed" error when printing.
[11:09] <apokryphos> geno_: it's really best to read the FAQ first (which you'd find in the channel topic, which you should read on entering a channel ::))
[11:09] <Fletcheri> What i need to know are 1]  How to mount NTFS drives with permissions and 2]  How to add these drives to Fstab so i don't have to mount them on every boot
[11:09] <apokryphos> j-swim: if you installed with aptitude yes, if not -- no. But you could remove some vital qt or kde lib which will take the vast majority of the stuff with it
[11:09] <superkirbyartist> "/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip failed" error when printing.
[11:10] <psusi> compilerwriter: most mail programs store mail in the standard mbox format... usually moving it between them is as simple as compacting it, exiting the original program, and copying the file to the new one's directory
[11:10] <apokryphos> Fletcheri: please read the FAQ. You can't really expect others to help you if you don't want to help yourself :)
[11:10] <higi> is it possible to take windows out of an extended partition???
[11:10] <j-swim> apokryphos: just with synaptic gui...
[11:10] <jimb1> stuck again
[11:10] <psusi> higyes... I said by using fdisk VERY CAREFULLY
[11:10] <apokryphos> j-swim: then you're going to have to go for the latter method
[11:10] <higi> ah! you are my salvation!
[11:10] <jimb1> still having trouble with the second (slave) hard drive
[11:10] <TGPO> geno_, edit your /etc/apt/sources list anywhere you see dapper change it to edgy
[11:10] <higi> sorry i didnt read it
[11:10] <jimb1> cant see it
[11:10] <Fletcheri> apokryphos, point me in the direction of where the faq is, and what part to read, im a total begginer here
[11:10] <jimb1> cant mount it
[11:11] <psusi> higi: though I'm not sure how the hell it got switched to extended in the first place... that is fubar
[11:11] <Batmanuel> apokryphos: you know how annoying it is to hear the same questions every day? Well, it sucks just as bad to hear the same answer. Everyone knows about the FAQ.
[11:11] <geno_> TGPO: That's what I thought, will it work 100%?
[11:11] <j-swim> ah ok, apokryphos out of curiosity what could i have done if i had used aptitude?
[11:11] <compilerwriter> psusi I have been using evolution will that do that for me?
[11:11] <TGPO> geno_, then apt-get update and then apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:11] <jimb1> whats the command to try and mount that slave hard drive?
[11:11] <higi> psusi do you know what do i have to type
[11:11] <superkirbyartist> "/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip failed" error when printing.
[11:11] <apokryphos> Fletcheri: check the channel topic
[11:11] <geno_> TGPO: Thanks!
[11:11] <higi> i dont know either
[11:11] <apokryphos> Batmanuel: read my last post. Obviously they don't.
[11:11] <TGPO> geno_, np
[11:11] <psusi> compilerwriter: you are using a pop server not an IMAP one I assume?
[11:11] <apokryphos> j-swim: just a sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop
[11:11] <compilerwriter> Yes.  I map is not an option for me with this provider.
[11:12] <j-swim> apokryphos: and it would have taken care of all the deps?
[11:12] <psusi> compilerwriter: then yea, I believe it fetches pop mail into an mbox file
[11:12] <apokryphos> j-swim: right. It's good like that, for things like that :)
[11:12] <jimb1> i need to mount a hard drive...installed gparted...cant do it there..option is greyed out
[11:12] <j-swim> very cool apokryphos
[11:13] <Batmanuel> alright, off to the mexican channel. Maybe they'll have answers there...
[11:13] <j-swim> odd i didnt realize that ubuntu 6.10 is not LTS... what does that mean to a regular desktop user?
[11:13] <compilerwriter> psusi is there a way to get evolution to leave messages on the server until such time as I delete them from my mail program?  I liked that feature with outlook.
[11:13] <apokryphos> geez
[11:13] <bakert> j-swim, nothing really ...
[11:13] <psusi> higi: you will need to start up fdisk and note the exact start and end location of the partition, then blow it and the extended partition it is in away, then create a primary partition that has the same start and end sectors
[11:13] <superkirbyartist> K YOU PPL I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY PRINTER!
[11:13] <j-swim> bakert: why the diffirentiation then?
[11:14] <apokryphos> !caps | superkirbyartist
[11:14] <ubotu> superkirbyartist: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[11:14] <TGPO> superkirbyartist, yes it seems to have locked your caps lock jey
[11:14] <jimb1> i need to mount a hard drive...formated to ext  Is there a command to use..  total n00b here first day on nix
[11:14] <psusi> compilerwriter: I'm sure there is.... though usually ISPs will complain if your mailbox gets too big
[11:14] <superkirbyartist> WELL THEN WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING!
[11:14] <bakert> j-swim, its for people that need to know that they will be supported in the long-term, such as companies rolling it out
[11:14] <bakert> j-swim, in that case go for dapper not edgy
[11:14] <Martyo> someone kick superkirbyartist please
[11:14] <apokryphos> jimb1: welcome :). Please have a read of the FAQ that you can find in teh channel topic :)
[11:14] <jimb1> is my text getting through?
[11:14] <Martyo> ah, thanks ;)
[11:14] <bakert> j-swim, but for a home machine you have control of, you may as well get the latest
[11:15] <psusi> jimb1: yes
[11:15] <jimb1> faq in topic?
[11:15] <j-swim> I see bakert.
[11:15] <compilerwriter> psusi it is my own domain.  The only problem I will have is hard disk limits.  They could care less whether it is all mail or html.
[11:15] <psusi> jimb1: look at the channel topic
[11:15] <jimb1> i see it ...lot of links
[11:15] <bakert> j-swim, edgy is meant to be a bit more "cutting edge" and experimental but it is pretty solid i think
[11:15] <compilerwriter> psusi I just liked that feature as a sort of backup of the important mail.
[11:15] <psusi> compilerwriter: but you can't get them to use imap eh?  too bad... imap rocks
[11:16] <jimb1> i was hoping to save some time by not having to sort through a lot of web pages
[11:16] <psusi> bakert: no, edgy is the current stable release
[11:16] <j-swim> bakert: yah i've been using it myself for some time.
[11:16] <ubuntu> sorry, how can i have 5 primary partitions???
[11:16] <bakert> psusi, yeah but it is meant to be a bit experimental (see inclusion of firefox 2.0)
[11:16] <compilerwriter> ps unfortunately not.
[11:16] <apokryphos> jimb1: it's not a lot of webpages. It's a clear and succinct FAQ. Please take some time to read it :)
[11:16] <psusi> ubuntu: you can't
=== Nix is now known as Ivani

[11:17] <ubuntu> give one minute
[11:17] <apokryphos> superkirbyartist: now, please, no more caps :)
[11:17] <bakert> psusi, it aint exactly a stable and proven release of many years ago though, is it?

[11:17] <bakert> psusi, mark shuttleworth: "Edgy is all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge,
[11:17] <bakert> brand new code and infrastructure"
[11:17] <ubuntu> there are 5
[11:18] <psusi> bakert: obviously not... that's why it is the latest release
[11:18] <ubuntu> in primary
[11:18] <psusi> but it is a stable release

[11:19] <bjorn_> I really need some help getting my mic to work. The volume control gui says the volume is on max, but running alsamixer in console it's turned off, and I can't get it up. Any suggestions?
[11:19] <jimb1> ok
[11:19] <TGPO> superkirbyartist, just because you have a question does not mean someone here has an answer, if no one does then no one will respond
[11:19] <linoob_> when I try to boot my ubuntu system, i get Error 21 at the grub boot loader, and then nothing happens. I need to fix this!!!
[11:19] <superkirbyartist> Help me with my /usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip failed problem.  It is a "long term support".
[11:19] <bakert> psusi, i'm not sure what we're disagreeing about really.  edgy is meant to be a bit "edgy" but is a proper full release.  if you are rolling out for corporate infrastructure use dapper, for home use look at edgy.
[11:20] <Staz> if I dont install something using aptitude/apt-get, but instead "dpkg -i xxx.deb" I can then remove the app using aptitude?
[11:20] <apokryphos> superkirbyartist: the "support" there means that you'll get security updates, maybe some bugfixes, for a longer term. It doesn't mean we're forced to help you :)
[11:20] <apokryphos> Staz: right
[11:20] <Staz> cheers
[11:20] <MikeB-> linoob_: you /boot/grub/menu.lst is not pint to the right drive
[11:20] <superkirbyartist> Who cares?  Why are others getting help?
[11:20] <apokryphos> Staz: they all use the same package database; apt-get/aptitude are both front-ends to dpkg
[11:20] <psusi> superkirbyartist: because we know the answers to their questions
[11:20] <Staz> ahh ok

[11:20] <ubuntu> here you are
[11:21] <Ivani> please, I need of the makers crosswords...
[11:21] <jimb1> apokryphos: I see the faq page now and at a point when I get the machine running it will be helpful. I see nothing there relating to mounting and accessing an unaccessable hard drive
[11:21] <ubuntu> 5 primary partitions
[11:21] <psusi> ubuntu: one of those is on another disk ( /dev/hdb )
[11:21] <superkirbyartist> Well if you "help for ubuntu" and you don't even know how it works then what's the point?  Why am I getting a  "/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip failed" error message?
[11:21] <MikeB-> linoob_:  boot off the Live CD and mount the partition you install linux to
[11:21] <Staz> so it doesnt matter at all whether I use "dpkg -r xxx" or "aptitude remove xxx" ?
[11:21] <lufis> I'm using Edgy and periodically when booting, the throbber cursor appears momentarily and then disappears and nothing happens afterwards. Any ideas?
[11:21] <Staz> to remove that is :)
[11:21] <ubuntu> oh it's true!

[11:31] <tag> I only have 1 of my 2 CPUs also

[11:32] <TGPO> I'v had to compile new kernel to get SMP up nearly every time with edgy
[11:32] <lmosher> I heard that -generic was supposed to detect it, but I can't get it to load.

[11:37] <allen2003> anyone got idea how to show Linux partition on winXP?
[11:37] <TGPO> allen2003, there is a windows add on that will allow you to read and write ext2/3
[11:38] <allen2003> where D:
[11:38] <MikeB-> allen2003: look for ext driver for Windows on google
[11:38] <allen2003> ok
[11:38] <TGPO> allen2003, google
[11:38] <allen2003> xD
[11:38] <crimsun> bjorn_: ok, so far you've told me nothing. Start by pastebinning ``asoundconf list && amixer''
[11:38] <allen2003> kk
[11:38] <lmosher> |rt|, MikeB-, any idea what I should do to get the generic kernel running?
[11:38] <bjorn_> Crimsun: Sorry, what does pastebinning mean?
[11:38] <lmosher> how do I prevent the mdadm.conf file not found error? why is it looking for this file?
[11:39] <crimsun> bjorn_: it means use pastebin (see topic)

[11:43] <TGPO> lmosher thanks, I just read it
[11:43] <lmosher> mark__, best bet is jsut use the postscript driver. Finding yoru exact printer can be challenging, so sending postscript format is general good..

[11:43] <lmosher> TGPO, I'm going to test it. brb

[11:52] <Jimbo> first impression is that ubuntu is crap
[11:52] <Keyseir> I just installed edgy and I can't find any UI for mounting discs under the system menu. There was a "disks" option on dapper...
[11:52] <mnepton> honk: gnome-launcher
[11:52] <Jimbo> cant even see my blasted hard drives
[11:52] <crimsun> Jimbo: see you when Vista hits, then.
[11:52] <bjorn_> hehe
[11:53] <presto> when i try to play divx with mplayer it talks about my video out not being set any ideas
[11:53] <Kingsqueak> or at least the NSA will
[11:53] <crimsun> Jimbo: now what drives are you trying to see (specifically, what fs type(s))?
[11:53] <tpc247> TGPO: yes, I'm attempting to connect to a legacy system that is using Novell to authenticate
[11:53] <Jimbo> i had it seeing it when it was ntfs, so i formated to ext3, nothin, then fat, nothin
[11:54] <Jimbo> and no one here apparently knows how to get it to properly mount a hard drive either
[11:54] <Jadedwolf> Does anyone know a program that will allow me to test my NVIDIA driver?
[11:54] <Kingsqueak> if you formatted it, it can see it
[11:54] <up365> I have SB Live, get sound from CDs but none from internet sites, when playing RealPlayer
[11:54] <crimsun> Jimbo: you don't mount an entire hard but instead partitions
[11:54] <Jimbo> thparted can see it
[11:54] <Keyseir> Any help on the "disk" UI? Can't find anything under the system menu on edgy
[11:54] <Jimbo> gparted can see it
[11:54] <Jimbo> but it wont allow it to be mounted
[11:54] <Jimbo> i installed the os twic today
[11:55] <tpc247> most of the documents online say to enable IPX in the kernel, compile IPX in the kernel, but I'm not quite sure how to do this
[11:55] <Kingsqueak> Jimbo: what's   cat /proc/partitions   tell you?
[11:55] <mostafa_as3ad> i upgraded to edgy a few days ago and now the bittorrent wont download anything, it gives me this error:  Problem connecting to tracker .... urlopen error (111, 'Connection refused'),  so whats wrong and how to fix it?
[11:55] <Jimbo> there is sposed to be "disk" listed under system/administration where u can enagle a partition but there is not
[11:55] <presto> any ideas as to why when i play divx on mplayer i get a error initialing the selected video out device
[11:56] <nothlit> Jimbo, you're telling me nothing pops up under ls /dev | grep hd   ?
[11:56] <Jimbo> King.  i dont know...first time on linux today
[11:56] <crimsun> tpc247: you don't need to compile it at all; Ubuntu comes with it as a module. Just ``sudo modprobe ipx''
[11:56] <honk> thanks mnepton
[11:56] <Jimbo> will try and find out
[11:56] <Kingsqueak> Jimbo: that should show you the drives the system sees, or try  'fdisk -l'
[11:56] <ayaa> what binary is setting up the xorg.conf every time i boot a livecd as knoppix ?
[11:56] <Jimbo> fdisk didnt work earlier today
[11:57] <Kingsqueak> Jimbo: actually 'sudo fdisk -l'
[11:57] <nothlit> Jimbo, also the best way to permanently mount drives is edit /etc/fstab then sudo mount -a
[11:57] <Jimbo> can i pm u kingspeak?
[11:57] <Kingsqueak> sure
[11:57] <nothlit> You also need mount points for all the drives :P
[11:58] <shwag> if the default umask is 022 , why do files usually only get created as -rw-r--r-- , rather then  -rwxr-xr-x
[11:58] <Jimbo> nothlit...can u give me those commands in a pm so im sure i understand?
[11:58] <andreasdk> Hi. How do I encode in MP3 with sound juicer and which package do I need to hear my existing MP3`s?
[11:58] <nothlit> Hey I was ./configuring alltray and for some reason it can't see  (gtk+-2.0 >= 2.2.0 gdk-2.0 gconf-2.0 gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0), can someone tell me why?
=== jones20992 is now known as modman
[11:58] <nothlit> Jimbo, lol its not that simple I don't exactly know what you need to do
=== modman is now known as modman01
[11:58] <tpc247> crimsun: ok, I did that, and then I did 'sudo /etc/init.d/ipx start' but now how do I use IPX ?  I installed via Synaptic the ipx package, but where are the user-space utils ?
[11:59] <Kingsqueak> shwag: because files are supposed to be that way, umask doesn't know you intend to also create executables
[11:59] <Jimbo> i just need one lousey slave drive to show up and be readable and writable
=== modman01 is now known as jones20992
[11:59] <shwag> Kingsqueak: so you are saying it is not possible ?
[11:59] <Kingsqueak> shwag: you shouldn't be creating any file by default as executable
[11:59] <Kingsqueak> shwag: I'm actually not sure it is possible, no
[11:59] <nalioth> nothlit: do you have the gtk development libraries?
[12:00] <andreasdk> How do I encode in MP3 with sound juicer and which package do I need to hear my existing MP3`s?
[12:00] <shwag> Kingsqueak: how do I make it -rw-rw-r-x-  then ?
[12:00] <nothlit> Jimbo, you need to know what drive it is on and then the partition you need, along with the filesystem
[12:00] <Jimbo> i see why people stick with windows...you cant even get the machine to run with nix so you can learn the blasted os
[12:00] <shwag> Kingsqueak: because umake 002 does not do it.
[12:00] <andreasdk> Also .WMV in Firefox would be nice
[12:00] <Kingsqueak> shwag: chmod 755 filename
[12:00] <jrib> andreasdk: mplayer-plugin with w32codecs should let you play wmv
