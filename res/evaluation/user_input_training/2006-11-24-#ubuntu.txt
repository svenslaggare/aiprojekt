[12:01] <sn9> killown: barely, but once you get it to work, you'll like the results
[12:01] <DreamerHxC1> wait let me show you my xorg.conf
[12:01] <killown> certo!
[12:02] <ublender> hey, does anyone know of a way to set up ubuntu to share work-load over a network?
[12:02] <mcphail> jimmypw: what are you doing to exit the application?
[12:03] <DreamerHxC1> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33553/
[12:03] <Seveas> ublender, that's application specific
[12:03] <sn9> ublender: there are several pkgs that do that
[12:03] <Seveas> ublender, distcc does it for compiling for instance
[12:03] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: why not use the ati driver?
[12:03] <ublender> er, I found drqueue for rendering. but I was hoping to find one for video encoding as well
[12:04] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: I need the Section "ServerLayout"
[12:04] <DreamerHxC1> ok wait
[12:04] <Seveas> ublender, maybe mencoder can do that? Or transcode\
[12:04] <jimmypw> mcphail; for example i press ^a-c to create a new screen by default its bash thats loaded.... I do what i have to do then i type exit and bash closes closing the screen to *usually* but sometimes the procrss just goes zombie on me and i cant kill it however i try
[12:04] <simmerz> why can't i build the hostap driver with make-kpkg? it keeps erroring saying that there isn't a makefile for it
[12:04] <ublender> Seveas: mmm, thx, i'll see what I can find out about that
[12:04] <tonyyarusso> Seveas: Is it theoretically possible to make something that would distribute all of your processing?
[12:04] <Seveas> tonyyarusso, yes
[12:05] <mcphail> jimmypw: what process "goes zombie"? The bash session?
[12:05] <tonyyarusso> Seveas: Cool.  /me hopes someone does, and packages it for us :)
[12:05] <cntb> issue
[12:05] <cntb> samba share read only /home/user.  windows tries to read but is asked a user password multiple times .have come across such issue? what is the workaround?
[12:05] <kralcymerej> in the goal of playing dvds on my system I loaded Xine, but it is telling me that "The source can not be read - maybe you don't have enough rights for this or the source doesn't contain any data" any ideas?
[12:05] <ublender> are there any load sharing programs that are not app specific? can that even be done?
[12:05] <sn9> Seveas: you're a high-ranking ubuntu guy -- ever hear of liborbit2 becoming non-functional upon a breezy-to-dapper upgrade?
[12:06] <Seveas> sn9, nope
[12:06] <mush> anyone willing to help me out, please?
[12:06] <tonyyarusso> mush: Just ask your question and see
[12:06] <sn9> Seveas: well, it appears to have happened to me
[12:06] <jimmypw> mcphial: yes the bash session or whatever app i started after screen <appname>
[12:07] <sn9> Seveas: it's making firefox do a SIGILL, and i suspect it's what's causing synaptic to crash too
[12:07] <DreamerHxC1> slavik http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33554/
[12:07] <Seveas> sn9, funky, tried reinstalling the thing?
[12:07] <mush> when i plug my usb drive, it does not seem to correctly detect the free space...
[12:07] <Seveas> (the thing == liborbit)
[12:07] <sn9> Seveas: liborbit2? yes. and firefox, too
[12:07] <Seveas> sn9, and how did you determine it to be liborbit?
[12:07] <mush> i use edgy
[12:07] <sn9> Seveas: gdb
[12:07] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: ok ... gimme a sec
[12:08] <jimmypw> mcphial: would you like me to pastebin my results of ps waxf?
[12:08] <Seveas> sn9, can you pastebin the gdb output please
[12:08] <DreamerHxC1> slavik ok
[12:08] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33556/
[12:09] <simmerz> if i make-kpkg kernel_image, is the only difference between that and modules_image that 3rd party modules aren't installed?
[12:09] <sn9> Seveas: well, i no longer have the window open, but i can recreate the backtrace. also, this is on a powerpc (g3)
[12:09] <slavik> change the section with driver ati to that and remove the fglrx section
[12:09] <DreamerHxC1> chage ati to fglrx?
[12:09] <mcphail> jimmypw: there is a "zombie" section in the screen manpage. Does that help?
[12:09] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: actually, instead of fglrx in the end, use ati, fglrx doesn't support your card anymore ... (unless you get the 8.28.8 driver)
[12:10] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: scratch everything for now
[12:10] <DreamerHxC1> what=
[12:10] <DreamerHxC1> ?
[12:10] <Poromenos1> how can i gzip a file from stdin
[12:10] <Poromenos1> ?
[12:10] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: change the section with ati to this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33557/
[12:10] <Seveas> Poromenos1, gzip -
[12:10] <Seveas> (the - means stdin)
[12:10] <ortega10> i'm looking for a gui-based personal backup tool, any suggestions?
[12:10] <Poromenos1> Seveas: it says gzip: compressed data not written to a terminal. Use -f to force compression.
[12:10] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: and remove the fglrx section
[12:11] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:11] <jimmypw> mcphail: ill check
[12:11] <DreamerHxC1> and the other dvice section?
[12:11] <Seveas> Poromenos1, gzip -f - > filename
[12:11] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: new fglrx doesn't support older ati cards (only X series cards)
[12:11] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: the fglrx section, remove it
[12:11] <DreamerHxC1> oI don't understand
[12:12] <Poromenos1> Seveas: ah, that worked, thanks! can I also name the file inside the archive somehow?
[12:12] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: fglrx does not support your video card
[12:12] <Seveas> Poromenos1, dunno, man gzip ;)
[12:12] <DreamerHxC1> which section do I remove? first device with "ati" or second with "fglxr"
[12:12] <Poromenos1> Seveas: ok, thanks :)
[12:12] <slavik> the second one
[12:12] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:12] <socrates> hi all, I need to rip a cd into MP3s. Any free tools to do that efficiently?
[12:12] <socrates> it's not a copyright cd
[12:12] <Seveas> socrates, sound-juicer
[12:12] <ortega10> socrates: soundjuicer
[12:13] <socrates> thanks
[12:13] <DreamerHxC1> so I just have http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33559/
[12:13] <Seveas> socrates, it's even installed by default ;)
[12:13] <socrates> you mean using the extract button?
[12:13] <DreamerHxC1> right?
[12:13] <ortega10> socrates: it comes with ubuntu by default i think
[12:13] <socrates> oh ok  didn't realize that. thanks all :-)
[12:13] <ortega10> socrates: anytime
[12:13] <Doow> I had a crappy set of frequencies for my monitor, edited my Xorg.conf, got better ones (e.g. 1024x768@85 Hz which is what I want) I installed Beryl which screwed that up(best then was 1024x768@64Hz), removed beryl, reverted Xorg.conf back to the old (good) one. But I can't get 1024x768@85Hz back, any ideas?
[12:13] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: change the identifier to the one from the fglrx section
[12:13] <DekKeD> anyone here uses Octave?
[12:14] <DreamerHxC1> ok aticonfig-device
[12:14] <slavik> yes
[12:14] <ortega10> i'm looking for a gui-based personal backup tool, any suggestions ?
[12:15] <Seveas> ortega10, hubackup
[12:15] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:15] <ortega10> Seveas: thanks
[12:15] <DreamerHxC1> and what now?
[12:15] <slavik> restart X ...
[12:15] <Doow> Let me rephrase that, how can I get higher update frequency for my monitor? =)
[12:15] <TuxN00b> hey hey
[12:16] <DreamerHxC1> slavik problems with X
[12:16] <slavik> what is the problem?
[12:16] <DreamerHxC1> wait wait
[12:17] <sn9> Seveas: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33560/
[12:17] <scrambled2486> how do i find out where a disk is currently mounted?
[12:18] <DreamerHxC1> ok restarting X
[12:18] <Doow> df
[12:18] <DreamerHxC1> but this is not working
[12:18] <DreamerHxC1> still freezed before desktop
[12:18] <bimberi> scrambled2486: df
[12:18] <plesnivyjano> is there any alternative in ubuntu for command "write" ?
[12:18] <TuxN00b> I have some questions about installation/partitioning
[12:18] <Seveas> sn9, that output seems incomplete
[12:19] <sn9> Seveas: what's missing? looks ok to me
[12:19] <simmerz> why wont the hostap driver install cleanly???
[12:19] <Seveas> sn9, and try disabling assistive technologies/accessibility things
[12:19] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: hmm ... try a reboot
[12:19] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:20] <sn9> Seveas: i'll have to log out for that, but now that you mention it, gok fails to start, complaining about a missing /dev/js0
[12:20] <DreamerHxC1> slavik it worked, Im now in at the desktop but I know that if I reboot, it won't work again
[12:20] <TuxN00b> is it actually feasable to install ubuntu alongside a windows partition without having to format my harddrive and losing everything?
[12:20] <Seveas> sn9, well, it's the backtrace of only one thread and the actual signal is missing ;)
[12:20] <DreamerHxC1> this already happened to me
[12:20] <scrambled2486> how can i get ntfs write support on the Live CD
[12:20] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: what won't work again?
[12:21] <sn9> Seveas: it's the thread that got the signal
[12:21] <scrambled2486> TuxN00b: yes
[12:21] <Seveas> scrambled2486, with a lot of pain and suffering
[12:21] <DreamerHxC1> everything
[12:21] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: try to reboot again then
[12:21] <Seveas> sn9, fair enough ;)
[12:21] <DreamerHxC1> ok let's see
[12:21] <scrambled2486> TuxN00b: the Ubuntu installer can resize windows partitions
[12:21] <sn9> Seveas: the top line refers to the illegal instruction
[12:21] <scrambled2486> Seveas: how much
[12:21] <scrambled2486> Seveas: and where do i go to receive this pain and suffering
[12:21] <Seveas> scrambled2486, an awful lot
[12:21] <scrambled2486> Seveas: whatever, where do i go
[12:22] <Seveas> scrambled2486, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ntfs-3g
[12:22] <DreamerHxC1> as I said, this is not working again :)
[12:22] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: what error does it give?
[12:23] <DreamerHxC1> when it's going to work, it sounds like a session start sound
[12:23] <newpZ> hi im running ubuntu and the latest xgl / beryl. with an ati card (direct rendering is working) when i switch sessions to xgl and fireup beryl manager everything crashes then hard locks.. does anyone know of a fix to this?
[12:23] <DreamerHxC1> nothing
[12:23] <DreamerHxC1> just it gets freezed before show desktop
[12:23] <DreamerHxC1> i can switch to console or ctrl + alt + backspace
[12:23] <TuxN00b> if I resize my NTFS windows partition using the extra space it won't adversely affect my hard drive?
[12:24] <slavik> console
[12:24] <DreamerHxC1> im there
[12:25] <slavik> cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[12:25] <TuxN00b> ?
[12:25] <slavik> last few lines should say what happened

[12:27] <sn9> Seveas: i'll give turning off assistive devices a try now, and then i'm going to thanksgiving dinner with family and friends of family, so i won't be able to report back until another day. which channel would be the best one to receive such a report?
[12:27] <DreamerHxC1> slavik this files has many suspicious lines...
[12:27] <bimberi> TuxN00b: it isn't designed to cause damage, but you should always have very good backups before attempting something of that sort
[12:27] <Seveas> sn9, here
[12:27] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: like what?
[12:27] <DreamerHxC1> for examble could not init font path elemnt, removing from list!

[12:27] <TuxN00b> yea
[12:28] <TuxN00b> mainly docs are all i have to lose

[12:28] <sn9> Seveas: to you? ok...
[12:28] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: that is fine
[12:28] <DreamerHxC1> ah ok
[12:28] <DreamerHxC1> can I see that log by parts?
[12:28] <DreamerHxC1> because I jsut can see last lines
[12:28] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: less the file
[12:29] <slavik> use less instead of cat
[12:29] <sn9> Seveas: well, later...
[12:29] <Seveas> ciao

[12:32] <utopi> hi, how do i format a hdd to ext3 filesystem?
[12:33] <funkyHat> utopi, you could use gparted to do it
[12:34] <DreamerHxC1> this has so many lines....
[12:34] <bimberi> utopi: or cli - 'mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda3'  (for example)
[12:34] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: yes it does
[12:34] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: scroll through it, see if anything looks weird
[12:34] <utopi> "cli - 'mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdd" and my hdd becomes a whole new ext3 hdd?
[12:34] <DreamerHxC1> AIGLX?
[12:34] <DreamerHxC1> 3d driver claims to not support visual 0x24?
[12:34] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: keep going
[12:34] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:35] <slavik> hmm, I think there was something in forums about it
[12:35] <slicky> hi.. where can i find a nice howto 4 the free ati drivers ? :$
[12:35] <DreamerHxC1> render acceleration unsupported in radeon 9500 and newer, disabling render accel
[12:36] <DreamerHxC1> i can't see anything bad but im not a linux expert
[12:36] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: change the ati driver to radeon in xorg.conf
[12:36] <bimberi> utopi: no, you will need to partition it first - using gparted would be a better idea
[12:36] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:36] <slicky> but that means that u cant play any games with the radeon cards?
[12:36] <Bilange> eww... for some reason, gnome's network-manager crashes when I start it. is there anyone with this issue? (OR:is there any way I can revert to basic/default network settings so network-manager can start again without crashing?)
[12:36] <rioghal> slicky,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:36] <utopi> bimberi: well i just used gparted
[12:37] <utopi> it took around 1 min
[12:37] <utopi> can that be right?
[12:37] <timo90> Hey how do you configure remote controls in linux
[12:37] <bimberi> utopi: yep, sounds about right - it's fairly quick - even for large drives
[12:38] <utopi> ok cool
[12:38] <utopi> how do i find it?
[12:38] <timo90> I have a DVB remote
[12:38] <utopi> do i have to mount hdd1 or something?
[12:38] <DreamerHxC1> ok changed, im gonna reboot
[12:38] <slavik> k
[12:38] <cameron> u guys running linux mint or ubuntu?
[12:38] <bruenig> ubuntu
[12:38] <bimberi> utopi: yes, create a mountpoint (eg. 'sudo mkdir /media/hdd1' ) then mount it - 'sudo mount /dev/hdd1 /media/hdd1'
[12:38] <bruenig> xubuntu actually
[12:39] <utopi> ok thanks
[12:39] <bimberi> utopi: add an entry to /etc/fstab to make it mount at boot
[12:39] <tone> whats the easiest way to mount an iso?
[12:39] <utopi> :)
[12:39] <tone> vmplayer?
[12:39] <utopi> bimberi: thank you
[12:39] <bruenig> !iso
[12:39] <cameron> burn image to disk
[12:39] <ubotu> To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[12:39] <bimberi> utopi: np :)

[12:45] <DreamerHxC1> yes, the date
[12:45] <slavik> you do a lot of aticonfig?
[12:45] <DreamerHxC1> i've been two days like this
[12:45] <slavik> heh
[12:46] <DreamerHxC1> so excuse me if now I hate linux and ati
[12:46] <slavik> ok, well, do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select all defaults (and choose the ati driver)
[12:46] <Seveas> DreamerHxC1, join the club
[12:46] <DreamerHxC1> ok but i've done this already many times before
[12:46] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: I don't like ATI either ... but for other reasons
[12:46] <DreamerHxC1> hehe thanks Seveas :)
[12:46] <ebaad> I'm having flicker problem since I have installed the Edgy

[12:49] <dv_> can ubuntu handle multi-monitor setups?
[12:49] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:49] <simmerz> has anyone flashed firmware on a prism2 device?
[12:49] <jose> just a simple one : I use the dictionnary, but have access only to the English one. Is there a way to get also the French one ?
[12:49] <slavik> dvyes
[12:49] <slavik> dv_: yes
[12:49] <bruenig> dv_, yes
[12:49] <dv_> does it require the same resolution on all monitors, or can they have individual ones?
[12:50] <DreamerHxC1> slavik restarting x is not working
[12:50] <slavik> dv_: they can be different ...
[12:50] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: and the log file?
[12:50] <bruenig> !info myspell-fr
[12:50] <ubotu> myspell-fr: The French dictionary for myspell (Hydro-Quebec version). In component main, is optional. Version 1.4-20 (edgy), package size 156 kB, installed size 620 kB
[12:50] <dv_> slavik, with or without xinerama
[12:50] <dv_> ?
[12:50] <DreamerHxC1> when it worked I heard a sound like session start sound, does it matter?
[12:50] <slavik> dv_: no idea
[12:50] <ebaad> hello can somebody please help me
[12:50] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: that sound is amde by GDM
[12:50] <ebaad> with the video display
[12:50] <DreamerHxC1> ah
[12:50] <bruenig> jose, sudo apt-get install myspell-fr, if you didn't catch that
[12:51] <ed_> hello kids
[12:51] <DreamerHxC1> log seems to be the same
[12:51] <jose> ok, thanks. I do it right now
[12:51] <bruenig> jose, also if you need it for open office, sudo apt-get install openoffice.org-l10n-fr
[12:52] <slavik> hmm
[12:53] <DreamerHxC1> yeah, not working even rebooting
[12:53] <simmerz> is no one able to help me get new firmware on my prism wireless card?
[12:53] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: in Server Layout section, add a line: Option "AIGLX" "Disabled"
[12:53] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[12:53] <globe> simmerz: ...what card is it?, many are prisms
[12:53] <jose> bruenig, I've done what you said
[12:54] <jose> but my dictionary does not find french words ...
[12:54] <Xaice> which command displays the systemload
[12:54] <DreamerHxC1> I have no Server Layout section right now
[12:54] <slavik> Xaice: top
[12:54] <simmerz> globe: its a built in wireless unit. Intersil Prism 2.5
[12:54] <nblracer> why when i do Zip -D i still get all the Directorys, in the Zip
[12:54] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: in very bottom of xorg.cong
[12:54] <slavik> conf*
[12:54] <DreamerHxC1> oh yes
[12:55] <slavik> Section "ServerLayout"
[12:55] <Vspirit> are there tools for unpacking a self-extracting zip file (.exe) a windows file containing windows drivers for my wireless nic found on the vendors website. (for use with bcm43xx-fwcutter)
[12:55] <simmerz> I'm trying to modify the kernel source for the hostap driver to allow the PRISM2_DOWNLOAD_SUPPORT to work
[12:55] <ebaad> I really need help with the screen please
[12:55] <adam__> hi, i am having problems trying to run mysql, when i type mysql from the terminal i get: ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2) . any ideas anybody? :(
[12:55] <globe> simmerz: have you searched google for the computer model ... ex "Dell Inspiron 25310 ubuntu wireless"
[12:55] <ebaad> I would really appreciate if somebody can help me with the flickering issue
[12:56] <DreamerHxC1> still not working
[12:56] <ebaad> The screen is still flickering as I'm typing this message
[12:56] <idigtal> "Multimedia audio controller: Rockwell International: Unknown device 4310"
[12:56] <adam__> im running ubuntu 6.10 if that matters.
[12:56] <simmerz> globe: its an old laptop. and it is nothing to do with the laptop itself. its to do with the firmware on the card. it needs updating but to do that i need to enable a couple of option in the kernel source. and Im not sure how to.
[12:57] <slavik> hmm
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[12:57] <asqueella> I'd like to make my system wake me up at the morning by playing loud music.
[12:57] <newpZ> i i have an ati xpress 200M card.. i followed all the guides.. i hard lock everytime in XGL... im running ubuntu edgy... can anyone help me out
[12:57] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: change the driver to vesa ... that should definitely work ...
[12:57] <DreamerHxC1> ok wait
[12:57] <FuelB> ugh, I had to change font paths from /usr/share/X11/fonts to /usr/share/fonts/X11/ to get emacs to work
[12:57] <asqueella> it doesn't seem there are nice apps that can do this out of box, so I tried running rhytmbox <path to mp3> from a cron job, which didn't work
[12:57] <globe> simmerz: good.  sounds like you have a pretty good idea what needs to be done. I don't know how to help you, but if you rephrase you question, somebody probably does ;-)
[12:58] <FuelB> it seems xorg.conf has wrong font paths
=== GionnyBoss[away]  is now known as GionnyBoss
[12:58] <simmerz> globe: I have done many times.
[12:58] <GionnyBoss> hi all again :)
[12:58] <slavik> newpZ: that's not a very powerful card ... try adding 'beryl-xgl' to the session startup program
[12:58] <DreamerHxC1> I bet it won't work
[12:58] <simmerz> globe: I'm not a newbie. I know what I'm doing most of the time, but i'm stumped on this one.
[12:58] <jose> Do you know how I can get OpenOffice menu in French ?
[12:58] <DreamerHxC1> 100$
[12:58] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: only one way to find out ;)
[12:59] <DreamerHxC1> I know :)
[12:59] <jisatsu> How do I tell the exact version of the kernel I'm using? Apparently there's a bug in 2.6.17.1 - 2.6.17.7, and I need to know if mine (Edgy) is affected by it
[12:59] <GionnyBoss> I have installed JDK Sun package (I need that for Netbeans) without uninstalling Sun JRE first... will I get some problems?
[12:59] <DreamerHxC1> slavik could be my monitor?
[12:59] <slavik> GionnyBoss: you shouldn't
[12:59] <DreamerHxC1> yep, not working
[12:59] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: shouldn't be your monitor
[12:59] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: check the log file ...
[12:59] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: did it ever work?
[01:00] <DreamerHxC1> wo so so
[01:00] <DreamerHxC1> the log is different this time
[01:00] <DreamerHxC1> very different
[01:00] <GionnyBoss> slavik, ok thanks... it's just that I checked /urs/lib/jvm dir... and it looks like JDK overwrote the JRE...
[01:00] <slavik> ok, this is good
[01:00] <DreamerHxC1> slavik yes
[01:00] <DreamerHxC1> it works sometimes but when I reboot......
[01:00] <GionnyBoss> but I wanted to keep JRE because I thought that without JRE, mozilla java plugin would not work
[01:01] <slavik> GionnyBoss: JDK includes JRE
[01:01] <asqueella> ls -l | grep 361432
[01:01] <jose> do somebody know and can tell me  how I can get OpenOffice menu in French ?
[01:01] <asqueella> oops, sorry, the perils of multimon
[01:01] <wenko> hey there
[01:01] <GionnyBoss> slavik, I know that... just don't know the package dependencies for JRE mozilla plugin and I was not very sure what to do... anyways... I think that I won't have problem :)
[01:02] <DreamerHxC1> slavik so?
[01:02] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: what does the log say?
[01:02] <DreamerHxC1> for example
[01:02] <slicky> slavik: what about that howto u told me about b4?
[01:02] <wenko> anyne able to help me out...Id like to install nmap on this ubuntu box but i dont have make...how do I get make
[01:02] <DreamerHxC1> GLX: initialized driver MESA-PROXY GL provider for screen 0
[01:02] <ufox> hi all
[01:02] <kitche> wenko: sudo apt-get install build-esstenial
[01:03] <slavik> slicky: you need to use ati, not fglrx
[01:03] <Harley-D> how can i edit sources file for update in ubuntu
[01:03] <samuel> sup all
[01:03] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: are you trying to get compiz/beryl to work?
[01:03] <GionnyBoss> slavik, you look like an expert... can I ask you what can I do to change monitor gamma? I'm using xgamma, but when I restart it doesn't keep my gamma settings... I remember I let this work on Fedora, there was a command that I don't remember... can you help, please?
[01:03] <vook> I'm not too familiar with today's bootup process.  Other than /etc/rc2.d, where would I look to see what is loading at boot?  (to disable gdm, raid scripts, etc...) ??
[01:03] <slavik> GionnyBoss: I have no idea, sorry :(
[01:03] <GionnyBoss> no problem
[01:03] <samuel> how can i start/stop services in 6.10??? i dont know upstart
[01:04] <GionnyBoss> thanks anyway ;)
[01:04] <kitche> vook: ubuntu scripts are in /etc/init.d
[01:04] <DreamerHxC1> slavik log doesn't says anything more about graphic or screen
[01:04] <GionnyBoss> I ask here just because I googled for it with no success :(
[01:04] <limoflasche> hi, unfortunately im not good in linux and in chatting.so could please some1 tell me if there is a german ubuntu chat somewhere?
[01:04] <slicky> slavik: ye.. that done.. i followd the howto https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver?highlight=%28radeon%29#head-ba6d435f5620ddc29ae8af2c8cc09737aee0ffe7  and when i restart x it says that i dont have any display.. and it complaind on the nputDevice     "stylus" "SendCoreEvents"
[01:04] <vook> kitche: they are located there, but not all are used.  It's the old debian way - /etc/inittab goes into runlevel 2 (/etc/rc2.d)  but other stuff is loading as well.
[01:04] <DreamerHxC1> but when I get to logon screen, it's showed with plenty of colours and a great resolution, which shouldn't be with vesa, right?
[01:05] <ufox> I've lost my /boot partition, I've been looking for a solution in the internet, but nothing
[01:05] <slicky> slavik: so i put # on the lines where it complaind.. and now the x server starts
[01:05] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: no always
[01:05] <slavik> slicky: that's ok
[01:05] <DreamerHxC1> oh
[01:05] <ufox> I am looking for the vmlinuz and initrd files
[01:05] <slavik> s/no/not
[01:05] <DreamerHxC1> then im totally out of ideas
[01:05] <kitche> vook: which version of ubuntu are you using sicne Edgy doesn't follow the debian way to bootup
[01:05] <slavik> vesa is a standards driver
[01:06] <slavik> the lowest common denominator driver
[01:06] <DreamerHxC1> oh i didn't know
[01:06] <globe> limoflasche: you can try ubuntu-de
[01:06] <ufox> are both generics to download and put them in my partition?
[01:06] <limoflasche> how can i go there?
[01:06] <ufox> thanks and sorry abour my english
[01:07] <globe> limoflasche: try typing /join #ubuntu-de
[01:07] <jimmypw> aaahhh i dont know whats going on, I was told not to worry about the load averages of my machine (server edition) but they keep going up and up and up load average: 13.99, 13.97, 13.55
[01:07] <Harley-D> vi tells me /etc/apt/sources file is only read only how can i change this
[01:07] <limoflasche> thanks. im gonna try now, bye
[01:07] <globe> Harley-D: use sudo
[01:07] <slavik> Harley-D: use sudo vi :)
[01:07] <Harley-D> thanks
[01:07] <asqueella> sorry to repeat myself, but anyone knows how can I make ubuntu play music at a specified time?
[01:07] <Harley-D> apperiate it :)
[01:08] <kitche> vook: but ubutnu has all initscripts in /etc/init.d/ to make gdm to not load you will have to go into /etc/init.d/ and chmod -x the gdm script
[01:08] <asqueella> I guess it didn't work out for me with cron and rhythmbox because rhythmbox is a gui app
[01:08] <mcphail> asqueella: use "at" or "cron"
[01:08] <asqueella> and?..
[01:08] <globe> asqueella: try using mpg123 .... its a term mp3
[01:08] <vook> kitche - Edgy.  Oops, nevermind.  I was looking in the high numbers in /etc/rc2.d for the gdm script.  It's actually /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm, I thought it would be higher in the process.  BTW, unless things in linux in general have changed, all scripts are located in /etc/init.d, then the runlevel is mentioned in /etc/inittab (2), which then heads off to /etc/rc2.d and processes all the S scripts there, just like executing the command 'init 0' loads the scripts in /etc/
[01:08] <globe> asqueella: its in apt
[01:08] <asqueella> it didn't want to actually play the music
[01:08] <asqueella> tried that before rhythmbox :)
[01:08] <slicky> slavik: hm.. the 3d screen savers work now.. so maby it fixed?  but i cant change the screen resulution
[01:08] <asqueella> sec
[01:09] <slavik> slicky, using the ati driver? or fglrx?
[01:09] <DreamerHxC> sorry
[01:09] <DreamerHxC> slavik so any idea?
[01:09] <slicky> slavik: ati
[01:09] <kitche> vook: it depends ont eh system for example slackware doesn't use /etc/init.d at all
[01:09] <amicrawler> does any body know where i can get  new stuff for beod
[01:09] <asqueella> globe: says it can't open default sound device
[01:10] <simmerz> im having a problem trying to update the firmware on my prism 2.5 wireless card. I can't for the life of me get PRISM2_DOWNLOAD_SUPPORT working in the kernel. can someone help me with getting it working please?
[01:10] <amicrawler> does any body know where i can get  new stuff for beos
[01:10] <slavik> DreamerHxC ... no :(
[01:10] <globe> asqueella: do you have anything else using the sound card?
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> nothing like aticonfig or something like that?
[01:10] <asqueella> globe: thanks for answering by the way
[01:10] <globe> asqueella: np...
[01:10] <asqueella> oh, not again
[01:10] <slicky> slavik: how can i change the resulution? :$
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> oh
[01:10] <slavik> DreamerHxC: dpkg-reconfigure
[01:10] <asqueella> yeah, rhythmbox is playing in the background
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> again=
[01:10] <vook> kitche still uses /etc/inittab though, anyway - thanks!
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> ?
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> and what do I choose now?
[01:10] <asqueella> I thought we were past those days when linux couldn't play two sounds simultaneously
[01:10] <globe> asqueella: as far as i know, with mpg123 you cant have anything else playing....
[01:11] <asqueella> oh duh
[01:11] <slavik> slicky: make sure it's in xorg.conf
[01:11] <asqueella> thanks a lot
[01:11] <globe> asqueella: n/p ;-)
[01:11] <mcphail> asqueella: i think you'll have to wait for feisty for that to be sorted
[01:11] <slicky> slavik: ok
[01:11] <asqueella> I can swear I tried stopping rhythmbox before running mpg123 and it didn't work
[01:11] <jose> do somebody know and can tell me  how I can get OpenOffice menu in French ?
[01:11] <asqueella> for what?
[01:12] <DreamerHxC> slavik which options do I choose now in dpgk-reconfigure?
[01:12] <slicky> slavik:
[01:12] <mcphail> asqueella: the next ubuntu release (or maybe the one after that - i can't remember)
[01:12] <globe> asqueella: you might have to exit rythm, I dont know how it handles its control over the soundcard
[01:12] <slicky> soz
[01:12] <slavik> xserver-xorg
[01:12] <nasragiel> any ideas why edgy does not recognize the 2nd kernel? http://nopaste.php-q.net/256394
[01:12] <slavik> choose the vesa driver ...
[01:12] <appleton> I just installed flash player for firefox 2. On edgy, and it wont stop crashing whenever i go to a page with flash on it. How can i just get rid of the flash plugin? I installed flash, btw, via the firefox popup that asks you to install macromedia flash player in order to view the page
[01:12] <asqueella> globe: yeah, it appears you're right
[01:12] <asqueella> thanks again
[01:12] <slavik> nasragiel: did you do sudo update-grub after installing new kernel?
[01:12] <slicky> slavik: when i type glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"  i get: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[01:12] <DreamerHxC> yes but in graphic card, which chipset? ati again? do u want me to build a default xorg.conf?
[01:12] <globe> asqueella: np...
[01:13] <slavik> slicky: check the forums
[01:13] <jose> bye
[01:13] <slicky> slavik:  @ ubuntu.com? :o
[01:13] <slavik> DreamerHxC yes
[01:13] <DreamerHxC> ....ok
[01:14] <slavik> slicky: ubuntuforums.org
[01:14] <appleton> I just installed flash player for firefox 2. On edgy, and it wont stop crashing whenever i go to a page with flash on it. How can i just get rid of the flash plugin?

[01:19] <kitche> super: well it does and it doesn't you have to unzip the .exe file
[01:19] <DreamerHxC> and maybe again with glrx?
[01:19] <slavik> DreamerHxC what are some of the last thigns the log says regarding errors in graphics?

[01:20] <dabaR> appleton: open firefox, click Edit>Preferences>Content>Manage button under file types, see whether removing something there helps.
[01:21] <wimpies> I might have found a bug in php 5.1 but before I can report it I need to upgrade to 5.2 ... Any packages ?

[01:36] <Daviey> stalefries, THANX
[01:36] <LjL> cmweb: no. you type "man ln"
[01:37] <stalefries> Daviey: no prob :)
[01:37] <LjL> cmweb: that explains how to create a symbolic link
[01:37] <dabaR> cmweb: man is a command that shows a manual for the command that comes after it, so man ln shows ln's manual
[01:37] <LjL> cmweb: anything that starts with the "man" command is just a manual page. you should know that by now
[01:37] <cmweb> ljl, oh  i feel stupid now
[01:37] <dabaR> LjL: you know how old cmweb is?

[01:39] <yabba> i have a question. how can i restart my sound system. it seems to be blocked and cant give out music
[01:40] <morphish> ok, so how old is cmweb since it seems to matter so much!?
[01:40] <dabaR> yabba: edgy?
[01:40] <yabba> newest ubuntuyes
[01:40] <dabaR> morphish: does not matter so much, I just find it cool
[01:41] <dabaR> yabba: run lsof /dev/dsp and show output if any
[01:41] <DreamerHxC> slavik didn't work :(
[01:41] <Paradox-Ubuntu> can i put a password on folders to prevent users from accessing the folder>?
[01:41] <morphish> dabaR: so he is like some grufty old person?
[01:41] <yabba> dabaR, its the old problem with flash and the sound system. they two have problems, if they get each other in the way. now it happened. if the system is restarted it should be fine
[01:42] <yabba> ok
[01:42] <dabaR> Paradox-Ubuntu: you can set up permissions on the folder, man chmod if you want
[01:42] <Paradox-Ubuntu> chmod?
[01:42] <dabaR> morphish: no, a teenager.
[01:42] <stalefries> Paradox-Ubuntu: or just Right-click, Properties
[01:42] <simmerz> im having a problem trying to update the firmware on my prism 2.5 wireless card. I can't for the life of me get PRISM2_DOWNLOAD_SUPPORT working in the kernel. can someone help me with getting it working please?
[01:42] <mcphail> Paradox-Ubuntu: right click on the folder and change the permissions so that only you can read and write to it
[01:42] <Paradox-Ubuntu> yeah it isn't giving me an option to set a password..
[01:42] <yabba> dabaR, nspluginv 16540 tobsen   14u   CHR   14,3      7648 /dev/dsp
[01:43] <Paradox-Ubuntu> yeah... ok
[01:43] <Paradox-Ubuntu> thanks
[01:43] <mcphail> Paradox-Ubuntu: chmod is the command which will do that from the command line
[01:43] <dabaR> Paradox-Ubuntu: no passwords, permissions to only allow you to...
[01:43] <dabaR> yabba: kill the process. kill -9 16540 I think

[01:45] <Peps_> Hi, my laptop stopped automounting and poping a konqurer window when I plug in a usb storage device. I think this happened after I upgraged to KDE 3.5.5. I assume I am missing some setting - can someone help?
[01:45] <super> please with sugar on top
[01:45] <super> thx
[01:45] <blind> marshall: using gnome?
[01:45] <yabba> it worked for OSS sound, but not the sound the flash applet uses i think
[01:46] <mzli> GionnyBoss, localhost:631
[01:46] <marshall> blind, yeah GNOME
[01:46] <blind> marshall: go to system, preferences, preferred applications
[01:46] <GionnyBoss> mzli, I'm trying with that now... with cups web interface... and all seems to be setted in the right way, but printer doesn't work
[01:46] <dabaR> yabba: the flash plugin was not letting go of the sound device
[01:46] <bimberi> GionnyBoss: what make/model router/print-server?
[01:46] <mzli> GionnyBoss, I'v setting succeed from that page.
[01:47] <marshall> blind, im here, but  dont see anything that can help me
[01:47] <blind> marshall: you wanted thunar instead of firefox, right?
[01:47] <mzli> GionnyBoss, Just google an howto.
[01:47] <GionnyBoss> bimberi, Samsumg ML-1520 (that works if plugged via USB) and US robotics router
[01:47] <Peps_> I am running dapper
[01:47] <burningmyhair> whats the command to get from text mode to graphical?
[01:47] <blind> errr, nautilus
[01:47] <marshall> blind, thunar is a file manager like nautilus
[01:47] <DreamerHxC> slavik thank you so much for your help. I hope to see you again. bye
[01:47] <yabba> dabaR, how can i make it let go?;)
[01:47] <dabaR> yabba: still same output of lsof
[01:48] <yabba> dabaR, No. lsof is clean
[01:48] <GionnyBoss> mzli, the problem is that printer URL is http://routerIPaddress:1631/printers/printername ... that damn 1631 port... I guess that this is the problem
[01:48] <dabaR> and sound still no worky?
[01:48] <yabba> dabaR, but i also think the flash applet somehow still occupies some sound device that is why i want to restart it
[01:48] <yabba> sound works for mp3s which i play with xmms which uses OSS
[01:48] <mzli> GionnyBoss, I've no idea of that. sorry.
[01:48] <bimberi> GionnyBoss: hm, i have a print-server/switch (Linksys PSUS4) and it uses a LPD print queue.  So my knowledge probably won't help you
[01:48] <yabba> but not within the flash plugin
[01:49] <yabba> how can i kill the flash plugin ;)
[01:49] <burningmyhair> ive managed to press a hotkey that leads me into text mode twice... and i dont know how to get back to the graphical interface...
[01:49] <DekKeD> anyone here uses Octave?
[01:49] <bimberi> burningmyhair: ctrl-alt-f7
[01:49] <bimberi> burningmyhair: ctrl-alt-f1 to f6  switches to the virtual terminals
[01:49] <burningmyhair> thank you so much, bimberi :D:D
[01:49] <GionnyBoss> bimberi, yeah I think that it's different. my print server uses IPP via HTTP
[01:49] <stalefries> burningmyhair: ctrl+alt_F{1-6} is text
[01:49] <bimberi> burningmyhair: np :)
[01:50] <GionnyBoss> well, thanks a lot anyway
[01:50] <GionnyBoss> :)
[01:50] <bimberi> GionnyBoss: ah, np :)
[01:50] <Peps_> Hi, my laptop stopped automounting and poping a konqurer window when I plug in a usb storage device. I think this happened after I upgraged to KDE 3.5.5. I assume I am missing some setting - can someone help? I am running dapper
[01:51] <dabaR> yabba: it was killed. show ps aux on a pastebin.
[01:51] <burningmyhair> is there any way to get a window to roll up to the title bar with a right click on it?
[01:51] <TheMole> Hi, I just upgraded from dapper to edgy and now I don't get any sound through firefox. I tried adding firefoxdsp="aoss" to the rc file and downloading alsa-oss but it still isn't having any of it. Anybody have any ideas?
[01:51] <dabaR> burningmyhair: the openbox window manager allows rolling up and down with the scroll wheel
[01:52] <Daviey> stalefries, That worked a treat! thanx
[01:52] <stalefries> Daviey: good to know, but have no idea what I told you! :)
[01:52] <ihavenoname>  Buenas
[01:52] <dabaR> ihavenoname: buenas
[01:52] <burningmyhair> hmm.. worth to check out. thanx dabar!
[01:52] <Daviey> stalefries, the grey webcam issue
[01:53] <stalefries> Daviey: ah, good
[01:53] <stalefries> Daviey: it worked well?
[01:53] <dabaR> burningmyhair: you can run openbox as a session of its own(no desktop, no panel, no nothing, just what you want to add...or as part of gnome. You can run openbox in a terminal in gnome session to get it as the window manager temporarily, for permanent, search ubuntuforums for "openbox stormy eyes"
[01:54] <Daviey> stalefries, well seems so.  I'm try to get it working on somebody else's computer by remote logging in.  They went to bed and turned out all the lights,  Therefore all i see is black, but different shades.  so i guess it's working!  ;)
[01:54] <stalefries> Daviey: lol
[01:54] <sc0tt_> hm
[01:55] <sc0tt_> is it possible to place links to smb shares on the desktop?

[01:56] <sc0tt_> usually via places > network
[01:56] <sc0tt_> but I can connect any way needed
[01:56] <sc0tt_> :)
[01:57] <sc0tt_> also, all programs on the machine need to access the files
[01:57] <sc0tt_> such a movies/music
[01:57] <sc0tt_> maybe i'll install smbfs
[01:57] <dabaR> sc0tt_: open gconf-editor, and go to apps>nautilus>desktop and see whether there is a check in volumes visible
[01:58] <Daviey> whats the best way to make an application start on login.  ie 'aMsn'?
[01:58] <burningmyhair> hmm... got two more problems, sure they are pretty common. no sound in flash videos in firefox. and the java runtime plugin to firefox.

[02:19] <monitor> I'm getting this in a Manhattan build: make: *** No rule to make target `../lib/libneo.so', needed by `main_menu'.  Stop.
[02:19] <cmweb> Who knows of a Free Webhosting script such as CPanel?
[02:19] <dabaR> ebaad: Ubuntu with the gnome desktop has a System>Preferences>Screen or Resolution applet
[02:19] <monitor> It's an 6.10 server.
[02:19] <ebaad> the same HW with Breezy was working fine
[02:20] <ebaad> It says 1280X1024@61
[02:20] <evilmegaman> hi, How would I transfer data from my phone to my laptop and vice versa?

[02:21] <burningmyhair> thank you so much for all your help :D you're like... arch angels of linux :D
[02:21] <ferret0567> Is that mobo really not going to work with Ubuntu?
[02:22] <dabaR> ebaad: what says that resolution?
[02:22] <ferret0567> Ubuntu 6.10 to be exact
[02:22] <dabaR> monitor: it has some info here: http://manhattan.sourceforge.net/?Documentation:README_Files:INSTALL under step 6
[02:22] <ebaad> it is 1280X1024 @ 61 Hz
[02:22] <dabaR> monitor: also, libneo.so does not exist in edgy or dapper
[02:22] <ebaad> the screen is continously flickering
[02:23] <dabaR> monitor: also, there is a clearsilver-dev package, so I am not sure what the relationship is with what you are installing

[02:26] <metres> Hi all, anyone know why I got this error : sudo: nspluginwrapper: command not found ?
[02:26] <green_earz> iturk: sudo deluser user-name
[02:26] <luca> cmweb thanks...I will check the second link., but the first was no help :(
=== AnOrange is now known as snype
[02:26] <dewboy3d> iturk, what was the exact command you used for useradd?
[02:26] <dabaR> metres: where did you get it?
[02:27] <cmweb> Does any one know of a free WHM?
[02:27] <cmweb> luca, k
[02:27] <sc0tt_> interesting
[02:27] <snype> whm?
[02:27] <dabaR> cmweb: what is it?
[02:27] <cmweb> Web Hosting Manager
[02:27] <metres> dabaR : sudo nspluginwrapper -i /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins32/libflashplayer.so command line
[02:27] <sc0tt_> why can't you remove evolution?
[02:27] <sc0tt_> :|
[02:27] <snype> apache + lamp is free
[02:27] <dabaR> metres: why did you run that command?
[02:28] <dabaR> sc0tt_: you could, why not?
[02:28] <metres> dabaR  : to install flash
[02:28] <sc0tt_> it removes ubuntu-desktop :/
[02:28] <soobnauce> i have ubuntu and windows xp installed on my main hdd.  ubuntu is installed on the front of the hdd.  but i seem to have not installed a bootloader, so my computer automatically boots windows without prompting me to choose which operating system to boot.  what can i do to get the prompt?
[02:28] <dabaR> metres: where did you see that command? maybe you need to run sudo ./nspluginwrapper -i /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins32/libflashplayer.so
[02:29] <dabaR> sc0tt: that will not break anything, it is just a list of packages in the common ubuntu-desktop system, of which evolution is a part of.
[02:29] <sc0tt> alright

[02:29] <luca> cmweb: I really do not understand what I should do with this page: http://gkall.hobby.nl/pac20x.html
[02:29] <luca> I think it is the right one, but I have no clue about what to do with it
[02:29] <metres> dabaR : didnt work I saw it in many Tutorials for flash installation on amd64
[02:30] <dabaR> metres: nspluginwrapper is a program that probably comes with some download in those tutorials. Did you read the restrictedformats page of the wiki?
[02:31] <cmweb> luca, http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html Which is yours
[02:31] <soobnauce> nevermind, ubotu sent me a link.   thx
[02:31] <luca> cmweb: pixart imaging - I have already installed the spca5xx and still does not function
[02:32] <dabaR> soobnauce: welcome
[02:32] <metres> dabaR: dont know this page... i look for it
[02:32] <dabaR> !restricted > metres
[02:32] <luca> cmweb: it is not on hte list, but the link I have sent to you should be the right one for the pac files - but I do not know what to do with them
[02:32] <kamui> how might I go about searching a bunch of source files for a definition?
[02:33] <cmweb> luca, Is their a read me in the file?
[02:33] <kamui> Im looking for a specific variable declaration in someone elses sourcecode, but I don't know what file to look in, its not in the most likely suspect
[02:33] <kamui> s
[02:34] <dabaR> kamui: does cat file|grep def help?
[02:34] <dabaR> kamui: oh, declaration of a variable, grep <variableName>
[02:34] <kamui> dabar, let me give it a shot
[02:34] <luca> cmweb nope for the pac files, that is why I do not know how to use them
[02:34] <dabaR> kamui: do you understand the placeholders there?
[02:35] <Trixsey> Anyone here experiencing problems with Azureus?
[02:35] <kamui> dabar: yes
[02:35] <cmweb> luca, im not really the one to ask i have gone as far as i could. Any one else pick up where i left off?
[02:36] <kamui> dabar: cat *.cpp | grep "forwardmove"
[02:36] <dabaR> kamui: awesome:)
[02:36] <kamui> but it doesn't tell me the name of the file its in
[02:36] <kamui> :(
[02:36] <dabaR> kamui: ya, I had that too:))
[02:36] <kamui> :-D
[02:36] <dabaR> kamui: one by one:(
[02:36] <luca> cmweb: thx anyway
[02:36] <Misnix> kamui,  ,  dabaR, the cat part is one step to many, just do  grep string file(s)   or   grep "string1|string2" file(s)
[02:36] <luca> :)
[02:37] <Chousuke> useless use of cat. :)
[02:37] <kamui> lol:
[02:37] <dabaR> Misnix: Ya, I was aware of it being extra, but too lazy to look up grep syntax, thanks.
[02:37] <green_earz> Trixsey: as it been working ?
[02:37] <Trixsey> It starts up, then it closes down automatically
[02:37] <kamui> awesome
[02:37] <Trixsey> 2-3 seconds after start
[02:37] <Trixsey> lol
[02:37] <kamui> taht works perfectly
[02:37] <kamui> just the grep command
[02:37] <kamui> thanks guys
[02:38] <kamui> lists all the files that contain what
[02:38] <evilmegaman> Hi does anyone know how to transfer files from my laptop to my mobile phone via bluetooth?
[02:38] <green_earz> Trixsey: if you can start it from a terminal to see if it put out a error message
[02:39] <dabaR> kamui: so it shows where it is? FTW...
[02:39] <kamui> dabar: yes, it shows each line, and then the filename its in on the left
[02:39] <kamui> didn't know grep could do that
[02:39] <kamui> get better with this os every day
[02:40] <kamui> btw, happy thanksgiving to all who celebrate
[02:40] <kamui> :)
[02:40] <Misnix> kamui, add a -n and you'll get linenumbers too
[02:40] <Pelo> grep ?
[02:40] <ebaad> Hi Dabar, I ran that sudo command and I had to restart the server again and the screen is still flickering, please help
[02:40] <dabaR> grep is cool:) part of the magic of the command line, really
[02:40] <Misnix> kamui, and you could use regexps on both filenames and search terms
[02:41] <dabaR> ebaad: what is the exact make and model of the monitor?
[02:41] <ebaad> it is a sony lcd
[02:41] <Pelo> ebaad,   crt ?
[02:41] <kamui> misnix: thanks, your initial grep worked perfectly for what I needed, just needed to find out some info on how quakepsp handles side movements so I can add the option to strafe using the analog stick ;)
[02:41] <Pelo> nvm
[02:41] <Tarkus> hey guys. i have been a windows user for a while now. and i am strongly suggesting the switch to linux. i love all the open-source software that i use on windows (firefox, openoffice, xchat) but i need to have adobe products and autodesk 3DSMax. is there a possibility that in the future these software companies will start developing for linux?
[02:42] <Zylche> perhaps wine or cadega will run it?
[02:42] <ebaad> its a sony Lcd please help. Thanks.
[02:42] <Terminus> Tarkus: ask them, not us. =)
[02:42] <Zylche> :)
[02:42] <dewboy3d> Tarkus: always a possibility but i wouldn't hold me breath... there's alternatives though
[02:43] <Pelo> Tarkus,  you guess is as good as ours,  but you can try running them on wine ,   not sure about the autodesk one, I can tell you acad 2005 up don'T work on it
[02:43] <Terminus> Tarkus: maybe blender3d would be an ok alternative for you in place of 3DSMax
[02:43] <Misnix> kamui, "man grep" is your friend </rant>  :-p
[02:43] <dewboy3d> i use blender with great success. find it easier to work with than 3dsmax
[02:43] <Pelo> Tarkus,  as far as adobe stuff is consern you can try  gimp for photoshop and ink for illustrator
[02:43] <Tarkus> Terminus, VRay Renderer is a necessity though, and there is no version of vray for blender afaik..
[02:43] <monitor> how can i asure that i have all the dev packages necesaries?
[02:44] <dewboy3d> monitor: there is a package called build-essentials that should have everything you need.
[02:44] <ferret0567> Does anybody have a ASUS P5B Deluxe now? I think IRC does not give a transcript to new users joining the channel?
[02:45] <monitor> Oh! thanks, dewboy3d!
[02:45] <dabaR> dewboy3d: not on point of his question...he wants .h and .so files.
[02:45] <dewboy3d> i see. missed that part
[02:45] <dabaR> monitor: I follow the readme usually, or decipher config and make output
[02:45] <green_earz> ebaad: is the right drive installed for the video card ? to check > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/   then run the command dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   and see what video driver installed. the xserver-xorg may be wrong
[02:46] <monitor> build-essentials: no such package.
[02:46] <Pelo> no S
[02:46] <green_earz> ebaad: and see if you can find out what the refresh rates are for the monitor. google for montior info
[02:47] <beyond> hi,all
[02:47] <varsendaggr> where do i change the rightclip play with options?
[02:47] <varsendaggr> click
[02:48] <Pelo> minisplit ?
[02:48] <dewboy3d> ebaad: run xvidtune and post your results
[02:50] <dewboy3d> or if you want to read a bit to understand...http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=83973
[02:52] <dewboy3d> refresh rate (vertical sync) being at 61 is causing your flicker. would probably do much better to get it up to 75. that document will help you
[02:52] <tim167> in Mozilla Sunbird Calendar: can I let days start at 5 am instead of 00h00 ? (I prefer night hours below on screen) thanks!
[02:53] <[erisco] > how do you restart an application through the terminal? Apache2 would be my example
[02:53] <Nlytn_> hi i asked a question about and hour or so ago about several application launching in the background using up 100% cpu and causing my pc to freeze up, ive done a full reinstall of ubuntu edgy now and its still happening :( the programs running that take up all the cpu are "dd" (copy app) "klogd" and "kacpid", ive checked syslog and it is absolutely huge with weird errors
[02:54] <green_earz> [erisco] : sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 restart
[02:54] <Nlytn_> "Ag0e/e(: Ag0e/e(: Ag0e/e: A0 e/e>: " for example in /var/log/messages
[02:54] <Pelo> Nlytn_,  are you running kubuntu ?
[02:54] <Nlytn_> nope just ubuntu
[02:54] <[erisco] > green_earz, thanks
[02:54] <green_earz> np
[02:54] <dabaR> Pelo: those ks are for kernel
[02:55] <Pelo> ok
[02:55] <dewboy3d> why is dd running in background?
[02:55] <ferret0567> Who knows why DD id
[02:55] <Nlytn_> no idea, i have to kill it within 15 secs or so of it starting or it freezes my pc
[02:55] <ferret0567> Who knows why DD is running in the background
[02:55] <dabaR> Nlytn_: it could be some device that is plugged in, do you have anything other than keyboard mouse monitor in terms of peripherals?
[02:56] <Nlytn_> hmmm a webcam
[02:56] <Nlytn_> oh, a bluetooth dongle too
[02:56] <dabaR> Nlytn_: unplug(make it bare), restart, see:)
[02:56] <dewboy3d> neither should be running dd
[02:56] <tim167> Can days start at 5:00 am instead of 0:00 in Mozilla Sunbird ?
[02:56] <dabaR> hates recommending restarts but is not really good at restarting diff services...
[02:56] <Nlytn_> also an ipod mini connector... but its not plugged into ipod
[02:56] <green_earz> [erisco] : and to see what servers there is cd /etc/init.d  and the use the command ls  : which give you a list of what servers that start on boot
[02:57] <tim167> or has anyone a better Calendar program suggestion ?
[02:57] <dabaR> Nlytn_: unplug everything weird. then if it is better, plug one by one in and see which one sucks
[02:57] <dabaR> hehe, that sentence sucked ass
[02:57] <Nlytn_> dabaR: thankyou :)
[02:57] <dabaR> Nlytn_: it is a try, no guarantees
[02:57] <Nlytn_> i take it those errors in syslog are hardware related then?
[02:57] <dewboy3d> tim167: evolution has a calendar
[02:58] <dabaR> Nlytn_: that is the only thing I can think of, but have no real idea what is going on.
[02:58] <Trixsey> If I install something through synpatic, I can see the program under Applications, use commands like $ program & in the terminal etc.. but when I download them manually I can't
[02:58] <Nlytn_> ok
[02:58] <dabaR> Nlytn_: it is an attempt, and you can only try...
[02:58] <Trixsey> how do I make them cool like that? :p
[02:58] <Trixsey> I'd like to "install" a compiled program thats already running.. that is.. have it added to menues etc
[02:59] <dabaR> Trixsey: what did you download for example? is it something compiled?
[02:59] <Trixsey> yes
[02:59] <Trixsey> Azureus
[02:59] <sethk> Trixsey, if you have a shell already running, you have to do this:      hash -r
[02:59] <tim167> dewboy3d:thanks, actually I am used thunderbird for my mails...how does evolution compare to that ?
[02:59] <dabaR> Trixsey: azureus is java, and I am pretty sure they distribute a binary...
[02:59] <Trixsey> can't get it through synpatic, that version is bugged
[02:59] <Trixsey> hash-r on what?
[02:59] <Trixsey> on my file?
[02:59] <Nlytn_> hmmm what is the size figure "ls" displays? bytes? my "messages" is 10277550 :S
[02:59] <Trixsey> executable?
[02:59] <sethk> Trixsey, that flushes the execution path caches and forces the shell to look for any program you try to run.
[02:59] <sethk> Trixsey, no, in the shell, where you said it isn't working when you type the name of the program.
[03:00] <dabaR> Nlytn_: bytes maybe
[03:00] <ssd7_> Can I ask a question that isn't really ubuntu related?
[03:00] <sethk> Trixsey, there's no difference between installing through the gui, or installing manually.
[03:00] <sethk> ssd7_, sure.
[03:00] <dabaR> sethk: you are defining manually as apt-get?
[03:00] <Trixsey> how do you eman?
[03:00] <ebaad> thanks much for help
[03:00] <sethk> dabaR, not defining it at all.
[03:00] <Trixsey> azureus & hash -r?
[03:00] <Trixsey> or
[03:00] <Trixsey> azureus &
[03:00] <Trixsey> hash -r
[03:00] <ebaad>  I think that dpkg command worked and I put the right model of the LCD and it works perfect now
[03:00] <dewboy3d> tim167: works great. i've never had any isues with it. but i haven't used TB on linux yet so i can't offer a comparison
[03:00] <dabaR> sethk: cause there is a diff between compiling and installing a package...
[03:00] <sethk> Trixsey, no, no, _first_.  hash -r _first_
[03:00] <tim167> dewboy3d: and very important to me: can I set days to run from 5 am to 5 am instead of 0:00 to 0:00 in evolution calendar?
[03:00] <ebaad> THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL THE HELP.............
[03:01] <sethk> dabaR, yes, but my answer is correct for that case also.
[03:01] <dabaR> ebaad: glad it worked:)
[03:01] <ebaad> It has been bothering me since yesterday
[03:01] <dewboy3d> let me check. i think it's possible
[03:01] <ebaad> Now I can move forward to other things
[03:01] <Trixsey> trixsey@trixsey:~$ hash -r
[03:01] <Trixsey> trixsey@trixsey:~$ azureus &
[03:01] <Trixsey> [2]  10708
[03:01] <Trixsey> bash: azureus: command not found
[03:01] <Trixsey> ugh
[03:01] <ebaad> THNAKS MUCH
[03:01] <wildchild> why kaffeine doesn't wanna opened itself :s
[03:01] <sethk> Trixsey, did you compile?
[03:01] <wildchild> how can I fix that
[03:01] <Trixsey> no
[03:01] <dabaR> ebaad: welcome.
[03:01] <ssd7_> I downloaded Transarc AFS client from my university; however, I can't figure out how to install it.  There is no readme file that I can find, no make files, just a bunch of directories and executables
[03:01] <Trixsey> I downloaded compiled files
[03:01] <dabaR> sethk: feel like explaining in #ubuntu-offtopic?
[03:01] <sethk> Trixsey, then whatever you think you did to install it manually, really didn't install it.
[03:01] <Trixsey> Like I said, runs perfectly fine.. although it's not "installed"
[03:01] <sethk> dabaR, sure
[03:02] <ebaad> Now u r on my speed dial
[03:02] <Nlytn_> dabaR: ah i found ls -lh prints in kb/mb etc, my messages is 10mb :|
[03:02] <ebaad> just kidding
[03:02] <Trixsey> sethk: it's not installed, thats what I'm saying
[03:02] <Trixsey> it's downloaded compiled executables, and I WOULD LIKE to install them
[03:02] <Trixsey> thus asking how
[03:02] <Trixsey> synpatic gives me a bugged azureus anyway
[03:03] <dewboy3d> tim167: yes it is possible. you can change start and end times for you day in the calendar
[03:03] <tim167> dewboy3d: yet another question: can I sync evolution calendar with a windows user ? ("share" a calendar I mean...)
[03:03] <Pelo> Trixsey,  no  az realy does take that much memory and cpu
[03:03] <ssd7_> Any tips on how I should go about installing this, anything I should be looking for other than make files and readme files?
[03:03] <melot> anyone here teach me how to make a DVD movie from avi file
[03:03] <wildchild> how can I fix that
[03:03] <wildchild> why kaffeine doesn't wanna opened itself :s
[03:03] <dabaR> Trixsey: make a link to the executable file in /usr/bin, with the ln command, see usage with man ln, then add a menu entry with Applications>Accessories>Menu editor
[03:03] <sethk> Trixsey, well, that's a different issue.
[03:04] <dewboy3d> tim167: that i have never tried. no one i would want to share with. you can publish calendars to the web though
[03:04] <sethk> Trixsey, in some cases you can just copy a program to a directory in $PATH, but in other cases the program consists not only of the executable files but other associated files as well.
[03:04] <tim167> dewboy3d: great, I'm gonna check evolution then, maybe switch to that for mail too...thanks!
[03:04] <dabaR> wildchild: how do you try to open it?
[03:05] <green_earz> Trixsey: have you used BitTornado its a very stable client and if you want to go big time check out torrentflux
[03:05] <dewboy3d> melot: try this from ubuntu forums.. http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183936&highlight=avi+to+dvd
[03:05] <Trixsey> I do prefer Azureus
[03:05] <melot> thanks
[03:05] <melot> ill try dewboy3d
[03:06] <Pelo> Trixsey,  torrent works very well on wine , only a few minor things don't work
[03:06] <wildchild> dabaR by clicking on it multimedia -> kaffeine
[03:06] <Trixsey> I wasn't asking for alternatives :p
[03:06] <Pelo> fine
[03:06] <dabaR> wildchild: try in a terminal see the errors if any
[03:06] <Coir> Does anyone know which linux image would be best to use with a Core 2 Duo, and if it will make much dif. using Parallels?
[03:07] <dabaR> sethk: he should make a link imo.
[03:07] <Pelo> Trixsey,   az just got a new version out anyway, wait a while and there will be a ubu package
[03:07] <wildchild> dabaR; in terminal nothing happens when I write kaffeine and then enter :S
[03:07] <sethk> dabaR, no particular advantage to using a link
[03:07] <kyconquers> how do I reconfigure a new sound card?
[03:07] <dabaR> wildchild: nothing never happens, there is always something, what do you mean exactly?
[03:08] <sethk> wildchild, nothing is about the only thing that can't happen
[03:08] <dabaR> wildchild: hangs?
[03:08] <dabaR> hehe
[03:08] <wildchild> dabaR: look:
[03:08] <wildchild> q@umbrella:~$ kaffeine
[03:08] <wildchild> q@umbrella:~$
[03:08] <bimberi> Coir: Edgy?  -generic should be fine  Dapper? -686-smp
[03:08] <wildchild> this happened...
[03:08] <dabaR> ok, so it returns to the prompt...
[03:09] <dabaR> wildchild: sudo apt-get install --reinstall kaffeine will reinstall it...
[03:09] <sethk> wildchild, that means it found kaffeine, executed it, and the program did not raise any errors.
[03:09] <dabaR> sethk: ya, but it ended without doing anything...
[03:10] <Trixsey> If I do compile it myself, would it be "installed" then?
[03:10] <sethk> dabaR, anything _visible_
[03:10] <dabaR> sethk: right
[03:10] <sethk> Trixsey, there is a step in compiling, "make install", that installs the program
[03:10] <dabaR> Trixsey: I told you what to do if you want $azureus<enter> to work, and have a menu item
[03:10] <sethk> Trixsey, by default in /usr/local instead of /usr, so you need to make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH
[03:11] <sethk> Trixsey, but it's not usually the best thing to do.
[03:11] <Trixsey> dabaR: Making a link didn't work.. azureus starts but craches
[03:11] <dabaR> Trixsey: what is the error message?
[03:11] <Trixsey> crashes*
[03:12] <musicuser> can any one unban me from ubuntu-xgl i just join and says i'm banned
[03:12] <wildchild> I reinstalled kaffeine and still nothing _visible_ happens...

[03:12] <dabaR> musicuser: ask on #ubuntu-ops if you don't get an answer here.
[03:12] <musicuser> oh ok
[03:13] <naitmer> hi
[03:13] <naitmer> someone knows the difference between the 32 and 64 bits versions of ubuntu?
[03:13] <dabaR> Trixsey: but it works if you run azureus in the directory you installed it in?
[03:14] <Trixsey> dabaR: sure
[03:14] <Trixsey> works perfectly fine
[03:14] <Trixsey> when was it released, yesterday?
[03:14] <dabaR> naitmer: that is not a great question, cause a possible answer is "one is for 32 bit computers, and other is for 64 bit computers"
[03:14] <Trixsey> (Azureus)
[03:14] <Trixsey> then I might as well wait for the new version to surface on synpatic
[03:14] <naitmer> yes, i know that, but is there an apreciable difference?
[03:14] <dabaR> Trixsey: it crashes now cause it does not like something, I don't feel like explaining.
[03:15] <Trixsey> I did just like you said anyways
[03:15] <dabaR> Trixsey: delete the link, add an alias to your /etc/bash.bashrc file, do you know how?
[03:15] <Trixsey> nah.. nvm that :P I'll wait untill Azureus is out in version 2.5 in synpatic
[03:15] <Trixsey> untill then I'll just use this folder on the desktop

[03:15] <dabaR> Trixsey: sounds good to me:)
[03:15] <Trixsey> it works anyway.. was just "ugly" :p
[03:16] <w30> naitmer, 64 bit gives problems with flash player and RealPlayer and wmv9 because the 64 bit versions are not available yet.
[03:16] <dabaR> naitmer: 64 bit does not have as simple installation of certain programs, like flash
[03:17] <w30> naitmer, there are work arounds but if you really don't need 64 bit and just want a desktop go for the 32 bit version
[03:17] <tim167> in Evolution calendar I can set the day to start and end at 5:00 am, but it is still displayed as 0:00 to 0:00, I want the topmost on the screen to be 5:00 and the bottom most 4:30, is that possible ?
[03:17] <naitmer> so you strongly recommend the 32 bit ver despite i have a 64bit cpu?
[03:18] <kyconquers> I know which chipset my sound card needs, but I need help enabling the card. aplay -l returns no cards. I have the emu10k1 chipset card.
[03:18] <w30> naitmer, remember 32 bit will run faster on a 64 bit computer than on a 32 bit computer
[03:19] <w30> naitmer, 64 bit really gains in apps written especially for 64 bit like data base stuff I suppose?
[03:19] <plagerism> Okay I am having the weirdest problem. I wrote a simple shell script to create a directory cd into the created directory and then create some files and stuff based on a list of files.  The first time it ran through everything seemed to work fine, however I had to stop it to do something else(I was gonna put it in screen cause it will take a while).  However now it cant create the directories.  I can personally cr
[03:19] <plagerism> eate the directory with mkdir, however I get permission denied from within the script. I unmounted remounted the volume, checked lsof, checked dmesg,checked permissions of everything and nothing seems to tell me why I cant do what I want to do.  Any other ideas?
[03:19] <dabaR> naitmer: depending on how you intend to use your system. the 32 bit version will be better for desktop everyday usage likely. but you forego some advantages of a kernel built specifically for your hardware, which would be advantageous for a server, for example. I do not recommend either really, don't know enough about it to make sense
[03:20] <dabaR> plagerism: post script on pastebin, and check permissions.
[03:20] <green_earz> kyconquers: sudo aptitude install modconf     the fire it up sudo modconf and track down you sound card driver and install it
[03:21] <w30> naitmer, 64 bit Linux is nuthin' new its been around for years on server machines.
[03:21] <kyconquers> green_earz: how would I track down my driver? and install it?
[03:22] <green_earz> kyconquers: and to check what the driver is for the card check out > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
[03:22] <w30> naitmer, I have been on 64 bit for a year on AMD x86_64 cpu
[03:22] <green_earz> kyconquers: install modconf and then fire it up and start looking for it the auido section
[03:23] <tim167> I am looking for a Calendar program that can display days starting from 5am and ending at 4am, evolution doesn't do that... thanks!
[03:23] <w30> naitmer, but I don't know why, just to say I run 64 bit I guess, maybe because I liked dual guads on my race car too just to brag.
[03:23] <plagerism> dabar script posted http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33589/.  It does really nothing except creates directories right now
[03:23] <plagerism> permissions of directories are fine
[03:24] <ryanakca> "apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName"... what do I do to set it?
[03:25] <dabaR> plagerism: I suppose you are asked for a dir name to create then the dir is created, then you cd to the parent dir?
[03:25] <plagerism> yea I removed some of the script for testing
[03:25] <plagerism> create the directory && cd to the directory && create the files
[03:25] <plagerism> so if the directory exists it does nothing for that listing
[03:26] <plagerism> But it wont create the damn files
[03:26] <dabaR> plagerism: oh, it reads the whole thing from the listing file?
[03:26] <plagerism> yes
[03:27] <stiffme1983> hello everyone
[03:27] <bruenig> !hi | stiffme1983
[03:27] <ubotu> stiffme1983: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:27] <Beforewisdom> Hi.  Does anyone know how to get MPlayer to STOP skipping all of the extra stuff at the start of a dvd?
[03:27] <illiad> hello all :)
[03:27] <plagerism> Duh nevermind I figured it out
[03:27] <plagerism> STUPID
[03:27] <stiffme1983> can i get kernel source in edgy?
[03:27] <dabaR> plagerism: and what does the cd .. do? it did not really change directory as far as I could tell.
[03:27] <dabaR> when I ran it...
[03:28] <plagerism> dabaR I removed some of the code
[03:28] <stiffme1983> the kernel in edgy seems lag in my laptop
[03:28] <kyconquers> I ran modconf and found that the module should already be loaded.
[03:28] <plagerism> Just a stupid logic error, thanks dabaR
[03:28] <dabaR> plagerism: you got it fixed?
[03:28] <plagerism> yea it was a silly logic error tis all
[03:28] <dabaR> so now you are good? all fixed?
[03:29] <illiad> just a quick question, i have forgotten how to burn an iso to cdrom... can i use dd or cc i can't remember what it was called....
[03:29] <green_earz> kyconquers: lsmod and see if you can see it
[03:29] <Beforewisdom> Hi.  Does anyone know how to get MPlayer to STOP skipping all of the extra stuff at the start of a dvd?
[03:29] <dabaR> illiad: right click on iso burn to disc or some like option
[03:29] <plagerism> The reason why it worked the first is because none of the directories existed.  The second time the first directory existed it when back one and the second directory got permission denied
[03:29] <Beforewisdom> Okay, thanks anyway
[03:29] <dabaR> plagerism: I was thinking the same exact thing:)
[03:29] <Beforewisdom> Bye
[03:30] <dabaR> Beforewisdom: cya

[03:53] <z9999> The next step does not display any wireless devices.
[03:53] <zelda276> on a partition: does free space = no files?
[03:54] <dabaR> zelda276: only if free space = available space
[03:54] <hovdo> dabar: thx i know that it can work that way,  i wanted to try to not touch the xp drive at all. and have the grub on the linux drive. i just dont know during the install which i am now running which drive he thinks is the hd0 hd1 hd2
[03:54] <coz_> zelda276, if you mean windows then no not necessarily, free the mft reserve will be seen as free space
[03:54] <dabaR> well, partition size, not available space
[03:54] <zelda276> dabar: thx
[03:54] <tonyyarusso> zelda276: In general, that means you haven't formatted it, so it's not even usable yet
[03:55] <zelda276> is there a more detailed partition guide than the one at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/forum/installation/Partitioning
[03:55] <dabaR> hovdo: hd0 is the master ide hard drive, hd1 is the slave, and so on.
[03:55] <tonyyarusso> zelda276: Not likely...
[03:55] <dabaR> tonyyarusso: still have the stats for the chan?
[03:56] <tonyyarusso> dabaR: Yeah - haven't done any analysis (I had been ambitious and thought I could extract # nicks info), but the activity graphs are up
[03:57] <stalefries> Hey, anyone know how I can enable seahorse network key sharing?
[03:57] <dabaR> tonyyarusso: :)
[03:57] <dabaR> tonyyarusso: I was motivated by them for a while:)
[03:57] <tonyyarusso> dabaR: Did pretty well too, iirc
[03:57] <catalytic> when you run export
[03:57] <stalefries> !seahorse
[03:57] <ubotu> seahorse: A Gnome front end for GnuPG. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.5-1ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 1560 kB, installed size 5528 kB
[03:57] <hovdo> dabar: thx i found that on some forums grub thinks different after it is installed, i just didnt wanted to make a mistake. thx for help
[03:58] <catalytic> is that showing the settings for an X11 script?
[03:58] <catalytic> and if so, where is it?
[03:58] <dabaR> hovdo: welcome.
[04:00] <catalytic> anyone  know what the export function is dumping out?
[04:00] <stalefries> Does anyone here use seahorse?
[04:00] <Xenguy> catalytic: environmental variables  ?
[04:00] <catalytic> ok
[04:00] <catalytic> are they stored somewhere?
[04:01] <catalytic> in a file?
[04:01] <fnf> Hi, can anyone please tell me is this possible to change/route IRQ in Linux ?. I seem to be having problem with IRQ conflict with my video and network card.
[04:01] <Xenguy> catalytic: hrm, maybe not
[04:01] <catalytic> so i can add a manual entry that will be added every startup?
[04:01] <catalytic> im trying to add this command
[04:01] <catalytic> export MAYA_MMSET_DEFAULT_XCURSOR=1;
=== cari_tmen_ce is now known as co_ruwet
[04:01] <stalefries> catalytic: stick that in your ~/.bashrc
[04:01] <catalytic> ok
[04:01] <stalefries> at the end
[04:01] <catalytic> cheers
[04:01] <Xenguy> catalytic: hrm, compare with 'set'
[04:02] <stalefries> Bummer, I was hoping someone could help me with seahorse. I'll check google/the forums
[04:02] <catalytic> use set instead?
[04:02] <tonyyarusso> stalefries: Perhaps - what about it?
[04:02] <Xenguy> catalytic: no, what stalefries said
[04:02] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: network key sharing
[04:02] <naitmer> this can seem a bit noob question but.. what is journalism as for file system?
[04:02] <Xenguy> catalytic: I'm just exploring a bit
[04:03] <naitmer> journaling i mean
[04:03] <catalytic> erm
[04:03] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: I get errors about loading something or other on login, pretty non-descript
[04:03] <catalytic> just stick it anywhere in there?
[04:03] <stalefries> !journaling
[04:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about journaling - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:03] <naitmer> i tryed that :P
[04:03] <stalefries> catalytic: at the end is best, for tidyness
[04:03] <tonyyarusso> stalefries: Hmm, sorry.  I got nothing on that.
[04:03] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: oh well
[04:04] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: don't even know what it would do, but sounds interesting :)
[04:04] <catalytic> do i need to end it with a ;
[04:04] <catalytic> ?
[04:04] <stalefries> nah
[04:04] <catalytic> ok thanks

[04:07] <z9999> Does anyone knowwhat channel to join for help getting wireless to work in Ubuntu?
[04:08] <stalefries> !wireless
[04:08] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[04:08] <tonyyarusso> z9999: This one - just ask your question and see if anyone with an answer is about.  ^^ is a good place to start.
[04:08] <stalefries> z9999: otherwise, stick around here and ask :)
[04:09] <feross> z9999: Very easy...install Network Manager, comment out everything in /etc/network/interfaces except the lo device and remove the default gnome network applet from tray.. done
[04:10] <catalytic> hmmm
[04:10] <catalytic> it worked for a while
[04:10] <Zambezi> Is it possible to ban a person here which has misbeahaved really bad in the Swedish channel?
[04:10] <catalytic> now the poxy big black X for x11 is back
[04:10] <catalytic> how can i stop it from doing that and using the proper mouse pointer?
[04:10] <davey486> Has anyone got a kodak docking station to print with edgy?
[04:11] <Xenguy> Zambezi: oh stop your witch hunt and political correctness
[04:11] <naitmer> has anyone loaded an ubuntu live cd with 192mb of ram? :S
[04:11] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: it seems I need some sort of zeroconf networking
[04:11] <stalefries> naitmer: 128 here
[04:11] <Admiral_Buttercr> winecfg, cant access sound tab, diablo II no sound, getting an error about non existant directory
[04:11] <naitmer> it wont do it arg
[04:11] <MarianoGuerra> a friend of mine installed dapper with 128 MB of RAM
[04:11] <MarianoGuerra> i dont know how :D
[04:12] <stalefries> it hurts
[04:12] <Pelo> davey486,  is your docking station listed in CUPS  ?
[04:12] <naitmer> it stops at the window manager loading screen
[04:12] <stalefries> I ran ubuntu for a while (full gnome) with 64
[04:12] <Zambezi> Xenguy, I can translate it later. He'll be banned in Swedish channel later.
[04:12] <davey486> i don't think so
[04:12] <zelda276> how much ram does the gimp use?
[04:12] <tonyyarusso> stalefries: Aaah.
[04:12] <Pelo> davey486,  ...   check
[04:12] <Xenguy> Zambezi: I'm just personally tired of censors and lawyers :P
[04:13] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: it was because one of my ram slots borked
[04:13] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: I later bought a stick of 256, that's all I have now
[04:13] <silent_scream> hey all, does anyone know how to set up the joypad in cedega??

[04:14] <Admiral_Buttercr> Does anyone know how to get sound to work in WINE?
[04:14] <Pelo> Admiral_Buttercr,  join #winehq
[04:14] <Zambezi> Xenguy, Okay, but this guy really deseves it. ;-) He bullied me and was rude to all the other in the channel.
[04:14] <Admiral_Buttercr> ty
[04:14] <Pelo> Zambezi,  so just /ignore him
[04:14] <Xenguy> Zambezi: I'm going to bite my tongue (hard) now -- excuse me :p
[04:15] <silent_scream> anyone using cedega?
[04:15] <silent_scream> k i'll wait
[04:15] <Zambezi> Pelo, I'll too, but I weren't sure how I did. Thanks for the tip.
[04:16] <stalefries> silent_scream: have your tried joining #cedega ?
[04:16] <Xenguy> Zambezi: this may work to /ignore replies too: ignore -replies -time 1800
[04:16] <silent_scream> stalefries, yup... everyone in there is sleeping i suppose
[04:16] <Xenguy> Zambezi: this may work to /ignore replies too: /ignore -replies -time 1800
[04:16] <stalefries> silent_scream: hmm
[04:18] <Zambezi> Xenguy, I save the commands. But it became personal, so I'll ignore him here and get him banned in the Swedish channel. :-)
[04:18] <silent_scream> it seems you guys are my last chance :d
[04:18] <davey486> pelo: cups sees my printer as an eastmen kodak company kodak easyshare printer dock 3
[04:18] <Pelo> davey486,  and does it work
[04:18] <Pelo> ?
[04:19] <davey486> pelo: no, I can't get my computer to print anything through it, it sends the jobs to the spooler but they never go out
[04:20] <z9999> feross: When you say default gnome network applet, do you mean the 2 icons that look like monitors on top of the screen? One of them displays Network connection: eth0, and the other displays No network connection when pointed to, and if I right click and display About, they both display Network Manager Applet 0.6.2.
[04:20] <z9999> I'm really new to Linux so I'm not real familiar with all the terms used yet.
[04:20] <silent_scream> think i got it
[04:20] <Pelo> davey486,  try setting it up through  system > admin > printers ,  or try looking up your modle number in the forum , maybe you'll find an howto
[04:21] <davey486> I tried loooking in the forum, but there is no recent threads, i was just hoping to run into someone that night have had a little luck
[04:22] <silent_scream> no i didn't
[04:23] <davey486> I downloaded the cd iso and the dvd iso, i did an install with both and didn't notice a difference, is there something that i moissed?
[04:24] <Pelo> davey486,   the  cd is the first of a series of 6 or 7  that contain all the packages available in synaptic,  the dvd contains everyting,    when you just install with the first cd you get everything else onile
[04:24] <Pelo> online e
[04:24] <Pelo> -e
[04:25] <davey486> I did the dvd install and the cd, but the installed the same packages
[04:26] <Pelo> davey486,  that is only for the default install,  if you want/need extra packages   you need the other cds  the dvd or synaptic will get them online from repos
[04:26] <Pelo> davey486,  there are 20k plus packages listed in syanptic
[04:27] <davey486> in one's opinion, would it be worth it to stay with dapper for the 3 year support or go with edgy for the newer features?
[04:27] <Pelo> stay with dapper
[04:27] <cmweb> Support is better
[04:27] <crimsun_> davey486, if using the absolute latest isn't your top priority, use 6.06.1
[04:27] <bimberi> davey486: the dvd would have a repository with lots of additional packages
[04:28] <davey486> thats what i was thinking, i upgraded to edgy and it made a mess so i did a clean install of edgy, but im not noticing a whole lot that makes a difference toi me
[04:29] <Pelo> meaning it works fine now
[04:29] <davey486> do you have edgy pelo?
[04:29] <Pelo> I do now
[04:29] <davey486> did you do the upgrade?
[04:29] <pppoe_dude> hi
[04:29] <Pelo> I am having some minor problems with  mimetype
[04:30] <pppoe_dude> how do i disable tooltips in gnome panels?
[04:30] <gotta_luv_tux> crimsun_: If I am using the 6.06 version, will I get the same software versions and kernels as newer versions of ubuntu?
[04:30] <gotta_luv_tux> through updates that is
[04:30] <Pelo> davey486,  after I updated online I had to dl the dvd and make a clean install,  I realy wasn'T up to "fixing" the problems that the update caused
[04:31] <davey486> yeah me too, maybe on there next release they'll fix it
[04:31] <davey486> that is the update process
[04:32] <Pelo> davey486,  and the update took forever ,  I think it is possible to update from the dvd /cd , but I am not sure, that would probably have been quicker
[04:32] <Pelo> gotta_luv_tux,  I think you probably would
[04:32] <bimberi> gotta_luv_tux: no.  older releases get security and major bugfixes which doesn't necessarily keep them at the latest
[04:33] <nullcode> is ubuntu user familiar ?
[04:33] <davey486> have a goo night, I'm off to downgrade to dapper and then spend the night making my computer feel like home again
[04:33] <davey486> goo=god
[04:33] <Pelo> nullcode,  do you mean user freindly ?
[04:33] <davey486> goo=god=good

[04:35] <wulfy814> I only have webmin access to a 6.06 server
[04:35] <Pelo> nullcode,  it's the distro that's getting ppl to switch from MS  to linux
[04:35] <wulfy814> I can't ssh into it
[04:35] <kitche> nullcode: it's more user friendly then other distros out there
[04:35] <Pelo> nullcode,  do not pm me
[04:35] <wulfy814> don't have physical access at the moment
[04:35] <crimsun_> gotta_luv_tux, no, you won't.
[04:35] <wulfy814> ssh appears to be starting ok
[04:35] <Sh0gun> help plz with "command not found"
[04:35] <wulfy814> and netstat -nl | grep 22 show's port 22 is listening

[04:35] <nullcode> Pelo , sorry
[04:36] <crimsun_> gotta_luv_tux, that's why we release every six months (so that people who absolutely die without the latest and greatest have a chance to get them)
[04:36] <nullcode> can you even read what i said and answer me here ?
[04:36] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: I can't find anything on the seahorse network key sharing!
[04:36] <cmweb> anyone? Does anyone even run a webserver....
[04:36] <nullcode> what about the hardware drivers pelo ?
[04:36] <Pelo> nullcode,   I didn'T get any problems with the hardware but I have nothing fancy on my computer
[04:36] <Pahalial> cmweb: #php might be more relevant...?
[04:37] <gotta_luv_tux> crimsun_: so what is the befit to using the 6.06 LTS version
[04:37] <cmweb> Pahalial: no, not necessarily
[04:37] <crimsun_> gotta_luv_tux, three years of desktop support
[04:37] <gotta_luv_tux> crimsun_: Thanks
[04:37] <bieb> I am having a software raid issue....
[04:37] <bieb> I have an old Dell Dimension, I have 1 ide HDD for the OS, and 2 IDE HDDs that I want to put in Raid1 to backup some files from my home PC,
[04:37] <bieb> I have installed 6.06 from the alternate CD, and setup the Raid on those 2 drives, but when Ubuntu loads, they are not in Raid or mounted or formatted
[04:37] <crimsun_> gotta_luv_tux, in other words, when you file a support request, we look at LTS releases first
[04:37] <tonyyarusso> stalefries: Does seahorse have an irc channel?
[04:38] <age2sddgd> hi
[04:38] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: haven't checked
[04:38] <tonyyarusso> crimsun_: fyi, my mic currently works on Feisty - hoping it stays until release :)
[04:38] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: yes, #seahorse!
[04:38] <nullcode> is there a way to install ubuntu over many pcs at the same time ?
[04:38] <crimsun_> tonyyarusso, no reason why it wouldn't unless you make me angry and I break it.
[04:38] <stalefries> tonyyarusso: but the only other 2 people on are away
[04:39] <tonyyarusso> crimsun_: Hehe.  Just b/c things like to break?
[04:39] <wulfy814> any ideas on why I can't ssh in?
[04:40] <bieb> ssh not running?
[04:40] <crimsun_> tonyyarusso, no, because it's a moving target
[04:40] <nullcode> firewall ?
[04:40] <kitche> wulfy814: have you opened your ssh port?
[04:40] <nullcode> router ?
[04:40] <bieb> ssh config?
[04:40] <kitche> wulfy814: by default ubuntu has no ports open

[04:50] <gpled> crimsun: two. have one on board, but added a pci for performance issues
[04:51] <crimsun_> gpled, pastebin ``asoundconf list && cat /etc/asound.conf ~/.asoundrc*'', and indicate which one you want to use

[04:51] <bieb> wulfy.. check the sshd.conf file too
[04:51] <feross> z9999: do a 'ps aux|grep nm-applet' and see if it's running
[04:51] <bieb> gpled.. any ideas?
[04:52] <z9999> feross: Yes it is running
[04:52] <feross> z9999: do you see it in the tray?
[04:53] <gpled> bieb: iv done software rade with centos. have not tried it with ubuntu.  it worked with centos
[04:53] <stiffme1983> is there a benchmark software to test the performance of the kernel?
[04:53] <bieb> whats weird is... If I look at the 2 drives/partitions in gparted, it has them flagged as raid
[04:54] <itiel> ubuntu-es
[04:54] <gpled> bieb: does it seem to have issue with you putting the os on another drive, instead of the raid?
[04:54] <haxality> actually yeah, is there a benchmarking program for linux?

[04:56] <ubotu> floating: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[04:56] <Pelo> Gaygot992,   /join #winehq
[04:56] <feross> bieb: so did you partiton it?
[04:56] <floating> wasn't samba to make server for windows machines to connect my files
[04:56] <wapityyy> guys ?
[04:57] <stalefries> floating: it works both ways
[04:57] <gpled> crimsun:  only thing i get is from asoundconf list : AudioPCI
[04:57] <bieb> ok feross.. here is what I have done.. I installed Ubuntu 6.06 with the alternate CD
[04:57] <itiel> Initializing package states... Done
[04:57] <itiel> E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[04:57] <wapityyy> :(
[04:57] <feross> z9999: acually you shou just click on it and it will display the networks available
[04:57] <floating> ok thx
[04:57] <crimsun_> gpled, so that's your ensoniq
[04:57] <stalefries> itiel, do 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
[04:57] <asfalt> speaking of samba, would it be possible to mount a local ntfs partition and use it from smb://localhost ? as to access ntfs read/write without using the ntfs rw support ?
[04:57] <stalefries> asfalt: nope
[04:57] <Pelo> wapityyy,   you'Re not being ignored,  there just isn'T anyone that can help around right now
[04:57] <bieb> during the partitioning, I selected 2 drives, set them to format as Linux Raid...
[04:58] <twb> ubotu pxe
[04:58] <gpled> crimsun: ensoniq?
[04:58] <ubotu> pxe: free PX daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.4.2-4 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 136 kB
[04:58] <itiel> it's the error thats view when I to install amsn in the ubuntu
[04:58] <z9999> feross: When I point to it, it displays Network Connection: eth0, and right clicking displays a pull down showing Properties, Help, About, Remove from Panel, Move and Lock to Panel.
[04:58] <crimsun_> gpled, your sound card
[04:58] <twb> ubotu: network-boot
[04:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about network-boot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:58] <crimsun_> gpled, does muting 'External Amplifier' help?
[04:58] <stalefries> itiel, do you know a language other than English?
[04:58] <wapityyy> this is really bothering ;(
[04:58] <feross> z9999: ok that's the default gnome applet.. remove that one
[04:58] <bieb> gave them a mount point, then followed the "software raid" setup in the partitioner, after the install was done.. I reboot the system, the drives are seen as individual drives
[04:58] <Pelo> wapityyy,  try looking up your problem in the forum
[04:59] <bieb> if I look at the drives with gparted, they show as "raid" flagged
[04:59] <itiel> i speak spanish
[04:59] <epp> how do i know what chipset my wireless card has?
[04:59] <stalefries> !es | itiel
[04:59] <ubotu> itiel: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:59] <feross> z9999: if Network Manager is already installed you should see another icon similar to the gnome one.. it might look like bars
[04:59] <stalefries> itiel: escribe '/join #ubuntu-es'
[05:00] <itiel> ok
[05:00] <kitche> eep: who's your maker of the card?
[05:00] <z9999> feross: The only remaining icons are for updates, battery, speaker, and the clock
[05:00] <feross> bieb: in gparted can you create a partition? although you have the drives as a RAID it does not mean that they have a partition on them.
[05:01] <epp> how do i know what chipset my wireless card has?
[05:01] <twb> Does anyone know where I can find information about turning the Ubuntu LiveCD into a pxe (netboot) client?
[05:01] <itiel> jajajaja
[05:01] <stalefries> itiel: andaba eso?
[05:01] <bieb> Feross.. in gparted when I select one of the drives set for raid... Partition = /dev/hdc1, Filesystem = unknown, size = 298.09gb, and Flags = raid
[05:01] <itiel> I the one usuarios
[05:01] <cheatersrealm> http://channels.debian.net/paste/4588  <- I get this when I boot with my syba sata card (si3114 chipset)
[05:01] <cheatersrealm> any ideas?
[05:01] <gpled> crimsun: where do i mute External Amplifier at?
[05:02] <feross> bieb: if you r click on it what options do you have.. can you crete a new partition or is it grayed out
[05:02] <bieb> if I clisck the partition, and then partition on the toolbar, it gives me "delete, format to, and information"
[05:02] <bieb> grayed out
[05:02] <feross> z9999: that's strange.. run 'ps aux|grep nm-applet'  is it running?
[05:03] <epp> whats the command to find out what chipset and info about my wireless card?
[05:03] <feross> epp: lspci
[05:03] <wulfy814> nmap of my server shows port 22 open
[05:03] <wulfy814> but I'm getting
[05:03] <epp> feross, thanks
[05:03] <VigoFusion> epp: You can use Synaptic to view that.
[05:03] <wulfy814> connection closed when attempting to ssh into it
[05:03] <bieb> feross.. if I select format to, then ext3, it fails
[05:03] <crimsun_> gpled, use the volume control applet, or amixer, or alsamixer, or ...
[05:03] <wulfy814> how can I remove ssh and reinstall it with default permissions and settings/
[05:04] <kitche> wulfy814: ok it's your firewall most likely
[05:04] <VigoFusion> epp: Or the Device Manager> System>Device Manager
[05:04] <feross> bieb: try breaking the raid.. partiton.. and format.. then setup as raid
[05:04] <z9999> feross: Yes it showsrunning
[05:04] <wulfy814> I don't believe I have a firewall
[05:04] <bieb> how do I break the raid?
[05:05] <asfalt> wulfy does ssh work when you do it locally?
[05:05] <kitche> wulf814: all linux's have a firewall it's called iptables
[05:05] <VigoFusion> wulfy814: What version?
[05:05] <feross> z9999: hate to say this but try reboot and then it should show up in tray.. or you can try restart udev
[05:05] <wulfy814> asfalt: I don't have local access to the box
[05:05] <wulfy814> VigoFusion: 6.06
[05:05] <floating> Is there another method for connecting a computer in LAN, than samba ? I heard there is , but I can't locate anything with my xubuntu atm
[05:05] <z9999> feross: I'll try a reboot
[05:05] <feross> bieb: I don't have a raid to play around with but there must be some option there to break it..
[05:06] <levander> You know how you can use xvidtune or xrandr to move the X desktop around on the monitor a little?  How do I do the same thing for gdm?
[05:06] <kitche> wulf814: you should have a pm from ubotu
[05:06] <VigoFusion> wulfy814: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/
[05:06] <bieb> feross, should I delete the partitions in gparted?
[05:06] <feross> bieb: it wont hurt
[05:06] <wulfy814> Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer is what I get when I ssh from the box
[05:07] <bieb> ok.. then I can format with ext3?
[05:07] <bieb> then how to re-raid?
[05:07] <wapityyy> my windows will not boot anymore :( I just see 'starting up...' and nothing else after the grub menu
[05:07] <wapityyy> any help ??
[05:07] <levander> wapityyy: i think i had that before, and had to reinstall grub
[05:07] <feross> bieb: prolly ctrl+click on both partitions and then right-click raid
[05:08] <levander> wapityyy: you can reinstall grub from the livecd
[05:08] <VigoFusion> By default the system has its own security installed and pre configured. Mine passed grc.com and a few Linux tst sites.
[05:08] <levander> wapityyy: google around though, i'm not 100% sure
[05:08] <wapityyy> levander: hum ok
[05:08] <darwin> How can you tell what repo a package came from?
[05:10] <VigoFusion> Ratso, AYBABTU did not play? ARRRRGHH!
[05:11] <gpled> crimsun: so it seams the the trouble is in not knowing which sound card should be in use?
[05:12] <darwin> Can synaptic or dpkg show which repo a package came from? I tried reinstalling a package and I'm getting a message that it can't be downloaded.
[05:12] <z9999> feross: It's rebooting now, but the icon now only shows Wired Network connection, and iwconfig no shows lo and eth0, but I believe I will have to configure eth0 to get a wired connection to work as we are using a fixed IP, but still no indication of wireless connections. ndiswrapper -l still shows driver and hardware present.
[05:12] <jturek> how do i setup vesafb 1280 x 8 for my virtual consoles?
[05:13] <wapityyy> levander: hum, didnt work ;(
[05:13] <cmwe1> Did a supybot come thisa way?
[05:13] <z9999> feross: that should read iwconfig NOW shows, NOT, no shows. Poor typist.
[05:14] <Pelo> cmwe1,  just /whois him/her and if he/she's on the network you'll get a list of channels
[05:14] <gpled> when i hit test, in sound preferences, should it just beep?
[05:14] <feross> z9999: hmm, I didn't know you were using ndiswrapper... you might have to play around with network manager to get it working with the card. I never used ndiswrapper so I wouldn't be much help.. sorry
[05:14] <cmwe1> it logs in with a diffrent name every time im unsure of the name
[05:14] <cmwe1> administrator`, list
[05:15] <administrator`> cmwe1: Admin, Channel, Config, Greet, Herald, Misc, Owner, Traffic, User, and Webopedia
[05:15] <cmwe1> DANG
[05:15] <kitche> wasn't that banned once already?
[05:15] <cmwe1> administrator`, quit
[05:15] <administrator`> cmwe1: Error: You don't have the owner capability. If you think that you should have this capability, be sure that you are identified before trying again. The 'whoami' command can tell you if you're identified.
[05:15] <jturek> um why is this bot here? shoo shoo!
[05:16] <cmwe1> i got to log out and back in to kill it
[05:17] <z9999> feross: I was thinking everyone used ndiswrapper, It was very difficult to find software that would install with ndiswrapper for the wireless chip I'm using but finally found one that would install, but unable to show wlan0 or eth1 anywhere at this point so I can't proceed any further.
[05:17] <cmweb> ok to kill it
[05:17] <cmweb> administrator`, quit
[05:17] <Paradox-Ubuntu> can anyone help me to get WINE working?
[05:17] <Paradox-Ubuntu> or is that like a bad word here?
[05:17] <Paradox-Ubuntu> lol
[05:17] <bimberi> !wine | Paradox-Ubuntu
[05:17] <ubotu> Paradox-Ubuntu: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[05:17] <cmweb> gone at last
[05:18] <bimberi> Paradox-Ubuntu: not particularly bad :)
[05:18] <feross> z9999: nah, depending on the card you use there are linux drivers for them.
[05:18] <jturek> !vesafb
[05:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vesafb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:19] <Paradox-Ubuntu> ok i have two "WINE" apps in my application manager and ran the updator... but windows programs still dont seem to be working
[05:19] <red|rain> does anyone know where "imagemagick" gets installed to?
[05:19] <kitche> red|rain: imagemagick: isn't just one program it's a 3 to 4 programs
[05:19] <Pelo> Paradox-Ubuntu, #winehq
[05:19] <VigoFusion> I would think Applications?
[05:20] <red|rain> kitche, ahh ok, i'm just wonding because coppermine is asking for the location of it.
[05:20] <VigoFusion> red|rain: try looking in your Home Folder
[05:20] <Paradox-Ubuntu> ty Pelo
[05:20] <bimberi> red|rain: 'dpkg -L imagemagick | grep bin' will show you the commands
[05:21] <kitche> red|rain: but most likely it's probably in /usr/bin
[05:21] <Gaygot992> no one knows shyt in #winehq don't bother
[05:21] <VigoFusion> <<<<<is linuxly challenged, to much windoze time and way too little coffee
[05:22] <z9999> feross: Well it looks like any card using Broadcom 4311 chipset is one to avoid. Broadcom tells me they just make the chip and provide no support to end users, Compaq just says they don't support Linux, so it makes me feel like everyone is in bed with Microsoft. I can't understand why a chip maker would not make their chip specs public as they should be trying to sell chips. When I buy...
[05:22] <z9999> ...hardware I don't want to be tied to any particular piece of software,and I am trying to get ready to avoid Vista, and just move everything over to Linux here.
[05:22] <red|rain> kitche, bimberi thanks ^_^
[05:23] <daaaman64> I am trying to do this: "mencoder snorlax.flv -o snorlax.avi -ovc mjpeg -oac pcm"  however I keep getting "Error parsing option on the command line: -ovc"  Is there something else I need to install?? I think I have the right ovc value...
[05:24] <jml> hello!
[05:24] <daaaman64> No one knows why I am stupid?
[05:24] <jml> I'm installing edgy on a Thinkpad T22 which is missing its monitor. I've got an external monitor plugged in.
[05:25] <feross> z9999: yeah, it's well worth looking into linux support before buying hardware.. I made that mistake with the video card.. SiS doesn't support 3D :( ..
[05:25] <VigoFusion> Admitting it is the first step.
[05:25] <Sh0gun> how do i get online using dial-up??
[05:25] <kitche> !dialip|Sh0gun
[05:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dialip - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:25] <kitche> !dialup|Sh0gun
[05:25] <ubotu> Sh0gun: You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[05:25] <eck> Sh0gun: in linux? with great difficulty
[05:25] <Sh0gun> thx
[05:25] <jml> Everything goes fine for a while. I see the ubuntu logo and the orange progress bar. However, at some point, the display goes blank, the laptop makes the ubuntu sound and nothing more happens.
[05:26] <wapityyy> hum ...
[05:26] <bieb> jml.. hit the function keys on your laptop to send display to the external monitor
[05:26] <jml> I _think_ that it's trying to display on the non-existent builtin monitor.
[05:26] <bieb> see if that works
[05:26] <wapityyy> i still get nothing on grub when loading win xp :(
[05:26] <jml> bieb: it doesn't. it was the first thing I tried.
[05:26] <wapityyy> i get 'starting up ...'
[05:26] <VigoFusion> jiml: Is the partion set as a slave?
[05:26] <wapityyy> i really need help on this one :(
[05:26] <wapityyy> i just installed ubuntu
[05:27] <wapityyy> windows XP is on my first partition ...
=== mneptoid is now known as mnepton
[05:27] <wapityyy> and my menu.lst looks fine
[05:27] <asfalt> what is your preferred video player in ubuntu ? do most people use mplayer? or vlc? in regards to RestrictedFormats which of the two do you use? or do you use Totem perhaps? Wwhich is the best plugin for ff, the vlc one? the mplayer one? for viewing .asf/.wmv web content. Does the w32codecs package support all 3 players? I realise what is involved to set it up, just curious what solution/combination most people use
[05:27] <z9999> feross: Maybe there should be a large effort from the Linux community to push for some changes to be made in the way hardware manufacturers operate. I don't want to live in a world dominated by Microsoft.
[05:27] <bimberi> jml: does ctrl-alt-f1 get you to a console?
[05:27] <jml> bimberi: no, it doesn't.
[05:27] <VigoFusion> wapityyy: Is second parti set as a slave in BIOS?
[05:27] <bimberi> :|
[05:28] <Immolator> which chipset has better linux driver support, ATI or Nvidia? i'm buying a laptop and i need to know which card has better 3D support, because I know one is better than the other, just not which one, help would be greatly appreciated
[05:28] <levander> wapityyy: did you install xp after you installed ubuntu?
[05:28] <jml> ctrl-alt-backspace has no effect either.
[05:28] <wapityyy> levander: nope, had XP first
[05:28] <jml> no observable effect, that is.
[05:28] <eck> Immolator: if you have the option, intel has the best support
[05:28] <wapityyy> levander: and after i installed, i booted into XP to check, everything was fine
[05:28] <feross> z9999: well, I think the only language corporations understand is money.. so if they loose sales due to the linux factor they'll get the idea.
[05:28] <wapityyy> levander: than i ran apt-get dist-upgrade, and now it doesnt boot
[05:28] <levander> wapityyy: were you ever able to boot into ubuntu?
[05:28] <wapityyy> that's on edgy
[05:28] <wapityyy> levander: i am in ubuntu right now
[05:28] <daaaman64> asfalt: yes, most people are using mplayer.  However if you hate the gui give kmplayer a shot you may like it.  Also yes to the w32codec question as well.
[05:29] <jair> if I do not want to be typing my password all the time on the ubuntu Dapper drake what command should I issue? "sudo -l'?
[05:29] <z9999> asfalt: Sorry to interrupt, but I'm new and couldn't seem to get Totem to work so I installed VLC and it has performed very well.
[05:29] <daaaman64> asfalt: warning though, you will get the most reliablity out of mplayer.  Make sure to isntall w32codec pack also.  I assume you are using automatix?
[05:29] <Immolator> eck: but i'm looking at a high end card, like a Radeon or something, intel doesn't have an equivalent, it only has integrated graphics controllers doesn't it?
[05:29] <levander> wapityyy: so, the 2nd time you booted windows, that's when it wouldn't boot?
[05:29] <jml> I might try installing from the server iso
[05:29] <zcat[1] > !ltmodem
[05:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ltmodem - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:29] <wapityyy> levander: yeah, after the upgrade
[05:29] <levander> wapityyy: 2nd time after the ubuntu install?
[05:30] <wapityyy> levander: no error message, nothing, just 'starting up' forever
[05:30] <wapityyy> levander: yeah
[05:30] <bimberi> jair: 'sudo -i' gets you a root login shell
[05:30] <jair> I want to be able of edit, create, navigate open etc.. files and directories on the system, but all the time the sudo "command" ask me for a password to execute ? ;(
[05:30] <asfalt> nah that's great that's just the type of feedback i am after
[05:30] <levander> wapityyy: oh wait, 'starting up' is a message you are getting from windows?
[05:30] <jair> bimberi: so if I type that then is like I am root on the system until I log off
[05:30] <zcat[1] > Q: agere winmodem, appears as /dev/ttyLTM0 with the ltmodem drivers from seveas, dials, connects, won't pass any data. Any ideas?
[05:30] <levander> wapityyy: from the windows startup process
[05:30] <bimberi> jair: yes
[05:30] <levander> ?
[05:30] <wapityyy> levander: no, it's from grub
[05:30] <jair> bimberi: thanks you very much
[05:31] <wapityyy> levander: i get it (very shortly) when starting ubuntu too
[05:31] <bimberi> jair: yw :)
[05:31] <levander> wapityyy: grub is not finding the windows partition then
[05:31] <eck> Immolator: if you *just* have linux on the laptop, then intel is the best course, even though it is a lower end card... if you want a high end card to be able to do things in windows/os x then I would just go with whatever is the best value, nvidia and ati will be similar in functionality
[05:31] <asfalt> daaaman64 i plan on using automatix yes, i installed ubunty edgy the other day to get a feel for it, liked it, now i am reinstalling afresh on another machine for keeps :D
[05:31] <bruenig> automatix, uhoh
[05:31] <levander> wapityyy: or, it's not finding the stuff to boot windows on the windows partition
[05:31] <zcat[1] > automuntix
[05:31] <wapityyy> levander: hum if it's hda2
[05:31] <bimberi> jair: and i hereby indemnify myself from any damage you do while using it ;P
[05:31] <wapityyy> what should my menu.lst entry be ?
[05:31] <levander> wapityyy: there is a #grub channel, why not check in there?
[05:32] <wapityyy> rootnoverify		(hd0,1)
[05:32] <wapityyy> this should be hda2 right ?
[05:32] <zcat[1] > bah, back to the external modem I guess....
[05:32] <levander> wapityyy: yeah, (hd0,1) from what i remember about grub is correct
[05:32] <eck> when i had an ati based computer, i did not have good experiences... i would be surprised if nvidia was that much better :-(
[05:32] <Immolator> eck: i was told that one card didn't have very good 3D drivers and therefore could not run games very well in linux (hl2 etc), but I also want to game in Windows too
[05:32] <kitche> wapityyy: yes that would be hda2
[05:32] <daaaman64> asfalt: congrats, patience and willingness to learn are you best friend though.  You may find yourself preferring xp for quite awhile.  Just give it time.
[05:33] <wapityyy> kitche: hum ... what's wrong then ?
[05:33] <kitche> eck: nvidia is better then ati in linux most people tend to go to nvidia for 3d stuff since ati is known to not work on linux
[05:33] <levander> Immolator: nvidia has better opengl and linux support in their drivers, i'd get an nVidia card
[05:33] <VigoFusion> Ima gonna get a monkey wrench and make ATI work or somethin
[05:34] <Immolator> ok, thanks guys
[05:34] <bruenig> !thanks
[05:34] <ubotu> You're Welcome!
[05:35] <wapityyy> kitche: any other ideas ?
[05:35] <asfalt> daaaman64 i not totally fresh to linux so it's not too much of a shock luckily, just new to ubuntu and attracted by the ease of use. having tried various distros in the past, most recently fc6 in way of experimenting with desktops, i came to like ubuntu the best so far. i mean everything worked on my hardware. aside from that i been running slackware in cli only for a few years for a router
[05:35] <z9999> feross: You're right, and I believe the only reason Linux is not taking a bigger share is because of the mis-information that it is so much more difficult to learn than Windows. In truth the OS is very easy to learn and use and is much more powerful, but the fact that HW is difficult to get to work makes it appear that the OS is hard to use. If drivers were readily available for all HW Linux...
[05:35] <z9999> ...would be much easier to run than Windows, not to mention security, and stability. And I love the fact that Linux provides numerous tools to enable you to perform tasks that are difficult if not impossible to do in Windows. I can't live without commands like ed, sed, grep, cut, paste, col, just to name a few. I'm retired from AT&T so I may be a little biased toward unix though.
[05:35] <nayru> hey where is the trash in ubuntu ^_^
[05:35] <VigoFusion> Debian had a very nice writeup on ATI and issues/fixes today.
[05:35] <bruenig> nayru, ~/.Trash
[05:35] <kitche> wapityyy: well there can be many things if you resized your XP partition you might have over written a file that is needed to boot windows
[05:35] <nayru> thanx lol
[05:36] <wapityyy> kitche: i did, but im almost sure it worked the first time, even after the resize
[05:36] <wapityyy> kitche: do i have to repair the MBR with a windows CD ?
[05:36] <bruenig> !mbr
[05:36] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[05:36] <daaaman64> awesome asfalt, I am no pro myself.  I hope you are satisfied w/ ubuntu then.  Nothing beats a fresh install w/ automatix around.  Can have my workspace up in an hour.  Did you enjoy fc6?
[05:37] <kitche> wapityyy: well there is amny ways to fix it and my way is the more complicated way
[05:37] <bruenig> !automatix
[05:37] <ubotu> automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:37] <Firefishe> Greetings :) New ubuntu 6.06 user here.  I'm using it on a G4 PowerPC laptop, and I need a link to information about such things as the broadcom wireless driver and the touchpad.
[05:37] <wapityyy> kitche: which is ?
[05:37] <daaaman64> screw that, automatix works fine :p
[05:38] <bruenig> automatix destroyed my system once
[05:38] <Madpilot> daaaman64, no, it does not. It breaks far too many systems.
[05:38] <Madpilot> !wireless | Firefishe
[05:38] <ubotu> Firefishe: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:38] <kitche> wapityyy: well I usually flush the MBR then do /fixmbr then install grub to the MBR
[05:38] <daaaman64> I am on my third system with no problems.  I guess the opinions are fine though.
[05:38] <bruenig> !worksforme
[05:38] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[05:39] <Firefishe> Madpilot: Thank you.  I will check that documentation first.  Best work on one prob at a time, eh? ;)  ...on my way
[05:39] <daaaman64> What's your point automatix still works fine for me.
[05:39] <asfalt> daaaman64 yeah fc6 is ok, i have it running now on an old 400mhz headless machine i vnc to. although i noticed some slowdowns/nautilus crashes/abnormal cpu usage when copying large files , then again could be the old crappy machine itself :D
[05:39] <bruenig> what is my point? "Works for me" does not mean it is ok
[05:39] <bruenig> you can read yes?
[05:39] <FunnyLookinHat> daaaman64, The point is automatix is unsafe and not recommended by anyone giving support in this channel.
[05:40] <feross> z9999: I can't agree with you more. Unfortunately with Vista, it's weird but people always say that MS is shooting themselves on the foot with such and such OS but I haven't seen a dent into their monopoly :/... Hopefully this will be the one ..
[05:40] <asfalt> aha
[05:40] <daaaman64> bruenig: no kidding but works for me is enough for me to use it.
[05:40] <asfalt> so automatix is not offically supported eh?
[05:40] <VigoFusion> Firefishie: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=216301 <<poke around there?
[05:41] <FunnyLookinHat> asfalt, hardly  : )
[05:41] <kitche> asfalt: of course not it's not done by the ubuntu people
[05:41] <bruenig> it should not be enough to support it especially when confronted clearly with those with other experiences than your own
[05:41] <daaaman64> asfalt, it may not be, but if you have the time give it a shot.  Reinstall if you have to.
[05:42] <asfalt> well i found apt-get and the gui of synaptic fairly sufficient i guess
[05:42] <daaaman64> I have yet to see a problem w/ it though.
[05:42] <bruenig> asfalt, do what you want. Everything automatix does can be done on your own and with very little difficulty. Why you would allow a script that is known to break things do things that you can do on  your own seems odd to me, but nevertheless your computer
[05:42] <z9999> feross: Well, I've been doing my part here, I recommend to all my friends, strangers, and the schools locally that they move to Linux.
[05:42] <balder> hello  guys  how i can change the folder properties ?
[05:42] <asfalt> bruenig yeah fair enough, so i will probably not use it now in view of what you said.
[05:42] <bruenig> balder, chmod ###
[05:43] <Staz> Where in ubuntu can I see the wireless AP's available?
[05:43] <bruenig> balder, I misread, I thought it said folder permissions
[05:43] <Firefishe> VigoFusion: Just scrolled up and saw your url.  Thank you very much for that, I'll go there now.
[05:43] <asfalt> staz, good question, i could not find any utility on default edgy install to show nearby AP's
[05:43] <VigoFusion> :)
[05:44] <Firefishe> wb FunnyLookinHat
[05:44] <eck> asfalt: what about iwlist?
[05:44] <jair> anyone knows the location of the apache2 manual when you install it using apt-get or synaptic?
[05:44] <kitche> Staz: you will have to use software to do it or do iwlist -scan
[05:44] <FunnyLookinHat> Firefishe, closed the wrong window   ; )
[05:44] <jair> I am checking on the "/usr/share" but not luck.
[05:44] <maurox> jair: i think that you could do man apache3
[05:44] <bruenig> !info apache2-doc
[05:44] <z9999> feross: Something peculiar just happened, I entered all the info for my fixed IP address under eth0, and even rebooted, and the icon at the screen top says: No network connection, but I brought up Firefox and can connect to Google with no problem.
[05:45] <asfalt> eck: didn't know of that command, nice
[05:45] <ubotu> apache2-doc: documentation for apache2. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0.55-4ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 2074 kB, installed size 11376 kB
[05:45] <balder> but haw I do that the foldre properties say you don`t have permits  on ly the root
[05:45] <Firefishe> FunnyLookinHat: Ya, I've hit 'that' "X" before ;) hee
[05:45] <maurox> sorry apache2
[05:45] <balder> or something like that
[05:45] <feross> Staz: kismet is a good sniffing tool.. the config is a little tricky, if you want to use it let me know and I'll tell you how to setup the source.
[05:45] <Staz> kitche : cheers
[05:45] <Staz> thanks feross.
[05:46] <Adross> hey hey, anyone know the two letter sources.list code for Sweden?
[05:46] <bruenig> balder, what specifically are you trying to do, so I can think of what the permissions should be changed to
[05:46] <jair> maurox: I found it thanks /usr/share/doc/apache2-doc/manual
[05:46] <maurox> jair okay :)
[05:46] <jair> now if i want to make a symbolic link hmm
[05:46] <feross> z9999: hm. the other thing that could be interrupting network manager is the gnome network util.. look for profiles.xml in your .gnome2/ .. you might need to rm or mv it to a .bad and then restart.
[05:46] <jair> let me see how i do that
[05:47] <VigoFusion> feross: is that firestarter the fwall to use on Edgy Generic? or what if any apt-get should I use?
[05:47] <bruenig> Adross, perhaps sd, is the following factoid swedish, if so sd is probably the code
[05:47] <bruenig> !sd
[05:47] <Staz> iwlist works great, I'll take a look @ kismet also
[05:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:47] <bruenig> !se

[05:47] <bruenig> maybe se, is that swedish ^
[05:47] <Adross> so it's se then
[05:47] <balder> well I want  to copy a folder from the Desk  to  remove device
[05:47] <jair> kitche: thank you, I have to figure out where do i want the link first ;)
[05:48] <kitche> jair: the last manual is what you want the symlink to be named
[05:48] <Adross> it's se
[05:48] <P3L|C4N0> greetins
[05:48] <Staz> once I find the SSID of my router, how can I connect to it?
[05:48] <jair> kitche: I see, and I should run the command from the location i want to access it right?
[05:48] <feross> VigoFusion: yeah firestarter is the one to use... there are ways to make it start automatically when you boot but I have not looked into it. Other than that you just have to click on it and put in your password every time you log in.
[05:48] <test2> How do I dual-boot ubuntu and windows?
[05:48] <bruenig> balder, do sudo cp /path/to/file /path/to/removedevice, if that makes sense
[05:48] <bruenig> !dualboot
[05:48] <ubotu> Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64)  -  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[05:48] <kitche> jair: yeah for example you want your symlink in your home fodler you would run the command there
[05:48] <eck> Staz: from the command line, just use iwconfig and then possibly dhclient
[05:49] <VigoFusion> feross: Thank you.
[05:49] <feross> Hi P3L|C4N0 how are you, I hope you're having a GREAT day...
[05:49] <balder> ok let me  try  that
[05:49] <maurox> test2: grub does that automatically
[05:49] <test2> yes i did the standard procedure, but windows does not boot
[05:49] <Staz> eck : perfect cheers
[05:49] <obo>  I was wondering if anyone can help me rebuild a single kernel module for the stock ubuntu kernel
[05:49] <asfalt> wondering if there is any benefit to splitting a 70gb free space as to put /home on its own partition or whether to use the lot for /
[05:49] <kitche> VigoFusion: firestarter is not a firewall it's just a gui frontend to iptables
[05:50] <asfalt> i should probably do that i think in view of reinstalling/upgrades
[05:50] <ubuntu> hacking and programmers any??
[05:50] <jair> kitche: thank you very much ;)
[05:50] <maurox> asfalt: if you mount /home in  an own partition, you have your config there and never lose tehm :)
[05:50] <bruenig> asfalt, the benefit comes from when you screw up your install, you don't lose your important data. I would not split that 35G 35G, but instead something like 10G for / and 60G for /home. I have never had my / ever take up over 5 Gigs of space
[05:51] <z9999> feross: No profiles.xml file in .gnome2 directory, the LAN connection is working and I'm able to access the Internet.
[05:51] <ubuntu> how the hell is everyone ------happy turkey day
[05:51] <VigoFusion> kitchie: Then there is no firewall , or none available? or is it even needed? (old UNIX daze tells me yes)
[05:51] <bruenig> asfalt, perhaps 15 Gigs to be safe for /
[05:51] <eck> ubuntu: very good, happy turkey day to you too
[05:51] <asfalt> bruenig i think will do just that, thats how i had windows on it, 10gb os, rest data + little hidden fat partition with the image of the os
[05:51] <obo>  I was wondering if anyone can help me rebuild a single kernel module for the stock ubuntu kernel
[05:52] <ubuntu> ty eck
[05:52] <maurox> 60 GB for /home ??
[05:52] <kitche> VigoFusion: iptables is the firewall it runs by default firestarter just makes it easier to set it up for people that don't want to learn the cli commands for iptable
[05:52] <feross> z9999: right but it's not because of nm ... must be something else that's setting everything up. you did a 'locate profiles.xml' right? ... I think it might have changed in edgy.
[05:52] <asfalt> maurox yeah i guess so
[05:52] <maurox> thats too much
[05:52] <bruenig> asfalt, yeah that is what I do, but then again I don't generally have too much in the form of extra software and such installed
[05:52] <ubuntu> running live here nomally win 2000
[05:52] <djancak> is there a flash player for ubuntu that isnt macromedia?
[05:52] <bruenig> maurox, better that space be unused in /home than unused in /
[05:52] <VigoFusion> kitchie: Thank you, I like to learn! =-O
[05:53] <maurox> i have 36 GB for linux so 8 GB are for /home and 1 GB for swap and /the rest for /
[05:53] <kitche> djancak: gnash
[05:53] <test2> so I created a partition, but when I am in ubuntu's install program, i cannot install to that partition. install wants me to use partition that has windows already installed
[05:53] <gpled> ~$ sudo apt-get update
[05:53] <gpled> E: Malformed line 31 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
[05:53] <maurox> that deppend because i have to install a lot of programs :P
[05:53] <djancak> kitche: thanks
[05:53] <bruenig> maurox, and how much of that 36 GB is used?
[05:53] <ubuntu> unbuntu works with mac too
[05:53] <asfalt> whaf if you want to store more then 3 dvd's in /home maurox :D
[05:53] <kitche> maurox: on an average system / never goes over 5GB's
[05:53] <gpled> anyone else getting this?
[05:53] <feross> djancak: I think there is an os flash plugin but it probably doesn't work very well.
[05:54] <bruenig> djancak, take into consideration that gnash doesn't have sound and doesn't really "work"

[05:54] <ubuntu> hey pirite u in here????
[05:54] <bruenig> maurox, so that is what 7 Gigs?
[05:55] <maurox> asfalt and if i want to have 3 ddvs i have other partitions for that /Music and /Movies :)
[05:55] <gpled> here is the line it does not like:  deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy
[05:55] <balder> Bruenig   thanks  a lot  you are the only one can helpme with my problem
[05:55] <gpled> should i just comment it out?
[05:55] <maurox> brueing yes al leat 7 GB
[05:55] <maurox> least
[05:56] <bruenig> gpled, you need to add things after the edgy, things like "main" or "universe" or "multiverse"
[05:56] <thinh> anyone ehre?
[05:56] <thinh> here?
[05:56] <VigoFusion> no
[05:56] <Pavi> yes
[05:56] <Pavi> 11
[05:56] <thinh> lol
[05:56] <VigoFusion> maybe
[05:56] <bruenig> gpled, if you would pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list, I could look at it and make the appropriate changes
[05:56] <thinh> wasnt sure it thankgiving after all

[05:57] <balder> Bruenig   thanks  a lot  you are the only one can helpme with my problem    Bruenig   also  I want to apologize for my bad english  thanyou  again   see you latter
[05:57] <bruenig> balder, np
[05:57] <JL> go ahead thinh
[05:57] <JL> throw it out there
[05:58] <gpled> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33616/
[05:58] <cmweb> I get a problem when i setup Firestarter Firewall. i Go throught the setup enabling DHCP Internet Share and startup on dialup and click finish and it gives an error saying that i need to" Please check your network device settings and make sure you internet connection is active" i have done all this and still.
[05:58] <thinh> i have 2 partion on windows that i want to mount should i map both under media/windows or media/windows and media/something else?
[05:59] <gpled> bruenig: it strange that synaptic would mess the file like that
[05:59] <JL> thinh, i use /media/windows-c and /media/windows-d
[05:59] <eck> thinh: normally you would map them to two different places
[05:59] <test2> is it possible to install ubuntu to a partition??
[05:59] <z9999> feross: no profiles.xml found, but everything is working like previously.
[05:59] <JL> thinh, i just added it to /etc/fstab
[05:59] <bruenig> gpled, you don't have universe enabled, if you wish to do that, you can just change the last line to deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe. If you don't want universe you can just comment it out or delete or whatever.
[05:59] <Moosejaw> hi all
[05:59] <Moosejaw> :)
[05:59] <thinh> but i have to make the directories in the same name right?
[06:00] <JL> thinh, correct
[06:00] <eck> test2: i don't think there is any other way from the ubuntu installer
[06:00] <thinh> cool thanks
[06:00] <JL> thinh,   sudo mkdir -p /media/windows-c
[06:00] <JL> thinh,   sudo mkdir -p /media/windows-d
[06:00] <Moosejaw> just installed ubuntu for the first time...and need a bit of help.  I have followed the instructions on installng ndiswrapper but when i go to install the driver it says that ndiswrapper isnt a command etc...
[06:00] <Moosejaw> is there a different way i might go about making it work?
[06:00] <feross> z9999: hmm ok, I guess you might as well take nm out of the picture since you're not using it. Look in System>prefs>session and take it out of there if you're not going to use it.
[06:00] <Moosejaw> i have redone it 3 times...
[06:01] <gpled> burzum: adding universe to the end of line 31 seem to fix it.  thanks
[06:02] <wapityyy> levander: still no luck
[06:02] <eck> Moosejaw: make sure that ndiswrapper is installed, and if it is make sure that it is in your path
[06:02] <thinh> how do i remove a folder?
[06:03] <thinh> try to use rm but not working
[06:03] <bruenig> thinh, rm -rf /path/to/folder
[06:03] <eck> rm -rf
[06:03] <test2> ok, i already have a partition created. but Install program insists on installing to Windows partition AND the created partition.
[06:03] <kitche> thinh: I would empty the fodler out then runt he rmdir /path/to/folder
[06:03] <kitche> folder*

[06:05] <bimberi> PyR3X: 'dpkg -L <package> | grep bin'
[06:05] <eck> Moosejaw: this is for ndiswrapper?
[06:05] <bruenig> gpled, make sure it doesn't say deb http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy/universe, it needs to say deb http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy universe, no /, just a space
[06:05] <feross> PyR3X: try whereis or which .. eg 'which ls'
[06:05] <Moosejaw> yeo
[06:05] <Moosejaw> yes

[06:06] <Moosejaw> uhmm...no
[06:06] <z9999> feross: I found something else, I'm not to familiar with GUI apps, but found under Syetem, Administration, something called Windows Wireless Drivers, and clicked on it and it brings up a window called network settings. The location field has Wireless, eth1, and wlan0 as options and I'm not sure what to do with this yet. This may be where I should be looking to get the wireless working.
[06:06] <Moosejaw> i am not too familiar with the repositories thing since i am so new
[06:06] <tony_> i've enabled "1280x1024" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:06] <eck> Moosejaw: 'sudo make uninstall' and then add multiverse to your sources.list and then run 'sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper'
[06:06] <tony_> but it still doesn't work.
[06:06] <Moosejaw> ok
[06:06] <feross> z9999: cool
[06:06] <Moosejaw> cool
[06:07] <bruenig> tony_, you restarted x after you changed right?
[06:07] <tony_> yes, i even rebooted just to make sure
[06:07] <eck> Moosejaw: in the future when you want to install something just 'apt-get xxxx'
[06:07] <Moosejaw> multiverse is found in the system settings right?

[06:08] <z9999> feross: It looks like I may have to search for some info on how to use this as I can't find a way to enter any info yet.
[06:08] <Moosejaw> ok
[06:08] <bruenig> tony_, not sure
[06:08] <asfalt> regarding dvd players like in my notebook, they have a limited number of region changes before they become locked. under windows i had a utility which overcame this and allowed me to play different region discs without causing my player to change them. is there such tool for linux? i noticed regionset util, but that seems to set the drive
[06:08] <tony_> dang
[06:09] <tony_> have any ideas on what i can try to do?
[06:09] <bruenig> tony_, not big on the xorg.conf, it always just worked for me. Hence very little knowledge. I tend to learn from necessity as opposed to genuine interest
[06:09] <eck> Moosejaw: this is what mine looks like: http://rafb.net/paste/results/v5IQUe71.html
[06:09] <tony_> alright, thanks anyway
[06:10] <thinh> my sounds get messed up due to my tv tuner card
[06:10] <bruenig> cmweb, I have only made one policy in firestarter. That was to forward the bittorrent ports. I can try, but would likely be of little help for anything remotely complex
[06:10] <gpled> bruenig: nice catch.  it had deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ edgy universe.  note the / after .com
[06:11] <cmweb> I just want to foward port 80 and 21 and 23
[06:11] <cmweb> and some other (basic webhosting ports)
[06:12] <bruenig> cmweb, go to policy, make sure the right thing is clicked, inbound or outbound policy. Not sure which is necessary for your thing. Right click in the correct box and select add rule. The rest should be fairly easy
[06:12] <Andaluz_LNX> meep

[06:22] <cmweb> kitche, im sorry i think i got it though
[06:22] <WhiteNoise> OK - I upgraded to Edgy using the upgrade-manager -c option, default kernel didn't work, finally got in and compiled a working vanilla 2.6.18 kernel (w/ madwifi and nvidia) -- now boots, but root=UUID=XXX doesn't work, only root=/dev/hda6.  Do I need to patch the vanilla kernel to get it to use UUID?
[06:23] <Pavi> i am unable to upgrade dude
[06:23] <kitche> WhiteNoise: you probably do since it's mostly a Ubuntu thing that uses UUID
[06:23] <Pavi> with this upgrade manager
[06:24] <Pavi> from breezy to edgy
[06:24] <WhiteNoise> kitche - OK, I'll poke around some more and see what turns up.

[06:47] <cmweb> you are still on
[06:47] <kishan> hmm Pelo u doctor
[06:47] <dawkirst> Hello. Is there any flash player support for Firefox for a 64-bit architecture?
[06:47] <kitche> RoC_MM: your ip can be found anyways just by doing a whois on you so it's not like he pasted something that is private
[06:47] <cmweb> RoC_MM: log out of my sever your in every port
[06:48] <Pelo> kishan,  no,  I just thought you had a minor problem and I use to teach first aid
[06:48] <RoC_MM> You mentioned some server earlier but you appear to maybe be on dialup so I portscanned you to see if you were running anything I could help with.
[06:48] <RoC_MM> Thank you kitche I really didn't know that.  </sarcasm>
[06:48] <murchadh_bhaba> .
[06:48] <cmweb> its still port scanning
[06:48] <kishan> Pelo, thank you ..i am new to linux wanted to learn about it
[06:49] <RoC_MM> cmweb, I'm pretty sure it's not, but I can do it again if you'd like.  It didn't come back with any open ports...what was this server you mentioned earlier?
[06:49] <Pelo> kishan,  look under the application , add/remove ,  there might be some apps in there,
[06:49] <cmweb> cmweb.zapto.org
[06:49] <gpled> has anyone gotten flash 9 to work?

[06:49] <kishan> Pelo what do u suggest KDE or gnome
[06:49] <dawkirst> I receive this message when trying to install the flash player plugin: Your architecture, \'x86_64\', is not supported by the
[06:50] <dawkirst>        Macromedia Flash Player installer.
[06:50] <dawkirst> Any suggestions?
[06:50] <kitche> dawkirst: yes x86_64 isn't supported by Adobe Flash Player
[06:50] <RoC_MM> cmweb, I'm not connected to you at all, I just checked netstat.
[06:50] <Pelo> kishan,  your choice , I like gnome but I still use some kde progs
[06:50] <dawkirst> kitche: any alternative?
[06:50] <kitche> dawkirst: well you can use a plugin wrapper

[06:51] <RoC_MM> dawkirst, I think you may be able to work around it by using a 32-bit version of firefox...then you can use 32-bit plugins as well until the vendors get into shape.
[06:51] <dawkirst> kitche: care to elaborate? ;)
[06:51] <kishan> Pelo, i mean for genereal desktop net browsing and using multimedia is KDE better than genome
[06:51] <RoC_MM> cmweb, is "cmweb.zapto.org" a website or ?
[06:51] <kitche> dawkirst: nspluginwrapper is used to make x86 plugins run on x86_64 processors
[06:51] <cmweb> yes i use it for everything
[06:52] <dawkirst> kitche: thanks.
[06:52] <malt> is it hard to make a wire/wired router with a laptop running ubuntu os?
[06:52] <Pelo> kishan,  personnaly I just don't like the feel of kde,
[06:52] <haxality> malt: no, but a lot of other distros would probably work better
[06:52] <corevett1> sorry whoever was talking me about my 'make'
[06:52] <corevett1> command problem
[06:52] <Pelo> kishan,  try both , decide for yourself
[06:52] <corevett1> did anyone answer me?
[06:52] <agent> is it possible to remove the icon from the battery charge tray? i cant find anything in gconf
[06:52] <RoC_MM> malt, you mean make the machine into a router??  Usually you would use a desktop for this...
[06:52] <Pelo> corevette,   in synaptic,  install buid-essential
[06:52] <haxality> RoC_MM: could be an older laptop
[06:52] <RoC_MM> cmweb, no webserver on cmweb.zapto.org.
[06:52] <Pelo> corevett1,  do you listen when someone talks to you ?
[06:53] <corevett1> pelo, what is it?
[06:53] <corevett1> pelo, buid-essential
[06:53] <cmweb> its the firewall if i disable it youl see it all
[06:53] <Pelo> corevett1,  it's the stuff you need to use make
[06:53] <cmweb> so
[06:53] <cmweb> Come on in
[06:53] <corevett1> pelo, can i download it somewhere? i don't have the computer hooked up to the internet
[06:54] <cmweb> ljl, are you on?
[06:54] <Pelo> corevett1,    in menu > system > admin > synaptic ,  search >build essential ,  install,  then you can do complie manaualy
[06:54] <Pelo> corevett1,  it should be on the installation cd
[06:54] <corevett1> pelo, pretend i lost the installation cd
[06:54] <Pelo> corevett1,  then you are screwed because I am not that 1337
[06:55] <cmweb> Firewall off so refresh

[06:55] <corevett1> pelo

[06:55] <corevett1> pelo, i got the cd
[06:55] <kitche> cmweb: your page came up but it's just slow due to dial up I would suggest looking into getting a dedi server
[06:55] <RoC_MM> cmweb, I applaud you for hosting off of dial-up
[06:55] <corevett1> pelo, but i can't fidn it on the cd
[06:56] <corevett1> pelo, how do i get it
[06:56] <Pelo> corevett1,  pop the cd in and go to synaptic like I told you
[06:56] <cmweb> :-D
[06:56] <cmweb> kitche, a dedicated server?
[06:56] <RoC_MM> A nice little website...what are you going to use it for?
[06:56] <Pelo> or try waht nanomike  told you to do
[06:56] <cmweb> like ubuntus server?
[06:56] <cmweb> RoC_MM: webhosting lol
[06:57] <jml> on the server installation menu, what does "LAMP server" really actually mean?
[06:57] <RoC_MM> webhosting is much cheaper than a dedicated server.
[06:57] <corevett1> pelo, it says like gcc is not installable
[06:57] <RoC_MM> jml, Linux Apache MySQL and PHP.
[06:57] <cmweb> althoug, i got an old windows 98 compaq in the backroom collecting dust
[06:57] <Pelo> corevett1,  then I don'T know,  dl the dvd instead it's on there for sure
[06:57] <jml> RoC_MM: as in, it will install apache, mysql and php?
[06:57] <agent> !lamp > jml
[06:57] <corevett1> pelo, my dvd burner doesn't work
[06:57] <RoC_MM> jml, that sounds about right.
[06:57] <RoC_MM> !lamp > RoC_MM
[06:58] <cmweb> !lam
[06:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lam - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:58] <cmweb> !lamp
[06:58] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[06:58] <Pelo> corevett1,  like nanomike  told you , search for a  buid-essential  .deb package
[06:58] <agent> lol
[06:58] <Pelo> on google
[06:58] <corevett1> pelo hold on
[06:58] <agent> everyone spams jml with !lamo :)
[06:58] <jml> I'm familiar with the term. It's just when I see a menu that says "DNS Server; LAMP Server" I get a little nervous.
[06:58] <dawkirst> Does Linux ship with native mp3 support?
[06:58] <RoC_MM> Which Linux?
[06:58] <Pelo> dawkirst,  no but it is easy enought to get
[06:58] <agent> no one ships linux :)
[06:58] <bimberi> dawkirst: not Ubuntu
[06:59] <[pyro] > hey all
[06:59] <cmweb> kitche, can i set up a dedicated server on this?
[06:59] <nanomike> corevett1, http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/devel/build-essential download and instal
[06:59] <dawkirst> Pelo: what would you suggest I get?
[07:00] <ijbgreen> anybody can help me?
[07:00] <cmweb> !anybody
[07:00] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[07:00] <Pelo> dawkirst, install ubuntu and then get the mp3 support from either the restricted fromat packages or from automatix,
[07:00] <corevett1> nanomike, when i install it form the cd , it says a whole bunch o depends, like g++-4.1 is not going to be installed
[07:00] <Pelo> corevett1, get the package nano giave you a link to
[07:01] <corevett1> pelo read my above statement
[07:01] <Pelo> or get you computer connected to the net
[07:01] <nanomike> corevett1, Some of the package are not on the CD, either download them or apt-get install or synaptic to get them
[07:01] <agent> dawkirst: asking "does linux have mp3 support?" is like asking "do my tires have a cd drive?" - linux, which is actually gnu/linux, i just the kernel, the "engine" that runs everything
[07:01] <Pelo> gotta go , g'night folks
[07:01] <RoC_MM> Yeah dawkirst I think you overlook that including mp3 support would violate these things called "patents" possibly.
[07:02] <dawkirst> agent: thanks for that analogous snippet ;)
[07:02] <Bilange> issue reguarding wireless installation: my system doesnt seem to see my broadcom 4318 under ndiswrapper. Even if ndiswrapper adds a "wlan0" alias in modprobe, i cant find it under ifconfig or iwconfig. Whats wrong?
[07:02] <Stanislav> does anyone know why when i load WoW.. the graphical things dont show up (just black) and the screen flickers?
[07:02] <dawkirst> RoC_MM: I get you.
[07:02] <cmweb> One more thing before i go.... Ive tryed to install the PSX2 thingi on here and it installed but it wont open. Isnt it a GUI?
[07:02] <jml> agent: I think GNU/Linux refers to the broader system and Linux is just the kernel.
[07:03] <RoC_MM> jml, That sounds right.
[07:03] <agent> jml: sure :)
[07:03] <Stanislav> anyone got any ideas ; ;? this is writing me insane

[07:06] <RoC_MM> pradeepvglughyd, it's OK if your DHT is unreachable from the outside.  It would help you find peers if any of your torrent's trackers go down though.  It's not an Ubuntu-specific question though.

[07:09] <rakee1_1981> hey all, has anyone had trouble installing the java run time environment and linking it to firefox?
[07:09] <corevett1> pelo, do you think if i reinstall ubuntu with edgy eft, make will work/
[07:09] <ijbgreen> if i don't found an answer i come back to here
[07:09] <pradeepvglughyd> one more thing the azureus pop up screen comes up at lower right side and when i press hide it refuses to do so
[07:09] <haxality> gotit: they are window managers.
[07:09] <RoC_MM> gotit, XFCE is a light-weight window manager for older computers.
[07:09] <agent> ijbgreen: you will because i found an answer in about 5seconds :)
[07:09] <kishan> rakeel_1981, use automatrix to install all the accessories for ubuntu
[07:09] <RoC_MM> gotit, and as far as kde and gnome look here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kdegnome
[07:10] <cmweb> Does any one in here use PCSX i got it installed but when i click the link it does nothing
[07:10] <nanomike> corevett1, A complete reinstall, then you will need to reinstall build-essential
[07:10] <haxality> gotit: if you've never used linux before, use standard ubuntu or kubuntu. they have the smallest learning curve
[07:10] <kyconquers> what music program do you all recommend? and what program to listen to internet radio?
[07:10] <rakee1_1981> what's automatrix? (sorry to appear ignorant)
[07:10] <haxality> kyconquers: I'm partial to xmms
[07:10] <kishan> rakeel_1981, http://www.getautomatix.com/
[07:10] <agent> !automatix
[07:10] <ubotu> automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:11] <gotit> i heard ubuntu is the best linux, is it true ??
[07:11] <rakee1_1981> sorry, just found out
[07:11] <haxality> gotit: there is no such thing as the 'best linux'
[07:11] <rakee1_1981> cheers kishan :)
[07:11] <haxality> gotit: it depends on your application.
[07:11] <RoC_MM> cmweb, there are lots of free webspace providers....also if you want your own domain name with hosting you can register a domain name through plenty of places....I recommend dreamhost.com for registration and hosting.
[07:11] <kishan> hey agent is is bad to install automartix
[07:11] <agent> gotit: no... it all depends on who you ask... linux is like food, everyone has their favorite flavors
[07:11] <RoC_MM> gotit, it's the most popular or hottest right now.
[07:11] <haxality> gotit: ubuntu is very good for a desktop system if you don't want to do tons of manual configuration
[07:11] <haxality> like RoC_MM said.
[07:11] <nanomike> corevett1, Do you have access to a internet connection and some sort of removable media. Then download build-essential and as .deb and install from that media
[07:12] <agent> kishan: yes, very.... we helped someone yesterday who installed auzuerus using automatix and had problems because of it
[07:12] <nanomike> corevett1, http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/devel/build-essential
[07:12] <RoC_MM> gotit, more info about linux distros is on wikipedia or look on distrowatch.com to see what's hot right now
[07:12] <gotit> i want to learn linux guys, i need to learn it fast , should i install desktop system or any thing else
[07:13] <cmweb> RoC_MM, you see the thing is i want to be a FULLY FLEDGED host. Doing my own domain names Ftp, E-mail, the whole kitten caboodle.
[07:13] <kishan> i too installed almost everything from automartix i never had a problem
[07:13] <agent> gotit: install whatever you want.... ubuntu is a good choice of course
[07:13] <ademan> i want to create a new updated package for the eclipse cdt (because the old one is incompatible with the current eclipse package) but i've never made a package before, is there any way i can look at what was done for the original cdt package? or is there any description of how to do it? (or even a better channel to ask in)
[07:13] <eck> gotit: get a book
[07:14] <aztracker1> imho ubuntu is the most usable linux distro to date.. just imho though...
[07:14] <gotit> i am not a book type , i prefer learning by doing it myself
[07:14] <haxality> I wouldn't necessarily call Ubuntu most usable, but it strikes the best balance between performance and ease of use, by far
[07:14] <jml> is there a metapackage or something for install gnome?
[07:14] <agent> gotit: all this talking is wasting time .... you could have installed ubuntu by now ;)
[07:14] <agent> jml: ubuntu-desktop
[07:15] <jml> agent: thanks
[07:15] <haxality> gotit: linux is not something you can pick up in 5 minutes, just a bit of forewarning
[07:15] <RoC_MM> cmweb, you will need much more bandwidth than you are paying for now, and possibly more than you might want to pay.  Expect to pay around $100 a monnth or more for something with a fast upload.  For example, I have comcast, but it's only "high-speed" in one direction, downloading...the other direction is the slow upload pipe they give me, and that's bad for servers and hosting...it's 6000kbit on way, but only 384kbit the other way.  Yo
[07:15] <RoC_MM> u'll want at least 1000kbit (1mbit) upstream to do serious hosting for serious people.
[07:15] <haxality> it's just like any operating system, it takes time to learn the quirks
[07:15] <aztracker1> haxality, would probably say that...  has been far easier going doing what I want with it than other versions...
[07:15] <aztracker1> versions/distros even.
[07:15] <corevett1> when i try to do a make command, it responds that /lib/modules/2.6.17-7-generic/build is missing, please set KERNALPATH. stop.
[07:16] <haxality> aztracker1: yeah, I had some awesome point about how it wasn't the easiest to use, but then I realized it pretty much is
[07:16] <agent> gotit: also, do note that a lot of distributions (flavors of gnu/linux) have a livecd... you can test the distro before you install! it runs 100% off your cdrom - runs slower, but it runs
[07:16] <cmweb> RoC_MM, Im planing to go G4 in May
[07:16] <aztracker1> haxality, true enough.. google has been a good friend so far.
[07:16] <haxality> it's that old connection in my brain where a distro has to be slow and bloated to be easy to use
[07:16] <RoC_MM> cmweb, and a 1mbit uplink would n't be very nice for more than like a few different people.
[07:16] <corevett1> nanomike, when i try to do a make command, it responds that /lib/modules/2.6.17-7-generic/build is missing, please set KERNALPATH. stop.
[07:16] <RoC_MM> cmweb, a G4 is a computer....is that what you mean?  I thought we were talking about bandwidth.
[07:17] <aztracker1> haxality, lol.. yeah, I've tried a few dozen distros over the years.. ubuntu 5.10 was the first to be the main os on my desktop.
[07:17] <haxality> I'm not going to lie, I've had a bit of a love/hate relationship with linux
[07:17] <kishan> so What is NAT error in azeurus and how to correcct it any one help
[07:17] <haxality> I finally got ged up with all the crap MS is handing down to the end user though
[07:17] <haxality> ged = fed
[07:17] <RoC_MM> kishan, is it a NAT Error, DHT Firewalled, or both?
[07:17] <cmweb> RoC_MM G4 is a verry fast verry powerful badwith only avalibal to people within a certain range annd always by satalight it gets four gigabites a sec
[07:17] <haxality> and it was a bit of a challenge to install ubuntu on this laptop, but once I worked the kinks out.. I don't think I can ever go back to windows
[07:18] <aztracker1> haxality, honestly me too.. just really sick of MS.. I like VS2005 though, that's about it.. mono at least runs most everything .net now.
[07:18] <cmweb> RoC_MM, at leases thats what ive heard
[07:18] <||x|x||> how do i replace Firefox 1.5.0.8 with Firefox 2.0?
[07:18] <RoC_MM> Is that so cmweb ?
[07:18] <kishan> well RoC_MM when i test the port it says NAT error
[07:18] <aztracker1> x, update to edgy
[07:18] <cmweb> RoC_MM My Uncle has it
[07:18] <haxality> yeah, digg had an article about linux IDEs an hour or so ago
[07:18] <RoC_MM> I very much doubt it's anything near gigabit cmweb .
[07:18] <eck> vim ftw :-)
[07:18] <kyconquers> linux ide's?
[07:18] <aztracker1> ||x|x||, update to edgy...
[07:18] <corevett1> when i try to do a make command, it responds that /lib/modules/2.6.17-7-generic/build is missing, please set KERNALPATH. stop.
[07:18] <haxality> integrated development environment
[07:19] <RoC_MM> cmweb, 4gigabit is 682 times faster than the wired cable modem connection I have here.
[07:19] <haxality> it's a consolidated set of programming tools all in one package that is usually easy to use and tends towards GUI-ness
[07:19] <haxality> if that made sense :x
[07:19] <cmweb> RoC_MM, well hell my uncles wrong?
=== GobleGoblekid is now known as FatpigKid
[07:19] <aztracker1> kyconquers, there are a few out there, though eclipse is probably most used...
[07:19] <malt> wonder why ddclient is not in my package manger and i got all my updates?
[07:19] <RoC_MM> cmweb, if you'd like you can google for "speakeasy speedtest" which has a good speedtest.
[07:19] <kyconquers> I have eclipse right now
[07:19] <haxality> cmweb: we aren't calling you a liar. just saying you might have misheard
[07:19] <dawkirst> Is Evolution any good, or should I get Thunderbird?
[07:20] <haxality> cmweb: because that is an obscenely fast connection for an average home user to have
[07:20] <||x|x||> :(
[07:20] <RoC_MM> It's borderline absurd.
[07:20] <pradeepvglughyd> how to start bittorrent ??
[07:20] <||x|x||> i have to download edgy?
[07:20] <cmweb> Its not for a home user its an office building but he has access at his home
[07:20] <quinnster> It pretty difficult for me to use the quote key.  I can do it, but it takes me about .5-1 second of holding it down to show up.   Same thing is going on with the tilde ( ~ ).  Is this a keyboard layout issue?  Anything I can do?
[07:20] <RoC_MM> Univerisities don't even have connections that fast, even half a dozen put together.
[07:20] <haxality> cmweb: that isn't exactly how it works
[07:20] <ademan> quinnster: are you dual booting linux and windows?
[07:21] <aztracker1> kyconquers, I've been leaning towards .net/mono over java myself...
[07:21] <haxality> cmweb: he probably has a VNC connection
[07:21] <quinnster> ademan: yes.
[07:21] <ademan> quinnster: does it work on windows?
[07:21] <haxality> cmweb: which means he can access his office LAN but he's still limited by the physical media he's connecting from
[07:21] <quinnster> ademan: I never thought to check on there.  Should I try and come back?
[07:21] <ademan> because honestly, that sounds like a hardware problem to me...
[07:21] <ademan> yeah, definitely check
[07:21] <aztracker1> dawkirst, Evolution is more similar to outlook.. thunderbird is better for multiple account handling.
[07:21] <RoC_MM> cmweb, you could set up a server at his work...that would work if it's done with the blessing of the network administrators there.
[07:21] <quinnster> ademan: ok thanks, brb
[07:22] <dawkirst> aztracker1: thanks.
[07:22] <RoC_MM> cmweb, there is no such thing as a "G4" but there is a T3.
[07:23] <cmweb> gah, il go with the myspace thing
[07:23] <RoC_MM> which is obscenely fast.
[07:23] <RoC_MM> Don't do it, myspace rots your brain.
[07:23] <aztracker1> dawkirst, no prob... basically if you want outlook style functionality (not outlook express) go for evolution, if you're like me with 9 email accounts to manage, I use tbird.
[07:23] <VigoFusion> gotta reboot? just did an update.
[07:24] <whohuhwhat> evening all, first timer here so be gentle.  Thoughts on running Ubuntu under VMWare as i'm not sure i really want to partition my HD at this time.  will this give me an accurate testing of the OS?
[07:24] <cmweb> il get the dam page where it says it
[07:24] <quinnster> ademan: hey, I'm on WinXP and the shift key is working as expected.
[07:24] <RoC_MM> whohuhwhat, yes and no
[07:25] <||x|x||> aztracker1, i already did execute 'gksu "update-manager -c"' it says my computer is up-to-date.. my firefox is still version 1.5.0.8
[07:25] <RoC_MM> ubuntu is a livecd, so you may just want to reboot it...hardware detection and compatability is something you really want...a livecd you can just pop in and reboot, and it loads into your ram without needing any immediate install to your hard drive.
[07:25] <RoC_MM> you can test it out fully and see if it works and if you like it
[07:25] <RoC_MM> and it won't have the performance overhead of virtual machien software like vmware
[07:25] <whohuhwhat> wow, didn't know that, hmmmmm
[07:26] <aztracker1> ||x|x||, did you look in synaptic then?
[07:26] <RoC_MM> but to anser your question, yes vmware will more or less give you a good idea.
=== cari_tmen_ce is now known as girl
[07:26] <||x|x||> aztracker1, yes
=== girl is now known as guv
[07:26] <whohuhwhat> exellent that was what i was hoping for, tyvm RoC_MM
[07:26] <||x|x||> aztracker1, do i have to "apt-get dist-upgrade"?
[07:26] <aztracker1> RoC_MM, vmware runs XP okay on my P42.8 w/ 2gb ram, 768 for the vm
[07:27] <RoC_MM> I'm not surprised
[07:27] <RoC_MM> 768 megs of ram is a crapload, and vmware is the best virtual machine software out there.
[07:27] <haxality> yeah...
[07:27] <haxality> that is a ton of ram
[07:27] <haxality> my desktop that was so modern about 3 years ago still only has a gig
[07:28] <aztracker1> ||x|x||, if the gksu is up to date, maybe not.. use system..administration..synaptic and search for firefox.. see if 2.0 is there, if so uncheck 1.5.x and check 2.0
[07:28] <RoC_MM> I give my linux VM's like 256 and XP is greedy so I give it 320.
[07:28] <agent> ||x|x||: officially, it is not recommened to use apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade from one ubuntu release to another
[07:28] <haxality> cmweb: what is the problem you're having
[07:28] <jml> agent: what is recommended?
[07:28] <cmweb> >:o
[07:28] <agent> !upgrade
[07:28] <RoC_MM> ||x|x||, you name is gay, but look for a package called "firefox2" it may be in the package system under that name.
[07:28] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[07:29] <quinnster> I'm having problems typing quotes and tildes on Ubuntu 6.10.  It works on WinXP.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  Thanks!
[07:29] <aztracker1> RoC_MM, I run Visual Studio, and Paint Shop Pro on my XP vm, so I give it more..
[07:29] <RoC_MM> Oh
[07:29] <RoC_MM> Visual Studio must be greedy as well
[07:29] <aztracker1> about all I run under my xp vm.
[07:29] <elkbuntu> RoC_MM, that wasnt a very nice thing to say, please apologise to ||x|x||
[07:29] <haxality> quinnster: sounds like a problem with your keyboard layout.
[07:29] <aztracker1> VS isn't so bad... photo stuff saps the ram though..
[07:29] <haxality> try gnome-keyboard-properties
[07:29] <aztracker1> eats even.
[07:29] <agent> !edgy > jml
[07:29] <||x|x||> :(
[07:30] <RoC_MM> IT's a pain to type the first few characters of ||\\||
[07:30] <jml> agent: I know all of that about edgy :)
[07:30] <haxality> RoC_MM: you don't have tab completion?
[07:30] <quinnster> I tried changing between the defaults... Maybe I need to try some more.  I'm on a Toshiba Satellite A75-S209 laptop.  Any inside tips?
[07:30] <RoC_MM> haha
[07:30] <RoC_MM> my brother has one of those
[07:30] <agent> jml: then you should already know the official upgrade method which is mentioned on that page
[07:30] <marshall> toshiba setellietes are nice
[07:30] <RoC_MM> I'm surprised you could find the tilda.
[07:30] <haxality> quinnster: I'm on a tecra M1, myself. my only advice is that toshiba laptops do not like linux at all. they take a bit of convincing
[07:30] <jml> agent: well, I did after you gave me the first link :)
[07:30] <||x|x||> agent, if i upgade my drapper to edgy.. what command should i execute?
[07:31] <agent> jml: ok :P
[07:31] <quinnster> Yeah, it's quite a different keyboard layout, Roc_MM.
[07:31] <agent> !edgy > ||x|x||
[07:31] <haxality> quinnster: my best advice is try googling for some images of standard keyboard layouts, and comparing them with yours..
[07:31] <RoC_MM> My brother's Toshiba works great with Kubuntu...everything works out of the box perfect.
[07:31] <quinnster> OK, thanks haxality.
[07:31] <haxality> RoC_MM: alright, I guess I mean older toshiba laptops then
[07:31] <||x|x||> agent, !edgy at console?
[07:31] <quinnster> So does this one, but there is a big power issue with it.  I just joined the class action lawsuit.
[07:31] <haxality> RoC_MM: since those are the only ones I really have experience
[07:31] <RoC_MM> There are many models of toshiba laptops.
[07:32] <RoC_MM> And many generations.
[07:32] <ivx> hey i installed proftpd and set it up and also gproftp to config, and i got it setup with a user, and can log in and it is connected to the correct dir, but after login, it just lists the files in the same way that apache does if there isn't an index, what do i have to do so that that user can drag files and copy and all that
[07:32] <haxality> quinnster: ..class-action lawsuit?
[07:32] <jml> agent: I was simply curious. apt-get dist-upgrade has been taking me to new and exciting linux horizons since slink.
[07:32] <agent> ||x|x||: lol no.... that is a command in this irc channel, it should have sent you a message about edgy upgrade
[07:32] <||x|x||> ahh
[07:32] <||x|x||> hehe :D
[07:32] <||x|x||> !edgy
[07:32] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[07:33] <quinnster> haxality: yeah, http://lorisklar.com/
[07:33] <agent> ||x|x||: and if i want to send that only to you instead of this whole channel, i write !edgy > ||x|x||
[07:33] <haxality> aw, that sucks
[07:33] <||x|x||> thanks
[07:33] <haxality> toshiba actually had a decent record as a manufacturer up until that
[07:34] <haxality> heh
[07:34] <||x|x||> thank you aztracker1 too
[07:34] <||x|x||> :)
[07:34] <malt> wonder why ddclient is not in my package manger and i got all my updates?
[07:34] <dawkirst> haxality: while you're on the subject, what is a good brand laptop to invest in?
[07:34] <malt> can i add it some how?
[07:34] <quinnster> haxality: the computer runs sorta hot.  lots of equipment for the size.  this heat somewhat desolders the AC power adapter (the part just inside the laptop) over time.  Took mine 1+ year.  I took it apart, resoldered it, but now it's going loose again.  Real annoying.  This lawsuit should make toshiba extend everyone's warranty for a year so you can send it back and get it fixed.
[07:34] <agent> jml: i dist-upgraded hoary->breezy->dapper->edgy :) and even dist-upgrade debian->ubuntu
[07:35] <haxality> quinnster: one of the few lawsuits like that that I actually agree with
[07:35] <aztracker1> ddclient, is it in the main repository, have you enabled the others (commercial, unsupported, etc)
[07:35] <agent> jml: so its definetly possible to use dist-upgrade but you need to know how because things can go wrong
[07:35] <haxality> and also, props for resoldering stuff inside your laptop
[07:35] <jml> agent: right
[07:35] <haxality> I consider myself decent with a soldering iron but I don't think I have the chops for such an endeavor
[07:36] <haxality> fortunately this thing is rock solid aside from a little wobble in the screen supports
[07:36] <quinnster> hehe, thx.  it's pretty easy to access and isn't surface mount or anything so there's lots of space to work with.  i see these on ebay every other week for 'unknown power problems' selling for parts for like $50
[07:36] <haxality> ugh
[07:36] <haxality> that's unfortunate
[07:36] <quinnster> i sent the url for the fix to a few of the sellers, but it's easier to sell than solder for them.
[07:36] <haxality> I hate when good hardware is ruined by bad end product design
[07:37] <haxality> is there anything you can do to decrease the operating temp?
[07:37] <Pavi> can somebody help me upgrading from breezy to edgy
[07:37] <||x|x||> agent, is it system safe to upgrade to edgy while running xchat?
[07:37] <haxality> underclock your CPU, maybe?
[07:37] <Pavi> how to do it
[07:37] <aztracker1> !edgy
[07:37] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[07:37] <aztracker1> Pavi, see above
[07:37] <||x|x||> agent, i'm running the upgrade now
[07:37] <haxality> ||x|x||: due to the way ext filesystems work, files are generally never locked while in use
[07:37] <agent> ||x|x||: sure.... but you may be disconnected after a while.... depends... but it wont hard anything
[07:38] <RoC_MM> ||x|x||, yes.
[07:38] <agent> ||x|x||: hard = harm
[07:38] <quinnster> yeah, there's poewr management stuff to decrease the brightness and cpu speed.  but, that's also why i bought it.  hopefully i'll be able to send this back and get the fix and be good from there.
[07:38] <haxality> yeah
[07:38] <Pavi> but the command " update-manager -c" show no new dist upgrades
[07:38] <gamboos> How would I go about installing a USB game controller?
[07:38] <haxality> that really bugs me, actually
[07:38] <||x|x||> ah.. ic.. thanks
[07:38] <haxality> I see more and more laptops that have 3-prong power adapters, and it's like, wow, what could they possibly need that much juice for
[07:38] <agent> Pavi: maybe because you are running edgy? :D
[07:39] <Pavi> how to check
[07:39] <RoC_MM> haxality, it's for the 1GB of RAM!
[07:39] <RoC_MM> Don't be silly.
[07:39] <haxality> ahhhh ok
[07:39] <haxality> how could I forget
[07:39] <RoC_MM> :-P
[07:39] <quinnster> the biggest problem is that there are two air intake fans on the bottom of the laptop.  now, there are four 1/2 inch pads to hold it up--that works fine if you're on a table, but for people who use it on their lap, carpet, bed, etc... they fry up fast.
[07:39] <RoC_MM> Actually the 3rd prong provides no power, it is a ground.
[07:39] <haxality> I know that.
[07:39] <quinnster> i've been using a large book under my laptop for the past year!  this is more of a portable desktop than a laptop.
[07:40] <haxality> but there is no point in having the 3rd prong on the power cord unless there's a decent amount of amperage running through it
[07:40] <RoC_MM> ic
[07:40] <quinnster> yeah.  19v 6.3amps for me
[07:40] <agent> Pavi: the easiest way is system -> about ubuntu
[07:40] <haxality> quinnster: that sucks, man, I really don't see the logic in putting the primary cooling apperatus for a computer on the one face of it that sees the least cool air
[07:40] <Pavi> ok
[07:41] <dawkirst> haxality: With what laptop brand would you go?
[07:41] <haxality> dawkirst: actually, I'd probably still say toshiba
[07:41] <RoC_MM> Titanium.
[07:42] <haxality> just because my experience with their support infrastructure has been very pleasant
[07:42] <quinnster> dawkirst: to be honest, i'm going back to desktops.  i'm not a fan of laptops, but have had one for work and stuff for the past few years.
[07:42] <RoC_MM> anything made out of titanium is good.
[07:42] <RoC_MM> or duranium.
[07:42] <quinnster> just make sure you research the wifi, graphics, etc.
[07:42] <haxality> OR DEPLETED URANIUM MUAHAHAHA
[07:42] <haxality> yeah.
[07:42] <RoC_MM> haha
[07:42] <dawkirst> Ok, thanks.
[07:42] <haxality> dawkirst: I would vote toshiba or IBM for a portable laptop
[07:42] <haxality> no idea for a desktop replacement
[07:43] <RoC_MM> Dell?
[07:43] <haxality> also toshiba is about the only company other than IBM to put trackpoints in theirs
[07:43] <haxality> actually now that I think about it HP makes some awesome media-centric DTR laptops
[07:43] <dawkirst> And what about laptop CPUs? Allot of them here comes with Celerons, but I don't know about that. I prefer AMD.
[07:43] <haxality> dawkirst: steer clear of celerons, generally
[07:43] <dawkirst> Yeah.
[07:43] <dawkirst> What about Packard Bell?
[07:43] <haxality> the new ones are considerably better, but they tend to be a terrible value
[07:44] <haxality> haha, I didn't even know they still existed
[07:44] <dawkirst> lol
[07:44] <agent> dawkirst: ibm (now under lenovo) are the best laptops.. thinkpad t and x series
[07:44] <quinnster> dawkirst: check out http://www.linux-laptop.net/, search forums for the model # and the words "review" and "problem", search for people who have done the advanced stuff with your laptop (video binary drivers, wifi, suspend, etc.)--not just 'knoppix works', see how many are being sold on ebay for 'parts', and maybe try calling customer support before you buy it and see how friendly they are! :)
[07:44] <dawkirst> agent: thanks, will look into it. Now that I think about it the IBMs impressed me quite a bit.
[07:45] <||x|x||> agent, if upgrade is cancelled, could it be continued the next time?
[07:45] <haxality> IBMs are the only laptops I lust after more than toshibas
[07:45] <agent> dawkirst: i would rather get a used thinpad t/x than a new dell (i sold dells so i know they are, uhm, not of good quality)
[07:45] <dawkirst> quinnster: thanks!
[07:45] <haxality> durable, simple, and they have AWESOME keyboards
[07:45] <RoC_MM> ||x|x||, usually.
[07:46] <agent> ||x|x||: i would not try it if i were you...
[07:46] <jml> haxality: my powerbook is pretty nice (what a shame I can't get wireless working w/ ubuntu)
[07:46] <quinnster> jml, what driver do you have?
[07:46] <RoC_MM> yeah but don't do it ||x|x||
[07:46] <quinnster> or, what type of card.
[07:46] <jml> quinnster: bcm43xx
[07:46] <FatpigKid> is there an album creator in linux? for photos?
[07:46] <||x|x||> oh.. coz i dont have much time to download the packages
[07:46] <jml> quinnster: I posted to the forums w/ the relevant info. sec...
[07:46] <||x|x||> my connection is slow
[07:46] <agent> FatpigKid: yes, quite a few... in ubuntu edgy there is fspot
[07:46] <||x|x||> hmm
[07:47] <quinnster> jml: does it work in other distros?  slackware+ndis?
[07:47] <haxality> oh man, wish I had like 1000 bucks lying around..
[07:47] <dawkirst> haxality: don't we all? ;)
[07:47] <jml> quinnster: I have only tried ubuntu.
[07:47] <haxality> jml: I like the design of apple laptops, but I don't think I could ever use a single-button interface
[07:47] <quinnster> no, some wish we had more than 1,000. :)
[07:47] <FatpigKid> agent, ok ill try it
[07:47] <agent> ||x|x||: if you are just downloading then yes... you can stop it no problem... but never stop an upgrade once it starts to actually upgrade/install packages
[07:47] <dawkirst> Naturally.
[07:47] <jml> haxality: fair enough.
[07:47] <whohuhwhat> does Ubuntu come with a IRC client or do you have to install one?
[07:48] <haxality> and I don't want to start a flame war or anything but I've recently gotten somewhat fed up with apple
[07:48] <haxality> heh
[07:48] <quinnster> whohuhwhat: install xchat.
[07:48] <||x|x||> maybe next time.. i'll start upgrading early in the morning
[07:48] <||x|x||> :)
[07:48] <FatpigKid> agent, mmm fspot?
[07:48] <agent> whohuhwhat: uuuuuuhhh... you are using irc right now :)
[07:48] <haxality> don't get me wrong, if I could find one at a decent price I'd pick up a used ibook in a second
[07:48] <FatpigKid> agent, cant find the package
[07:48] <jml> quinnster: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301958
[07:48] <||x|x||> thanks agent & RoC_MM
[07:48] <quinnster> jml: check out ndiswrapper.  you'll have to confirm your driver, but if it has windows drivers you can usually load it.
[07:48] <agent> FatpigKid: its already installed in edgy by default
[07:48] <quinnster> jml: just saw your url... brb
[07:48] <jml> quinnster: where would I get windows drivers?
[07:48] <agent> FatpigKid: applications -> graphics -> fspot
[07:49] <agent> ||x|x||: your welcome
[07:49] <quinnster> jml: do you dual (or more) boot?
[07:49] <FatpigKid> agent, im on dapper, ya thnk i have to dl the source?
[07:49] <dawkirst> whohuhwhat: it does. Gaim.
[07:49] <whohuhwhat> yea, i just finished installing Ubuntu with VM ware, this is my windows irc client :(
[07:49] <bongzilla> good day
[07:49] <jml> quinnster: no. at the moment I am only running OS X. I tried using Ubuntu on my powerbook then gave up after I couldn't get wireless working.
[07:49] <bongzilla> im having problem in my dhcp server

[07:51] <bongzilla> but the server can't ping the workstation
[07:51] <quinnster> jml: oh! i guess that would make it hard to get windows drivers.  :) i have no experience with apple, but go to the website and see if you can find a driver download for win32.  there are 2 files among them that ndiswrapper can use.
[07:51] <FatpigKid> agent, now we're talking

[08:02] <gpled> cmweb: you are right where i am at
[08:02] <mnepton> cmweb: you'll need a 32bit compat lib for Firefox, or a chroot'ed 32 bit instance.
[08:02] <gpled> cmweb: you said 6.10?
[08:02] <cmweb> no 6.06
[08:02] <dougsko> cmweb: i downloaded the installer from the flash website, and ran the installer. the only thing is that it makes the new path to the patched ff, /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
[08:02] <cmweb> 6.20 hates me
[08:02] <bongzilla> what's the next step dougsko?
[08:03] <gpled> cmweb: 6.10 hates me :)

[08:03] <cmweb> i have dapper
[08:03] <dougsko> bongzilla: i really dont know. it sounds like a firewall is running on windows, but im not sure

[08:05] <darius_> I've upgraded a second laptop to Edgy .. and now the Network Configuration tool does not list the available wireless APs on either laptop.

[08:12] <dougsko> cmweb: are you running the installer?
[08:12] <bongzilla> thanks foo
[08:12] <blufox> enyc, yes it is listening on the port i specified in the conf file
[08:12] <cmweb> YES
[08:13] <dougsko> cmweb: whats the default?
[08:13] <foo> cmweb: Easy with all caps, we aren't paid to help. All caps implies you are yelling.
[08:13] <cmweb> hu
[08:13] <enyc> blufox: ok so far
[08:13] <enyc> blufox: from the other machine,
[08:14] <gpled> bongzilla: on the xp box, can you ping 192.168.1.1?
[08:14] <enyc> blufox: try "telnet (server) (port)" -- e.g. "telnet 192.168.2.53 8100" or whatever it is
[08:14] <blufox> i mean d server is listening
[08:14] <blufox> ok enyc :)
[08:14] <bongzilla> yes sir
[08:14] <bongzilla> i can ping
[08:14] <bongzilla> i can ping 192.168.1.1
[08:14] <enyc> blufox: (grom the machine where you are trying to agt-get)
[08:14] <cmweb> dougsko, /home/clint
[08:14] <zebulon25> hi everybody
[08:14] <gpled> bongzilla: on the xp box, what do you show as the gateway?  you can see this with ipconfig /all
[08:14] <dougsko> blufox: nmap is an invaluble tool when doing stuff like that. you can use it test if your ports are open very easily
[08:15] <blufox> enyc, i m trying to see if it works from the server only
[08:15] <blufox> it doesnt even works for the server itself
[08:15] <blufox> enyc, it doesnt even works for the server itself
[08:15] <bongzilla> gateway is 192.168.1.1
[08:15] <dougsko> cmweb: cmweb whats is that directory?
[08:15] <cmweb> i found it
[08:15] <blufox> ok enyc
[08:15] <enyc> blufox: hrrm firewall on server??
[08:15] <dougsko> cmweb: ...please dont paste its contents :D
[08:16] <enyc> blufox: can't even "telnet localhost (port)" on the server-machine itself?
[08:16] <dougsko> cmweb: oh, thats yr home dir, isnt it?
[08:16] <dougsko> cmweb: nm
[08:16] <cmweb> Mozilla installation directory  = /home/clint/.mozilla
[08:16] <gpled> bongzilla: how did you setup routing on your 192.168.1.1 ?
[08:16] <dougsko> cmweb: whatever, just hit [enter]  and go with the default
[08:17] <cmweb> you dont know where im at
[08:17] <dxdemetriou> can I bring back the programs on notification area if gnome panel crash and disappeared?
[08:17] <blufox> i can telnet from the local machine enyc
[08:17] <bongzilla> can you give me an idea with that
[08:17] <bongzilla> routing
[08:17] <dougsko> cmweb: ok...
[08:17] <gpled> bongzilla: i think what you did was setup a dhcp server that works.  but you are now working on making the dhcp server a router
[08:18] <enyc> blufox: are you sure the service is listeneing on all interfaces andd not just localhost?
[08:18] <bongzilla> what should i do sir
[08:18] <gpled> bongzilla: is there any other dhcp servers on your network?  like a dsl modem, or access point?
[08:18] <enyc> blufox: look at the line in "netstat -ltn"
[08:18] <z9999> Does anyone know where to obtain the information to be placed in  wireless_key entry of /etc/network/interfaces file?
[08:19] <bongzilla> nop
[08:19] <blufox> enyc, it says Local adrress as 0.0.0.0:3142
[08:19] <enyc> blufox: ok that means all interfaces
[08:19] <bongzilla> a straight ds3 connection
[08:19] <AcidEyE> from where i can download new themes for Ubuntu 6.10?
[08:19] <bongzilla> then i just connect the server in the core switch
[08:19] <blufox> enyc, and foreign adrress as 0.0.0.0:*
[08:19] <gpled> bongzilla: just to test things do ipconfig /releaseall
[08:19] <bongzilla> and set the public ip add in eth1
[08:19] <enyc> blufox: that means any other host can connect in stort
[08:20] <daya> how can i add to panel an icon (such as keyboard indicator) by directly editing a file?
[08:20] <gpled> bongzilla: then to ipconfig all .  you should see all 0000
[08:20] <bongzilla> in the workstation
[08:20] <bongzilla> ok
[08:20] <gpled> bongzilla: then do renew
[08:20] <blufox> enyc, but it is not connecting somehow :(
[08:20] <fallingdutch> hi all, does anyone know what to do if you bundle some files together in a package that have different licenses (BSD, GPL and LGPL) do i have to split them into different packages or can i refer in the copyright to the licences on the system , claiming wich part uses which license? (a link would be cool, too)
[08:20] <gpled> bongzilla: to see if you get the ip address again
[08:21] <blufox> enyc, it says conncetion failed for all the serves in the sources.list on doing a apt-get update
[08:21] <foo> heading out, late - I'll be back tomorrow, thanks moonie and AlienX
[08:21] <enyc> blufox: now... you know the ip address of the server machine?  check with ''ifconfig''
[08:21] <gpled> bongzilla: any luck?
[08:21] <bongzilla> it turns into 0.0.0.0
[08:22] <enyc> blufox: ON the server do "telnet (ip) 3142" -- does that connect (you know it works for localhost)?
[08:22] <VigoFusio1> Hot Dawg! that was easy, TBird installed from GUI thingy
[08:22] <gpled> bongzilla: you know how to renew ?
[08:22] <bongzilla> yup
[08:23] <gpled> bongzilla: did you get your addresses back?
[08:23] <bongzilla> i already did it then it back again in 192.168.1.200
[08:23] <bongzilla> yup
[08:23] <bongzilla> it back
[08:23] <gpled> bongzilla: and gateway 192.168.1.1
[08:23] <bongzilla> yup
[08:23] <blufox> enyc, i can telnet the machine at desired port
[08:23] <bongzilla> exactly
[08:23] <enyc> blufox: ok,, ,now do the same thing from ANOTHER machine
[08:24] <gpled> bongzilla: ok, good job on getting your dhcp working :)
[08:24] <enyc> blufox: (not from the server)
[08:24] <gpled> bongzilla: think you just need to fix your route table
[08:24] <bongzilla> how can we do that?
[08:24] <bongzilla> the route table
[08:24] <Shadow_mil> is there anyway I can setup so my video out is my video in?
[08:24] <malt> anyone here use ddclient?
[08:24] <gpled> bongzilla: type route
[08:25] <blufox>  yes enyc i understand that ;), yup working from the client machine too

[08:37] <omeganine> What kernel should i be using for a duel core CPU?  Is it -smp or just 686?
[08:37] <Pavi> thx jernst
[08:37] <bongzilla> still there?
[08:37] <enyc> omeganine: -smp
[08:37] <Viscid2> Alpha2: thanks, btw
[08:37] <omeganine> Cool, thanks.
[08:38] <enyc> omeganine: however in edgy they have a generic kernel with smp etc. always seemingly

[08:39] <Enselic_> How can I specify what python bin that should be used?
[08:39] <bongzilla> 224 is my subnet mask
[08:39] <bongzilla> for the public ip add
[08:40] <omeganine> If I remember right, in 6.01 when I moved to SMP it killed my wireless drivers...among other things...if I dont have to upgrade my kernel i would rather not.

[08:48] <zzyber> Hi, i have a winmodem called HSF 56k HSFi Modem in my hardware monitor, yesterday i tried to activate it to use it as Fax modem but failed so i started looking for a solution and found a driver online. The problem is the driver cost awsome 19USD and i hate to spen that money on a driver alone, and just the thought of someone earning money on a driver and not having it as GPL make me mad.
[08:48] <Agrajag> corevett1: linux-headers-`uname -r`
[08:48] <Agrajag> the backticks are significant
[08:48] <bongzilla> it can't ping
[08:48] <cmweb> zzyber, check the fourms
[08:48] <zzyber> Do anyone here have another solution for me to use, another driver maybe?
[08:48] <corevett1> aprajag thats what i typed...and they can't find it
[08:48] <gpled> bongzilla: 58.71.27.70 ?
[08:48] <bongzilla> that'
[08:48] <cmweb> zzyber, im useing lucent/Agree modem here
[08:48] <bongzilla> that's my public ip
[08:48] <bongzilla> 70
[08:48] <Agrajag> corevett1: no, you didn't. Did you use ' instead of `?
[08:49] <bongzilla> 58.71.27.70
[08:49] <corevett1> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-'uname -r' responds with 'couldn't find package linux-headers-uname -r'
[08:49] <cmweb> But my question still stands how do i install Shockwave
[08:49] <jernst> cmweb: there is no shockwave version for linux yet, so you have to use the windows one for the shockwave sites
[08:49] <corevett1> aprajag oh wait
[08:49] <gpled> bongzilla: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33632/
[08:49] <DarkMageZ> zzyber, ask your friends if they have a spare real modem? or maybe get dsl

[08:50] <bongzilla> i dont know what's 58.71.27.64 doing in my route table
[08:50] <Agrajag> corevett1: you're on edgy?
[08:50] <corevett1> aprajag yes
[08:50] <Agrajag> corevett1: update your kernel, it's on 2.6.17-10 now

[08:51] <bongzilla> i have no idea
[08:52] <Agrajag> corevett1: then where were you going to get that package?
[08:52] <DarkMageZ> zzyber, there are some drivers available for winmodems, but only particular models. it's better to get a real modem.

[09:00] <bongzilla> the eth1? the public?
[09:00] <mnepton> it does not
[09:00] <gpled> dark_light: you can not get flash working on firefox if it is 64bit
[09:00] <malt> anyone here use ddclient?
[09:00] <dark_light> gpled, even flash 9?
[09:00] <bongzilla> what's next sir
[09:01] <dark_light> i heard flash 9 would have 64bits versions
[09:01] <gpled> dark_light: i think the best bet is to get 32bit firefox working on your amd 64 box
[09:01] <Amaranth> dark_light: Maybe by the end of 2007

[09:01] <Amaranth> dark_light: that's what i've heard about flash9 on amd64
[09:01] <dark_light> i think i will install gnash instead
[09:02] <Amaranth> cmweb: You can't repartition the HD you're running on.
[09:02] <gpled> bongzilla: is eth0 public?
[09:02] <dark_light> Amaranth, no, he can
[09:02] <Amaranth> dark_light: gnash is barely flash 7 compatible and doesn't even work with youtube/google video
[09:02] <bongzilla> eth1 is public
[09:02] <cmweb> Well then im going to run out of space i only got 898.2 MB left!
[09:02] <bongzilla> eth0 is the 192.168.1.1
[09:02] <Amaranth> dark_light: Not the partitions he is using
[09:03] <dark_light> cmweb, just run your prefered partition program, but changing currently mounted partitions isn't very wise
[09:03] <jernst> cmweb: why don't you use the livecd ?
[09:03] <gpled> bongzilla: look at eth1
[09:03] <cmweb> dark_light, what
[09:03] <dark_light> Amaranth, well, he can delete a partition he is using, but the kernel will not notice the change
[09:03] <bongzilla> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33634/
[09:03] <cmweb> jernst, i dont feel like reformating
[09:03] <jernst> cmweb: you don't need to reformat, just use gparted
[09:04] <dark_light> cmeme, try sudo aptitude install gparted
[09:04] <Amaranth> dark_light: Alright, pretend I had a 'Sanely' in front of my sentence. :P
[09:04] <jernst> boot with the livecd, go to system/administration/gnome partition editor
[09:04] <dark_light> Amallya, hmn :P

[09:12] <spdf> syntaxx, Sounds like you're missing a Window Manger, install Emerald
[09:12] <kyconquers> what music programs do you sugest?
[09:12] <bongzilla> that's all then it will work?
[09:12] <syntaxx> spdf: yeah i already have emerald.. when i run it manually im getting segfault
[09:12] <sn9> rLynx: at least until i can get a spare hard disk to install 6.10 onto
[09:12] <||x|x||> how do i view hidden files & folders?
[09:13] <gpled> bongzilla: think so
[09:13] <bongzilla> my god

[09:13] <sn9> rLynx: in the meantime, 6.06 isn't so bad
[09:13] <bongzilla> i got deadlines
[09:13] <bongzilla> and
[09:13] <rLynx> sn9 why you are using 6.06? is it better then 6.10?
[09:13] <bongzilla> i propost ubuntu
[09:13] <gpled> you can manualy do it with route add
[09:13] <bongzilla> for the company
[09:13] <nanomike> !postfix

[09:14] <rLynx> i have 5.10 and 6.10, to 6.06 i gotta download it, and it will take 6 days, i am on low connection
[09:14] <gpled> kyconquers: vlc all the way
[09:14] <syntaxx> bongzilla: ano problem kosa? ^^
[09:14] <sn9> rLynx: they had eight months to work on 6.06, but only four on 6.10 -- and they tried to introduce more changes in 6.10
[09:14] <bongzilla> pare
[09:14] <bongzilla> syntaxx
[09:14] <gpled> kyconquers: but get it from the instructions from the vlc site
[09:14] <VigoFusio1> Can I just update 6.10 to the server as it is installed? I selected Non-Server, but all the packages are there....
[09:14] <||x|x||> gpled, how do i configure to view hidden files & folders?
[09:14] <bongzilla> may problema ata ako sa route table ko

[09:15] <Inez> Hi
[09:15] <ripper> nevermind i fixed my problem
[09:15] <ripper> :)
[09:15] <gpled> ||x|x||: ls -la will show all the .folders
[09:15] <ripper> seems most/all hp printers use the same drivers.

[09:15] <sn9> rLynx: 6.06 is hands down better than 5.10, but if you're on dial-up and have 6.10, stick with it
[09:15] <Inez> If I mount remote firectory via SSH using Places/Connect with server then where I can connect that drectory via MC?
[09:15] <rLynx> sn9 okies

[09:19] <dawkirst> Hi. Is it possible/common for my nVidia graphics adaptor to overheat due to Ubuntu?
[09:19] <||x|x||> gpled, thanks :)
[09:19] <FirstStrike> uhh
[09:19] <||x|x||> <<-- blind eyes
[09:19] <FirstStrike> dawkirst: why would it overheat due to ubuntu? It would overheat if it was improperly cooled.
[09:19] <||x|x||> its in the View menu
[09:19] <||x|x||> :D
[09:20] <Kelmos> someone can help me about postgre database?
[09:20] <dawkirst> FirstStrike: maybe Ubuntu doesn't distribute with proper nVidia driver support, for example.
[09:21] <FirstStrike> Did you install the nvidia drivers?
[09:21] <FirstStrike> I've been running a geforce 6800 GS with no issues.
[09:21] <FirstStrike> Mine doesn't overheat
[09:23] <dawkirst> Well I never said mine overheated, did I FirstStrike?
[09:24] <FirstStrike> Then what was the purpose of the question?
[09:24] <morten_> how can i patch into the local display (:0) of a remote computer?
[09:24] <VigoFusion> What kind of card? And is the Case well ventilated?
[09:24] <dawkirst> That is my purpose, and not the purpose of this channel to question the purpose behind the purpose.
[09:25] <Arcainus> morning
[09:27] <VigoFusion> What is the suggested AV? or what is the official AV ?
[09:29] <morten_> how can i patch into the local display (:0) of a remote computer?
[09:29] <VigoFusion> Good Morning Arcainus
[09:30] <dark_light> Amallya, er :P
[09:31] <VigoFusion> Use the View Remote doohicky
[09:31] <morten_> basically, i want to have the same display show up on the monitor as well as my laptop, and control it from the latter
[09:31] <morten_> how can i do this?
[09:32] <n3rdism> lol i didnt know ubuntu came packaged with "doohikies" is that fiesty yer running? :P
[09:33] <VigoFusion> You make a connection, permission is nice, in that case I dont think it needed, basically just a p2p doohicky, let me find the app
[09:33] <n3rdism> Terminal Server Client?
[09:33] <n3rdism> for remote desktop use?
[09:33] <VigoFusion> Yes
[09:34] <n3rdism> Applications > Internet
[09:34] <mathersalan> o
[09:34] <VigoFusion> That doohicky allows it
[09:34] <morten_> n3rdism: what do i need to run on the remote computer?
[09:35] <n3rdism> for some reason w/e i read something someone says. in my mind, its followed by 2 or 3 statements of jive talk back straight outa the 70's
[09:35] <morten_> remote computer doesn't have any gnome apps installed
[09:35] <n3rdism> morten: ive never actually used that to rdesktop
[09:36] <morten_> me neither :(
[09:36] <n3rdism> what type of computer are you connectng to?
[09:36] <VigoFusion> Is basic Admin stuff, allow incomeing from (select what you want here)
[09:36] <n3rdism> is it windows?
[09:36] <bilss_> hi
[09:36] <morten_> n3rdism: no. both are linux.
[09:36] <n3rdism> ok nvm, was gonna suggest logmein
[09:36] <eexp16> morten_: use vnc
[09:37] <guest459> anyone know where I can get some info on Mepis?
[09:37] <VigoFusion> You have to give permissions on both PCs, well its at least the right thing to do.
[09:37] <morten_> vnc will let me control :0?
[09:37] <eexp16> morten_: x11vnc can
[09:37] <bilss_> whats the command line to see what my free disk space is is it dd somwthing?
[09:37] <eexp16> morten_: x11vnc attaches to the running x session
[09:37] <morten_> fantastic
[09:37] <morten_> that's exactly what i need
[09:37] <VigoFusion> :)
[09:37] <eexp16> morten_: run x11vnc on the computer you want to remote control and any vnc viewer on the client side

[09:40] <Stanislav> i tried that
[09:40] <Stanislav> still wont start =\
[09:40] <enyc> omeganine: 6.10 IS latest release... no upgrades available (except experimental/testing)
[09:40] <n3rdism> try removing it completely first?
[09:40] <VigoFusion> Did you purge and install or overlay?
[09:40] <n3rdism> bilss: just type df in a terminal
[09:41] <Stanislav> just did reinstalled via the package manager
[09:41] <morten_> what vnc client do you guys recommend?
[09:41] <n3rdism> try completely removing it first, then installing it again
[09:41] <n3rdism> stanislav ^
[09:41] <eexp16> morten_: tightvnc
[09:41] <VigoFusion> It has allways been my callto Remove/Purge, then fresh install.
[09:42] <morten_> eexp16: how tight is it?
[09:42] <n3rdism> lol
[09:42] <Arcainus> i have an apt-get install question about clamav ... should i ask here or #clamav ? :\
[09:42] <n3rdism> like a 12 year old

[09:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i did not say that - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:42] <eexp16> morten_: tightvnc can optionally use jpeg compression for low network bandwidth
[09:42] <eexp16> n3rdism: muhahaha
[09:42] <Stanislav> whats ubuntu desktop system?
[09:42] <joshua__> can anyone help me with a simple gnome question?
[09:43] <VigoFusion> yall are just TOO funny
[09:43] <n3rdism> stanislav: its pretty useless actually, dont worry about getting rid of that
[09:43] <Stanislav> kk
[09:43] <bilss_> n3rdism: here it is   http://pastebin.ca/256497
[09:43] <joshua__> i deleted my desktop switcher from my bottom panel...and i can no longer switch between apps there. What do I have to add to the panel to get it back to normal?
[09:43] <n3rdism> nice
[09:43] <nanomike> How do I use postfix with SMTP-AUTH and TLS once I've installed it? Followed this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/email-services.html
[09:43] <n3rdism> bilss: so whats youre question?
[09:44] <bilss_> does it mean i am useing 16r more of my hard drive% o
[09:44] <umops> !xserver
[09:44] <n3rdism> joshua: right click, add to pannel.
[09:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xserver - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:44] <bilss_> 16%
[09:44] <VigoFusion> Desktop is for loosers like me that dont know squat about Linux, I think its package is for Low End Hardware and or just users that dont want or need Server Side
[09:44] <n3rdism> bills: affirmative
[09:45] <n3rdism> vigo: no more ecstacy
[09:45] <joshua__> n3rdism: yeah. But what do i have to add to get it back to normal?
[09:45] <n3rdism> "Workspace switcher"
[09:45] <eexp16> VigoFusion: why not learning to use the command line? it's really worth it, even if you are a desktop user.
[09:46] <VigoFusion> I am just lazy, too many years at a terminal got me tired.
[09:46] <n3rdism> its extremely handy, especially when you mess something up. or an unstable update is released. and you have to safe mode in and remove it
[09:46] <bilss_> so if i have a HD of 40 gigs 16% is being used so can use say 20 gigs for VM ware or Xen for example
[09:46] <Stanislav> ok firefox works now >_>
[09:46] <n3rdism> bilss: sure, sounds good. are you using a gui at all?
[09:47] <joshua__> n3rdism: thanks alot man. That worked. I'm a dumb noob
[09:47] <n3rdism> "im a dumb noob" lmfao
[09:47] <bilss_> just a mimimal flushbox at the moment
[09:47] <bilss_> fluxbox?
[09:47] <n3rdism> fluxbox*
[09:47] <eexp16> bilss_: fluxbox
[09:47] <joshua__> well, i installed beryl in 5 minutes without a problem. but my clumbsy ass somehow erases my entire bottom panel.
[09:48] <bilss_> ok thanks yep thats the one

[09:51] <n3rdism> compile a newer version from source
[09:51] <bilss_> i just wish ubuntu was more rock soild like Debian sarge

[09:59] <Acke_ubu> yeah 255.255.255.0 i think
[09:59] <bongzilla> what should i do?
[09:59] <Acke_ubu> i can check with router
[10:00] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: no, not the netmask. the subnet address. like 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.20.0
[10:00] <VigoFusion> 255 is default Subnet mask
[10:00] <n3rdism> bilss_: there you go :)
[10:00] <Acke_ubu> its 0.x
[10:00] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: so 192.168.0.x ?
[10:01] <bilss_> go where , what does there you go mean?
[10:01] <n3rdism> lol
[10:01] <n3rdism> good job in other words
[10:01] <Acke_ubu> eexp16: yes
[10:01] <VigoFusion> Multiple Units can use 255.255.255.0 XXXXXXXXXXXX.1,,,,or you can do that with the DHCP doohickey
[10:01] <bilss_> lol and the seas parted and unbuntu crossed
[10:01] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: do you have nmap installed?
[10:01] <n3rdism> XD
[10:02] <bilss_> and if i drink another cup of coffee will it make me feel better
[10:02] <Acke_ubu> 'i think so eexp16 how to use it?
[10:02] <n3rdism> omg i want some coffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, im crashing so hard
[10:03] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: nmap -p 80 192.168.0.0/24
[10:03] <n3rdism> nice eexp
[10:03] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: this will try to connect to port 80 on each address in the 192.168.0.x/255.255.255.0 subnet
[10:04] <n3rdism> eexp16: can you arg different ports?
[10:04] <eexp16> n3rdism: yeah, the -p option also accepts port ranges
[10:04] <n3rdism> dope
[10:04] <bilss_> ok its been updated sorry my fault
[10:04] <mzli> !paste
[10:04] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:04] <n3rdism> im sucha networking newb
[10:05] <eexp16> n3rdism: if you leave out the -p option, it will try "well known" ports (about 1500)
[10:05] <DeveLinux> good morning guys
[10:05] <n3rdism> g'morning
[10:05] <Acke_ubu> eexp16: would ubuntu accept scans on port 80 then?
[10:05] <n3rdism> eexp16: now how to setup bittorrent with ubuntu
[10:06] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: it will say the port is closed, but at least thats an answer
[10:06] <Acke_ubu>  yes
[10:06] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: so you can see which ip addresses exist
[10:06] <Acke_ubu> right
[10:07] <eexp16> n3rdism: i don't use peer2peer software. ask someone else.
[10:07] <VigoFusion> Synaptic Package manager has that ready for download.
[10:07] <n3rdism> haha its all good
[10:08] <n3rdism> vigofusion: i just have trouble getting the ports to go to the right places
[10:08] <cwillu> how do I make vi usable again under a console in edgy?
[10:08] <eexp16> cwillu: press ESC and then :q!
[10:08] <VigoFusion> I don't do p2p either, unless its SSL and I am physically talking with the other operater.
[10:08] <cwillu> **smack eexp16**
[10:09] <cwillu> eexp16:  I have great disdain for the editor that goes 'grumble grumble' when it doesn't do what nearly every other editor does when I hit ctrl+s
[10:10] <wenko> anyone know the command to apt-get the make compiler
[10:10] <cwillu> doesn't leave many options in a stock system :)
[10:10] <eexp16> cwillu: this is not the editors fault
[10:10] <Acke_ubu> damn maybe my mac ubuntu machine doesnt get ip from router... :(
[10:10] <eexp16> cwillu: the console itself reacts to ctrl-s
[10:10] <eexp16> cwillu: ctrl-s blocks all output, ctrl-q will resume
[10:10] <cwillu> believe me when I say I don't care, I just want vi to work how it did under dapper
[10:10] <n3rdism> wenko: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[10:11] <wenko> thanks
[10:11] <Acke_ubu> but anyways. it doesnt recognize my work laptop pc, but only the router, and the pc based ubuntu lappy im running
[10:11] <n3rdism> np
[10:11] <morten_> cwillu: they changed vi?
[10:11] <morten_> that's sacrilege!
[10:11] <cwillu> my best guess is that they changed the default terminal emulation or something
[10:11] <morten_> vi was perfected before most of us were born!
[10:11] <cwillu> arrow keys don't work under insert mode any more
[10:11] <eexp16> morten_: no. cwillu just typed ctrl-s and the console blocks. perfectly normal, has nothing to do with vi.
[10:11] <morten_> that's strange. works fine for me.
[10:12] <cwillu> eexp16: that's not what I'm talking about
[10:12] <n3rdism> i like scite :P
[10:12] <BeBraw> i just installed D-Link DWL-G122 wlan adapter on my new system. i used ndiswrapper and modprobe to set its driver. the problem is that the device does not appear in ubuntu's Networking settings and hence the connection does not work
[10:12] <eexp16> BeBraw: which h/w revision of the g122 is that?
[10:12] <Acke_ubu>  -p 8080 found one more ip.. :)
[10:12] <morten_> honestly, though, while i know it's rude to say so, i kinda prefer vim.
[10:12] <eexp16> Acke_ubu: hehe
[10:12] <morten_> for the syntax highlighting
[10:13] <cwillu> ahhhhhhhhh, that's what they did
[10:13] <BeBraw> eexp16: A1
[10:13] <n3rdism> scite is basically vim but gui
[10:13] <wenko> n3rdism: is there anyway to install it without teh CD?
[10:13] <eexp16> BeBraw: there are different revisions with different chipsets
[10:13] <n3rdism> wenko: install what again? sry, memory of a small kitten
[10:14] <cwillu> vi isn't the same thing as vim anymore
[10:14] <wenko> make
[10:14] <morten_> cwillu: if you were hardcore, you'd be using xterm anyways. and that hasn't changed as far as i know.
[10:14] <eexp16> BeBraw: oh, A1 has prism usb chipset i think. mine is B1, it has rt2570 (ralink) chipset.
[10:14] <morten_> actually, screw that. you'd be using tty1.
[10:14] <wenko> useing the sudo apt-get install build-essential command
[10:14] <cwillu> morten_: I'm running in single user mode
[10:14] <n3rdism> wenko: ofcourse, if you have an internet connection
[10:14] <cwillu> is that hardcore enough?
[10:14] <eexp16> BeBraw: sorry, i only have experience with the B1 one
[10:14] <morten_> it is. i'm proud of you, cwillu
[10:14] <BeBraw> eexp16: i used the netprism driver provided on the install cd. ndiswrapper -l shows the device just fine
[10:14] <cwillu> lol
[10:14] <n3rdism> wenko: you have to enable some universal repos tho
[10:14] <wenko> n3rdism: i think i have an internet connection on this computer... :P
[10:14] <eexp16> BeBraw: i dont use ndiswrapper at all, so i cant help you
[10:14] <wenko> universal repos?
[10:15] <BeBraw> eexp16: no problem :)
[10:15] <sc4ttrbrain> !beryl
[10:15] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[10:15] <n3rdism> wenko: in your sources.list
[10:15] <h2c> Hi, is anyone using beryl with an ATI card here ?. I had a little problem. #beryl currently doesn't seem to have anyone using ATI.
[10:15] <wenko> lol...lost me...im a n00b
[10:15] <cwillu> morten_:  okay, so vi and vim are ultimately symlinked to the same place.  why do they behave differently?
[10:15] <n3rdism> wenko: alternatively you can go System > Admin > Software Resources
[10:15] <Acke_ubu> i use ati
[10:15] <morten_> cwillu: are you shitting me?
[10:15] <h2c> Aye, thanks ubotu
[10:15] <cwillu> I am not
[10:15] <n3rdism> wenko; Softare Sources*
[10:15] <morten_> ubuntu doesn't have vi installed, but links to vim?
[10:16] <Acke_ubu> disable composite thats the only thing that works
[10:16] <morten_> that honestly offends me.
[10:16] <cwillu> and that changed recently,
[10:16] <morten_> i'm guessing it's some command line option, cwillu
[10:16] <eexp16> BeBraw: i think you don't need ndiswrapper for that card, i should run with the wlan-ng drivers. however, i am not sure.
[10:16] <morten_> but i haven't checked
[10:16] <cwillu> in a symlink?
[10:16] <cwillu> you can do that?
[10:16] <n3rdism> guys, stop you're making me feel cool
[10:16] <nanomike> Where do I paste logs?
[10:16] <Acke_ubu> im so screwed. i dont have a monitor for my mac. so i cant connect to it.. :(
[10:16] <VigoFusion> I have that stoopid 200 series, onboard, the ATI Linux didnt correct it, yet..........
[10:16] <wenko> n3rdism: ok I am in the UI, now what :P
[10:16] <Tomcat_> !paste | nanomike
[10:16] <ubotu> nanomike: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:17] <nanomike> Tomcat_, Thanks
[10:17] <Tomcat_> :-)
[10:17] <morten_> cwillu: i think so. but it doesn't seem like it's being done here.
[10:17] <wenko> n3rdism: think i got it
[10:17] <n3rdism> :)
[10:17] <morten_> couldn't you make a link an alias, though? like, 'ln /usr/bin/vim -mode vi /usr/bin/vi', or something like that?
[10:18] <Spee_Der> Acke_ubu: Can't you just use xvnc and connect to it that way ?
[10:18] <BeBraw> eexp16: okay. i will try those
[10:18] <morten_> cwillu: even so, i think it's pretty lame that they've taken out vi.
[10:19] <cwillu> morten_: I think vim's detecting the name its called by
[10:19] <kamui> i need some help again
[10:19] <cwillu> I just made my own symlink called 'vi' elsewhere, and it launched the vim-in-weird-mode
[10:19] <eexp16> BeBraw: if you try it, make sure that ndiswrapper module is not loaded anymore, possibly blocking the card
[10:19] <kamui> is there a program that will help me "step" through a c/c++ program
[10:19] <n3rdism> kamui: like ./configure ?
[10:19] <kamui> the thing is the binary is crosscompiled, so I can't actually just debug it
[10:20] <kamui> no, more like run step by step through the potential execution, so I can see the flow of the program in its source
[10:20] <cwillu> ahaaa
[10:20] <n3rdism> wtf, this isnt middle earth
[10:20] <kamui> similar to stepping through a program in basic
[10:20] <cwillu> /etc/vim/vim.tiny
[10:20] <asfalt> hi, i used apt-get install xmms and now i can play mp3's ok. however when i try to open an mp3 from a samba share on my network it does not play unless I copy it over first. can I change this?
[10:21] <BeBraw> eexp16: how do i unload it?
[10:21] <in4mer> ??
[10:21] <patrick_king> how would i download throught a proxy which makes  me to login
[10:21] <eexp16> BeBraw: sudo rmmod ndiswrapper
[10:21] <kamui> is this impossible?
[10:22] <sn9> kamui: gdb can work over a two-machine connection
[10:22] <cwillu> morton_:  ahhhh, much better.  now I can finish putting in my hacks to bash.bashrc to make it more windows cmd like
[10:22] <sn9> kamui: or you can use a virtual machine
[10:23] <asfalt> does this mean i need the grsteamer ? if i can play mp3 local in xmms but not from a samba share/network ?
[10:23] <n3rdism> kamui: would an IDE help?
[10:23] <BeBraw> eexp16: it works with wlan-ng! thanks a lot! :)
[10:23] <eexp16> BeBraw: cool
[10:23] <iron_angel> asfalt: no, not necessarily. gstreamer is an engine for playing media.
[10:23] <kamui> n3rdism: I don't know of any ide 's that would do that per say
[10:24] <kamui> I have codeblocks right now
[10:24] <iron_angel> asfalt: what happens when you try to play from a samba share?
[10:24] <kamui> I was hoping there was a program that would let me step through the application
[10:24] <sn9> kamui: qemu
[10:24] <n3rdism> kamui: well you could run specific sections of your code in an ide rigght?
[10:24] <kamui> n3rdism: no
[10:24] <kamui> this is a psp port of quake Im working on
[10:25] <n3rdism> woah, sweet
[10:25] <kamui> I need to see how the program steps through the original code
[10:25] <asfalt> iron_angel nothing, no error msg, ie say i will browse to a song, right click it, open with xmms, the title appears in xmms, but nothing plays back and pressing play has no effect
[10:25] <kamui> yea, I've fixed a ton of stuff and it compiles and runs quite well
[10:25] <n3rdism> sry, im out of ideas
[10:25] <kamui> working on fixing the ingame browser
[10:25] <n3rdism> home brew?
[10:25] <kamui> thats the problem is that I can't tell when the Cvars are initialized
[10:25] <kamui> yes
[10:25] <n3rdism> cool, good luck
[10:25] <kamui> thanks
[10:26] <kamui> I think I might call it a night
[10:26] <sn9> kamui: if your cross-devel target is a psp, you won't find anything better than qemu
[10:26] <kamui> been at this for hours
[10:26] <bilss_> hi again
[10:26] <kamui> sn9: qemu doesn't emulate the psp
[10:26] <n3rdism> its 4:30 here x.x
[10:26] <kamui> 3:30 here :)
[10:26] <n3rdism> hello bilss
[10:26] <kamui> cst
[10:26] <n3rdism> i dont even know what  im doing at this point lol
[10:26] <Mowhawko> anyone know about 6.10 not displaying SSIDs for wireless? worked fine in 6.06
[10:26] <bilss_> just to say thanks ton3rdism for firefox url
[10:26] <kamui> sn9: so why do you keep mentioning qemu?
[10:26] <sn9> kamui: the cpu by itself should be enough
[10:26] <bilss_> but
[10:27] <n3rdism> lmao
[10:27] <iron_angel> asfalt: Hmmm. what if you right-click the title in the xmms playlist and look at the properties?
[10:27] <kamui> sn9: the psp has 2 cpus, one arm7 one arm9
[10:27] <kamui> sn9how do I run a kxploited elf binary in qemu
[10:27] <bilss_> how to give alex thats me salex is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.udoers rights as in
[10:28] <asfalt> iron_angel under File Info i can see the smb:// path and the id3 tag details
[10:28] <Mowhawko> anyone know about 6.10 not displaying SSIDs for wireless? worked fine in 6.06...
[10:28] <n3rdism> bilss: what exactly are you trying to do
[10:28] <sn9> kamui: ah, well... i think qemu might only do arm4 or arm5. whatever
[10:28] <bilss_> following the  hwoto you sent me
[10:28] <bilss_> here look
[10:28] <n3rdism> what part are you on?
[10:28] <iron_angel> asfalt: ah, that's it. xmms doesn't directly know how to handle smb:// URLs. You'd have to mount the filesystem so that it appears to be local.
[10:28] <asfalt> iron_angel i must add, the share is not mounted where i am attemping to play it from, i simply browsed to it perhaps that is the problem
[10:28] <kamui> sn9: even if qemu did emulate the 7 and/or 9 cpu, how would I run the xmb on it?  thanks for your input though
[10:29] <cge> Does anyone here know how to mount a partition image (ie, made with dd if= of=) in Windows XP, with the added caveat that the image is 60GB and is on an ext2 partition mounted with the IFS driver?
[10:29] <iron_angel> asfalt: I don't recall precisely how to mount it, it's been forever since I've used smaba much...
[10:29] <n3rdism> kamui: leet gandalf hax
[10:29] <bilss_> http://pastebin.ca/256509
[10:29] <asfalt> aha thanks iron_angel , this is probably also the same issue with the divx movies then mplayer probably likewise doesn't like smb paths
[10:29] <iron_angel> cge: mount -t fstype -o loop file mountpoint
[10:29] <asfalt> iron_angel thats cool i can set the shares up, no problems there
[10:30] <cge> iron_angel: Err, I need to do this in Windows.
[10:30] <iron_angel> cge: oh, nuts.... Hmm. Not sure at all, sorry :-(
[10:30] <n3rdism> bilss: you can normally sudo?
[10:31] <cge> iron_angel: Mounting it in Linux would be too easy. I'd have to put it on an ntfs partition or something to make it challenging.
[10:31] <asfalt> now, on the note of mplayer, so far i tested one xvid file, it plays back fine, however on startup mplayer throws up an error "Requested audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available. Enable it at compilation. I used apt-get install mplayer to install mplayer itself
[10:31] <willvdl> is i810 driver correct for i945 chipset?
[10:31] <bilss_> n3rdism : not as alex no i do not want to go su then root do I ?
[10:31] <n3rdism> cge: if you're just using it as RO ntfs should work fine
[10:31] <Tomtheman70> Just wondering, can I burn an .iso to a CD while running in Live-CD mode?
[10:31] <iron_angel> cge: <grin>
[10:31] <Tomcat_> Tomtheman70: Not if it's the same CD drive.
[10:32] <n3rdism> bilss: not sure :/
[10:32] <Tomtheman70> Tomcat_ I have two.
[10:32] <iron_angel> Tomtheman70: If you have another one, though, yeah.
[10:32] <bilss_> not sure ok how to make alex a sudoers user
[10:32] <n3rdism> that we can do
[10:32] <Tomtheman70> iron_angel, so I can store the ISO to my hard drive?
[10:32] <bilss_> ok lets do it please
[10:32] <Tomtheman70> iron_angel, even if I'm in a Live-CD boot?
[10:33] <iron_angel> Tomtheman70: yeah, I'd think so, as long as you have somewhere to store it to.
[10:33] <n3rdism> bilss: found this via google http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-9890.html
[10:34] <Tomtheman70> iron_angel What if I've pulled the HD out of my computer and smashed it into a billion pieces out of rage of having M$ ruin my completely legal copy of their OS?
[10:34] <iron_angel> Tomtheman70: eep. So, nowhere to store it, eh? Get a 1GB+ thumbdrive, maybe?
[10:34] <n3rdism> tometheman70: what if you took anger managment courses?
[10:35] <bilss_> so in my case its   alex ALL=(ALL) ALL
[10:35] <n3rdism> yep
[10:35] <Tomtheman70> n3rdism, iron_angel, its a joke. I have a 20GB HD to store it on, but windows I think its using that partition... can I still store it there?
[10:35] <n3rdism> try that
[10:35] <bilss_> umm ok
[10:35] <cge> Tomtheman70: Yes, though if it is NTFS it is slightly harder.
[10:36] <iron_angel> Tomtheman70: if it's FAT, then yes, definitely. NTFS is trickier
[10:36] <bilss_> i expect the sudoers fille wilbe ownedby root
[10:36] <Tomtheman70> Well, I've got all night :P
[10:36] <n3rdism> bilss: probably :)
[10:36] <cge> bilss_: Edit sudoers with visudo, otherwise you will have problems.
[10:36] <ailean> when is the first release of edgy out?
[10:36] <n3rdism> tomtheman70: mounting ntfs as RO is extremely easy
[10:37] <cge> n3rdism: That won't help him at all.
[10:37] <Tomtheman70> n3rdism, easy on the non-english. I'm still relatively new at linux
[10:37] <bilss_> cge: ok how to that please from comand line as root please
[10:37] <ailean> when is the first release of feisty out, i mean? )
[10:37] <cge> bilss_: Just type visudo
[10:37] <n3rdism> sorry tom
[10:37] <bilss_> as root
[10:37] <Tomtheman70> :P
[10:37] <cge> Tomtheman70: What version of Windows is it?
[10:38] <Tomtheman70> cge, XP, blasted thing..
[10:38] <bilss_> cge: as root
[10:38] <cge> Tomtheman70: Then it is probably an NTFS partition.
[10:38] <cge> bilss_: yes
[10:38] <axisys> !xine > axisys
[10:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xine - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:38] <bilss_> cge: ok thanks
[10:38] <hamdin1> hello, I have an WinXp and Ubuntu 6.06.1 installed Pc and I want to install another WinXP?
[10:38] <hamdin1> what your advise?
[10:38] <Mowhawko> anyone know about 6.10 not displaying SSIDs for wireless? worked fine in 6.06...
[10:39] <cge> Tomtheman70: So you have to mount the NTFS partition read/write, which is tricky on the LiveCD.
[10:39] <n3rdism> cge: oh hes on livecd, sry i wasn't aware of that. or that he needed write :x.
[10:40] <Tomtheman70> cge, well, currently I'm downloading the "Don't ask, don't tell" version of XP off of my friend to put back on here and then load ubuntu again... so how would I get that working?
[10:40] <bilss_> cge: at the momen# User privilege specification
[10:40] <bilss_> root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
[10:40] <bilss_> # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
[10:40] <bilss_> %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL
[10:40] <bilss_> t it looks like this
[10:40] <Tomtheman70> cge, its downloading to the desktop of the live-CD so... everything must be going alright as of now..
[10:40] <bilss_> so just add alex to that
[10:40] <n3rdism> bilss: looks good, you should pastebin tho
[10:40] <VigoFusion> Theres a TRS-80 Emu in the file libs, I have a working, with manual and geek nylon original carrying case TRS-80. :-P
[10:40] <bilss_> sorry i should
[10:40] <cge> Tomtheman70: How much RAM do you have?
[10:41] <Tomtheman70> cge, how can I double check?
[10:41] <Herrie> Hi all, I've installed kde-core alongside Gnome and now is Konquror default browser in XChat (under Gnome) How do I change that back to Firefox (Edgy)
[10:41] <cge> Tomtheman70: Eeek - I don't remember an easy way to do so.
[10:41] <Tomtheman70> cge, well I know how to use the terminal
[10:42] <Daylighter> VigoFusion, a friend of mine has one of those, he brings it with him to conferences and even edits webpages on it. Then transfers them to his PDA and uploads them
[10:42] <ailean> when is the first release of feisty out?
[10:42] <nikita> Herrie: sudo update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/bin/firefox
[10:42] <n3rdism> bilss: np, this is just an idea. what if you just added alex to the admin group?
[10:42] <cge> Tomtheman70: Actually, do 'cat /proc/meminfo', and then it will be listed as MemTotal
[10:42] <Herrie> thx Nikita
[10:42] <bilss_> where do i place alex under members or users
[10:42] <DarkMageZ> Herrie, there's also a gui tool called galternatives
[10:42] <Tomtheman70> cge, 512
[10:42] <Tomtheman70> cge, or 515, whichever floats your boat.
[10:43] <VigoFusion> Daylighter: Thing still works perfect, has that little view panel, even has the Cassette Tape deck for MONGO storage.
[10:43] <cge> Tomtheman70: The CD image will fail to download about 3/4 of the way through, most likely.
[10:43] <n3rdism> bilss: members
[10:43] <hamdin1> I have an WinXp and Ubuntu 6.06.1 installed Pc and I want to install another WinXP
[10:43] <Tomtheman70> cge, or in about 15 seconds at the rate that my free memory is going down.
[10:43] <sn9> hamdin1: you want two xp's on the same machine?
[10:43] <bilss_> with or without the % at the begining of the line?
[10:43] <cge> Tomtheman70: You want to stop the download before that happens, or your system will become rather unresponsive.
[10:44] <n3rdism> with
[10:44] <bilss_> ok
[10:44] <wijnand> sn9: that's adding insult to injury isn't it? ;)
[10:44] <Tomtheman70> cge, its already getting to that point. :P hold on please.
[10:44] <willvdl> Herrie, in XChat, Settings -> Advanced -> URL Handlers
[10:44] <Tomtheman70> cge, can you kinda... quickly tell me how to mount the NTFS system?
[10:44] <hamdin1> this XP is very slow and much program istalled
[10:44] <cge> Tomtheman70: Are you running Dapper or Edgy?

[10:45] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource

[10:46] <bilss_> cge: thanks
[10:46] <cge> Tomtheman70: Ok, there are instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710. Delete the partial download before you start though, or your RAM will probably fill up again.
[10:46] <ragamuffin> I am installing ubuntu on D (with xp on C. where should i select for Mount point?
[10:46] <bilss_> n3rdism: thanks
[10:46] <guiest> Will my ubuntu system ever try to contact auckland.ubuntu.com and other places via the http port?
[10:46] <n3rdism> np is it working?
[10:46] <sn9> cge: that won't free up ram. he needs to reboot
[10:47] <cge> sn9: That will free up the RAM, I believe.
[10:47] <sn9> cge: i've tried it myself before. it doesn't
[10:47] <hamdin1>  have 1 license
[10:47] <Tomtheman70> cge, sn9, it freed up about 10 MB
[10:47] <cge> sn9: Strange, it worked for me about an hour ago.
[10:47] <guiest> yes, no?
[10:47] <VigoFusion> Can I safely and easily increase the SWAP in Edgy?
[10:47] <cge> Tomtheman70: Perhaps the management has improved in Edgy.
[10:48] <ragamuffin> urgent help please. Where should I select for mout point for dual boot with WinXP?
[10:48] <sn9> VigoFusion: if you have the disk space
[10:48] <cge> Tomtheman70: You will probably have to reboot then, and then follow those instructions.
[10:48] <n3rdism> vigofusion: i would think it have to be unmounted first?
[10:48] <sn9> ragamuffin: initially, select "do not mount"
[10:48] <VigoFusion> sn9: Got 40g left to play with
[10:48] <threeseas> how do you flush the printer buffer?
[10:48] <ragamuffin> sn9 thanks

[10:50] <olds> threeseas: try this command: lprm - [RET] 
[10:50] <bongzilla> what's lprm?
[10:50] <Lynoure> bongzilla: There are many ways, some put them as pre-up rules, some make them an init script
[10:51] <olds> line printer remove
[10:51] <Tomtheman70> cge, I'm just going to blow away my windows partition and just install xubuntu.
[10:51] <olds> that will remove all active line printer jobs
[10:51] <bongzilla> how about iptables
[10:51] <Tomtheman70> Argh
[10:51] <Tomtheman70> he left.
[10:51] <Lynoure> bongzilla: yes, iptables.
[10:51] <bongzilla> i set a rule then i reboot it
[10:51] <bongzilla> then
[10:52] <bongzilla> my set lost
[10:52] <bongzilla> i need to save them
[10:52] <bongzilla> i need help sir
[10:52] <Lynoure> bongzilla: yes, did you read what I said to you some lines back?
[10:52] <bongzilla> in the init script?
[10:53] <threeseas> didn't work.... I can shut off my printer and do lpr and have removed jobs from the printer but it still is wanting to print out the last thing.... which apparently has other problems .... don't need to be wasting reams of paper on this
[10:53] <threeseas> I can reboot but I shou;ldn't have to
[10:53] <olds> threeseas: that sounds like a printer issue
[10:54] <Lynoure> bongzilla: that's one way.
[10:54] <olds> but that is very odd
[10:54] <Tomtheman70> Does anyone know of a website where I can upload something that is larger than 700MB?
[10:54] <threeseas> yeah, cool how an pold cannon 4000 can maintain memory after it's shut off
[10:54] <bongzilla> i dont know how to do that
[10:54] <bongzilla> can you help me sir?
[10:54] <olds> bongzilla: it should be something like /etc/init.d/iptables save
[10:54] <olds> threeseas: well I might be wrong
[10:55] <threeseas> there has to be a way to flush the print buffer
[10:55] <bongzilla> i use to setup iptables using apt-get
[10:55] <bongzilla> but
[10:55] <azcazandco> anyone got any suggestions as to why I am having a really hard time getting dapper to install on one of my sata drives?
[10:55] <bongzilla> i dont see any scripts from init.d
[10:55] <Lynoure> bongzilla: here is an example for you http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=94513
[10:55] <bongzilla> for the iptables
[10:55] <Lynoure> mine is more simple, just the rules
[10:56] <BeBraw> which packages do i need to compile nvidia legacy driver on edgy eft?
[10:56] <pae> hello
[10:56] <paragon36> hello all
[10:57] <ragamuffin> no giuies talks about installation proess, where can I know about the installation?
[10:57] <pae> I am currently downloading the alternate install cd. will I be able to install the bootloader to the beginning of the disk I installed ubuntu on, and not on the mbr?
[10:57] <bongzilla> for a while sir
[10:58] <olds> ragamuffin: it's somewhat self explanatory imo, but I'm pretty sure there's a guide on the wiki
[10:58] <Lynoure> bongzilla: there is also a command  iptables-save  you can use
[10:58] <bongzilla> i already did iptables-save
[10:58] <bongzilla> but it won't work
[10:58] <ragamuffin> olds: let me check
[10:59] <bongzilla> after i command iptables-save, then i reboot
[10:59] <bongzilla> after that, all rules are gone
[10:59] <Lynoure> bongzilla: you need to have iptables-restore somewhere.
[10:59] <paragon36> Is anyone aware of the issue with MTU size in ubuntu ...   MTU:1500 give oui unknown shown in tcpdump .... setting it to MTU:1492  fixes the problem what is the cause of this I have never had this issue any other flavours of Linux or Unix for that matter?
[11:00] <bongzilla> should i put a path after the command?
[11:00] <olds> yes
[11:00] <olds> iptables-save -c > /etc/iptables-save.iptable
[11:00] <olds> like that
[11:01] <eexp16> olds: still he need to put iptables-restore somewhere in an initscript
[11:01] <ihavenoname>  salut
[11:01] <threeseas> Apparently the printer buffer thing is a long running bug inb the linux system and nobody seems to be able to fix it other than turning off the computer
[11:01] <olds> cat /etc/iptables-save.iptable | iptables-restore -c
[11:01] <ragamuffin> olds: why the hell is that i can't move out of the partitions settings and go on with my installation?
[11:01] <ihavenoname>  fgggggdfgfdhhjghjghjghjhjghjgh
[11:01] <olds> because you need to specify the partition you wanna install the OS on
[11:01] <asfalt> how can i specify which plugin ff uses for vid's? (i am trying to view pages which embed .asx/asf/wmv files) and i get a blank window where the player would normally reside within the page. i did install mozilla-mplayer and w32codecs, if i save an .asf file locally I can play it back. when i run about:plugins in ff i notice i seem to have other pluggins installed relating to Totem
[11:01] <ragamuffin> olds: I did thtat
[11:01] <asfalt> hmm
[11:01] <olds> and what does it say
[11:02] <mixandgo> anyone having problems installing privoxy on edgy ?
[11:02] <ragamuffin> olds: whernever I enter on Done Seeting it goes back to partition Disk window
[11:02] <mixandgo> I get : chown: cannot access `/etc/privoxy/*.action': No such file or directory chown: cannot access `/etc/privoxy/trust': No such file or directory
[11:03] <olds> did you take the disk out?
[11:03] <olds> it's been a while since I actually installed it
[11:03] <olds> mixandgo: probably need to read the setup again
[11:04] <ragamuffin> olds: no cd is in the drive
[11:04] <olds> ragamuffin: that's odd
[11:04] <ragamuffin> I rebooted and tried again
[11:05] <ragamuffin> Olds use ext journaling file system

[11:15] <mutedog> is there Chinese here ?
[11:15] <olds> and when you double click the icon on the desktop, what happens?
[11:15] <Tomtheman70> olds, yes, which I don't care about, they're from the old NTFS days of when I used to use it with XP

[11:16] <sc0tt_> blonde day :(
[11:16] <paragon36> olds: Yes I installed ubuntu from a live cd .... the ifconfig -a showed mtu size of 1500 which is standard but  got the following symptoms :- I could surf to certain sites but not to others. I could connect to irc.freenode.net then it would hang. the tcpdump showed 'unknown oui' on changing the mtu size to 1492 it all started to work ... ????
[11:17] <threeseas> I figured out the printer problem.... I upgraded from Breezy to 6.06
[11:17] <Flannel> sc0tt_: tcl8.3-dev (you can search at packages.ubuntu.com)
[11:17] <threeseas> why are printer such a problem in linux?
[11:17] <Flannel> sc0tt_: of course, that might have a more appropriate meta package

[11:17] <sc0tt_> :D

[11:17] <Tomtheman70> olds, so how would I reformat this HD?
[11:18] <Tomtheman70> olds, to make it usable for my live-cd boot of ubuntu
[11:18] <olds> 1 sec

[11:23] <olds> weird
[11:23] <olds> okay

[11:24] <bilss_> Chousuke: how much do you think
[11:24] <Chousuke> bilss_: but it's your machine. I don't know what your space requirements are.
[11:24] <olds> Tomtheman70: do a 'df' for me on the commandline
[11:24] <Tomtheman70> olds, every single experience I've had with help from here hasn't been able to figure out this laptop. Its a very odd laptop indeed.
[11:24] <Chousuke> bilss_: calculate. :P
[11:24] <Chousuke> bilss_: 40GB - 0.16*40GB - 25GB
[11:25] <Chousuke> except that's not exactly accurate.
[11:25] <bilss_> its 38 gigs sorry
[11:25] <Tomtheman70> olds, what do you want from the df?
[11:25] <Chousuke> bilss_: use the calculator

[11:26] <bilss_> dont have one on fluxbox
[11:26] <ripper> is there a simple way i can display uptime uname -a , and cpu MHz & model name in one line ?
[11:27] <ripper> i've tried doing uptime && uname -a && cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep (with various methods) w/ no luck
[11:27] <olds> Tomtheman70: on the commandline do this
[11:27] <olds> sudo apt-get install gparted
[11:27] <olds> then when that's done
[11:27] <olds> sudo gparted
[11:28] <Tomtheman70> kk
[11:28] <bimberi> !gksudo
[11:28] <ubotu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use gksudo, as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using "sudo <GUI-application>"
[11:28] <Tomtheman70> Ok, running it now
[11:28] <olds> ok
[11:29] <olds> on the right hand side you'll see a drop down
[11:29] <bilss_> looks i have used 6 gigs ie 16% of 38
[11:29] <Tomtheman70> yep, I think I see where you're going with this.
[11:29] <olds> select the one that is closest in size to that Buslink
[11:29] <screechingcat> how do i change the size of all the icons on the desktop
[11:29] <bilss_> so 25 gigs  would be ok
[11:29] <olds> right click on the partition (I assume there's jsut 1)
[11:29] <olds> click unmount
[11:30] <olds> it'll say 'scanning for drives' for about 10 seconds
[11:30] <olds> then right click on it again
[11:30] <olds> format to -> ext3
[11:30] <bimberi> screechingcat: open a nautilus window and set the default zoom in the preferences
[11:30] <Tomtheman70> Here's the weird thing olds... 38 GB is set in ext3, 352 MB is extended 352 is linux-swap
[11:30] <olds> on the buslink?
[11:30] <Tomtheman70> Yea
[11:30] <screechingcat> bimberi: that works only while it is in nautilus. i'm talking about the desktop
[11:31] <olds> are you sure it's the buslink?
[11:31] <bimberi> screechingcat: seems to work here (the desktop _is_ nautilus)
[11:31] <Tomtheman70> olds, yep.
[11:31] <olds> because the only reason you'd have extended and linux-swap is if you tried to install linux on the drive
[11:31] <Tomtheman70> olds, yea, I did. A long time ago.
[11:31] <olds> ok :)
[11:31] <Tomtheman70> olds, it failed, because it isn't an internal drive
[11:32] <olds> so yea, you can take care of those too if you like
[11:32] <morten_> how can i set up a launcher to execute a program over an ssh tunnel?
[11:32] <Tomtheman70> olds, and there's a physical scratch on the drive and it'll freeze if anything touches that part.
[11:32] <olds> I imagine you'd just delete them
[11:32] <screechingcat> bimberi: when i increase zoom in nautlius, it applies to that folder only
[11:32] <morten_> i've tried 'ssh -x `hostname` | `appname`' but that won't work
[11:32] <Tomtheman70> olds, horay for my shoddy hardware, eh?
[11:32] <Mowhawko> anyone know how to get damn wireless working in 6.10?
[11:32] <olds> Tomtheman70: just throw it out
[11:32] <Tomtheman70> olds, I'm not made of money.
[11:32] <screechingcat> bimberi: i want the icons on my desktop to increase to say 128
[11:32] <olds> 40gig USB drives are like $25 these days
[11:33] <Tomtheman70> olds, yea, and I'm currently on a laptop I built from a scrap pile.
[11:33] <Tomtheman70> olds, Me = No $$$
[11:33] <morten_> Tomtheman70: for linux, ubuntu is very demanding
[11:33] <bimberi> screechingcat: edit -> preferences, view tab, icon view defaults, default zoom level ??
[11:33] <olds> Well you see how to format it from there?
[11:33] <morten_> it might not be your best choice if you're running really old hardware
[11:33] <olds> morten: he's already running it I believe
[11:33] <Tomtheman70> morten_, I built a very nice computer for free.
[11:34] <screechingcat> bimberi: now all my icons have disappeared
[11:34] <Tomtheman70> morten, 2.4 ghz, 512 MB ram, 64 MB ati express
[11:34] <eilker> what command to learn my filesystem ?
[11:34] <morten_> you call that an old pile of junk?
[11:34] <olds> truly a question for the ages there eilker
[11:34] <morten_> /bin/learn
[11:34] <screechingcat> bimberi: but it works. thanks.
[11:35] <Mowhawko> anyone know how to get damn wireless working in edgy eft?
[11:35] <Tomtheman70> morten_, the speakers are blown, the touchpad and trackpoint are busted, the RAM has defects, the screen flickers off and on sometimes.
[11:35] <eilker> olds: ?
[11:35] <bimberi> screechingcat: an interesting pair of posts :)
[11:35] <morten_> eilker: i'm gonna try to decipher your strange language, and guess that you want to build the locate database
[11:35] <morten_> run updatedb
[11:35] <morten_> as root.
[11:35] <olds> I'd guess he wants to know what filesystem he's using
[11:35] <morten_> ah, ok.
[11:35] <eilker> olds: exactly
[11:35] <morten_> well, if you haven't chosen one, you're using ext3.
[11:35] <Tomtheman70> olds, so... shouldn't formatting take more than like 1 second?
[11:35] <screechingcat> bimberi: previously i thought that the magnifying glass on the top of the window was the "default zoom control"
[11:36] <olds> you can do a quick 'df'
[11:36] <morten_> you could do that as well
[11:36] <morten_> or 'mount'
[11:36] <bimberi> screechingcat: ah, ic
[11:36] <Tomtheman70> olds, I got an error.. but the error window is frozen
[11:36] <morten_> actually, df doesn't show fs
[11:36] <morten_> so run mount, with no command options
[11:36] <eilker> olds: df doesnt show
[11:37] <morten_> or check /etc/fstab. same thing as mount does, tho
[11:37] <eilker> morten: thanx
[11:37] <screechingcat> bimberi: and the disappearing is fixed by puting all the icons on the desktop again
[11:37] <eilker> morten: it is ext3
[11:37] <morten_> told you so
[11:37] <compengi> is there a way i can see all ubuntu commands
[11:37] <boink> ubuntu uses ex3
[11:37] <boink> ubuntu uses ext3
[11:37] <morten_> linux uses ext3
[11:37] <boink> no, that's not true
[11:37] <olds> df -T
[11:37] <boink> linux is only a kernel
[11:37] <morten_> tell me one distro that doesn't use ext3 as default, smartypants
[11:37] <bimberi> screechingcat: ah, i'm with you, icons near some of the edges would have disappeared
[11:38] <eilker> morten: i made it ext2 , but dont remeber changed or not, so that i tried to check it
[11:38] <boink> with Slackware, you can choose.
[11:38] <Tomtheman70> olds, I got an error
[11:38] <olds> morten: a lot don't
[11:38] <boink> and stop the name calling
[11:38] <morten_> any distro lets you choose
[11:38] <boink> !language
[11:38] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:38] <morten_> but as far as i know, they all use ext3 as default
[11:38] <olds> Tomtheman70: the disk is scratched
[11:39] <morten_> you took offense to me calling you smartypants?
[11:39] <olds> I dont know what you expect, honestly
[11:39] <boink> !language
[11:39] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:39] <morten_> what kind of slack jawed loser are you?
[11:39] <morten_> for shame!
[11:39] <Tomtheman70> olds, can I use it as a frisbee now?
[11:39] <boink> nobody likes a smartass
[11:39] <bimberi> settle down folks
[11:39] <Tomtheman70> !language
[11:39] <Tomtheman70> :P
[11:39] <Mowhawko> anyone know how to get wireless working in edgy eft?
[11:39] <morten_> don't make me go tourettes on you, Tomtheman70
[11:39] <bimberi> Mowhawko: please be less vague
[11:39] <Tomtheman70> hahaha
[11:40] <Mowhawko> no question that I've asked in the last hour has gotten any response whatsoever, so this is a start
[11:40] <Tomtheman70> My girlfriends sister has tourettes, normally I wouldn't laugh, but thats funny.
[11:40] <bimberi> Mowhawko: :)
[11:40] <Han> How can I make, for example, flash-nonfree install without it asking questions? `aptget install foo -y' doesn't help and `yes ^V^M|apt-get install foo' doesn't help either.
[11:40] <crimsun> Han: it already defaults to that format in Feisty.
[11:40] <Mowhawko> no ssids show up in networking configuration, though some do with iwconfig scan
[11:41] <morten_> really, though. the language hysteria going on in this channel is pretty pathetic sometimes.
[11:41] <Han> crimsun, that's nice to know. But allas I still have to work with edgy for a long time.
[11:41] <Mowhawko> and I've found a couple guides online that recommend installing wpasupplicant and network-manager-gnome and such, and i've tried that twice to no avail
[11:41] <fourat> i have openoffice not starting on my edgy, is it a bug ?
[11:41] <crimsun> Han: you can either grab the feisty deb and install it, or wait for the edgy-backports one
[11:41] <eexp16> morten_: fully agree
[11:41] <rambo3> Han idont think you can apt-get install foo -y < "Y\n"
[11:41] <crimsun> Han: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?arch=i386&file=pool%2Fmultiverse%2Ff%2Fflashplugin-nonfree%2Fflashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78.2ubuntu1_i386.deb&md5sum=4e1155ca4cd1bf8531dafb0bc59b08dd&arch=i386&type=main
[11:41] <TLE> fourat: I can check it for you
[11:42] <Mowhawko> wireless worked fine in dapper, but for some reason is being crabby in edgy
[11:42] <ailean> when is the first release of feisty out?
[11:42] <fourat> TLE how ?
[11:42] <Han> crimsun, it was an example, there are other packages that do the same and they won't get backported.
[11:42] <boink> they screwed up some of the wireless stuff on edgy
[11:42] <Mowhawko> any idea how to fix it? or should i just revert to dapper til it gets fixed?
[11:42] <crimsun> Han: then change the debconf interface
[11:42] <crimsun> Han: dpkg-reconfigure debconf
[11:43] <Mowhawko> if I enter the ssid manually, it works, but I'm on a laptop which makes that a royal pain
[11:43] <TLE> fourat: Ubuntu uses a centrlized web application called Launchpad to register and moniter bugs, here you go: https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs Just search for openoffice or oo and see if there is a bug that fit your description
[11:44] <bimberi> Mowhawko: when you installed network-manager-gnome did you deconfigure network interfaces (eg. by commenting them out in /etc/network/interfaces)?
[11:44] <zOap> is there any way of editing what programs that are allowed to start up besides the service manager? it doesn't contain much of the apps I want to restrain..
[11:44] <TLE> fourat: Offcourse searching here doesn't rule out that you can have a new bug, but since Edgy is a few weeks old now the chances are small
[11:44] <Mowhawko> bimberi: yes
[11:45] <bimberi> Mowhawko: k :|
[11:45] <boink> I have an old laptop with edgy and a netgear WG511T .. doesn't work
[11:45] <boink> damm :/
[11:45] <Mowhawko> bimberi: weird thing is, the new network manager doesn't even show up, as the guides say it's supposed to
[11:45] <screechingcat> boink: ndiswrapper ?
[11:45] <Mowhawko> I'm not really sure what else to try
=== jordan is now known as sc0tt_
[11:46] <bimberi> Mowhawko: doesn't show up?  no applet do you mean?
[11:46] <sc0tt_> hey folks
[11:46] <TLE> ailean: Search the wiki for "feisty release schedule" or "feisty schedule"
[11:46] <sc0tt_> whats the manual way to add a printer to cups?
[11:46] <sc0tt_> the printers interface just dies when trying to add on :(
[11:46] <sc0tt_> one*
[11:46] <screechingcat> boink: i have a netgear too. i gave up and drew a really long ethernet wire from my router to the computer
[11:46] <Mowhawko> bimberi: yeah, a few of the screenies show a signal strength bar that's supposed to appear after restart, which is what allows selecting between network devices
[11:47] <bimberi> Mowhawko: try running it manually - 'nm-applet --sm-disable'
[11:47] <TLE> ailean: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule?highlight=%28feisty%29%7C%28schedule%29
[11:48] <Mowhawko> bimberi: don't seem to get any response from that, it's just kinda hanging
[11:49] <bimberi> Mowhawko: yes it should just sit there - do you have a notification area applet? that's where the network-manager applet appears
[11:49] <boink> the WG511T should work fine on ubuntu.
[11:49] <boink> under the ubuntu documentation it's marked all with "YES YES YES"
[11:50] <screechingcat> boink: did ubuntu recognize it when you installed the card and restarted ?
[11:50] <boink> hmm, no
[11:50] <boink> but lspci does
[11:50] <screechingcat> boink: try opening system>admin>netwroking
[11:50] <boink> I did
[11:51] <screechingcat> and is iut there ?
[11:51] <boink> no
[11:51] <boink> it's not loading the modules
[11:51] <screechingcat> and lspci recognizes it ?
[11:51] <boink> yes
[11:51] <Mowhawko> ok, the applet pops up, but doesn't let me configure anything
[11:51] <boink> damm edgy
[11:52] <boink> I really think two releases a year is too much
[11:52] <constrictor> anybody knows where i can find some really simple and to the point perl tutorials. I want to start using it
[11:52] <screechingcat> wierd! but did it work in dapper ?
[11:52] <Mowhawko> bimberi: just a few options,  Enable Networking, Enable Wireless, and some info selections
[11:52] <fourat> TLE: seems that noone reported this issue : https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/73119
[11:52] <boink> dapper is fairly well done
[11:52] <boink> but it has bugs too
[11:52] <bimberi> Mowhawko: no list of networks? including "Wired Network"?
[11:52] <Mowhawko> nope
[11:53] <bimberi> Mowhawko: and /etc/network/interfaces only has lines referring to "lo" enabled?
[11:53] <TLE> fourat: Yeah I saw that one, does it fit your description? Showing the splash for a short time before crashing ?
[11:53] <Mowhawko> bimberi: double-checking, but i think so, yes
[11:53] <screechingcat> boink: well edgy is mostly fine. its just a few peices here and there that are fryed
[11:53] <boink> heh, I had massive problems with mysql on amd64 edgy
[11:53] <boink> mysql-server-5.0
[11:54] <Mowhawko> bimberi: affirmative
[11:54] <fourat> TLE: it mine :)
[11:54] <bimberi> Mowhawko: hmm :|
[11:54] <boink> so, edgy is something like debian sid
[11:54] <boink> expect massive amounts of pain :/
[11:54] <TLE> fourat: ?
[11:55] <screechingcat> boink: i gave up on my Netgear wifi and everything else workd fine in edgy
[11:55] <bilss_> hi
[11:55] <fourat> TLE: "does it fit your description?" ==> It's my description, am the issuer
[11:55] <boink> but why doesn't the WG511T work then when the documentation is so keen on it?
[11:55] <boink> that's madness
[11:55] <Mowhawko> it's just frustrating that all this wireless worked fine in dapper, and now is all messed up
[11:55] <boink> it's like why even read the ubuntu documentation?
[11:55] <bimberi> Mowhawko: yes, understandable.  unfortunately i'm out of ideas at this point sorry
[11:56] <screechingcat> boink: wait a second . . . . . did u upgrade or clean install ?
[11:56] <boink> clean install
[11:56] <Mowhawko> bimberi: thanks for the help anyway, appreciate it
[11:56] <bimberi> Mowhawko: np :)
[11:56] <TLE> fourat: Ah so you made a new one? How about this one https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/63676
[11:57] <screechingcat> boink: 2 options - wait for feisty (6 months more) remove edgy and re-install dapper
[11:57] <boink> heh, I just might do that
[11:57] <boink> it seems that dapper works better, afterall it's a LTS
[11:57] <bilss_> according to df command i am useing 80% on hda1 but what about varrun 1% var lock 1% udev 1% and  lrm 6% must i  add them all together to get a total or is 80%  the total
[11:58] <Doow> what's LTS?
[11:58] <Doow> been wondering that for some time now =)
[11:58] <eexp16> Doow: long term support
[11:58] <Enselic> shouldnt I get output when I issue: echo 'adsf' > grep a -
[11:58] <Doow> eexp16: aha, ty
[11:58] <constrictor> anyone do perl here?
[11:58] <boink> a LTS release has a 5 year server support and 3 year desktop support
[11:58] <screechingcat> Doow: five years worth of patches is an LTS
[11:58] <bilss_> as dapper was the fist in the long line of server support
[11:59] <boink> whearas edgy only has 18 month support
[11:59] <Mowhawko> maybe stupid question, but there's no way to downgrade dist without fresh install is there?
[11:59] <Doow> screechingcat: how long for the other ones?
[11:59] <stefg> bliss_ /var/lock and udev and stuff are little filesystems in tmpfs (RAM), generated at boot. You don't need to consider these in your space calculations
[11:59] <boink> !downgrade
[11:59] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[11:59] <mnepton> Mowhawko: not saefly
[11:59] <mnepton> *safely
[11:59] <Mowhawko> fresh install it is
[11:59] <screechingcat> Doow: edgy has 18 months
[11:59] <Surghi> hi
[11:59] <Mowhawko> stupid edgy ><
[11:59] <bilss_>  according to df command i am useing 80% on hda1 but what about varrun 1% var lock 1% udev 1% and  lrm 6% must i  add them all together to get a total or is 80%  the total
[11:59] <bimberi> Enselic: no, that creates a file called grep with contents "asdf a -"
[11:59] <Doow> screechingcat: good enough for me =)
[11:59] <stefg> bilss_:  /var/lock and udev and stuff are little filesystems in tmpfs (RAM), generated at boot. You don't need to consider these in your space calculations
[12:00] <screechingcat> Doow: yes especially since feisty releases in 6 months more and i'll be upgrading to it
[12:00] <Doow> screechingcat: same here
[12:00] <Enselic> bimberi: Ahh, y
[12:00] <Enselic> bimberi: hey youre smart, thanks
[12:00] <Surghi> what program is the best for managing all appointments and thigs to do AT a speciefied day or BEFORE a specified day?   A normal calender does not give me the complete overview I need,  a simple task list is too simple  ... I am not sure what I need, but whatever I tried out, it was not good enough
[12:01] <bimberi> Enselic: tell my wife :P
[12:02] <Rodietze> hey I got 2 simple and quick questions, First: how do I switch between kdm for gnome and vice versa? Second: HOw do I change KDE Look and feel without having to quit a gnome session? yeah I got KDE too
[12:02] <Rodietze> oops KDM for GDM
[12:02] <ztech> yay
[12:02] <ztech> sucessfully installed ubuntu
[12:03] <screechingcat> ztech: welcome ;/
[12:03] <bilss_> stefg: please look here  http://pastebin.ca/256540  before adding a 25gig vmware HD i was useing oinly 16% now is the total  91% or is it more
[12:03] <huibert>  Rodietze: start the kcontrol program in an terminal.
[12:03] <Rodietze> when I try to start KDM it says: KDM isn't your default Greeter
[12:03] <catsy> hi i'm using ubuntu latest live
[12:03] <catsy> how do i install it into my hdd instead
[12:03] <bimberi> Rodietze: usually you have one (kdm or gdm) and choose Gnome or KDE from the Sessions menu at login.  Is that what you're wanting?
[12:04] <bimberi> catsy: Install icon on the desktop
[12:04] <ztech> are there 'themes' i can download thru package manager?
[12:04] <screechingcat> Rodietze: when i installed kde over my ubuntu system, i was asked wether i wanted kdm or gdm
[12:04] <catsy> r u sure
[12:04] <Rodietze> bimberi: no, I have KDE and GNOME, but I'm tired of GDM, but I want to know how to switch from GDM to KDM as the default greeter
[12:05] <bimberi> Rodietze: try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm'
[12:05] <catsy> does it actually have it
[12:05] <stefg> bilss_: why should df tell you your drive is 91% full if it doesn't mean it?
[12:05] <screechingcat> ztech: plenty of themes over at www.gnome-look.org

[12:09] <tijn> 250 gb external hdd usb2.0 105 EUR
[12:09] <eilker> krampo_h: and may i use it when ubuntu working ?
[12:09] <bilss_> sfefg: ok thanks   /dev/hda1              36G   31G  3.3G  91% /
[12:09] <bilss_>   its 3.3 gigs which at the moment is ok
[12:10] <oscar> shop around the internet
[12:10] <tijn> but thats external, internal should be cheaper
[12:10] <redDEADresolve> does edgy support dual core processors out of the box. or do i have to enable it?
[12:10] <oscar> 350GB external here for $79
[12:11] <krampo_h> eilker: I think it must be ok. Anyway, if you get a grub error, you can always use LiveCD ro repair ir :)
[12:11] <stefg> bilss_: you should consider to put virtual machines on a separate partition. It's quicker if the .vmdk's are contigous and in one piece...
[12:12] <eilker> krampo_h: and when i resize, will i lose my data ?
[12:13] <oscar> eilker, always backup data before resizing partitions
[12:13] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey all, im new to ubuntu and i was wondering how do i access my windows drive? i've got two drives right now, windows isn't loading (on the first drive) so i installed ubuntu on the second drive and now i'm trying to get crap off of it.
[12:13] <stefg> !mount
[12:13] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[12:14] <bimberi> !mountwindows | CoRnJuLiOx
[12:14] <ubotu> CoRnJuLiOx: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[12:14] <mats> !hdparm
[12:14] <ubotu> hdparm: tune hard disk parameters for high performance. In component main, is standard. Version 6.6-1ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 57 kB, installed size 228 kB
[12:14] <huibert> CoRnJuLiOx: ubuntu should be able to mount the windows partitions, read only, should work per default.
[12:14] <eilker> oscar: i dont have chance to back up 50 gb data :(
[12:14] <oscar> eilker, why not?
[12:14] <huibert> For read write, you might have to install "drivers"
[12:15] <stefg> 50 GB is a 40 buck harddrive , or a pile of a dozen DVD's
[12:15] <eilker> oscar: i dont have enough dvd writer, and i am not in a lan, and can qtparted be used when kubuntu is working ?
[12:15] <oscar> eilker, because you can't get a 200GB drive off ebay for $20 ?
[12:16] <Daviey> Hi, does anybody use XDMCP?
[12:16] <oscar> you want to drive a porsche but can't afford the tires.  don't complain then.
[12:16] <eilker> oscar: 200 gb drive is nearly 100 dollars here
[12:17] <oscar> i don't even think they sell 200G in stores here.  the newest are 750 and the lowest is probably 300
[12:17] <stefg> for 3,5 inch...
[12:17] <Enselic> I want to see all lines of cvs up that dont start with P or c, but:     cvs up | grep ^[^cP]       gives output like: cvs server: Updating app
[12:18] <eilker> oscar: can qtparted be used when kubuntu is working ?
[12:18] <oscar> eilker, i'm sure saturn or arlt or one of those stores has specials on drives
[12:18] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, i ran the diskmounter script that the bot gave me and it mounted the drives (i think), but when i try to move to the folder, it says 'permission denied'
[12:19] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: are you using the file manager (Nautilus)?
[12:19] <huibert> CoRnJuLiOx: yes, moving is a WRITE opperation, which is not supported on NTFS(windows) partitions
[12:19] <oscar> eilker, if you resize your windows partition good luck.  high chance it will not be bootable
[12:20] <huibert> oops, you wrote, "move too", sorry
[12:20] <huibert> moving into folders should work.
[12:20] <felixjet> how i can switch wine apps in ubuntu? when i do alt+tab i switch gnome apps but not the ones under wine
[12:20] <CoRnJuLiOx> btw, is there a shortcut to nautilus?
[12:20] <eilker> oscar: i know it, i ask how to do it in a safe way ? that's why i am here
[12:21] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: where are you trying to move to the folder?
[12:21] <oscar> eilker, only safe way is to backup all your important data
[12:21] <huibert> CoRnJuLiOx: you can assign a key to open your HOME. I assigned the left "windows" key for it.
[12:21] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms can only be launched from terminal,if it from menu bar,then it fails to lauch help me
[12:21] <Tomcat_> Enselic: Use egrep instead of grep... that should do it.
[12:21] <Duesentrieb> oscar, eilker: I have resized windows partitions before, using parted and even fdisk. Never had problems.
[12:21] <asfalt> does the gnome weather applet work for anyone? i get a panel error when i attempt to add it
[12:22] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms can only be launched from terminal,if it from menu bar,then it fails to lauch help me
[12:22] <oscar> Duesentrieb, sometimes it works.  but sometimes if fails.  i've seen both.
[12:22] <Duesentrieb> oscar, eilker: make sure it'S defragmented first, and there's no data at the end of the partition. on next boot, windows will do a checkdisk. And yes, there'S no guarantee. Always make a backup.
[12:22] <Duesentrieb> be prepared to install from scratch - then try to resize for conveniance
[12:22] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms can only be launched from terminal,if it from menu bar,then it fails to lauch help me :(
[12:23] <Enselic> Tomcat_: It appears as if the message was used as stderr,      cvs up 2>&1 | grep ^[^cP]     worked
[12:23] <Tomcat_> Enselic: Mh... regular grep should work. Maybe try: grep "^[^cP] "
[12:23] <Tomcat_> Enselic: Or that, alright. :D
[12:23] <eilker> Duesentrieb,oscar: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33654/
[12:23] <oscar> Duesentrieb, i agree.  you must be prepared for the loss and be pleasantly surprised if it works  :-)
[12:23] <ztech> will running samba..let me log in to this machine remotely??
[12:23] <Duesentrieb> sc4ttrbrain: repeating your question every few seconds doesn't get you much sympathy, you know...
[12:23] <ztech> via http?
[12:23] <eilker> Duesentrieb,oscar: i have described in pastebin
[12:23] <CoRnJuLiOx> bimberi: i'm trying to get to it in nautilus, and its saying that i don't have the permissions necessary to view the files
[12:23] <Duesentrieb> ztech: "log in via http"? What does that mean?
[12:23] <sc4ttrbrain> sorry
[12:23] <sc4ttrbrain> it just weird problem
[12:24] <ztech> meaning i can log in like http://myipaddresshere
[12:24] <oscar> eilker, there's nothing i need to see/read   you know the solution already
[12:24] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: quit and try 'gksudo nautilus'.  be careful, you'll be running it as the superuser, don't do any damage :)
[12:24] <Duesentrieb> ztech: log in via a url? that does not make any sense... please define "log in"
[12:24] <eexp16> ztech: neither smb nor http are protocols for remote logins. use ssh for that.
[12:25] <oscar> eilker, personally, i always have an external drive to back up my entire drive, and always keep my backup images up to date.
[12:25] <DreamerHxC> hi everyone
[12:25] <oscar> eilker, i consider it a necessity of using a computer and include the cost in the overall total
[12:25] <CoRnJuLiOx> bimberi: got it, thanks. /msg doesn't seem to work?
[12:25] <ztech> like in XP, there are some software u can download and set the machine to log in via remotely via http://ipaddress
[12:26] <ztech> Theres gotta be something similar for ubuntu
[12:26] <eilker> oscar: it would be good to have external hd, thanx anyway...
[12:26] <oscar> ztech, you mean a web server?  try apache
[12:26] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: yes, it's working, best to work in here so others can tell you if I'm giving dodgy advice :)
[12:26] <DreamerHxC> I need help because yesterday I had an ATI and I could not boot up Ubuntu and now I have an nVIDIA and I cannot boot neither!
[12:26] <ztech> I know i can run a ftp server..but wondering if theres something that will allow me to log in via http
[12:26] <oscar> eilker, or an external dvd burner to burn to
[12:27] <Duesentrieb> ztech: i'm pretty sure that's a misunderstanding. please provide a link to such a software, so we can figure out what you mean.
[12:27] <oscar> eilker, those i think are really cheap now.  maybe $20-$30
[12:27] <ztech> duesentrieb, www.filesharepro.com
[12:27] <Daviey> Hi, does has anybody tried logging in using XDMCP under edgy?
[12:27] <eilker> oscar: where do u live ?
[12:27] <Duesentrieb> ztech: there's rdesktop, which gives you a graphical login to another windows maching. there are similar things for linux. there's ssh... none of which use http.
[12:27] <oscar> eilker, usa west coast, but i lived in germany too
[12:27] <ztech> http://www.wfshome.com/
[12:28] <eilker> oscar: here is cyprus and not cheap as you said:)
[12:28] <ztech> http://www.sharing-file.com/
[12:28] <eilker> oscar: 70-80 $
[12:28] <oscar> eilker, what about ebay?
[12:28] <felixjet> how i can switch wine apps in ubuntu? when i do alt+tab i switch gnome apps but not the ones under wine
[12:28] <DreamerHxC> I need help because yesterday I had an ATI and I could not boot up Ubuntu and now I have an nVIDIA and I cannot boot neither!
[12:28] <DreamerHxC> please
[12:28] <DreamerHxC> I cannot even see live cd desktop
[12:29] <eilker> oscar: i havent used it before...
[12:29] <eilker> oscar: dont they add transportation money ?
[12:29] <oscar> eilker, welcome to the 21st century
[12:29] <bimberi> CoRnJuLiOx: yes you should be able to copy/paste from the windows drive
[12:29] <eilker> oscar: ahahah:)
[12:29] <Duesentrieb> ztech: so, you are talking about file sharing / remote file access, not about a login at all.
[12:30] <ztech> Duesentrieb, yes..but those programs u can set a user/name/pass.
[12:30] <ztech> i just want to setup my photoshop files..and access them from anywhere in the USA, is that possible/? apache will allow me?
[12:31] <Duesentrieb> ztech: i have never looked closely, but afaik ubuntu comes with http-based file sharing build in.
[12:31] <oscar> ztech, apache with mod userdir
[12:31] <eilker> oscar: thanx for your interest, checking ebay now, see you
[12:31] <Duesentrieb> oscar: well, that requires quite a bit of knowledge and setup to do what he wants...
[12:31] <ztech> afaik  ubuntu? i google that
[12:32] <oscar> Duesentrieb, apt-get install apache2; a2enmod userdir
[12:32] <eexp16> ztech: afaik is short for "as far as i know"
[12:32] <Duesentrieb> ztech: afaik = "as far as i know" :)
[12:32] <ztech> lol..sorry
[12:32] <Duesentrieb> ztech: well, ubuntu offers sharing via nfs and samba per default. There are probably also webDAV solutions around - perhaps look into that. ssh/fish is also good, but not http.#
[12:32] <Acke_ubu> hey how do i mount ubuntu drives in mac os x?
[12:33] <ztech> are the default built in drivers for nvidia tnt2 in the latest ubuntu release good? or something better exist
[12:34] <oscar> ztech, if you just want to be able to browse the files with a web browser then set up apache and mod auth
[12:34] <Duesentrieb> Acke_ubu: depends on the filesystem, i guess.
[12:34] <ztech> package manager turns up nothing
[12:34] <constrictor> i'm not sure why but firefox 2.0 seems a tad heavier and crashes more often than 1.5 did in Edgy anyways
[12:35] <joshua__> firefox 2.0 is better in windows than it is in linux. it doesn't really feel like a complete version.
[12:35] <Duesentrieb> oscar: anyway... do you know anything abouit the new UUID based mounting mechanism in edgy? it misbehaves (doesn't mount vfat drives on boot).
[12:35] <constrictor> yeah
[12:35] <Duesentrieb> i'd like to understand what it is for, and how it works...
[12:35] <oscar> Duesentrieb, yes i've used uuid mounting for a while even before ubuntu used it
[12:36] <constrictor> joshua__ do you use alternatives?
[12:36] <Acke_ubu> Duesentrieb: whats standard when instilling ubuntu on a mac? ext3?
[12:36] <Duesentrieb> ztech: http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&q=ubuntu+web-based+file-sharing&btnG=Suche&meta=
[12:36] <Duesentrieb> Acke_ubu: i have no clue. i'd guess so.
[12:36] <boink> I'm using the linux Firefox 2.0 on FreeBSD, works better I think than 1.5
[12:36] <oscar> Duesentrieb, uuid is just a feature of mount where you replace the device name with the uuid you which you can obtain with the blkid command
[12:37] <boink> and on edgy, Firefox 2.0 is quite good
[12:37] <Duesentrieb> oscar: well, when upgrading to edgy, it automatically converted all mounts in fstab to use uuids. it doesn't work as expected. I could just change it back, i guess, but i'd like to get some background...
[12:37] <DreamerHxC> I need help because yesterday I had an ATI and I could not boot up Ubuntu and now I have an nVIDIA and I cannot boot neither! I can't see the desktop
[12:37] <oscar> Duesentrieb, this way if you have multiple external usb drives for instance, they will always get mounted regardless of whether they show up as sda, sdb, sdc or whatever
[12:38] <oscar> that's the reason for using uuid because its independent of the device name since the device name is somewhat arbitratry
[12:38] <Duesentrieb> oscar: also, if i mount manually, the mount disappears when i close the session (which seems very strange to me). It kind of behaves like mounts for usp sticks - but it's a normal vfat partion, which should always be mounted.
[12:38] <Duesentrieb> oscar: so, you are saying that the uuid-based mount is handy for removable drives, but doesn't make any difference for a build in device?
[12:39] <oscar> Duesentrieb, i don't know, there's really weird stuff that goes on with ubuntu and automounting stuff, ignoring entries in fstab.  i actually can't figure it out
[12:39] <Daviey> Hi, does has anybody tried logging in using XDMCP under edgy?
[12:39] <oscar> Duesentrieb, yes
[12:39] <Duesentrieb> oscar: grmbl. yea, thatS why i'm here, i guess.
[12:39] <Duesentrieb> ok, i'll just change it back to the traditional way and see if it helps.
[12:39] <oscar> Duesentrieb, if the device names aren't going to change for your built in drives
[12:40] <Duesentrieb> i wouldn't know why they should change. also, there are device labels for that, no?
[12:40] <oscar> Duesentrieb, maybe on a server with multiple scsi bays or something where you'd add/remove disks then it could be a problem, but on a normal desktop its not
[12:41] <napslap> moin moin
[12:41] <oscar> Duesentrieb, i think devlabel is another way of handling the problem but i think a little more compllex.  uuid is nice because its simple and is already supported by mount

[12:42] <cwillu> how do I set/force a splash resolution for the boot splash, to happen every boot?
[12:42] <napslap> Hello who can help me with the kernel update
[12:43] <CoRnJuLiOx> i can't copy->paste from the windows drive that i just mounted. i can get to the stuff, though
[12:43] <devilsadvocate> cwillu, you have to set the vg = something option in the kernel boot options
[12:43] <devilsadvocate> cwillu, and that dowes not always work
[12:43] <cwillu> devilsadvocate: where are those documented?
[12:43] <devilsadvocate> cwillu, ermmm. i dont remember  :|
[12:43] <devilsadvocate> let me see if i can find it
[12:43] <oscar> cwillu, in the kernel source documentation under fb/vesa
[12:43] <cwillu> thanks :)
[12:44] <Duesentrieb> oscar: thanks for the advice. devlabels have worked nicely for me in the past, and seem pretty streight forward.
[12:45] <Duesentrieb> napslap: no one can help if you don't state your problem
[12:45] <Daviey> cwillu, do you mean usplash splash screen?  if thats the case /boot/grub/menu.1st
[12:45] <Daviey> cwillu, look under the boot option and set vga=x (x being a code)
[12:45] <napslap> my problem is that i donot know how to set the kernel right in the xconfig
[12:45] <cwillu> nvm, I'll just get rid of the splash;  not worth the trouble :p
[12:46] <oscar> i hate splash screens
[12:46] <russ> is there any way to see this page -> http://video.msn.com/v/us/v.htm
[12:46] <oscar> i don't even like splash logos
[12:46] <Daviey> cwillu, halfway down this page is a list of the 7xx codes
[12:47] <Daviey> oscar, i have just made my own custom splash!  sure i can't tempt you?
[12:47] <omeganine> Is anyone else having issues with the http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org repository?  Im trying to install beryl and stuff but i keep getting 404s back
[12:47] <DreamerHxC> I need help because yesterday I had an ATI and I could not boot up Ubuntu and now I have an nVIDIA and I cannot boot neither! I can't see the desktop. what the hell is happening?
[12:47] <oscar> Daviey, i used to use fbsplash which had a kickass background debian logo, but it was such a pain to get working
[12:47] <Daviey> russ, install the appropriate codec
[12:48] <joshua__> dreamer, are you using compiz or beryl?
[12:48] <DreamerHxC> i dont know because I never booted up the desktop
[12:48] <cwillu> the splashscreen itself works, but vt's are corrupted after if I used one while booting
[12:48] <russ> Daviey, no the problem is the JavaScript detetcs WMP 10 is not available
[12:48] <CaptainMorgan> how do I view all programs currently running?
[12:48] <Daviey> oscar, embarrassingly it has taken me a number of hours to build my own
[12:48] <DreamerHxC> when I get to logon screen and I log in....there's nothing showing
[12:48] <DreamerHxC> a yellow screen
[12:48] <russ> Daviey, if you go to the page it always redirects
[12:48] <cwillu> CaptainMorgan: ps aux in a terminal will do it
[12:49] <oscar> Daviey, yeah, it was cool, but then they changed stuff and i just didn't have the energy to keep up with it
[12:49] <joshua__> dreamer: will it boot up without using your video card?
[12:49] <Daviey> russ, i see what you mean.  firefox is trying to only play the flash stuff
[12:49] <h00pla> CaptainMorgan: either ps axf in a console or open system monitor from Preferences
[12:49] <DreamerHxC> with no video card?
[12:49] <mats> CaptainMorgan: if you want too see whats using what in terms of memory cpy ect. use "top"
[12:49] <Daviey> oscar, it's is actually really easy once you have done it!
[12:49] <russ> Daviey, does the page redirect you though
[12:49] <russ> ?
[12:49] <oscar> Daviey, if i were a  hardware vendor putting out my own custom linux boxes then i guess it would be worth it
[12:49] <DreamerHxC> how do I know it if I have no videocard?
[12:50] <Daviey> oscar, i made it for a HTPC frontend in the lounge, so wanted it to look nice
[12:50] <joshua__> try it without any video hardware and see if it'll boot up then
[12:50] <russ> Daviey, i get redirected to this page always -> http://video.msn.com/v/us/req.aspx?r=4&hf=1&h=http%3A//video.msn.com/v/us/fv/fv.htm%3Fhttp%3A//video.msn.com/v/us/v.htm
[12:50] <DreamerHxC> but how do I know if it booted up?
[12:50] <Daviey> russ, me too
[12:50] <joshua__> it'd load the desktop. just try it
[12:50] <russ> Daviey, yeah so there is no way around it easily :-(
[12:50] <DreamerHxC> but
[12:51] <omeganine> !beryl
[12:51] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:51] <CaptainMorgan> my processor says its in 50% use and I barely have anything running!? ex: Irc/consoles, browsers, and text editors
[12:51] <DreamerHxC> let me see if I understood: you want me to remove my hardoware videocard so I can't see ANYTHING in my screen and I boot up linux?
[12:51] <russ> CaptainMorgan, is this edgy
[12:52] <Daverocks> CaptainMorgan: check which process is hogging the cpu in top
[12:52] <joshua__> plug your monitor into an onboard port for it
[12:52] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, is there a way to make a shortcut that would automatically 'gksudo nautilus' for me?
[12:52] <russ> CaptainMorgan, might be nautilus bug
[12:52] <Daviey> russ, no sorry.  i get redirected to another page
[12:52] <oscar> CaptainMorgan, try running the top command
[12:52] <DreamerHxC> I don't understand, sorry
[12:52] <joshua__> if i'm not making sense, it's because i've been around my family all day. i'm drunk.
[12:52] <DreamerHxC> my motherboard has no integrated videocard
[12:52] <Daviey> russ, do you have w32 codec installed? and adobe flash
[12:52] <NegativeSpace> Is there a piece of software which can write over free disk space?
[12:52] <DreamerHxC> hum that explains many things
[12:52] <CaptainMorgan> rpmg?
[12:52] <afief> I've got a secondary partition mounted as HDA1, it is owned by root. i want regular users to have RW access to it. how can i do that?
[12:52] <russ> Daviey, yes
[12:52] <CaptainMorgan> ti's the hog
[12:53] <CaptainMorgan> 99% cpu usage
[12:53] <oscar> CaptainMorgan, i never heard of anything that runs a process with that name
[12:53] <Daviey> russ, i egt redirected to http://video.msn.com/v/us/fv/fv.htm?http://video.msn.com/v/us/v.htm
[12:53] <asfalt> hmmm just trying to download beryl, seems their mirror is broken or in the process of being moved but neither works
[12:53] <oscar> CaptainMorgan, try running ps aux |grep rpmg
[12:53] <russ> Daviey, yeah ;-(
[12:53] <afief> I've got a secondary partition mounted as HDA1, it is owned by root. i want regular users to have RW access to it. how can i do that?
[12:54] <russ> CaptainMorgan, killall rpmg
[12:54] <oscar> CaptainMorgan, try killing it if you're sure you don't need it
[12:54] <Daviey> russ, it's a different page to the one you were
[12:54] <oscar> russ, killall -TERM rpmg
[12:54] <oscar> try to kill it nicely first
[12:54] <CaptainMorgan> I just tried to kill it using top... and after becomign su.. and nothing happened.. it's still ther
[12:54] <russ> Daviey, only thing different is you aren't using firefox 1.5
[12:55] <beligum> hi all, anyone developing using JBoss in here?
[12:55] <Daviey> CaptainMorgan, ps -A | grep rpmg   (take the process id) and type sudo kill -9 process_id
[12:55] <oscar> CaptainMorgan, don't kill it with top.  use the kill command.  e.g. kill -15 <pid>
[12:55] <Daverocks> oscar: killall doesn't accept something like "-TERM", that's only for "kill", but i think something like "killall -s TERM" has the same effect
[12:55] <CaptainMorgan> beautiful Daviey that did it
[12:55] <CaptainMorgan> very nice
[12:55] <CaptainMorgan> phew
[12:56] <Daviey> CaptainMorgan, np
[12:56] <CaptainMorgan> not even sure how long that's been happening.. I just happened to glance down at my system montior
[12:56] <russ> i use ubuntu since 4.10 -- yay!
[12:56] <Daverocks> russ: i'm going to expect responses from people in here who boast that they've been using ubuntu way before 4.10 ... just waiting for the flooding to come in ;)
[12:57] <russ> Daverocks, was there any alphas before 4.10 ?
[12:57] <russ> heh
[12:57] <Daverocks> russ: i'm not an ubuntu person really, no idea :P
[12:57] <Daviey> Daverocks, i felt like saying i have been using it since 4.10 beta (but i haven't)
[12:58] <oscar> i've been using ubuntu since the days of slink
[12:58] <russ> yeah, over 2 years now ... gentoo before that, since 1.x
[12:58] <CoRnJuLiOx> i've been using ubuntu for like, 1 hour now :-(
[12:58] <Daviey> Hi, has anybody tried logging in using XDMCP under edgy?
[12:58] <fnf> Daviey: Yes ?
[12:58] <Daviey> fnf, did it work?
[12:59] <fnf> Daviey: I tried it once, and it worked.
[12:59] <oscar> noone here knows what slink is
[12:59] <mats> *memories* gentoo - using 2 days by compilling kde :p
[12:59] <Daviey> fnf, when i select the remote machine (autodects it on network) and pressconnect.  screen goes black and goes back to local gdm login :(
[12:59] <CoRnJuLiOx> the add/remove applications thing looks like its still installing, but i don't see a progress bar..
[12:59] <russ> oscar, i do
[12:59] <Daverocks> mats: heh, hardware has advanced so much
[01:00] <russ> oscar, but ubuntu was definitely not around -)
[01:00] <oscar> russ, the precursor
[01:00] <fnf> Daviey: Did you take a look at the log, I have not experienced problems with XDMCP so not really sure.
[01:00] <oscar> progenitor
[01:00] <Daviey> fnf, any idea where the log is?
[01:00] <cwillu> Daverocks: started with 4.10, but was using beatrix before that
[01:01] <cwillu> compiling gnome into the kernel ftw!
[01:01] <fnf> Daviey: Two possible localtions could be /var/log/syslog and /var/log/Xorg.*.log
[01:01] <Daverocks> cwillu: compiling _GNOME_ into the kernel? wtflol
[01:02] <Daviey> fnf, cheers
[01:02] <oscar> modprobe -r gnome
[01:02] <Daviey> fnf, seems strange that neither work though.  I have tried connected both directions from two machines
[01:02] <Daverocks> oscar: heh, you wouldn't want to do that while running gnome XD
[01:03] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, im having problems w/permissions, i've moved 3 items from my windows drive (two folders, one mp3), and neither are accessible by anything other than the root nautilus window i have open. i've changed the owner and the group, but they still show up as locked on my desktop.
[01:03] <russ> Daverocks, i dont know of any modules named gnome
[01:04] <russ> CoRnJuLiOx, chmod 777 when in doubt
[01:04] <Daverocks> russ: neither did i, but obviously when cwillu compiled gnome into the kernel, he could have made it a kernel module :P ... and i think you wanted to address oscar
[01:04] <fnf> Daviey: Sorry as the problem doesn't apply to mine, have you searched on Google yet ?. I'm of no use for this.
[01:04] <BlackHawk> hoi
[01:04] <russ> Daverocks, compiling gnome into the kernel!!!??  are you crazy!?!?!
[01:04] <cwillu> Daverocks: I didn't compile it;  it was a 'feature' of the distro
[01:04] <cwillu> :p
[01:05] <cwillu> I might be misremembering it though, looking for the url
[01:05] <Daverocks> russ: hey, _I_ didn't do it. i thought it was crazy too :D
[01:05] <oscar> ubuntu's supermegapatched kernel maybe?
[01:05] <Daverocks> cwillu: interesting XD
[01:05] <russ> sounds like a security nightmare waiting to happen
[01:05] <Daverocks> yuh XD
[01:05] <jim777> hello all - anyone had much experience with raki/syne to syn windows mobile devices with k/ubuntu
[01:05] <Daverocks> all the code running in kernel-sapce
[01:05] <Daverocks> *space
[01:05] <Daverocks> not good
[01:05] <selinuxium> how do I alter it so as mp4 are opened in mplayer not Movie Player
[01:05] <jim777> make that raki/synce
[01:06] <Daverocks> selinuxium: from nautilus?
[01:06] <russ> selinuxium, from desktop, right-click, properties
[01:06] <russ> on some file
[01:06] <selinuxium> ok cheers...
[01:06] <Daverocks> selinuxium: no, i mean, _when_ you open it from nautilus?
[01:06] <web_knows> hi :)
[01:07] <fnf> Does anyone know how to instruct Ubuntu to load the nvidiafb module instead og vesafb at load without having to recompile the kernel ?
[01:07] <jim777> no takers on raki/synce?
[01:07] <DreamerHxC> im trying to install nvidia drivers in console mode but I get NVIDIA: Failed to load NVIDIA Kernel Module. Screen found but none have a usable configuration after restarting gdm. what can I do?
[01:07] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms error,help me, please see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1800482#post1800482
[01:07] <russ> fnf, /etc/modules
[01:07] <selinuxium> I am opening it via PenguinTV I would love to just get shot of Totem altogether, but i am sure I probably use it unknowingly
[01:08] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: you sure X isn't running when you install?
[01:08] <oscar> DreamerHxC, i got an error like that also. i had to run this:  insmod nvidia
[01:08] <fnf> russ: That doesn't work if I want the module to load at the very beginning, to have high-resolution console.
[01:08] <selinuxium> Daverocks: ^^^
[01:08] <DreamerHxC> no, im not sure, in wiki can't see anything about stoping gdm
[01:08] <russ> fnf, you mean before full boot??
[01:08] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[01:08] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: better would be "init 3"
[01:08] <russ> fnf, probably in your initram then
[01:08] <DreamerHxC> but that before installing drivers?
[01:09] <DreamerHxC> init 3 instead init.d?
[01:09] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: sorry, "sudo init 3"
[01:09] <russ> fnf, check your initrd file
[01:09] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: be warned that will shut down your X session and everything in it
[01:09] <[GuS] > Bonjour...
[01:09] <fnf> russ: That's not really necessary, I'd want a resolution higher than the max 1024x768 that vesa can provide. If there's any step to do it after booting, I'd be glad.
[01:09] <DreamerHxC> i can't run graphic mode so I don't mind
[01:09] <fnf> russ: I'll check and come back.
[01:09] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: oh lol :P
[01:09] <russ> fnf, well modprobe
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> what is "sudo init 3" for?
[01:10] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: changes to runlevel 3
[01:10] <russ> fnf, after booting ;-)
[01:10] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: runlevel 3 is notable for not running a graphical interface
[01:10] <DreamerHxC> ok so is it gdm stoped already?
[01:10] <fnf> russ: modprobe wouldn't automagically bring up higher res, I've tried.
[01:10] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms error,help me, please see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1800482#post1800482
[01:11] <CoRnJuLiOx> is there an equivalent to ctrl+alt+del in linux? i need to kill this add/remove applications box, its been sitting here for a while and i can't seem to make it go away
[01:11] <fnf> russ: I'm aware of 915resolution, but that seems unstable for some, unfortunately. People with ATI card can recompile the kernel to have max resolution, but I have no idea how to load it first on boot.
[01:11] <Daverocks> CoRnJuLiOx: find the process and kill it with "kill", or type "xkill" and click on the offending window
[01:12] <russ> fnf, the compile into the kernel
[01:12] <DreamerHxC> Daverocks not wrking either
[01:12] <CoRnJuLiOx> Daverocks; thanks
[01:12] <CoRnJuLiOx> is there a way to manage performance related features? like in windows how theres a dialog that'll let you disable visual effects to improve performance? its kinda laggy on me
[01:12] <fnf> russ: The last time I recompiled there was no option relates to nvidia driver though. I'd find the config for initram, btw, can you tell me where it is.
=== igor is now known as igcek
[01:13] <russ> fnf, well cant you pass the kernel some options then/
[01:13] <russ> fnf, video=foofb VGA=1600x1200
[01:13] <fnf> russ: I did "video=nvidiafb" but to no avail. I still loaded vesafb
[01:13] <russ> fnf, did you pass the VGA option
[01:14] <fnf> russ: I also use vga=792 all the time. But recompiling the kernel for my other PC with ATI card doesn't need vga option though.
[01:15] <fnf> russ: I'll try it once again to make sure, do you have any other suggestion ?
[01:15] <russ> fnf, any errors in boot log?
[01:15] <DreamerHxC> Daverocks http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33662/
[01:15] <fnf> russ: no, the thing is, kern.log did show my options parsed correctly, but vesafb still loaded.
[01:16] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: try oscar's suggestion, "insmod nvidia"
[01:16] <russ> fnf, why not try vesafb-tng then ?
=== Zylch is now known as Zylche
[01:16] <russ> fnf, i think that is a better option
[01:16] <DreamerHxC> oh i didn't read it
[01:17] <DreamerHxC> insmod nvidia
[01:17] <DreamerHxC> im going
[01:17] <russ> fnf, try video=vesafb-tng VGA=792
[01:17] <fnf> russ: That was good enough, but couldn't bring resolution higher than 1024x768, my monitor's max res is 1600x1200. It is slower than native driver for nvidia also.
[01:17] <fnf> russ: What is that ?
[01:17] <russ> fnf, vesafb the next generation
[01:17] <russ> supports higher resolutions
[01:18] <Acke_ubu> hey where would i fine files that configures eth0??
[01:18] <Acke_ubu> find
[01:18] <DreamerHxC> can't read nvidia: no such file or directory
[01:18] <b08y> fnf: what about editing the monitor section in x.org.conf
[01:18] <fnf> russ: Another cool name :) thanks, I'll try that. Is there any other place I can look for ?
[01:18] <Acke_ubu> where would i find the eth0 config file?
[01:18] <russ> fnf, should be compiled in
[01:18] <fnf> b08y: I was refering to the console though.
[01:18] <b08y> fnf: ah, k
[01:18] <oscar> well i think i'm going to reinstall with etch
[01:18] <syntaxx> anyone know how to adjust the size of kiba-dock?
[01:19] <oscar> DreamerHxC, what kernel are you running?
[01:19] <fnf> russ: Ok thank you.
[01:19] <DreamerHxC> ubunut's default
[01:19] <DreamerHxC> edgy ef
[01:19] <DreamerHxC> t
[01:19] <russ> fnf, make sure it is though
[01:19] <russ> fnf, modprobe vesafb-tng
[01:20] <oscar> DreamerHxC, you need to install the linux-restricted modules for your kernel
[01:20] <fnf> russ: d'oh! It doesn't seem to be exist.
[01:20] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey, is there a way to disable visual features (or any other extra features) to improve performance?
[01:20] <DreamerHxC> ok im going os390
[01:20] <DreamerHxC> oscar
[01:20] <oscar> CoRnJuLiOx, apt-get install openbox  :-)
[01:21] <russ> fnf, http://dev.gentoo.org/~spock/projects/vesafb-tng/
[01:21] <DreamerHxC> oscar it's already installed in its most recent version
[01:21] <oscar> DreamerHxC, well you shoud have the nvicia module then
[01:21] <dromer> damnit, I keep getting hiliteod on DreamerHxC :P
[01:21] <DreamerHxC> how do I know if I have it?
[01:22] <DreamerHxC> ;)
[01:22] <fnf> russ: I'm taking a look at it. WRT initram config, I couldn't find it yet. Is it compressed anywhere ?
[01:22] <oscar> DreamerHxC, its should be nvidia.ko under /lib/modules/`uname -r`/........ somewhere
[01:23] <DreamerHxC> ok let me see
[01:23] <oscar> CoRnJuLiOx, i don't know what kind of system you have, what resources are available
[01:23] <NegativeSpace> Is there a piece of software which can write over free disk space?
[01:23] <DreamerHxC> oscar it's not there >.<
[01:24] <bluesign> anyone know a full DVD authoring software for ubuntu, with subtitles, menus etc?
[01:24] <fnf> NegativeSpace: If you want to screw deleted data for secure, *nix natively support it.

[01:24] <DreamerHxC> hold on
[01:24] <NegativeSpace> fnf: Thanks.
[01:25] <DreamerHxC> that directory doesn't exist

Neither will connect to each other.  Could it be a problem with XDMCP monitoring the wrong interface (but gdm autodetected a XDMCP enabled host0
[01:27] <dudanogueira> kamo, is it the version 6.06?
[01:27] <OldLink> hello
[01:27] <oscar> DreamerHxC, make sure the restricted modules is the one for your kernel version
[01:27] <DreamerHxC> in /lib/modules i have two directories
[01:27] <kamo> dudanogueira, i think it is the latest system
[01:28] <OldLink> good afternnon
[01:28] <DreamerHxC> 2.6.17-10-386 and 2.6.17-10-generic
[01:28] <DreamerHxC> and there's nothing like nvidia there
[01:28] <oscar> DreamerHxC, i don't care about that.  i only care that the restricted modules version matches your running kernell's version
[01:28] <OldLink> am desesperatly needing help for my Wacom tablet...
[01:28] <dudanogueira> kamo, when i installed the dapper drake 6.06 on my mother's computers, i had this problem. it hooked on LVM and EVMS services. had to wait for it to load and after install remove it from init scripts
[01:28] <eexp16> DreamerHxC: type uname -r to see which kernel you are running now
[01:29] <DreamerHxC> ok 2.6.17-10-386
[01:29] <oscar> it could be version 5823x9efoofoofoo for all i care
[01:29] <DreamerHxC> so in that directory there's no nvidia
[01:29] <Duesentrieb> DreamerHxC: what exactly are you trying to do?
[01:29] <DreamerHxC> initrd, kernel, madwifi, volatile
[01:29] <oscar> DreamerHxC, what version(s) of the restricted modules?
[01:30] <kamo> dudanogueira, it says: "Buffer I/O error on device dm_l, logical block 27232. The next message is about 27233 and its endless

[01:31] <DreamerHxC> i've done it thousands of times
[01:31] <kamo> dudanogueira, i can't it is a laptop - i tryed i cant unplug the hdd except if i open everything
[01:31] <oscar> Duesentrieb, if the module can't be insmoded then theres a more serious problem
[01:31] <Duesentrieb> OldLink: a concrete question usually helps.
[01:31] <kamo> defrysk, i can't boot man
[01:31] <wijnand> DreamerHxC: nobody cares about your sex life :P
[01:31] <oscar> DreamerHxC, please read what i asked above

[01:31] <DreamerHxC> sorry, what did u asked?
[01:32] <DreamerHxC> ahd the module
[01:32] <oscar> DreamerHxC, what version(s) of the restricted modules?
[01:32] <Duesentrieb> oscar: wrong version for the kernel, i guess...
[01:32] <OldLink> ok, thanks. I have done the installation steps, and the wacdump tool finds my tablet at ttyS0
[01:32] <DreamerHxC> ok 2.6.17-10-386
[01:32] <dudanogueira> catsy, only you can answerl this question :)
[01:32] <kamo> DreamerHxC, how can i make the boot cd not to care about the hdd - if you asked me
[01:32] <OldLink> but when I config it into xorg.conf, it does not work
[01:32] <Duesentrieb> the one for 1.6.15 workd fine with 2.6.17 for me, btw
[01:32] <Daverocks> catsy: yeah, whichever you like better
[01:32] <DreamerHxC> i dont know
[01:32] <Duesentrieb> 2.6.15 of course#
[01:33] <DreamerHxC> oscar 2.6.17-10-386
[01:33] <kamo> DreamerHxC, ok - it seems its not possible
[01:33] <OldLink> ok duda

[01:34] <Daverocks> CoRnJuLiOx: they can't, patent issues
[01:34] <oscar> DreamerHxC, odd, i can't find nvidia.ko for my ubuntu 2.6.10 kernel either, but i could insmod it
[01:34] <catsy> mandriva cost alot of money
[01:34] <Daverocks> catsy: i'm quite sure there's a free version of mandriva 2007
[01:35] <Lynoure> I just tell them to try something else if they do not like what they started with :)
[01:35] <RadicalDreamer> Hello. I have a little problem: Ubuntu does not seem to recognize the Classpath, even if my modify of /etc/profile seems proper. What did I miss?

[01:35] <dudanogueira> catsy, i used suse, mandrake, mandriva, fedora... had found ubuntu some time ago and am quite happier now :)
[01:35] <oscar> anyhow, i've got to do some installing.  laterz
[01:35] <DreamerHxC> so? becaue this is so weird not to show up the desktop nor with nvidia neither ati
[01:35] <DreamerHxC> g'bye thank u
[01:35] <catsy> dudanogueira, does ubuntu come with developemnt packages, c++, xorg devel.... etc?
[01:36] <dudanogueira> catsy, no, you have to install them.

[01:37] <catsy> dudanogueira, this is not a ripped off debian is it haha?
[01:37] <dudanogueira> catsy, ubuntu is focused on end users, so by default, it only have packages for supply this type of users
[01:37] <Daverocks> DreamerHxC: you _have_ the kernel module, right? like, you've installed the proprietary nvidia drivers?
[01:37] <dudanogueira> catsy, but you can easily install other packages, that'll feet you needs
[01:37] <wijnand> DreamerHxC: i know someone with exactly the same problem... he can't figure it out either
[01:38] <catsy> dudanogueira, this is not a ripped off Debian is it haha?
[01:38] <Daverocks> catsy: he/she answered that question
[01:38] <DreamerHxC> wijnand which graphic card does he have?
[01:38] <catsy> where?
[01:39] <dudanogueira> catsy, english isnt my native language, coudnt follow the ripped off :(
[01:39] <Daverocks> catsy: <dudanogueira> catsy, ubuntu is focused on end users, so by default, it only have packages for supply this type of users
[01:39] <Daverocks> dudanogueira: i think he means, a stripped-down version, like debian with lots of stuff removed
[01:39] <catsy> if itz not debian wat core is it?
[01:39] <Daverocks> catsy: it is debian-based
[01:40] <dudanogueira> catsy, no no... im my opinion, ubuntu WAS debian-based, but today it has a self structure and packages and etc
[01:40] <eexp16> dudanogueira: no. ubuntu also has all devel packages available, they are just not on the cd, but can be installed from the standard repositories on the net
[01:40] <Daverocks> ok ok, i was wrong :P
[01:40] <catsy> Daverocks, tharz what im tryin to say
[01:40] <gnomefreak> dudanogueira: ubuntu is still debian based
[01:40] <dudanogueira> eexp16, exactly what i said... it doesnt come by default, but you can install
[01:41] <eexp16> dudanogueira: okay
[01:41] <tim167> hello, I'm looking for a CALENDAR program that can display days starting from 5 am on top, and 4 am at the bottom, any ideas ??
[01:41] <Daverocks> yay! i wasn't wrong! :P
[01:41] <catsy> i saw the video of ubuntu, was it owned by Nelson Mandela
[01:41] <dudanogueira> gnomefreak, sure, but some services are quite diferent from debian...
[01:41] <eexp16> gnomefreak: but it's not wise to use debian repos in ubuntu and mix packages
[01:41] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#oneline, i sudo apt-get install (insert that long line w/all the package names in it), but it doesn't work. it says it cant find the package gstreamer0.10-pitfdll
[01:41] <gnomefreak> dudanogueira: being based on debina doesnt mean it uses everything debian uses
[01:41] <syntaxx> any experience kiba-dock users? i cant adjust kiba-docks siize anyone who can help me?
[01:42] <gnomefreak> eexp16: the binaries are not compatable
[01:42] <eexp16> gnomefreak: the boot process is also different
[01:42] <gnomefreak> eexp16: different versioning
[01:42] <dudanogueira> eexp16, only if you like big adventures. it may work, or may not...
[01:42] <kamo> anybody knows a boot parameter to make "enterprise volume management" not to start?
[01:42] <gnomefreak> eexp16: only in edgy
[01:42] <catsy> i saw the video of ubuntu, was it owned by Nelson Mandela???
[01:43] <catsy> on Ununtu OS
[01:43] <dudanogueira> but for sure youll brake you entire system if use debian repos on ubuntu =)
[01:43] <gnomefreak> catsy: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:43] <eexp16> gnomefreak: okay
[01:43] <RadicalDreamer> <catsy> i saw the video of ubuntu, was it owned by Nelson Mandela??? | No, no, he was just the sponsor. :)
[01:43] <catsy> than you RadicalDreamer
[01:43] <catsy> thanK you RadicalDreamer
[01:43] <eexp16> catsy: in that video talks about the african word "ubuntu", not the distro

[01:46] <catsy> black were racist
[01:47] <catsy> because white pplz said they have black dikz
[01:47] <dudanogueira> anto, you should set the DefaultRootDirectory for the specified user on the proftpd conf, and the user must have a valid bash and be on the system
[01:47] <rasputnik> catsy: oh, you're a *troll* - i was confused for a moment there

[01:52] <gump99> Hey everybody. I just noticed a bug in the Dapper release. If it is updated to Kernel 2.6.15-27 (which it seems to do automatically), the ipw3945 module for the centrino platform stops working, because /usr/sbin/ipw3945d isn't correctly renamed to ipw3945-2.6.15-27. Thus, you have to manually rename it to match the current kernel version. This should be fixed.
[01:52] <gump99> I found this bug on the database
[01:53] <gump99> e.g. onlaunchpad.net - how do I confirm it?
[01:53] <tonyyarusso> gump99: Meaning it's already registered in Launchpad?
[01:53] <gump99> yep
[01:53] <tonyyarusso> gump99: Log in, add a comment saying that you can confirm the behaviour.
[01:53] <catsy> i guess everyone had already seen Crouching tigher, Where's da dragon
[01:53] <tonyyarusso> gump99: That will notify certain people of your comment, and hopefully one will change the status to confirmed, and look into it.

[01:54] <CoRnJuLiOx> have they changed?
[01:55] <tonyyarusso> CoRnJuLiOx: Have you updated the package cache since modifying your sources?

[01:56] <dromer> damnit, my desktop hangs :o
[01:57] <dromer> I can still move the mouse, xmms is still playing
[01:57] <tonyyarusso> CoRnJuLiOx: So you're working in Synaptic.  How are you trying to find them, and what happens?
[01:57] <catsy> they start with butthole and then poo!!
[01:57] <kamo> is there a way to choose among several kernels on boot (from the CD)
[01:57] <dromer> but since I opened Evolution and started reading an e-mail ... everything is dead
[01:57] <dromer> it doesn't reacto on anything
[01:58] <dudanogueira> dromer, it happens with me, speacially when i receive a skype message that notifies with a sound. remove the sound and everything is ok now :P
[01:58] <dromer> thi sexplains why I couldn;t get it to react when I got home .. it was also stuck ..

[01:58] <RadicalDreamer> Repeating for newcomers: <RadicalDreamer> Hello. I have a little problem: Ubuntu does not seem to recognize the Classpath, even if my modify of /etc/profile seems proper. What did I miss?
[01:59] <dudanogueira> dromer, my evolution also hangs too, but i have milion of mails on it
[01:59] <tonyyarusso> CoRnJuLiOx: iirc, there are multiple sections labelled universe and multiverse, b/c of backports, security, and such.  Are you sure you got the right ones?
[01:59] <dromer> dudanogueira: maybe it;'s because of adding my gmail account ..
[01:59] <dromer> it has lots and lots of mail (especialy junk :/) with big attachments and stuff
[01:59] <asfalt> is the number of workspaces displayed dependable on the gnome theme? i only seem to have two in the switcher instead of 4
[01:59] <dudanogueira> dromer, im using thunderbird instead of evolution. much more hard to brake :)
[01:59] <dromer> I have it so all the messages are kept on the server though
[02:00] <dromer> ok
[02:00] <dromer> damnit, time to reset the pc I guess :/
[02:00] <Enselic_> I only have 1024x768 to choose from when I pick resolution, althogh 800x600 works when I have an external monitor. My xorg.conf file have several Modes, including 800x600, but I still cannot choose 800x600. What could be the error?

[02:03] <soundray> I have a compilation that fails with "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lqwt". libqwt is installed and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is pointing to it. How can I fix this?
[02:03] <dudanogueira> dromer, in evolution, i only like the fact of perfectly sync with my palm, and show the data on gnome clock and others. the mail app isnt the best..
[02:03] <dudanogueira> dromer, if i could insert the thunderbird into the evolution, it should be a must... :)
[02:03] <soundray> I'd appreciate any hint, even if it's generic.
[02:04] <dromer> haha
[02:04] <yakumo> hi help my linux ubuntu stop booting. i cant use my ubuntu anymore
[02:04] <dudanogueira> and the addressbook applet is a charm too
[02:04] <ActivE> thanks Enselic_ && Daverocks
[02:04] <yakumo> any idea how to fix it
[02:04] <dudanogueira> yakumo, error messages? is a notebook?
[02:05] <yakumo> none only black screen. im using desktop.. i try to recover mode but it dit not boot also
[02:05] <dudanogueira> if i shutdown my laptop with the wireless off and try to power it on with the wireless on, it doesnt run :(
[02:06] <dudanogueira> yakumo, on the black screen try switching the tty (ctrl+alt+f1, or f2, or f3...)
[02:06] <RadicalDreamer> D'oh, my $LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't even exist! Now I understand why I can't compile anything!
[02:06] <nanomike> Is there a way to use SMTP-AUTH with Postfix? I've followed every guide with no luck!
[02:07] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, chmod 777 /somefolder gives me read/write access to /somefolder, but how do i get the same access for all of the folders inside it?
[02:07] <dudanogueira> and see if you can get some error messages, or even load a working text mode
[02:07] <CoRnJuLiOx> files too
[02:07] <dudanogueira> CoRnJuLiOx, and -R
[02:07] <dudanogueira> CoRnJuLiOx, chmod -R 777
[02:07] <soundray> How to troubleshoot a compile error? At the linking stage, it says "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lqwt"

[02:12] <tonyyarusso> catsy: Please stop using the bot to spam the channel.
[02:12] <yakumo> i can't even access bash.
[02:12] <Healot> either, kuja_
[02:12] <maghat> Definitely K3B IMHO
[02:12] <catsy> stop
[02:12] <catsy> was dat abot

[02:12] <yakumo> <soundray>any idea :)
[02:13] <rambo3> RadicalDreamer, yes
[02:13] <apokryphos> RadicalDreamer: yup =)
[02:13] <runpain> iwant to run in root but when i sign in it says that the command is wrong the user and password do not exsist

[02:13] <ubotu> runpain: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[02:13] <rambo3> RadicalDreamer, it just ubuntu with bible stuff . take a look at whatwouldjesusdownload.com
[02:13] <maghat> kuja, please don't ditch nero. There are things K3B cannot do (like DVD recoding)
[02:13] <soundray> yakumo: is "mounting filesystems" also the last thing you see when you boot recovery mode?
[02:13] <kuja_> maghat: k3b can't do DVDs?
[02:14] <kuja_> Nero already screwed up one of my DVDs
[02:14] <dudanogueira> kuja_, gnomebaker rulez
[02:14] <maghat> kuja: yes it does, but it doesn't recode them so you can fit a double layer original into a single layer copy
[02:14] <kuja_> Also, when burning stuff, is it generally a smart idea to close running applications and also disable any screensavers?
[02:15] <apokryphos> kuja_: of course it can do dvds, yes. It's the most comprehensive burner available for Linux at the moment
[02:15] <yakumo> <soundray>no it stop after the mssg i don't remeber the mssg;;; sori
[02:15] <apokryphos> kuja_: depends on what type of setup you've got
[02:15] <kuja_> Honestly, I'm trying to burn a PS2 game.
[02:15] <kuja_> I have a very limited supply of DVDs, and I want to get it right.
[02:16] <apokryphos> kuja_: then use k3b
[02:16] <kuja_> Thanks, that's what I needed to hear.
[02:16] <yakumo> <soundray>anyway i install ubuntu on the other partition not removing the other ubuntu so i can get file bit torrent that im downloading, but i can't continue the save progress...
[02:16] <kuja_> maghat: Very useful information. I'll keep that in mind when I need to burn it that way, thanks!
[02:16] <maghat> kuja_:  on average modern pcs you can burn and do other stuff simultaneously
[02:16] <RadicalDreamer> http://www.whatwouldjesusdownload.com/christianubuntu/2006/07/about-ubuntu-christian-edition.html | Oh my Marx.
[02:17] <yakumo> <soundray>any idea how can i continue the file, beacuse its quite long to start over again
[02:17] <soundray> yakumo: is this a fresh installation?
[02:17] <kuja_> maghat: I don't know if my Celeron/512MB RAM is a modern PC :)
[02:17] <yakumo> <soundray>yup
[02:17] <rstanca> hello, what happed to silc in gaim? is that protocol not suported anymore? apt-cache search silc didn`t helped too much...
[02:17] <yakumo> <soundray>i only need to continue what i download in my previos ubuntu
[02:17] <Healot> kuja_: it's an ancient machine
[02:18] <maghat> kuja_: you may also invest some time reading the dvdrtools manual. There are things you can do from the command line that no graphical burner application allows you to.
[02:18] <soundray> yakumo: so your older ubuntu still boots?
[02:18] <yakumo> <soundray>i use the bit torrent provided by ubuntu when you install
[02:18] <kuja_> maghat: Yeah I was thinking of a command-line solution as well.
[02:18] <maghat> kuja_; What's the Celeron speed?
[02:18] <yakumo> <soundray>i cant still choose my older ubuntu
[02:18] <kuja_> maghat: About 2.2
[02:19] <kuja_> Perhaps not starting X (maybe just boot into recovery mode) and burning the DVD with a command-line tool would be the safest?
[02:19] <maghat> it definitely not ancient. But you would gain a significant performance increase if you double the RAM to 1Gb.
[02:20] <kuja_> maghat: Yeah, I only have 2 slots, and they're filled with 256's, so I'll need to buy 2 *new* 512's :(
[02:20] <maghat> kuja_: K3b uses buffer underrun protection in most DVD burners, you don't need to be so careful about DVD recording nowadays ;)
[02:20] <kuja_> I wonder if the investment into memory will be well worth it.
[02:20] <runpain> i have enabled root now when i sign on after loging out of user account and try to sign in on root account it says system administrator is not allowed to login from this screen
[02:21] <runpain> how do i fix that
[02:21] <kuja_> Hm...
[02:21] <apokryphos> runpain: ......... you should not be trying to login to root
[02:21] <apokryphos> runpain: it's disabled on Ubuntu for a good reason. See the wiki page on what to do.
[02:21] <runpain> i am root and user
[02:21] <maghat> kuja_: then you would benefit from using xubuntu instead of (k)ubuntu
[02:21] <apokryphos> runpain: irrelevant
[02:21] <kuja_> maghat: Can you recommend a company for RAM?
[02:21] <runpain> what wiki page
[02:21] <gdb> What's wrong with newegg's prices?  They're nearly always the lowest you can find.
[02:22] <kuja_> gdb: I live overseas, so the shipping itself may be a killer
[02:22] <apokryphos> !root | runpain
[02:22] <ubotu> runpain: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[02:22] <apokryphos> runpain: that one.
[02:22] <gdb> kuja_: ah, makes sense
[02:22] <Healot> Eclipse is a real eclipse for
[02:22] <yakumo> <soundray>is it possible to continue what i downloaded on my freshly install ubuntu??? using bit torrent??
[02:22] <kuja_> gdb: Not to mention, newegg takes a horribly long time to ship overseas :)
[02:22] <maghat> Kuja:_ I have used Infineon, TwinMOS, and now Kingston (ValueRam) but have also used vanilla OEM RAM chips and never had a problem so far :)
[02:23] <runpain> this sucks atlest in Mepis i can sign in as root or user
[02:23] <ragamuffin> Hello, can I extend my ubuntu partition (I am getting lowdisk message_
[02:23] <apokryphos> runpain: it's unsafe and you shouldn't. Read the page for all the information though. There should be no reason to ever login as root.
[02:23] <kuja_> runpain: In Ubuntu, we don't have the concept of "running as root", even though you can.
[02:23] <wijnand> ragamuffin: when your harddisk is full, it's time for a new one
[02:23] <dudanogueira> runpain, you only sould use the root for administrative tasks. this could be acomplished with the sudo command, so it will ask the user password and bypass the root itself
[02:23] <soundray> yakumo: I don't know, sorry.
[02:23] <maghat> runpain:_ please, for your own safety, *don't* login as root user. There are many reasons why Ubuntu does not allow it
[02:24] <yakumo> <soundray>thnks anyway
[02:24] <kuja_> runpain: Ubuntu is more about the sudo, where you do things as root, instead of logging in and doing everything as root (logging in as root causes more problems for the newbies)
[02:24] <ragamuffin> wijnand: I gave only 2.something gb to ubuntu. that is the problem
[02:24] <wijnand> maghat: i can login as root... still up and running :)
[02:24] <wijnand> ragamuffin: that sure is a problem
[02:24] <runpain> i want to trasfer some wallpapers and such over to this computer
[02:24] <apokryphos> wijnand: please don't recommend it to new users.
[02:24] <kuja_> runpain: Use sudo
[02:24] <soundray> runpain: if you want a root-like shell, use sudo -i
[02:24] <ragamuffin> I have more than enough for win partitions. Can i get more from there?
[02:24] <joshua__> when trying to start up beryl, i get this: joshua@joshua-desktop:~$ beryl-manager
[02:24] <joshua__> joshua@joshua-desktop:~$ compiz.real: No composite extension
[02:24] <apokryphos> wijnand: and if you're a new user you shouldn't be logging in as root.
[02:24] <kuja_> runpain: If you really need to log in as root, though I highly discourage it, run `sudo -s`
[02:25] <joshua__> any ideas?
[02:25] <maghat> actually I don't like the sudo thingy, I have root enabled but I (usually) know what I'm doing :p
[02:25] <zircx> ok, I'm trying to download and install the latest version of amsn from source and I'm getting this error, on ./configure : checking tcl build dir... configure: error: Unable to find Tcl directory or Tcl package is not tcl-dev. I'm a little lost on this one
[02:25] <apokryphos> sudo -i is better, and for graphical applications gksu/gksudo is recommended
[02:25] <zircx> maybe i need to add the prefix on ./configure? but what would the prefix be?
[02:25] <apokryphos> zircx: type sudo apt-get build-dep amsn
[02:26] <runpain> brb
[02:26] <zircx> ah
[02:26] <dv5237_> is there a option to say 'yes to all' when installing apps on the cli (sudo apt-get install <package name>'
[02:26] <apokryphos> dv5237: yes; see man apt-get
[02:26] <soundray> dv5237_: man apt-get, look at the -y option
[02:26] <maghat> or you can run "sudo passwd root" and enter a root password. Then open a terminal, login as root, as use it for administrative tasks.
[02:26] <kuja_> maghat: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820141424 -- I'm liking this =) ... Free shipping! :D
[02:26] <nysosym> h i Quinn_Storm :)))
=== kuja_ is now known as kuja
[02:27] <gnomefreak> maghat: that is not recommended
[02:27] <soundray> maghat: don't recommend this please. Much better for people to get used to the Ubuntu way ;)
[02:27] <Quinn_Storm> hi
[02:27] <apokryphos> maghat: please don't recommend that in a channel for new users
[02:27] <dv5237_> soundray: mkay thanks ill do that
[02:27] <maghat> kuja_: it's good value, if your motherboard supposts DDR 400
[02:27] <apokryphos> maghat: see /msg ubotu root for Ubuntu's default way of doing things
[02:27] <kuja> maghat: I'll have to check, as I'm not a big hardware guy.
[02:28] <kuja> maghat: I'm tired of opening up my computer (and I don't have the mobo manual to check), is there any software alternative to check?
[02:28] <gdb> maghat: How is "su -" and "sudo -i" so different as to justify setting an actual root password?
[02:28] <zircx> apokryphos, it's looking for the source package for amsn-0.96 do i actually state the .bz2 package when trying to build the source or is it from inside the actual unpacked source folder that I give that command
[02:28] <maghat> soundray: I most definitely *DO NOT* recommend it!!
[02:28] <gdb> maghat: What value does "su -" add that "sudo -i" does not?
[02:28] <apokryphos> zircx: check the faq on notes for compiling
[02:28] <soundray> maghat: your hint was not appropriately accompanied by a warning.
[02:28] <Quinn_Storm> sudo su - can work
[02:29] <dv_> Quinn_Storm, how about sudo -i :)
[02:29] <apokryphos> gdb: the main reason we recommend sudo -i instead of su - is for good practice. It's conflicting advise telling the new user to use sudo when if we were to say "use su -" for a jailed root session
[02:29] <gnomefreak> how about applications>systemtools>root terminal
[02:29] <apokryphos> so please recommend sudo -i instead of su - :)
[02:29] <gnomefreak> :)
[02:29] <Quinn_Storm> dv_: I just got used to sudo su - instead of su -
[02:29] <apokryphos> this comes up quite often :)
[02:29] <Quinn_Storm> err instead of sudo -i
[02:29] <maghat> gdb: not having to type "sudo" in the first place :)
[02:30] <gdb> apokryphos: I'm not advocating setting a root password and I've never recommended that one do so.  I'm asking maghat what value feels "su -" provides that "sudu -i" does not.
[02:30] <gdb> er what value he feels
[02:30] <apokryphos> gdb: ok, I see. Cool :)
[02:31] <maghat> gdb: you are right, it is mostly an old slackware/redhat habit ;)
[02:32] <zircx> damn this is somewhat a mission
[02:32] <gdb> No worries, I was just curious.  I started on Slackware many years ago, used Red Hat for years, and I've only been using Ubuntu since 2 weeks before Dapper release.  I use sudo -i for no reason other than it works.
[02:32] <maghat> gdb: and my laptop always sits behind a wireless router with builtin firewall (Dlink, very nice)
[02:32] <zircx> I installed the tk-dev file now it's asking for libpng..
[02:32] <apokryphos> zircx: indeed; that's why it's best to stick with the amsn packages from Ubuntu
[02:33] <zircx> they aren't up to date though
[02:33] <apokryphos> zircx: did the build-dep command I gave you not pull those in?
[02:33] <zircx> no
[02:33] <zircx> it wouldn't execute
[02:33] <zircx> E: Unable to find a source package for amsn
[02:33] <RadicalDreamer> Grrr. Any new variable I try adding to /etc/profile just doesn't work. Any ideas?
[02:34] <Nangisan> Hey everyone
[02:34] <Quinn_Storm> RadicalDreamer: how are you testing, and are you exporting?
[02:34] <soundray> RadicalDreamer: you need to 'source /etc/profile' after any change you make
[02:34] <maghat> kuja: do you know your motherboard maker/model ?
[02:34] <apokryphos> zircx: ok, you need to uncomment the deb-src lines in your /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:34] <Quinn_Storm> remember /etc/profile isn't sourced by default in x terminal emulators, they don't use a "login shell"
[02:34] <syntaxx> how can i view gnome menu?
[02:34] <apokryphos> zircx: you should always tell someone if the command they gave you gives an error :)
[02:35] <ubuntu> hello everyone!
[02:35] <apokryphos> hi
[02:35] <zircx> apokryphos, I said something about it, but I probably wasn't specific about it
[02:35] <kuja> maghat: Yep, I'll check it on newegg
[02:35] <Nangisan> hi there!
[02:35] <apokryphos> zircx: then you couldn't have highlighted me :P
[02:35] <Nangisan> Anyone here do any web page design? I've kind of run into a snag..
[02:35] <ubuntu> Could you help me in fresh edgy-install problem?
[02:36] <zircx> probably not... but at least we're getting closer, appreciate the help
[02:36] <monokrome> Nangisan: What's wrong?
[02:36] <apokryphos> !helpme
[02:36] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:36] <ubuntu> I've just installed edgy, from desktop cd
[02:36] <DreamerHxC> please I need help, I can't boot after login in graphic mode, not with ati nor with nvidia, im getting the same error. Help please!
[02:36] <apokryphos> M3t4ll1k0: no automatic away/back messages please :)
[02:36] <Nangisan> monokrome, it's actually just a stupid problem. I've been working with HTML and whatnot but it's to do with images
[02:36] <ubuntu> grub not loading..
[02:36] <M3t4ll1k0> apokryphos, ok sorry
[02:36] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: let us know the error
[02:36] <monokrome> Nangisan: Out with it, already :P
[02:37] <maghat> kuja: even if it doesn't support DDR400, if the memory modules are the same kind (physically) the kingston memory will still work, only slower
[02:37] <zircx> I don't have these build issues with slackware
[02:37] <ubuntu> I've 2 sata winchester
[02:37] <Nangisan> monokrome, It's creating an image that will let the background show through it. like transparency. I thought it would be simple enough, but i cant fiure it out
[02:37] <monokrome> You using CSS?
[02:37] <ubuntu> winxp is on sda1
[02:37] <apokryphos> zircx: Debian-based systems have one of the very best ways for solving build dependencies, trust me :)
[02:37] <Nangisan> monokrome, I've tried GIMP, photoshop, fireworks..
[02:37] <ubuntu> edgy is on sdb2
[02:37] <apokryphos> zircx: uncomment the deb-src lines in that file and then sudo apt-get update, and re-run the build-dep command
[02:38] <ubuntu> sdb1 is ntfs partition
[02:38] <monokrome> <img src="image.jpg" style="opacity: 0.8" />
[02:38] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos simply nothing, the screen gets freezed just after logging and just before showing up the screen "loading nautilus, etc" and I can't see the desktop
[02:38] <monokrome> 1 is fully opaque, 0 is invisible.
[02:38] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: does it go to a terminal session if you type ctrl+alt+f1
[02:38] <ubuntu> It would also help, just to be able to boot windows..
[02:38] <kuja> maghat: Yep it uses DDR 400, awesome
[02:38] <DreamerHxC> yes
[02:38] <kuja> Now I just need to get paid :)
[02:38] <DreamerHxC> i can do it or ctrl + alt +f1
[02:38] <zircx> apokryphos, I'm still finding out about debian package handling, obviously lol..
[02:39] <monokrome> kuja: You ever idle in a channel called wavelength?
[02:39] <RadicalDreamer> soundray: I tried, but it says "bash: CLASSPATH: command not found".
[02:39] <in4mer> sup
[02:39] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: ok, try killing gdm now with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, and then hit 'startx'
[02:39] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: as user
[02:39] <DreamerHxC> i tried to dpkhg-reconfigure, I tried to edit xorg.conf, etc
[02:39] <Nangisan> monokrome, that little tag in the html will make the image transparent?
[02:39] <DreamerHxC> ok
[02:39] <kuja> monokrome: Nope
[02:39] <zircx> well what the  hell do you know..
[02:39] <maghat> kuja: great!
[02:39] <monokrome> Nangisan: Yeah, it will.
[02:39] <zircx> that was far too easy..
[02:39] <apokryphos> =)
[02:39] <ubuntu> pls anyone..
[02:39] <kuja> maghat: Yep, I really appreciate the help. Thanks again :)
[02:39] <Nangisan> monokrome, does the image have to be saved as a gif first, or can JPEG's be used as well
[02:39] <maghat> Nangisan: probably not. Read this: http://digg.com/design/CSS_Image_Transparency_for_IE,_Mozilla_and_Safari
[02:39] <monokrome> Nangisan: 0.8 will make it 80% visible
[02:40] <monokrome> Nangisan: Anything can be used. You can even do it to DIV tags.
[02:40] <RadicalDreamer> Quinn_Storm: Here's the text. Seems proper to me. PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/bin
[02:40] <RadicalDreamer> JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun
[02:40] <RadicalDreamer> CLASSPATH =/www.web3d.org/x3d/content
[02:40] <RadicalDreamer> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib
[02:40] <RadicalDreamer> export PATH JAVA_HOME CLASSPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
[02:40] <zircx> great stuff apokryphos thanks very much for your help..
[02:40] <apokryphos> ubuntu: what's the problem? Not a good idea to use enter as punctuation in a huge channel like this :)
[02:40] <in4mer> investigating
[02:40] <apokryphos> RadiantFire: no pasting in here please

[02:40] <Nangisan> maghat, thanks for the great link.
[02:41] <maghat> kuja: ur welcome and good luck :)
[02:41] <ubuntu> Iok
[02:41] <Quinn_Storm> RadicalDreamer: does look good, not sure what to say there
[02:41] <ubuntu> so there are 2 SATAs
[02:41] <ubuntu> edgy is on sdb2
[02:42] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos no error, just the desktop is a grey squared screen
[02:42] <ubuntu> so
[02:42] <maghat> Nangisan: I never tried this, but I guess it can be done. You should probably test it with IE 7 though, I've had some problems recently concerning the new IE version and CSS
[02:42] <DreamerHxC> and the mouse cursor is a cross
[02:42] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: what card do you  have?
[02:42] <runpain> thanks i figured it out
[02:42] <azcazandco> anyone fancy helping me get ati drivers & xgl / beryl installed properly?  I just installed a fresh copy of Edgy and want to make sure I get it right
[02:42] <kuja> maghat: I wouldn't be a sucker if I went with the cheapest memory, right? :P
[02:42] <ubuntu> I wrote it once!
[02:42] <DreamerHxC> nvidia geforce fx5200
[02:42] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: and what version of ubuntu?
[02:42] <DreamerHxC> but i tried with ati radeon 9550 and i got the same
[02:42] <soundray> RadicalDreamer: you mustn't paste here. Get rid of the space after CLASSPATH
[02:43] <runpain> had to check box in logon to enable admin log in
[02:43] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: ok, with the nvidia card -- try installing the nvidia drivers (/msg ubotu nvidia) and try startx again
[02:43] <runpain> DAAAAAAAH
[02:43] <azcazandco> !ati
[02:43] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos it has appeared a grey square in the top left corner of the screen, but I still can't do nothing
[02:43] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:43] <urmom> i need some help
[02:43] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos I already tried

[02:43] <apokryphos> runpain: it's not a good idea to ignore half of the advice in the channel :)
[02:43] <urmom> i have an ibook g4 running ubuntu, how can i get java?
[02:44] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: startx gives you the exact same thing, are you sure?
[02:44] <azcazandco> me just figured out how to help himself lol
[02:44] <runpain> listen all i am using it for is my Bible programs
[02:44] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: also, what about the other details?
[02:44] <ubuntu> how can I start grub?
[02:44] <sal> Heya
[02:44] <ubuntu> it not loading
[02:44] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos what details?
[02:44] <urmom> can someone help me?
[02:44] <ubuntu> so I need to use desktop CD
[02:45] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: and what version of ubuntu?
[02:45] <RadicalDreamer> soundray: It really worked! I am so stupid!
[02:45] <DreamerHxC> I have an mobo with nforce2, by the way Im in text mode, I can't boot in graphic.
[02:45] <DreamerHxC> edgy eft
[02:45] <mamzers555> the latest wpasupplicant update breaks network-manager-gnome, where should i post this?
[02:45] <DreamerHxC> by the way, sometimes it has booted correctly in graphic but when I reboot...I get the same
[02:45] <wijnand> "text mode"
[02:45] <maghat> kuja: I'd go for the cheapest memory. That's why Im using Kingston on my main rig, because it was the same price as the no branded memory.
[02:46] <RadicalDreamer> Thank you, boys!
[02:46] <kuja> maghat: And it's been working great?
[02:46] <maghat> kuja: memory doesn't work "great", either it does or it doesn't work at all ;)
[02:47] <kuja> maghat: Good point
[02:47] <sal> Is there someone who could help me with an, albeit probably stupid question? I just installed Ubuntu yesterday and fixed my video card issues and all that, but there's one thing that aught to be simple that I can't figure out, how do I access my hard drives, I mean, besides the "filesystem"? Cause I have other partitions on this drive (not an winxp drive, but it is NTSF) and it has all my music and videos on it, but I can't figure out to access it,
[02:47] <sal> lol
[02:47] <ubuntu> how to uninstall not working edgy?
[02:47] <kuja> maghat: I was thinking maybe one would have a shorter lifetime
[02:47] <runpain> im using windows whilest i am Xchat :P
[02:47] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos any idea?
[02:47] <TLE> Ati binary drivers. Some guides tell me that if I have trouble geting the binary drivers to work properly I should disable dri in xorg.conf. But does that mean that I should remove it in the modules section or that I should remove the section called DRI or both ?
[02:47] <azcazandco> would I be right in saying I dont need to install ati drivers with edgy?
[02:47] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: ok, did you upgrade?
[02:48] <ubuntu> sal: mount --help
[02:48] <apokryphos> azcazandco: for what? Just running it? Yup.
[02:48] <DreamerHxC> no, fresh installatio
[02:48] <TLE> sal: have you checked if they are already mounted in the /media or /mnt folders ?
[02:48] <DreamerHxC> I had to do it with alternate CD because i can't see live cd desktop neither
[02:48] <azcazandco> apokryphos: I wanna get compiz / beryl type stuff running
[02:48] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: ok, curious. Could you startx with the nvidia drivers, then ctrl+alt+backspace when things muck up, and pastebin me the output
[02:48] <sal> There's a floppy drive and cd in my media folder
[02:48] <azcazandco> I am running at high 1600 x 1200 just now so I am assuming my card is okay
[02:48] <apokryphos> ubotu: beryl | azcazandco
[02:48] <ubotu> azcazandco: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[02:49] <sal> and my mnt folder is empty
[02:49] <maghat> kuja: it can have a short lifetime, even if it's branded. The greatest hazard is cosmic radiation from the Sun hitting your memory chip. Really.
[02:49] <kuja> maghat: My room has no windows (pun intended), and I'm proud :)
[02:49] <azcazandco> apokryphos: so I just need to that part and not install ati drivers?
[02:49] <apokryphos> azcazandco: and get help in -xgl, yes :)
[02:49] <azcazandco> ok
[02:50] <DreamerHxC> apokryphos coultd not init font path element /usr/share/fonts/X11/TTf
[02:50] <kuja> maghat: Hey, sorry to bug ya with a lot of hardware questions in an Ubuntu channel, but I'm reading a site that says my motherboard is compatible with P4 and Celeron processors. Does that mean any Pentium 4 is supported?
[02:50] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: I'm sure there's more than that. Could you pastebin it all?
[02:50] <soundray> sal: what filesystems do you have on your data partitions?
[02:50] <maghat> kuja: beware, cosmic radiation can travel through earth itself like a knife through hot butter. It basically goes through anything ;)
[02:50] <TLE> sal: ok then they need to mounted, (they will be readonly though) 2 sek I'll find the info for you
[02:50] <DreamerHxC> Can I paste you last lines?
[02:51] <DreamerHxC> because im writing this in my laptop and we're trying to fix my computer, not the laptop
[02:51] <sal> The filesystem is NTSF
[02:51] <urmom> how can i get compiz to work?
[02:51] <apokryphos> DreamerHxC: ok, but make sure you note any part that says Error or E. Paste in #flood
[02:51] <urmom> it worked with fedora :(

[02:52] <Morrissey> Hi, when show my fglrxinfo, it shows. "OpenGL version string: 1.3.1091 (X4.3.0-8.28.8)", usually people  have version 2.00 ... glxgears work great, but since beryl etc doesnt work I recon I dont have the proper composite ... has that anything to do with this? In advance, thank you
[02:52] <TLE> sal: please write my name if you wirte massages for me, otherwise I wont notice them
[02:53] <maghat> kuja: not likely. There are two "formats" of Celeron/P4 CPUs. Yours is probably compatible with the P4 CPUs that have the same format that your Celeron does. Check the motherboard manufacturer site, it must list the CPUs your motherboard supports.

[02:54] <nemeza1984> pls help

[02:56] <sal> ubotu: If it's unsafe I don't think i"ll risk it, I have a lot of stuff on there, but thanks!
[02:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about If it's unsafe I don't think i"ll risk it, I have a lot of stuff on there, but thanks! - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[02:58] <sal> Then another question, once I figure out how to access my NTSF volume at all where should I copy my music collection? lol you can't make new folders in the file system can you? right mouse> new folder doesn't exist lol
[02:58] <swanfl> in regards to fuse, is it unsafe to the linux partition or the windows partition?

[03:05] <etest> hi
[03:05] <Healot> nemeza1984: yes, you shall use it

[03:24] <ragamuffin> maghat:  Does Ubuntu take two gb disk space? or is it some earlier files of failed installation the cause of low diiskspace? I gave only 2 and a bit more  gb to ubuntu
[03:25] <the_mug> so if I want to upgrade from dapper to edgy I have to add the edgy sources to my sources.lst and  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ??
[03:25] <the_mug> is that all?
[03:25] <finalbeta> !upgrade
[03:25] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:25] <seraphim> ragamuffin: 2gb is the absolute minimum for a fresh install...
[03:25] <seraphim> ragamuffin: i think even 2.5
[03:26] <Morrissey> he following packages have unmet dependencies:  compiz: Depends: compiz-plugins (>= 0.2) but it is not going to be installed
[03:26] <ragamuffin> seraphim: So the only way is to repartition and fresh install?
[03:26] <seraphim> ragamuffin: my sys needs 4.7
[03:26] <codeRat> iturk: hmm, I would like to make a video of my desktop (ex. a video tutorial how to install something). So than "you" could watch the video as if you were looking at my comp
[03:26] <seraphim> ragamuffin: yep
[03:26] <iturk> the_mug: i recomend you to use dselect it will be more user friendly looks that the normal comands are sometimes difficult to remember
[03:26] <maghat> ragamuffin: I have just installed edgy and security updates, and it occupies exactly 2GB.  Add 1GB to be comfortable.
[03:27] <iturk> codeRat: ok so you are using ffmpg for that ??
[03:27] <rascharles>  Hi, I upgraded from breezy to edgy and now sudo is not working when I access items on the admin menu
[03:27] <codeRat> iturk: yes
[03:27] <maghat> ragamuffin: If you use the AMD64 bit version of ubuntu, it likely needs even more.
[03:27] <frogzoo> the_mug: I think for edgy just updating source is pretty much g'teed not to work
[03:27] <ragamuffin> maghat: now I see my mistake
[03:28] <ragamuffin> I wil do a fresh instal
[03:28] <ragamuffin> seraphim: I have also a problem with editng the grub. the instruction in the documention is cryptic to my eyes.
[03:28] <iturk> codeRat: well i only knoe ffmpg from mplayer codecs are you using some other specific application ??
[03:28] <rascharles> I'm not using ubuntu right now, but win2k3....I can't make my wireless card work w/o sudo working properly
[03:28] <vedos_> what's a good video playing program for Ubuntu which supports subtitles etc?
[03:28] <codeRat> iturk: no..it could be done with ffmpeg
[03:28] <vedos_> if it's mplayer why isn't it included in repositories?
[03:28] <codeRat> from the terminal
[03:28] <seraphim> ragamuffin: with a fresh install there should be no need to edit grub...
[03:28] <frogzoo> vedos_: gxine/vlc
[03:29] <maghat> ragamuffin: we all make them ;)
[03:29] <eladz> hi, can someone guide me howto install skype (or something) here?
[03:29] <eexp16> vedos_: it is. enable universe and multiverse repos.
[03:29] <rascharles> I get error about not having permissions to open/edit config files
[03:29] <ragamuffin> seraphim: I will need it any way, since I want to make XP default os
[03:29] <rascharles> Anyone encountered or fixed this?
[03:29] <codeRat> ffmpeg is included in the repositories, but I don't know what to put for grab video device so it would grap the video from the screen
[03:29] <frogzoo> eladz: ekiga ?
[03:29] <eladz> sorry i didn't understand
[03:29] <eexp16> vedos_: at least dapper has it. not sure about edgy.
[03:30] <eladz> im a newbie
[03:30] <maghat> eladz: google for automatix2 . It also allows you to install skype (plus a lot of other stuff).
[03:30] <seraphim> ragamuffin: then just edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and change the value of "default"
[03:30] <LjL> !automatix | maghat, eladz
[03:30] <ubotu> maghat, eladz: automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[03:30] <ragamuffin> seraphim:  I can't translate " default X_sequence" (in place of default   0).
[03:31] <maghat> ubotu: automatix sometimes fails, but it never breaked my system.
[03:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about automatix sometimes fails, but it never breaked my system. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:31] <ragamuffin> Have I to change defaul 0 to default 1 only?
[03:31] <eexp16> maghat: ubotu is a bot
[03:31] <LjL> !works for me | maghat
[03:31] <ubotu> maghat: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[03:31] <eladz> ok i just want to know how do i install things here
[03:31] <MsClock> yps!
[03:32] <ragamuffin> seraphim: only one line to be changed?
[03:32] <rascharles> Anyone else having problems with sudo after upgrading to edgy?
[03:32] <seraphim> ragamuffin: it should be default 2 i think...just count the entrys below, starting from 0 (0=normal, 1=save ubuntu, 2=win)
[03:32] <eladz> hi my connection disconnected
[03:32] <seraphim> if you have more kernels installed it will be 4 or 6 and so on
[03:33] <eladz> can any guide me how to install skype or something else?
[03:33] <vedos_> how about can someone recommend me a good audioplayer program for Linux?
[03:33] <seraphim> rascharles: you should have upgraded to dapper before you upgraded to edgy...
[03:33] <tbaur> out of interest
[03:33] <rascharles> Sorry, got names wrong...I was running dapper
[03:33] <eladz> i just want to learn how to install things here
[03:33] <rascharles> 6.01 right?
[03:33] <seraphim> vedos_: amarok
[03:34] <maghat> ubotu, eladz: I can *suggest* automatix, only based on my experience. eladz is free to try it, at his own risk. If it works for him then great.
[03:34] <rascharles> and edgy is 6.10 correct?
[03:34] <seraphim> rascharles: yes.
[03:34] <seraphim> so...no idea, here it was fine :/
[03:34] <rascharles> seraphim: thanks anyway
[03:34] <LjL> maghat: actually, i have to tell you that you really should *not* recommend automatix in here... i'm sorry, but there's been too many automatix-broken systems to deal with
[03:35] <eexp16> eladz: for installing software use synaptic. should be in your desktop menu.
=== pzn is now known as pzn-lunch
[03:35] <maghat> btw, based on my experience, upgrading your OS is generally a bad idea, be it Windows or Linux. Take the time to save your personal data, then do a fresh install. Just my opinion, of course.
[03:36] <maghat> LjL, I didn't know that.
[03:36] <rascharles> maghat: that has been one of the beauties of using Debian and Debian based distros for me...normally painless dist-upgrades

[03:37] <Duesentrieb> hi all
[03:37] <Duesentrieb> can anyone tell me how the modprobe.d config works?
[03:37] <Duesentrieb> i'm trying to fix sound on my box, and got instructions what to ad to modprobe.conf
[03:37] <Duesentrieb> but that does not exist under ubuntu
[03:38] <seraphim> rascharles: you could boot into save mode and have a look at /etc/sudoers and search the line %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> i'm at a loss as to where to add module options for the sound driver...
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> modprobe.d/options, perhaps? but how?
[03:38] <eexp16> Duesentrieb: there is a manpage for modprobe.d
[03:38] <maghat> rascharles: I have upgraded to Edgy beta from dapper that way, and it worked great. Still, I didn't feel comfortable enough, and reinstalled just a couple of hours ago ;)
[03:38] <eladz> how do i add more packages to there?
[03:38] <ken> Namaste, I have got some basic Ubuntu questions, may i ask?
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> eeboy: heh - tnx, should have checked that :P
[03:38] <eladz> skype doesn't appear there
[03:39] <rascharles> seraphim: my userid is part of the admin group in /etc/groups and I looked at the admin line in sudoers
[03:39] <seraphim> maghat: this sys here was a breezy once ;)
[03:39] <eexp16> eladz: sure. skype is unfree software. try ekiga instead.
[03:39] <maghat> seraphim: no reinstalls ??? :|
[03:39] <seraphim> rascharles: mh, well, then i got absolutely no idea and would recommend a fresh install
[03:40] <rascharles> maghat: guess I'll save my $HOME and reinstall
[03:40] <ken> Can someone please help me with basic Ubuntu questions, i installed it and can't boot it, May i ask the detailed question (if someone is interested than only i should go through the effort)
[03:40] <seraphim> maghat: no, was no need for ;)
[03:40] <eladz>  it doesn't appear there either
[03:40] <blisz> hello
[03:40] <maghat> rascharles: I would try that too
[03:40] <robbb> hi, i've downloaded the ubuntu server cd to do a rescue on my linux system but it doesnt appear to have any bootloader tools on it, nor does it have ssh or ftp, is there any other way i may be able to use it to fix my system?
[03:40] <eexp16> eladz: did you enable all repositories? (universe, multiverse)
[03:40] <ken> No-one?
[03:41] <eladz> i think not, how do i do that?
[03:41] <eexp16> !repositories
[03:41] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:41] <maghat> ken: dont ask to ask a question, just ask the question ;)
[03:42] <eexp16> eladz: read ubotu said
[03:43] <lucien> !EasySource
[03:43] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[03:43] <lucien> nice :-)
[03:45] <eladz> its very complicated, ill try anyway
[03:45] <maghat> eladz: try this link : http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-deb
[03:46] <maghat> eladz: I just installed skype. It seems to work too ;)
[03:46] <eladz> how do you install the deb file?
[03:46] <eexp16> maghat: eladz has to learn about repositories anyway
[03:46] <maghat> so, skype debian package works on Edgy without any dependencies. Sweet.
[03:47] <maghat> open it with firefox's default option
[03:47] <eexp16> eladz: you can install a .deb file with: sudo dpkg -i filename.deb

[03:47] <maghat> eexp16 there's a gui tool for that now ;)

[03:49] <maghat> eexp16: eladz has a problem. I'd rather give him a straight answer ;)
[03:49] <Vegeta^> When I play a video file, there is no sound. It's not because of lack of codec, since I had sound before. And I can hear system notification sounds. How can I fix this?
[03:49] <eexp16> eladz: exit synaptic first
[03:49] <tonyyarusso> eladz: Clost synaptic
[03:49] <maghat> eladz, check if you don't have an open synaptic window
[03:49] <maghat> eexp16: lol :)
[03:49] <eexp16> maghat: a dpkg commandline IS a straight answer
[03:49] <Rarj> How can I edit the headings of the Gnome menu ?
[03:50] <eladz>  skype depends on libqt3-mt | libqt3c102-mt (>= 3:3.3.3.2); however:
[03:50] <eladz>   Package libqt3-mt is not installed.
[03:50] <eladz>   Package libqt3c102-mt is not installed.
[03:50] <incorrect> i used to be able to use rdesktop to cut and paste between my location machine and the remote
[03:50] <maghat> eexp16: yes, i agree, but learning about repositories isn't. BTW the new synaptic version hides repository info as much as it can
[03:50] <eexp16> maghat: so no dependencies, eh?
[03:50] <incorrect> why would it not work anymore?
[03:50] <eexp16> maghat: thats why i stick to dapper
[03:51] <eladz> how can i fix these errors>
[03:51] <maghat> eexp16: no dependencies on a fresh install of EDGY
[03:51] <Kane274> so does anyone know how to add that hd :) ?
[03:51] <eexp16> maghat: maybe kubuntu egdy, not ubuntu
[03:51] <maghat> UBUNTU edgy.
[03:52] <eexp16> maghat: or is libqt also included in ubuntu?
[03:52] <Rarj> How can I edit the headings of the Gnome menu ?
[03:52] <Lelop> what means to compile something ?
[03:52] <maghat> I dont know. I downloaded the deb firefox offered to install it and it just worked.
[03:52] <tijn> huh
[03:52] <tijn> are portscans considred illegal?
[03:53] <Kane274> Lelop: compiling something is when you have the code and you need to make it work with the system. you compile the code so the system understands it :)
[03:53] <Kane274> if it isn't compiled the code is useless
[03:53] <maghat> I never could get skype to work on dapper btw
[03:53] <Lelop> Kane274: thank you
[03:54] <ataq> maghat: what problems had you?
[03:54] <Lelop> Kane274: do you know a site where can i read more about this ? .. about linux and all this stuff
[03:54] <eladz> how can i fix these errors>Selecting previously deselected package skype.

[03:55] <eladz> ok sorry
[03:55] <maghat> ataq the same eladz has now, but when I forced the installation of the qt libs, skype started but it never connected properly
[03:55] <ataq> search debian package database for libqt if its not in the repo's
[03:55] <maghat> eladz what version of ubuntu are you using?
[03:55] <ataq> Did ye try apt get?
[03:55] <eladz> xubuntu
[03:55] <ataq> dapper?
[03:55] <jeficebeam> im new to linux and i would like develope programs and web applications. what programming laguage should i study?
[03:55] <ataq> edgy?
[03:56] <maghat> yes eladz, dapper or edgy?
[03:56] <Kane274> Lelop: if you are planning to instal ubuntu edgy eft check out this site --> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[03:56] <vedos_> jeficebeam: try Python and Java
[03:56] <eladz> the older one..
[03:56] <maghat> so ubuntu edgy's firefox offers to install downloaded debs. sweeet!
[03:57] <dawkirst> Hello. My Ubunut (a fresh installation) hangs after a few hours? Any leading indicators to what my cause this?
[03:57] <MsClock> <jeficebeam> im new to linux and i would like develope programs and web applications. what programming laguage should i study?
[03:57] <Lelop> Kane274: i am using ubuntu edgy :)
[03:57] <MsClock> PHP, Mysql
[03:57] <MsClock> Python is an easy language
[03:57] <MsClock> Java is portable so it's probably the best to use in Linux if you want lots of people to use your programs
[03:57] <MsClock> It's also quite slow
[03:57] <ataq> maghat: http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/download.pl?arch=i386&file=pool%2Fmain%2Fq%2Fqt-x11-free%2Flibqt3-mt_3.3.7-1_i386.deb&md5sum=2c221ccf49a694b5bffd046d763f48e3&arch=i386&type=main
[03:57] <maghat> MySQL sux :p
[03:57] <MsClock> unfortunately
[03:57] <Kane274> Lelop: ah ok :) well that site is awesome to start with. what are you trying to compile ?
[03:57] <ataq> maghat: thats the package
[03:57] <MsClock> What should he use instead then?
[03:57] <MsClock> Yes, LAMP
[03:57] <MsClock> or WAMP
[03:57] <MsClock> Which is funnier
[03:57] <MsClock> I WAMP you!!!
[03:58] <MsClock> I WAMPed my server today.
[03:58] <Lelop> Kane274: well, this is the prob, i am not trying to compile nothing, just i want to know what is that :)
[03:58] <MsClock> <dawkirst> Hello. My Ubunut (a fresh installation) hangs after a few hours? Any leading indicators to what my cause this?
[03:58] <MsClock> Your Ubu Nut?
[03:58] <MsClock> Your Nut is hanging?
[03:58] <MsClock> Hmm
[03:58] <ataq> MySql is class! My fav!
[03:58] <MsClock> I'd see a doctor
[03:58] <maghat> use PostgreSQL any day of the week ;)
[03:58] <dawkirst> lol
[03:58] <dawkirst> Pretty much yeah ;)
[03:59] <dawkirst> Retry: my Ubuntu (a fresh installation) hangs after a few hours? Any leading indicators to what my cause this?
[03:59] <jeficebeam> ok.. actually, im already started studying php but my friend told me JSP is better to php. my other friend suggest python.
[03:59] <ataq> PostgreSQL won Linux Journel Editor choice database of the year. . .
[04:00] <eexp16> eladz: so you have ubuntu dapper?
[04:00] <ProN00b> jeficebeam, you and both of your friends are horribly misguided and wrong
[04:00] <ataq> maghat: did you try that?
[04:00] <ProN00b> jeficebeam, perl is the only real choice
[04:00] <maghat> JSP is not better, mostly it is just a lot more complicated :p
[04:00] <eladz> i guess, i downloaded the older version because it said it has support
[04:00] <dawkirst> So anyone knows why Ubunutu may hang?
[04:00] <maghat> eladz: upgrade to edgy and you should solve your problem.
[04:01] <ataq> eladz: oh ya the LTS?
[04:01] <eexp16> eladz: both have support, but the older has long term support
[04:01] <eladz> k, i don't want to update now
[04:01] <eexp16> eladz: cat /etc/issue
[04:01] <ataq> eladz: I dont really like edgy too much anyway. the promises of XGL out of the box that failed turned me back top fedora
[04:01] <Kane274> Lelop: well if you need to know what compiling is, it is just turning program code into an executable file/program. there isn't much more to compiling in general. but of course there are different languages that you can compile, like c, c++ etc. so if you wanna learn more about compiling you should try googeling for compiling c, howto compile c etc.
[04:02] <maghat> eladz: unless you are running a server you can upgrade to newer version without too much worry.
[04:02] <yokomo> I just installed 6.10 and I have a intel pro wireless 3945 card, I am having trouble with network-manager-gnome... it installs, but I can't seem to find it now
[04:02] <maghat> ataq: fc6 is very nice.
[04:02] <eladz> Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS \n \l
[04:02] <maghat> ataq: too bad wireless support basically sucks
[04:03] <ataq> maghat: Ya I fell in love with it. I left after RH9 and now its good to be home!
[04:03] <Luci3n> yokomo where have you looked
[04:03] <ataq> maghat: Drivers full stop!
[04:03] <yokomo> in the wiki
[04:03] <patrick_king> i need big help 1. Connect a ubuntu workstation to a windows 2003 domain.
[04:03] <patrick_king> 2. Get user profiles from the windows 2003 server. (even if this means creating linux profiles on the windows server)
[04:03] <yokomo> oh, on my system? in the applications
[04:03] <patrick_king> 3. Mount /home to users area on the windows 2003 domain server.
[04:03] <patrick_king> 4. also be able to connect to the internet via a proxy server.
[04:03] <patrick_king> sorry for spam
[04:03] <DreamerHxC> hello all
[04:03] <yokomo> and in system
[04:03] <eexp16> eladz: okay. do this: sudo apt-get install libqt-mt
[04:03] <michaelpo> i got ubuntu cd from shipit... thank you very much... but my 3 yr old compaq presario 2819ap cannot even bootup....
[04:03] <jeficebeam> ah.. ok. what is the advantage of perl with python? can i also use it for developing webpages?
[04:03] <ataq> maghat: I got my Ralink 2500 to finally work under FC6
[04:04] <DreamerHxC> what can I do when I fglxinfo and it says error: unable to open display (null)?
[04:04] <Slart> Is anyone here using wine on Ubuntu 6.10 64bit? I'm having trouble compiling it and I could use some help
[04:04] <Luci3n> yokomo have you installed ndiswrapper
[04:04] <maghat> perl is ugly :p
[04:04] <michaelpo> i got ubuntu cd from shipit... thank you very much... but my 3 yr old compaq presario 2819ap cannot even bootup.... any advise? help.. thanks...
[04:04] <Kane274> Lelop: it's just that compiling is very different regarding the program language you use, you can use different options compiling a code. most of the time when compiling the code is being scanned and checked for errors you made :) then tells you why it didnt compile. read the info on this site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler
[04:04] <maghat> python is slow :p
[04:04] <maghat> no language is perfect :)
[04:04] <ataq> michael: check bios boot settings
[04:04] <Lelop> Kane274: ok, so by the way, I want to start to develop programs but i dont know what language i can use. i dont know nothing about it.
[04:04] <maghat> except C of course :D
[04:04] <patrick_king> anyone know where i can start off
[04:04] <yokomo> Luci3n: no, because the wireless card is working right now
[04:04] <Slart> michaelpo: it just stops after "booting kernel"? if so, try to disconnect any external dvd/cd drives etc.. worked for me
[04:05] <eladz> E: Couldn't find package libqt-mt
[04:05] <michaelpo> what is there to check in the bios? the boot sequence?
[04:05] <dawkirst> So. Anyone knows why Ubunutu may hang?
[04:05] <Luci3n> yokomo it should apear as an icon where the software updates are
[04:05] <yokomo> Luci3n: nothing there
[04:05] <maghat> eladz: I tried and retried to install skype on dapper and never succeded making it work.
[04:05] <ataq> michaelpro: ya, you said dont even boot?
[04:05] <agent> is it possible to have a places panel entry only (ala "main menu") in gnome?
[04:05] <yokomo> Luci3n: synaptic shows it as installed
=== Deep__ is now known as Deep
[04:05] <Luci3n> yokomo also system > admin > netowk ...
[04:05] <eexp16> eladz: sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt
[04:05] <ataq> michaelpro: or have you already installed?
=== visualstation is now known as Grominet
[04:05] <DreamerHxC> what can I do when I fglxinfo and it says error: unable to open display (null)? I have an ATI
[04:06] <yokomo> Luci3n: not listed
[04:06] <Kane274> Lelop: well if you want to start developing software you should check out c++ or java. depending where the programm should eventually be run on... a great start to learn programming though is making websites with php (scripting language)
[04:06] <eladz> Package libqt3-mt is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[04:06] <Luci3n> yokomo maybe you should reinstall and if that fails trya reboot
[04:06] <maghat> eladz: so if you really need skyp I'd suggest using the newer ubuntu version. Or installing fedora core 6, it works beautifully there too.
[04:07] <MarciuxG> will firestarter help me to share internet for other computer?
[04:07] <eladz> E: Package libqt3-mt has no installation candidate
[04:07] <MarciuxG> will firestarter help me to share internet for other computer?
[04:07] <eexp16> eladz: fix your repositories
[04:07] <Kane274> Lelop: there you can see results right on the website and php is now object oriented programming (like c++ or java) :)
[04:07] <ataq> eladz: is that apt-get your using
[04:07] <ProN00b> MarciuxG, why not try ?
[04:07] <yokomo> Luci3n: I tried reinstalling in synaptic and rebooting
[04:07] <Lelop> Kane274: i think that c++ is to hard for a newbie..
[04:07] <rogue780> !ivtv
[04:07] <ubotu> IVTV can be installed on Edgy by following the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Install_IVTV_Edgy
[04:07] <yokomo> nothing shows
[04:07] <eladz> yes
[04:07] <jeficebeam> ok.. what do i need to start developing using c++ in ubuntu?
[04:07] <maghat> Lelop: Try python too. It's very elegant and easy to learn. And cross-platform too.
[04:07] <eladz> i wrote what eexp16 wrote
[04:07] <mrbond82> Is there any other alternative to ddclient for ubuntu? my ddclient doesnt' seem to work
[04:07] <michaelpo> i got ubuntu cd from shipit... thank you very much... but my 3 yr old compaq presario 2819ap laptop cannot even bootup in livecd.... pentium 4m.. 768mb ram.. iit give error messages halfway booting up... the laptop come with detachable cdrom drive... not external... if i remove the cdrom drive, what cd drive do i use to boot the livecd?
[04:07] <Luci3n> yoykomo try installing ndiswrapper utils
[04:07] <ataq> eladz: download the deb from http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/download.pl?arch=i386&file=pool%2Fmain%2Fq%2Fqt-x11-free%2Flibqt3-mt_3.3.7-1_i386.deb&md5sum=2c221ccf49a694b5bffd046d763f48e3&arch=i386&type=main
[04:07] <MarciuxG> or it is more easy thing to share internet?
[04:08] <agent> jeficebeam: an editor and a compiler (gcc)
[04:08] <ataq> eladz: and itsall that
[04:08] <Slart> Lelop, why not try python for a start.. pretty easy and well behaved..
[04:08] <Lelop> maghat: thanks guys, I'll search more about those languages
[04:08] <Lelop> ok
[04:08] <Kane274> Lelop: yeah python is nice too and so is c :) well hf
[04:08] <Lelop> hehe, thanks
[04:08] <maghat> Lelop: check out mono too.
[04:08] <yokomo> Luci3n: ok, installed
[04:08] <ProN00b> wow, whats with all the loosers in here suggesting php and python ?
[04:08] <Lelop> ok
[04:08] <ataq> eladz: did you do that?
[04:08] <Slart> michaelpo: good question.. I had an internal drive to boot from...I dont have any good ideas for your problem, sorry
[04:09] <DreamerHxC> what can I do when I fglxinfo and it says error: unable to open display (null)? I have an ATI
[04:09] <agent> jeficebeam: get package build-essential for the compilers
[04:09] <Luci3n> yokomo can you see the package now
[04:09] <yokomo> Luci3n: in synaptic?
[04:09] <eladz> tells me something about libaudio
[04:09] <ProN00b> maghat, why would you suggest mono to anyone, faghat ?
[04:09] <Slart> ProN00b: what's wrong with python as a first language?
[04:09] <Luci3n> yokomo no on the menu
[04:09] <ataq> faghat lol
[04:09] <yokomo> Luci3n: no
[04:09] <Lelop> so, do i have to buy the book with python ? and the cd of course
[04:10] <Luci3n> yokomo sorry im not sure what's wrong
[04:10] <ataq> eladz: what does it say?
[04:10] <ProN00b> Slart, its a really bad start
[04:10] <eladz> i can't copy because it's a lot of lines
[04:10] <michaelpo> sorry... it is swappable cdrom drive with diskette drive... its internal.. not external...
[04:11] <eladz>   Package libaudio2 is not installed.
[04:11] <ataq> eladz: roughly tell me what it says
[04:11] <ProN00b> Slart, almost as bad as starting with brainfuck or cobol or some other faggy language using whitespaces as syntax elements
[04:11] <ataq> then sudo apt-get that
[04:11] <maghat> ProNoob, because I program for a living, and Mono is *good*. And so is Python and .NET . And I also suggest you grow up.
[04:11] <Slart> ProN00b: why? no strict type-checking? whitespace?
[04:11] <ataq> eladz: you see you have to get all the package dependancies. use that site I gave you, if its not in the repos
[04:11] <ProN00b> Lelop, sudo apt-get install perl and you will have everything you ever need
[04:11] <eladz> how do i send you a private msg>
[04:12] <maghat> eladz: install the newer ubuntu, you will get it working faster, and time is money...
[04:12] <eladz> how do i do that?
[04:12] <maghat> perl? LOL
=== Grominet is now known as VisualStation|HD
[04:12] <ataq> eladz: Its roughly the same, I mean you'll still have dependacy problems
[04:12] <eladz> without downloading the iso and etc
[04:12] <osfameron> perl LOL?
[04:12] <eladz> ok
[04:12] <A[D] minS> how i can mount usb Memory Reader ?
[04:12] <eladz> so is there any package that has it all?
[04:13] <eladz> or something like that?
[04:13] <ataq> eladz: did you try sudo apt-get install libaudio2?
[04:13] <osfameron> I'm sure python and ruby rock also, but perl isn't quite ready to lol over just yet
[04:13] <damnandy> good morning
[04:13] <maghat> perl is fine... tcl is fine too. I like tcl. I like perl... Good old  languages.
[04:13] <A[D] minS> !mount usb
[04:13] <eladz> it gives me an error

[04:13] <DreamerHxC> what can I do when I fglxinfo and it says error: unable to open display (null)? I have an ATI
[04:13] <dawkirst> So. Anyone knows why Ubunutu may hang?
[04:13] <eladz> E: Package libaudio2 has no installation candidate
[04:13] <Slart> are there any good java development tools for linux? just asking.. never really looked
[04:13] <eladz> this is really annoying
[04:14] <ataq> eladz: when you try to apt-get it? ok try "sudo apt-get -f install"
[04:14] <ProN00b> osfameron, i bet they look trendy in your resume (python and ruby), right next to your krad ajax, xml and other web2.0 skillz
[04:14] <helgedk> I'm running Ubuntu 6.10 Server
[04:14] <osfameron> maghat: heh, s'pose.  Though perl is getting a *lot* more development than tcl these days
[04:14] <damnandy> i am not sure if i am in the right place for this question but here it goes...I am running dapper drake on a ppc and trying to run a webcam, I can get the driver loaded and it recognizes the webcam but i always get a black screen, I have had this run once for me before..can anybody help?
[04:14] <ProN00b> maghat, old doesn't matter
[04:14] <osfameron> ProN00b: python is older than perl iirc
[04:14] <helgedk> I tried reinstalling the e2fstools and stuff
[04:14] <ProN00b> osfameron, as i said, old doesn't matter
[04:14] <maghat> ProN00b, I'm 33 so I should know ;)
[04:15] <livingtm> I have a usb device that, when plugged in, shows up in lsusb... But the kernel modules dont get loaded and the firmware does not get downloaded. Anyone familiar with this system??
[04:15] <eladz> i don't know that to do, i'll return later, thanks for the help
[04:15] <eladz> bye
[04:16] <Juhaz> perl is -87, python is -90
[04:16] <ataq> eladz:g'luck
[04:16] <maghat> eladz: bye and goofd luck
[04:16] <eexp16> eladz, you are giving up much too fast
[04:16] <maghat> yeah, now you mention it perl definitely has that 80's something... hehe
[04:16] <ataq> eexp16: he'll reinstall xp now! lol
[04:16] <ProN00b> nobody ever heard of python before google bought it
[04:16] <eexp16> ataq: well, some people deserve it
[04:17] <Slart> so, noone here is using wine on ubuntu 6.10 64bit, AMD k8?
[04:17] <ataq> eexp16: haha ya lol!

[04:17] <dawkirst> So. Anyone knows why Ubunutu may hang?
[04:17] <maghat> Slart: Dual booting windows is less of an head-ache than using wine
[04:17] <ataq> hang? what way?
[04:18] <|_SpY_|> anybody knows how i can monitor my eth0 to know what is my current down/up ???
[04:18] <ArS3n1c0_W0rK> ok! ubotu!
[04:18] <Slart> maghat: mm.. I suppose so.... still I'd like to try it
[04:18] <ataq> maghat: F*** Dual boot! XP sucks, Just dont use windows progs!!
[04:18] <helgedk> Does anyone know of the ext3 problem? The journal keeps failing whenever I start copying files
[04:18] <helgedk> Everytime I do fsck some files are lost, and the error repeats itself
[04:18] <maghat> ataq: are you high? what about games???
[04:18] <ProN00b> dawkirst, yeah, its because you are *#!+~!! and you are lacking common sense... if you don't give any details how should we know why, ours doesn't hang
[04:18] <dawkirst> ataq, after a few hours it just freezes up. I suspect it's the screensaver: just read a thread about it.
[04:18] <helgedk> SpY: there's a little toolbar-plugin for your desktop
[04:19] <davey486> Has anyone tried feisty? What do you think?
[04:19] <helgedk> just right-click one of your panels
[04:19] <CoRnJuLiOx> does anyone here know if flash player 7 has a standalone projector for linux?
[04:19] <ProN00b> dawkirst, tried disabling it ?
[04:19] <maghat> ataq: You still need windows to get a proper development environment
[04:19] <ataq> maghat: I play ET:TCE, Doom3, Quake4! Linux!!
[04:19] <ProN00b> CoRnJuLiOx, why not use flash9 ?
[04:19] <Slart> ProN00b: did you pick underwear 2 sizes to small today? you seem kind of grumpy ;)
[04:19] <ProN00b> CoRnJuLiOx, i know flash 9 has a standalone projector
[04:19] <ataq> maghat: I program in C++ and I use Intel compilers!
[04:19] <maghat> ataq: and I think shooting games are braindead :p
[04:19] <ProN00b> Slart, lol whut ?
[04:19] <ataq> dawkirst: Disable screensaver and verify
[04:20] <helgedk> So noone knows of my problem? The errors start with [42955474.910000]  EXT3-fs error (device sda5): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - blocks from 81166339, length 1
[04:20] <ataq> maghat: ah! bad man!!! FPS rocks man
[04:20] <maghat> atak: I like Civilization 4, Neverwinter Nights 2, Elder Scrolls Oblivion...
[04:20] <dawkirst> ProN00b, thanks for that biography. No I did not try to disable it yet. I'm not in the near vacinity of the machine at the moment. Btw, I like your name -- it's choke full of common sense.
[04:20] <ProN00b> maghat, yeah, but how boring would your personal life be if you never did anything braindead ?
[04:20] <Slart> ProN00b: nothing.. you just seem kind of... grumpy "dawkirst, yeah, its because you are *#!+~!! and you are lacking common sense..." =)
[04:20] <ataq> maghat: oblivion is cool, played it in cedega before!
[04:20] <helgedk> there are also some [42955475.350000]  attempt to access beyond end of device
[04:21] <Jural> Having a issue with a fresh installation, X will only work when started from single user mode. started normally x freeze
[04:21] <maghat> ProN00b: ok I also play Call of Duty 2... but also for linux
[04:21] <ataq> ProN00b: I like your style!
[04:21] <helgedk> I could really use some help here.... reformating does not fix the problem
[04:21] <helgedk> There are no bad blocks on any of the devices
[04:21] <Jural> has anyone else seen this behaviour?
[04:21] <ProN00b> Slart, thats the first sentence which was intended to give more weight to the second, also he already pasted that sentence in here multiple times
[04:21] <ataq> maghat: Call of duty 2, cedega ya?
[04:21] <ProN00b> Slart, i sound different if i am grumpy, lol
[04:21] <_MMA_> Anyone having X crashing on them when trying to play games? ie: Quake4 or UT2004?
[04:21] <Slart> hehe.. ok.. just checking =)
[04:22] <ataq> _MMA_: Gammy Drivers?
[04:22] <ProN00b> ataq, thanks ^^
[04:22] <damnandy> anyone have any clue to what could be causing my webcam problem?
[04:22] <dawkirst> ProN00b, I did. But why didn't you reply the first time? Then I wouldn't have to paste it several times.
[04:23] <_MMA_> ataq: Gammy? Im usint the nVidia drivers from nVidia. I have a pretty new card. A 7900GT.
[04:23] <_MMA_> *using
[04:23] <ProN00b> dawkirst, because the first time i seen you already had pasted it twice, and spamming + lacking common sense was over the treshold
[04:23] <DanglyBits> anyone have broadcom 4306 wireless working on laptop?
[04:23] <ataq> _MMA_: Strange, maybe you might have the settings up too high and can't handle, although that card should not have a problem
[04:24] <davey486> how does cedega differ from wine?
[04:24] <ataq> cedega is speciffically for games and costs coinage
[04:24] <Slart> isn't cedega commercial?
[04:24] <ataq> yup
[04:24] <Kane274> can anyone help me mount my hd using the ubuntu server edition meaning no graphic help ;) ?
[04:24] <_MMA_> ataq: This is a TOTALLY fresh install. I launch UT2004 once and X crashes. No settings at all changed.
[04:24] <ataq> although winex is like cedega and free
[04:24] <davey486> isn't cedega wine with some extras?
[04:24] <dawkirst> ProN00b, you're a fart.
[04:25] <DreamerHxC> should be any problem if I have a motherboard with an AC97 and a sound blaster?
[04:25] <ProN00b> dawkirst, lol, and you lack common sense and are a spammer
[04:25] <ataq> _MMA_: I am not sure, i'd advise posting on ubuntu forums
[04:25] <_MMA_> ataq: -generic kernel
[04:25] <ProN00b> dawkirst, also, i think you are kinda childish for calling people names
[04:25] <Slart> _MMA_: perhaps you have to change graphics drivers? do some other voodoo with the x configuration
[04:25] <_MMA_> ataq: Yea... Ill see.
[04:25] <ataq> its not kernel anyways
[04:26] <_MMA_> ataq: Ill try the repo drivers.
[04:26] <ataq> prob a proplem with X, just dunno how to go about it
[04:26] <dawkirst> ProN00b, relax oh furious demeanor...that was meant as a social joke -- If I wanted to insult you I would've done better thatn "fart", believe you me.
[04:26] <iter> ugh
[04:26] <ataq> _MMA_: by the way, try running the game in the terminal, and that will say the output problem
[04:27] <_MMA_> I do. But it kills X and everything is gone. :)
[04:27] <ataq> _MMA_: F*** Repo driver. the nVidia ones are the best
[04:27] <_MMA_> Well I mean the nVidia drivers from the repo.
[04:27] <helgedk> It seems like my ext3 journals get killed when I write to one of the disks
[04:27] <ataq> try reconfiguring x "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" as su
[04:28] <ataq> _MMA_: type in terminal gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:28] <ProN00b> dawkirst, well, i was just judging from your pattern of behavior in here, sorry if thats not the real you
[04:28] <helgedk> The first few hundred megabytes are ok, but then it screws up and changes the drive to read-only
[04:28] <_MMA_> ataq: 8xxxx something from the repo. Im using 9629 from nVidia.
[04:28] <ataq> _MMA_: and check is driver nv or nvidia
[04:28] <ataq> 8774?
[04:29] <_MMA_> ataq: Im well versed in hacking my xorg. ;)
[04:29] <_MMA_> ataq: Yes, 8774 is the current repo driver.
[04:29] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[04:29] <ataq> _MMA_: sorry! try reconfigure, maybe resolution is stressing the display or something?
[04:30] <Slart> hmm.. can I use apt to download the newer driver from nvidia? or I have to compile it myself?
[04:30] <slipttees> !pastebot
[04:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pastebot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:30] <slipttees> !paste
[04:30] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:30] <ataq> Slart: you can get it through synaptic, yes
[04:31] <ataq> Slart: enable repo sources
[04:31] <Slart> ataq: ok.. I'll go look.. see what I can find.. brb
[04:31] <_MMA_> ataq: Cant be. I was running 1920x1200 on Dapper with 8xAA and 8xAF getting 40fps. The only new variable is Edgy and the 9629 from nVidia.
[04:31] <ataq> Slart: its in restricted I think . . .
[04:32] <helgedk> Now I reverted to an older kernel - I hope that will fix the filesystem problem
[04:32] <helgedk> Since noone replied yet, this is my best shot
[04:32] <yokomo> having some trouble with network-manager-gnome
[04:32] <ataq> helgedk: whats the prob?
[04:32] <yokomo> I have the package installed, I have my ipw 3945 working, I see nothing in the system tray for network manager
[04:33] <helgedk> the ext3 journal keeps corrupting whenever I write data on one of my new SATA drives (400gb)
[04:33] <dawkirst> ProN00b, you hit the nail on the head there. I'm actually a pretty likeable guy. And I an in awe at your abillity to judge people's common sense over a few lines of text so accurately! It's absolutely awesome - If you'd write a book, I'd buy it.
[04:33] <yokomo> in system->preferences-> sessions, I see nm-applet --sm-disable running
[04:33] <helgedk> after a minute or so it screws up and is remounted read-only
[04:34] <ataq> helgedk: My advise is, backup your stuff and reformat, because there is more to that than kernel anyways
[04:34] <playa_> Hi, i've got sound problems, master volume/channel in general don't work, though sound does. (I use ALSA 1.11 , onboard-sound, ATI-IXP, Ubuntu 6.10). I'm new to GNU/Linux
[04:34] <ataq> helgedk: do you hae permissions set to the files
[04:34] <yokomo> any ideas on how to get network-manager working properly?
[04:35] <Doow> playa_: could be that your master volume is set to the wrong device, rightclick it and choose preferences
[04:35] <rgg> hello,I downloaded an aMSN autopackage from...well,the amsn website.i changed the permissions and ran it,but i forgot to delete the old version of amsn from synaptic.so,it didn't install.then i deleted the old amsn and now it just won't run.
[04:35] <ataq> _MMA_: try the repo one just to see is there a difference, shouldnt be tho
[04:35] <helgedk> I tried reformating, even replaced the drive
[04:35] <DreamerHxC> my comp gets freezed just after logon screen and I get this with ATI and with nVIDIA videocards too, do u have any idea please?
[04:35] <rgg> nautilus is calling it a "script shell",i try to run it and it just doesn't,and when i run it on terminal,i get no "text" there,terminal opens and just closes right away.
[04:36] <ataq> rgg: unistall them and reinstall. . . .
[04:36] <helgedk> ok... but one of the drives is completely new
[04:36] <helgedk> I'm trying to do backup on that one, but it produces the same error as the old one
[04:36] <helgedk> yeah, some are root
[04:36] <helgedk> but I'm copying via root
[04:36] <helgedk> It also happens when writing new files
[04:36] <Doow> playa_: there's a console program called alsamixer that you could try also
[04:36] <rgg> ataq: uninstall what?
[04:36] <ProN00b> dawkirst, no, you misunderstood me there, that is exactly the problem, i can't judge you from those lines, and if you craft them like that i can do so even less but that doesn't really matter... what matters is how you behaved in here, even if that doesn not reflect your real chacter
[04:36] <ataq> rgg: aMSN. . . .
[04:36] <Slart> ataq: hmm.. how can I see what version the different packages install.. it's not in the description..
[04:36] <rgg> ataq: i've done that
[04:36] <rgg> ataq: read my message :)
[04:36] <ataq> Slart: Type in nVidia
[04:36] <_MMA_> ataq: I will. Right now its a choice between games and Beryl. :)
[04:36] <Doow> playa_: if I understood right that it's just your volume control that has no effect and your sound works otherwise
[04:36] <helgedk> I'm trying to copy the backup again now
[04:37] <playa_> Doow: it's set to ATI-IXP, thats correct afaik
[04:37] <ataq> Slart: delete .amsn and reinstall so
[04:37] <helgedk> same error!
[04:37] <helgedk> grrr
[04:37] <playa_> Doow: yes
[04:37] <helgedk> Ok, I'm lost now
[04:37] <ataq> _MMA_: Check out Fedora core 6, i moved for some probs, and everything just works! XGL perfect! Nvidia Sorted!
[04:38] <ataq> rgg: delete .amsn and reinstall so
[04:38] <playa_> Doow: In some progs with inbuilt sound control, i can change the output volume, but the Master Volume, etc does nothing...
[04:38] <yokomo> can anyone help me with network-manager?
[04:38] <rgg> ataq: no way :P

[04:39] <dawkirst> ProN00b, I guess you're right. I appologize for spamming (I'm new to this thing, and I don't know the channel policies, yet) and thank you for replying.
[04:39] <helgedk> Is there no option left but to use ext2 now?
[04:39] <ataq> _MMA_ I use edgy on my laptop, and I moved t FC6 for gaming and my server
[04:40] <rgg> ataq: contacts,smileys,logs,webcam logs...
[04:40] <Jural> I can only launch gdm or x from single user mode, when I start the system regular The screen blur's after a few seconds loading GDM, this also locks all terminals. GDM log reports a error not being able to open security policy file /usr/lib/xserver/SecurityPolicey <- this folder does not exist
[04:40] <_MMA_> ataq: What GFX driver on FC6?
[04:40] <ataq> rgg: well contacts will automatically be redownload by msn server.... and you can get the smileys again... and logs! who needs msn chat logs!
[04:41] <ProN00b> dawkirst, ok, so your box freezing only when you leave it alone (when the screensaver would normally kick in) ?
[04:41] <rgg> ataq: me :)
[04:41] <ataq> _MMA_ : its called mod-nvidia, its gr5eat, easy to install, just yum install mod-nvidia
[04:41] <wijnand> dawkirst: and here i was thinking common sense would get you by in the "channel policies" thing..
[04:41] <ataq> rgg: good luck getting running so! :)

[04:42] <Jural> help? anyone?
[04:43] <_MMA_> ataq: Nice.

[04:43] <GionnyBoss> I have just installed Samba... on Fedora Core I had a GUI to configure Samba in an easy way under System -> Amministration, but I can't see it here in Ubuntu... is there a package to install to have this feature?
[04:43] <ataq> _MMA_ : ubuntu is great but its not living up to certain promises thats why i left
[04:43] <wijnand> dawkirst: admitting it is the first step.
[04:44] <_MMA_> ataq: PM?
[04:44] <yokomo> so, no one can help me with network-manager?
[04:44] <woofer> help please!
[04:44] <GionnyBoss> hey gus, sorry... I think I found it on my own... there's a package xubuntu-system-tools :) ok sorry for asking withouth trying a little bit more on my own :P
[04:44] <DreamerHxC> what's the problem if I get when glxinfo: "Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display :0.0"???
[04:45] <woofer> Installer is not finding my hard disk
[04:45] <dawkirst> ProN00b, I will first try disabling the screensaver -- if the proplem prevails, I'll ask again ;)

[04:46] <helgedk> So I haven't been messing around. No crashes either
[04:46] <helgedk> It just suddenly stopped working.
[04:46] <helgedk> interesting... the copying is doing fine now!
[04:46] <helgedk> I omitted some directories
[04:46] <helgedk> no... now it crashed again :(

[04:48] <saimu0> ISSUE with a VIA video card,  anyone here can help?
[04:48] <yokomo> I installed edgy on my dell laptop with a ipw3945 and it works  out of the box, but I want to install network-manager-gnome and it doesn't seem to display in the system panel.  do I have to disable the native edgy support and use ndiswrapper to get around this or is there something else I could try?  I am a little lost and googling an answer just brings up people that got this working but now HOW they got it working.
[04:49] <iturk> hi there after i add a user using adduser -system ateos and then usermod -password xxxxx | then i cannot do login with this user why is that ?
[04:49] <Sobko> ahhhh ngantukk
[04:50] <dawkirst> Cheers guys. No hard feelings. Sorry about the lack of common sense and spamming.
[04:50] <bruenig> yokomo, from the network-manager-gnome description it appears to say that it will run in the tray.
[04:50] <yokomo> bruenig: correct, it is running however not displaying
[04:51] <bruenig> yokomo, you have a tray right?
[04:51] <iturk> any ideas about user creation in ubuntu ??
[04:51] <yokomo> in sessions, it is listed as nm-applet --sm-disable
[04:51] <LjL> iturk: specifically?
[04:51] <yokomo> bruenig: yes, I do have a tray
[04:51] <iturk> hi there after i add a user using adduser -system ateos and then usermod -password xxxxx | then i cannot do login with this user why is that ?
[04:51] <helgedk> is there anyone who have any idea how I can fix my ext3 filesystem problem? Any way to reinstall something that might be corrupting it? I already reinstalled e2fstools, e2fslibs and tried an older kernel. Any special parameters for mkfs.ext3 to make it work?It worked so far, but suddenly both of the 400gb SATA drives keeps failing.
[04:52] <bruenig> yokomo, right click on the panel. Go to add to panel, and then pick from that list of applets
[04:52] <wrzask_> helgedk, What kind of failure is that?
[04:53] <agent> is it possible to assign a shortcut to shutdown (not the logout menu)?
[04:53] <yokomo> bruenig: there isn
[04:53] <iturk> LjL: other think why is there a useradd and adduser command ??
[04:53] <yokomo> t a network-manager listed
[04:53] <helgedk> it looks like the ext3 journal get corrupted randomly when I write to the disk

[04:54] <inFw> Hello. I have acquired recently a laptop with an ATI x1600 graphics board. I'm using edgy and would like to know how to install the required drivers. Would someone please point me to some howto or something? (ps - my goal is to eventually install xgl, I've heard there are some conflicts with some drivers?)
[04:54] <helgedk> wrzask_: In dmesg it starts with this error: [42951343.870000]  EXT3-fs error (device sda5): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - blocks from 80183299, length 1

[04:54] <LjL> iturk: "su - ateos" from another user
[04:55] <LjL> iturk: if you actually want to login, and use it as a normal user, i don't think you should create a system user
[04:55] <LjL> iturk: create a regular user instead
[04:55] <helgedk> I would really like journaling on my filesystem, as it takes AGES to do an fsck if the system crashes (e.g. during power shortages)
[04:55] <iturk> LjL: hmmm so i would like to create a user that can also uses su command to have root privileges is that possible ??
[04:55] <LjL> iturk: what's wrong with using sudo?
[04:56] <helgedk> But ext3 just wont work
[04:56] <iturk> LjL: it says you are not a system user
[04:56] <LjL> iturk: that's just because you must add yourself as a member of group "admin", i think
[04:56] <LjL> iturk: only members of "admin" can use sudo to get root by default. so, "adduser <username> admin"

[05:00] <Whtiger> dcwChris, it's printf.
[05:00] <ProN00b> dcwChris, go to ##c -_-
[05:01] <dcwChris> I got the printf function just need the format syntax.
[05:01] <dcwChris> using the C bible but have not found a specific example of this.
[05:01] <MinceR> hi
[05:01] <MinceR> the pypanel package seems to lack /usr/bin/pypanel
[05:02] <dcwChris> thank you to all that tried to help.
[05:02] <helgedk> Maybe I should disable the diskcache on my 2 SATA drives to fix the problem - how do I do that?
[05:03] <iturk> LjL: thanks for the help

[05:03] <hc`> wijnand: hmm. but is it safe to use 5.10? The machine is an old PII 400mhz or so, with dualboot (windows and ubuntu). No advanced programs etc, just firefox, gaim/amsn, xchat and gedit. and thunderbird. a machine my cousin can play with

[05:05] <BeBraw> is there a GNOME based DVB player for edgy eft?
[05:06] <designdream> ahh... i broke /usr/bin/tail what package contains it?
[05:06] <omkar86> no i don't want to compile any big software, i want to write my own programs with some graphical IDE
[05:06] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell designdream about apt-file | designdream, you have a private message from Ubotu
[05:06] <EDevil> designdream, dpkg -S /usr/bin/tail
[05:06] <LjL> yeah, that too

[05:09] <mamonassassina> what is that?
[05:09] <gpled> i think i dont like adobe
[05:09] <mamonassassina> how can i solve that problem?
[05:09] <hc`> LjL: ah, I understand
[05:09] <omkar86> yeah is flash development possible in linux?
[05:09] <Lelop> sorry, LjL
[05:09] <mamonassassina> what should i install?
[05:09] <mamonassassina> i have tcl8.5 and tk8.5 as well
[05:09] <LjL> mamonassassina: sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
[05:10] <selinuxium_> mamonassassina: install libpng3-dev
[05:10] <selinuxium_> mamonassassina: What are you trying to build?
[05:10] <mamonassassina> selinuxium_: amsn 0.96
[05:10] <LjL> selinuxium_: amsn 0.96
[05:11] <mamonassassina> and now i need libjpeg. apt-get install libjpeg-dev?
[05:11] <omkar86> can we develop in flash in linux?
[05:11] <LjL> omkar86: afraid not. perhaps using WINE
[05:11] <Whtiger> So, how so I solve "perl: warning: Setting locale failed."?
[05:11] <omkar86> ok
[05:11] <selinuxium_> mamonassassina: do    sudo apt-get build-dep amsn   in a terminal to install all dependecies..
[05:12] <mamonassassina> selinuxium_: oh,that's great
[05:12] <LjL> mamonassassina: and read Ubotu's factoid
[05:12] <LjL> (and the link it contains, that is)
[05:12] <MinceR> bytez
[05:12] <selinuxium_> mamonassassina: you can do that for ones that are already in the repos.
[05:13] <selinuxium_> mamonassassina: NP :)
[05:13] <m_0_r_0_n> Hi, how can I downgrade thunderbird to the last older version?
[05:13] <mamonassassina> LjL: read it,and i'm reading the link
[05:13] <boink> !downgrade
[05:13] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[05:14] <boink> meaning .. downgrading any software is useless
[05:14] <ragamuffin> Is there a nog-graphical  way to install ubutnu alternate cd?
[05:14] <ragamuffin> I mean non-graphical
[05:14] <boink> is the install even graphical?
[05:14] <boink> it's based on an old debian install
[05:14] <LjL> hm, no, on the alternate CD, it is not
[05:14] <ragamuffin> boink: yes
[05:14] <LjL> ragamuffin: no
[05:15] <gpled> boink: all mine have been gui
[05:15] <boink> the ubuntu install off the live cd is very graphical
[05:15] <boink> whatever you think a gui is
[05:15] <LjL> yes but the question was about the Alternate CD
[05:15] <gpled> boink: how do you install with out gui?
[05:15] <snype> i didnt realize that
[05:15] <LjL> !alternate
[05:15] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[05:15] <m_0_r_0_n> boink, the new thunderbird contains a very dangerous bug! Downgrading to an older stable release can be usefull
[05:15] <gpled> !gui
[05:15] <boink> if there's a bug, there's an ubuntu security patch
[05:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gui - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:16] <LjL> !fishing
[05:16] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[05:16] <ragamuffin> but it fails to respond on my 256 mb ram system
[05:16] <boink> I installed that patch on dapper
[05:16] <gpled> !phishing
[05:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about phishing - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:16] <omkar86> sometimes ubuntu live desktop cd install runs very slow on even 256MB ram, in tht case alternate cd is best option
[05:16] <boink> I installed kubuntu on the alternate CD, worked fine
[05:16] <snype> really- i just recommended it to my uncle w/ 256 ram :-/
[05:16] <LjL> ragamuffin: well, with 256Mb, even the Desktop CD should run well, so with the Alternate CD, memory is certainly not a problem
[05:16] <boink> no need for a mouse
[05:17] <snype> alright sweet
[05:17] <Whtiger> Hellooo, does anyone know how to help me with my locale problem?
[05:17] <snype> sure
[05:17] <snype> !locale
[05:17] <boink> snype: use kubuntu
[05:17] <ubotu> To set up and configure your locales, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocaleConf
[05:17] <mamonassassina> now,look what happened after i did sudo make install and tried to open amsn: (let me pastebin it)
[05:17] <boink> damm .. sorry, I mean xubuntu.
[05:17] <snype> boink-- i use ubuntu
[05:17] <ragamuffin> LjL: Desktop faild miserably
[05:17] <boink> kubuntu is too much bloat for 256meg ram
[05:17] <snype> boink-- gnome > kde imho
[05:17] <ragamuffin> and then I downloaded alternate version
[05:17] <ragamuffin> that also is not responding with its graphical interface
[05:17] <boink> I installed xubuntu on an old laptop, I just made the mistake installing edgy
[05:18] <boink> should have installed dapper instead
[05:18] <LjL> ragamuffin, i honestly doubt that either failed because of RAM shortage. did you verify the CDs?
[05:18] <ragamuffin> LjL: yes
[05:18] <boink> ragamuffin: you see it's not the "Live CD"
[05:18] <mamonassassina> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33689/
[05:18] <LjL> ragamuffin: what kind of miserable failure do you get on the desktop CD?
=== Ross is now known as RossW
[05:18] <omkar86> i experienced slow install of kubuntu also, then i mounted some swap the install was more smooth than at first
[05:18] <boink> the Live CD can freeze up
[05:18] <mamonassassina> very strange,i just installed tcl8.5 and tk8.5
[05:18] <RossW> hi
[05:18] <gpled> yah, edgy seems like a mistake
[05:18] <ragamuffin> LjL: at first it was live and install combined
[05:18] <boink> edgy is like worse than debian sid
[05:19] <RossW> could anybody tell me how to rename a Mounted Drive, i have mounted a Fat32 drive and it has a weird name
[05:19] <dark_light> hello, i am in a amd64 environment and want to build i386 deb packages with the ati-driver-installer.. i saw the listpkg and the installer actually can produce packages from x86_64 and x86 architectures
[05:19] <boink> RossW: look in the /etc/fstab
[05:19] <dark_light> is there any trick i can use?
[05:19] <gpled> it is to bad. i had high hopes for edgy. 6.06 was a real nice distro
[05:19] <omkar86> boink: do u find any prblm with xmms in edgy?
[05:19] <ragamuffin> how much time can a memtest take?
[05:19] <RossW> i have done and the drive is called /Storage as i named it but on my desktop and in the file browser its called _PNG followed by a weird symbol
[05:19] <LjL> ragamuffin: weeks, if you let it run
[05:20] <dark_light> with suse, i can specify SuSE/SUSE93-IA32 or SuSE/SLED10-AMD64, but with ubuntu i found no option for this
[05:20] <boink> xmms with edgy? that should work fine
[05:20] <LjL> ragamuffin: the longer you let it run, the higher probability it has of finding a failure
[05:20] <ragamuffin> LjL: I should stop it midway?
[05:20] <RossW> How to fix a strange name of a mounted drive on your desktop and file browser but in fstab it is the correct name of the  drive?
[05:21] <ragamuffin> LjL: is it any good to run it?
[05:21] <LjL> ragamuffin: 10 minutes rules out obvious failures (stuck bits). things like 1/2 hours can rules out intermittent but fairly constant failures. for subtler stuff, at least 24 hours i'd say
[05:21] <omkar86> boink:i upgraded to edgy using gui update tool, I can't see any text in xmms windows
[05:21] <boink> then try at the prompt: which xmms
[05:21] <boink> otherwise, do a dpkg -l|grep xmms
[05:21] <LjL> ragamuffin: it's almost always a good idea to run a memtest.
[05:21] <gpled> RossW: what kind of strange names are you getting?
[05:21] <LjL> ragamuffin: and yeah, when you're "convinced enough" that your RAM is OK, just reset the computer
[05:21] <omkar86> boink:the same happened with debian when i did apt-get dist upgrade from sarge to sid
[05:22] <boink> heh .. you upgraded to sid and edgy? you must like pain and agony
[05:22] <ragamuffin> what does that test mean? checking memory modules?
[05:22] <tonyyarusso> I'd like to access IRC from school, but my university's wireless network only has ports open for http, https, and a couple others.  I have a server machine at home that could be used as a part of the solution, as well as a very configurable router.  Could someone tell me how to get access to IRC if I can only use ports for https and the like, using irssi, ssh, screen, etc.?
[05:22] <RossW> gpled: _PNG followed by a werid symbol that looks like a box with to 0s a 1 and an A
[05:22] <omkar86> i can;t see any text in xmms dialogues, tha main windows are just fine
[05:22] <boink> you could try webchat.xs4all.nl
[05:22] <boink> or see if you can use ssh from your school, so you can make a ssh connection to your favourite account
[05:23] <mjr> tonyyarusso, you can tell your ssh server to listen to any port that is open in your school wlan
[05:23] <LjL> ragamuffin, yes. it writes stuff to RAM, then reads it back, and check that it matches what it had written. it uses "smart" bit patterns to make possible failure more evident. but keep in mind that RAM can fail very subtly -- you can have a bit stay set correctly for a day, and then suddenly change state
[05:23] <gpled> RossW: wow, that is strange.  never seen that before
[05:23] <mamonassassina> so,from the beginning.
[05:23] <boink> I used ssh in Tunisia and China with much web censureship, works great :)
[05:23] <mjr> tonyyarusso, though, as a primary solution, I suggest asking them to open the ssh port, it's just stupid to block
[05:23] <mamonassassina> i am compiling amsn
[05:23] <PumpkinPie> noooo
[05:23] <mamonassassina> or...i compiled it
[05:23] <PumpkinPie> dont sppaamm me
[05:23] <tonyyarusso> mjr: So if I tell ssh to connect to 143 or whatever it is, the _outgoing_ port will be that as well?
[05:23] <mamonassassina> and when trying to open it,i get this:
[05:23] <LjL> ragamuffin: but, for the really broken RAM modules, memtest will tell you within 10 minutes usually
[05:23] <mamonassassina> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33689/
[05:23] <fnf> Hello, has anyone compiled the latest kernel (2.6.18.3) ? I'm having a few make errors here.
[05:23] <boink> you can try to pipe the ssh connection through port 80 as well
[05:23] <RossW> gpled: ive re-installed ubuntu 3 or 4 times and it still has a strange name but the name varies
[05:24] <LjL> PumpkinPie: ?
[05:24] <tonyyarusso> mjr: Yeah....they aren't too bright.  I already tried the intelligent method.
[05:24] <ragamuffin> LjL: I see, thanks
[05:24] <helgedk> disabling write cache on my SATA drives didn't work either
[05:25] <fnf> anyone ? the build errors seem to be common, but I wonder if this is Ubuntu-related ?
[05:25] <gpled> RossW: this on 6.10?
[05:25] <Setzer`> hi
[05:25] <RossW> 6.06
[05:25] <pur-angst`> hey
[05:25] <in4mer> sup?
[05:25] <tbaur> hello
[05:25] <mjr> tonyyarusso, bummer. On the client, you can spesify a nonstandard port with -p; on the server, add a line "Port whatever" to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[05:25] <RossW> gpled: i think its 6.06, dapper drake
[05:26] <ragamuffin> Strangely, the first time I installed alternate version I had no graphical user interface. I had failed with the desktop version. I doubt that alternate version took the edit partition thingly from the desktop version and worked for me.
[05:26] <gpled> RossW: run the check cd test
[05:26] <tonyyarusso> mjr: I'll give that a shot - thanks.
[05:26] <RossW> gpled: how do i do that? sorry im a newbie
[05:26] <in4mer> ok
[05:26] <pur-angst`> not sure
[05:26] <Setzer`> secret
[05:26] <tonyyarusso> mjr: Oh - can the server listen to both the standard and nonstandard port at the same time?
[05:26] <helgedk> I'm completely blank
[05:26] <gpled> RossW: just boot up the cd like an install, but look at the options.  one says something like check the cd
[05:26] <protocol1> how do I extract a .tgx file?
[05:26] <protocol1> via console?
[05:26] <mjr> tonyyarusso, yes, that's why I didn't tell you to replace the old Port line ;)
[05:27] <RossW> ooh, i already did that before installing
[05:27] <levander> You know how you can use xvidtune and xrandr to move the X desktop around on the monitor a little?  Anybody know how I can do the same thing with gdm?
[05:27] <LjL> ragamuffin, what do you mean, you had no graphical user interface? there's something i'm missing here. the Alternate CD has a text-mode only interface; it's got dialogs and all, but it all runs in text-mode. is that what you mean there with "graphical user interface"?
[05:27] <tonyyarusso> mjr: Aah.  perfect
[05:27] <protocol1> .tgz file
[05:27] <gpled> RossW: i would run memtest after that.  you do it the same way
[05:27] <RossW> gpled: its a partition on my hard drive, fat32 format which i created so that both linux and windows can access
[05:27] <ragamuffin> LjL: I am confused
[05:27] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell protocol1 about tar | protocol1, you have a private message from Ubotu
[05:27] <mamzers555> protocol1; man tar
[05:28] <ragamuffin> then I must have named my cds wrongly
[05:28] <LjL> ragamuffin, in other words, if you have a Gnome desktop when you load your Alternate CD, then it's not the Alternate CD :-D
[05:28] <RossW> gpled: my other partition is ok which is my actual windowsXP install partition that has the correct name (WindowsXP)
[05:28] <gpled> RossW: make sure you install windows before ubuntu
[05:28] <RossW> i did
[05:28] <ragamuffin> LjL: I had the options, 1. graphical 2. safe graphical etc
[05:28] <RossW> gpled: i formatted the partition in windows
[05:29] <nox-Hand> Hey
[05:29] <RossW> gpled: also tryed formatting in linux
[05:29] <ragamuffin> but the dekstop version had oem etc
[05:29] <LjL> ragamuffin: that looks like the Desktop CD, not the Alternate CD. the Alternate will just process to a text-mode install
[05:29] <gpled> RossW: you got me on this one.  i have never seen anything like that.  6.06 is real stable
[05:29] <nox-Hand> Whats the 6.10 kernel image name? Like, 606 was Casper
[05:29] <RossW> gpled: i tried googling and no results on my problem
[05:29] <LjL> ragamuffin: i don't know about OEM
[05:29] <harryfather> when i try to boot edgy i386 on my dual-core gateway, it doesnt recognize the cd drive
[05:29] <RossW> gpled: could it be the acutal name that im using for the mount?
[05:29] <mamonassassina> God.can someone help me out with that in a private conversation?
[05:29] <gpled> RossW: is their a LUG near you?
[05:30] <RossW> gpled: LUG?

[05:35] <LjL> nox-Hand: ok - that's why i pointed you to the !botabuse factoid in the first place: it tells you to "Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots"
[05:35] <RossW> i live in England
[05:35] <xor_> How do I disable the desired sound card, if I have two, one onboard and another PCI?
[05:35] <ragamuffin> LjL: yes, the image you pointed corresponds my last tried (and failed) version
[05:35] <gpled> RossW: where in England?
[05:35] <nox-Hand> Right.
[05:36] <pitti> nox-Hand: ok, 'casper' is a package that creates a live system environment; it has nothing to do with the kernel, or a parituclar Ubuntu version
[05:36] <gpled> RossW: see if i can find a lug for you
[05:36] <RossW> gpled: rochdale
[05:36] <mamonassassina> does anyone know where can i GET tcl8.5 and tk8.5?
[05:36] <pitti> nox-Hand: what do you mean with 'kernel image name'?
[05:36] <RossW> gpled: im 14 so it would have to be in walking distance
[05:36] <nox-Hand> pitti, The liveCD package then.
[05:36] <mamonassassina> there is a thousand people here,someone has to know :P
[05:36] <LjL> ragamuffin: this is a standard i386 Alternate CD: http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06.1-alternate-i386.iso    and this is a Desktop CD: http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso
[05:36] <nox-Hand> pitti, The one required to boot the installer via command line. Instead of casper, what then?
[05:36] <hopping> hello someone please help me on setting up the proxy in terminal, so i can be able to do apt-get update and apt-get install.
[05:36] <saquib>  I have an AMD64 3500+ (K8) CPU.. im currently using the 386 kernel, would using the K7 kernel give me better performance???
[05:37] <LjL> mamonassassina, not from the repos, since they seem to have only up to 8.4. which, for what i'm concerned, means i would not even attempt to install 8.5
[05:37] <mamonassassina> LjL: hm,so,what i should do is make amsn run with 8.4
[05:37] <user-land> how do you remove red eyes from pictures you take ?
[05:37] <mamonassassina> LjL: how? :P
[05:37] <pitti> nox-Hand: erm, slowly; you have an alternate or desktop CD?
[05:37] <CarinArr> hey.. i'm a bit puzzled.. all of a sudden my sound is all very quiet, even when alsamixer, the audio controller in the player, and my speaker controller are both set to full volume
[05:38] <protocol1> i love my laptop cooler
[05:38] <CarinArr> does anyone know what the culprit may be?
[05:38] <LjL> mamonassassina: why not make life simpler and use the packaged version of amsn?
[05:38] <mamonassassina> LjL: autopackage won't run,and repos have up to 0.95
[05:38] <Doow> user-land: that'd be #gimp on GIMPNet =)
[05:38] <levander> To run lm-sensors, I need some module w83627ehf that isn't on my system.  Anybody can tell me where to find it?
[05:38] <saquib>  I have an AMD64 3500+ (K8) CPU.. im currently using the 386 kernel, would using the K7 kernel give me better performance???
[05:39] <user-land> thanks, doow, so they finally implemented this feature ?
[05:39] <LjL> mamonassassina: let me give it a crack
[05:39] <PupenoR> Hello.
[05:39] <Doow> user-land: finally, you have always been able to do it, if you want to do it completely automatically I wouldn't know, but I don't think so
[05:39] <PupenoR> Does anybody know about those service where you can upload and download files without registration ?
[05:39] <Toma-> levander: should be in linux-image package... just run 'sudo modprobe w83627ehf'
[05:40] <Toma-> PupenoR: no?
[05:40] <Doow> user-land: should be a ? after finally there
[05:40] <PupenoR> Toma-: ?
[05:40] <ryanakca> shorewall vs fiaif vs uif. Which one do I install
[05:40] <gpled> RossW: http://www.linux.org/groups/united_kingdom/england.html
[05:40] <mamonassassina> LjL: as i told someone on the channel some minutes ago,i ran autopackage but forgot to uninstall the old version from amsn.and autopackage couldn't install.then,i uninstalled amsn with synaptic but it was too late i guess,autopackage won't run anymore
[05:40] <Doow> user-land: either way, #gimp is probably a much better place to ask =)
[05:41] <user-land> doow, i am looking for an easy way to remove red eyes from my albums.
[05:41] <hopping> hello someone please help me on setting up the proxy in terminal, so i can be able to do apt-get update and apt-get install
[05:41] <LjL> mamonassassina: nice messing up ;)
[05:41] <gpled> RossW: would try to get ahold of one of those lugs.  see if they know someone in your town
[05:41] <mamonassassina> LjL: yeah.
[05:41] <LjL> mamonassassina: uhm, here the ./configure seems to be happy with tcl 8.4 - don't know about the actual make yet
[05:42] <mamonassassina> LjL: and where did you get it?
[05:42] <Doow> user-land: hmm.. appearantly there's a #gimp-user channel that might be better suited, seems #gimp is for development
[05:42] <gpled> RossW: one thing you could try, just as a test.  try installing ubuntu on the whole hard drive with out windows.  see if the problem stays
[05:42] <LjL> mamonassassina, i just typed "sudo apt-get build-dep amsn"
[05:42] <mamonassassina> LjL: oh,and about the autopackage,am i f**ed?
[05:42] <Toma-> mamonassassina: youre building amsn too?
[05:43] <mamonassassina> Toma-: i built it
[05:43] <LjL> mamonassassina: don't know. i'm not going to try an autopackage, not really
[05:43] <|Lord_Zoo|> #join #fedora
[05:43] <gpled> RossW: did you try and split the hard drive to make room for ubuntu?
[05:43] <Toma-> with tk8.5?
[05:43] <mamonassassina> Toma-: with tcl and tk8.5
[05:43] <mamonassassina> Toma-: look what happened when i tried to run it.
[05:43] <Toma-> same ;)
[05:43] <LjL> mamonassassina: for the record, i compiled amsn successfully, and it runs
[05:43] <mamonassassina> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33689/
[05:43] <mamonassassina> LjL: 0.96?
[05:44] <LjL> mamonassassina: yes.
[05:44] <markstos> I've published a comparison of Mandriva 2007 vs. Ubuntu Edgy. Generally, I found Edgy to be better: http://www.richmondcomputes.org/blog/mark/mandriva_2007_vs_ubuntu_edgy
[05:44] <mamonassassina> LjL: with tcl8.4?well,maybe i should point amsn to wish8.4 instead of 8.5
[05:44] <user-land> thanks doow
[05:44] <Toma-> mamonassassina: sounds like your not using the right wish...
[05:44] <mamonassassina> Toma-: yeah
[05:44] <Doow> user-land: np, hope you find a good solution
[05:45] <mamonassassina> LjL: when i got a segmentation fault i did that,but i can't find amsn configuration file anymore.
[05:45] <LjL> mamonassassina: wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/amsn/amsn-0.96.tar.bz2 ; tar xf amsn-0.96.tar.bz2 ; cd amsn-0.96/ ; sudo apt-get build-dep amsn ; ./configure ; make ; ./amsn
[05:45] <RossW> gpled:no, i formatted the drive, installed windows, created 4 partitions, 1 with windowsXP on formatted in NTFS which i can mount fine but do not wish the write 2, i had 1 fat32 partition which is blank which i am having the strange name thing with and the 2 blank partitions, 1 which i installed ubuntu (formatted in ext3) and the final partition is the linux swap
[05:45] <LjL> mamonassassina: this procedure works fine here. not sure exactly how you've tried to complicate your life ;)
[05:45] <user-land> still i think there a much more ubuntu users looking for this then gimp users, because gimp is neither good for albums nor simple enough for most users.
[05:45] <hopping> someone please help me on setting up the proxy in terminal, so i can be able to do apt-get update and apt-get install
[05:45] <Toma-> i love compiling fresh + sxc apps like amsn
[05:46] <mamonassassina> LjL: let me try that
[05:46] <LjL> hopping: export HTTP_PROXY=whatever
[05:46] <Toma-> compiled and runs super here
[05:46] <ryanakca> fiaif vs shorewall vs uif vs guarddog vs ferm. Which should I install?
[05:46] <LjL> hopping: also, to be sure, export http_proxy=whatever
[05:47] <hopping> LjL: i did that too, still when i do apt-update it says unable to resolv the urls
[05:47] <spiekey> hello!
[05:47] <LjL> hopping: unable to *resolve*? that seems like a DNS problem. does "nslookup www.google.com" work?
[05:47] <spiekey> i need to install the zaptel drivers (ztdummy) for timing. Whats the package called?
[05:48] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell spiekey about packages | spiekey, you have a private message from Ubotu
[05:48] <RossW> gpled: hmm i just discovered something.... with my other drive it displays the size in GB and the says the name i have it mounted as, if i dont have it mounted it just says the size of the drive but with the drive i am struggling with it doesnt say the size of the drive it says "_PNG"
[05:48] <dennister> hello everyone, and especially anyone who could help me with udev rules :)
[05:48] <hopping> LjL: nslookup and ping is blocked by calbe operator, but i set the proxies in firefox working fine
[05:49] <dennister> lol...not having much luck troubleshooting this here
[05:49] <LjL> hopping: i see... but i'm afraid apt-get will still try to use DNS for resolving, even if it's going through a proxy
[05:49] <spiekey> :)
[05:49] <lir1> i'm on 2.6.15-27-686, can i remove packages like linux-image-2.6.15-27-386, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-27-386, linux-restricted-modules-386, linux-headers-2.6.15-26-386 ?

[05:49] <matahari> i have an usb-headset
[05:49] <matahari> it works fine
[05:49] <matahari> but
[05:50] <hopping> LjL : can't i update respo and install packages thru gui tool under system --> administrator menu?
[05:50] <LjL> spiekey, well, for a package like that, searching for "zaptel" can hardly fail. if it isn't there when you search at http://packages.ubuntu.com , it probably just means it isn't there
[05:50] <matahari> i always have to switch to use it when i boot my computer
[05:50] <LjL> !find zaptel
[05:50] <ubotu> Found: zaptel, zaptel-source
[05:50] <LjL> spiekey: could those above be it?
=== lir1 is now known as li1
[05:50] <matahari> i just want that it is used all the time, without setting anything at bootup
[05:50] <LjL> hopping: yes, but i guess you'll have the same problem
[05:50] <matahari> is this possible? and how?
=== li1 is now known as lir1
[05:51] <hopping> dang

[05:51] <marctt> where can i have this dvb audio device?
[05:52] <marctt> anyone?
[05:52] <LjL> spiekey: then that file's not packaged.
[05:52] <justin_> How much space does a default Ubuntu install consume?
[05:53] <LjL> spiekey: look at this however - http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=zaptel-source&version=warty&arch=all&page=2&number=50 - it's there as source
[05:53] <hopping> LjL i am using home internet cable, on windows for browsing internet we need to set proxies, and for messengers we need to install ISA firewall client, obtaine DNS is auto

[05:56] <mamzers555> how can i lower it
[05:56] <RossW> its only this partition, the other one mounts fine, no problems
[05:57] <justin_> mamzers555: Use Alsamixer gui.
[05:57] <gpled> RossW: how did you make the partitions?

[06:01] <Nookie> anyone who can help me out with edgy and ati
[06:01] <bruenig> fragalot, the easiest way to do so is to put the ubuntu live cd. Have a usb thumbdrive. Mount the hard disk and then copy files over. IF it is formatted, that could be a big problem. But you could try

[06:01] <fragalot> bruenig: but aren't there file recovery programs?

[06:09] <Wyvern|> I'm trying to set up my ubuntu server as a samba print server, but can't seem to figure out how to install and setup printer drivers?
[06:10] <fnf> Wyvern|: The default Ububtu installation tries to include as much driver as possible, so you should find no problem using your printer.
[06:10] <hopping> LjL how to enable sshd service?
[06:10] <dv5237_> hi im looking for a real time CLI based app that helps me 'find' wireless accespoints anyone know a package for ubuntu?
[06:10] <LjL> hopping, in Firefox you have "Auto-detect proxy settings for this network", or "Automatix proxy configuration URL"?
[06:10] <LjL> hopping: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[06:11] <fnf> Wyvern|: In case it doesn't, you'll need to download/compile the driver for it and load it as a module.
[06:11] <hopping> LjL no in firefoz manual proxy setting
[06:11] <LjL> dv5237_: apt-cache search find wireless
[06:11] <Wyvern|> Well, the problem is not that my driver is missing, but that I have no clue as of how to start the printer configuration in the first place. :)
[06:11] <Doow> How do I change what the default program for each filetype in the File Browser is?
[06:11] <Wyvern|> all guides seem to be for the windowed version

[06:12] <fnf> Wyvern|: What'd you want to setup ? Page size, margin ? etc...
[06:12] <Wyvern|> well, as of now I have just connected the printer.
[06:13] <nilson> I just installed ubuntu-server on my server and I'm trying to install nfs through aptitude

[06:15] <CoRnJuLiOx> join #hardware
[06:16] <CoRnJuLiOx> hey is there an ubuntu equivalent to the recycle bin?
[06:16] <Wyvern|> fnf: So ubuntu server should just set up and configure the printer the second it's plugged in, all by itself?
[06:16] <nilson> Why would a package want to remove ubuntu-standard?
[06:16] <LjL> hopping: you could try adding a line like Acquire::http::Proxy "http://address:port/";    to the APT configuration file... i'm not sure which file it is in Ubuntu however =) normally it would be /etc/apt/apt.conf, but Ubuntu has an /etc/apt/apt.conf.d directory
[06:16] <sn9> CoRnJuLiOx: it's in the lower right corner of the screen
[06:16] <Rossdokta> Hello you all...
[06:16] <LjL> maybe you can add it to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01ubuntu, but i don't really know if that's a good idea
[06:17] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop | nilson
[06:17] <ubotu> nilson: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[06:17] <LjL> nilson: same reasoning i suppose
[06:17] <grout> which command would create an ext3 filesystem on a partition?

[06:17] <synic> hah.
[06:17] <grout> thanks
[06:18] <fnf> Wyvern|: It should, there may be problem I'm not aware though. If your printer is an USB or compatible device, Linux will automagically recognize, the rest is done by appropriate kernel modules.
[06:18] <Rossdokta> I am quite new to Linux, so I wanted to ask you, wich version of Ubuntu I could install on my "good old" PII with 333 Mhz and 64 Ram...
[06:18] <grout> nubuntu
[06:18] <Quinn_Storm> you'd want one of the xubuntu distros probably
[06:18] <LjL> Rossdokta: Ubuntu Server. or perhaps Xubuntu, if you're lucky.
[06:18] <sn9> Rossdokta: 64 ram is the problem
[06:18] <nilson> LjL, so you think I would be safe to let it remove ubuntu-standard then reinstall it
[06:18] <LjL> indeed
[06:18] <grout> How can you check the firmware version of the tape drive installed in a Linux system, without rebooting?
[06:19] <Wyvern|> fnf: oh. too simple for me to fathom then ;)
[06:19] <LjL> nilson: reinstalling it will result in removing the package that you're now trying to install. which package is it anyway?
[06:19] <dennister> gonna try this new udev rule...reboot
[06:19] <nilson> dude
[06:19] <Rossdokta> hehe, well, but here dhe SDRAMs are hard to ged.... coz if I would i would use'em
[06:19] <phil717171> 6.06 Desktop, I installed Samba, do I have to manually edit any files to make it work, or can it all be done from the GUI?
[06:19] <nilson> LjL I Dont know about this
[06:19] <nilson> its removing everything
[06:19] <LjL> nilson, which package?
[06:19] <fnf> Wyvern|: Usually you'll find some logged info in the kern or syslog by the time a new device is plugged in.
[06:19] <grout> How can you check the firmware version of the tape drive installed in a Linux system, without rebooting?
[06:20] <LjL> grout: that would depend on the drive i suppose
[06:20] <Rossdokta> aha... well I will try with xubuntu.,...
[06:20] <grout> LjL its a scsi
[06:20] <Rossdokta> thx to you meanwhile...
[06:20] <LjL> Rossdokta: use the alternate cd
[06:20] <dv5237_> does anyone here know a easy to know CLI based wireless scanning tool?
[06:20] <Rossdokta> ok....
[06:20] <grout> kismet
[06:20] <sn9> Rossdokta: if i couldn't get a machine above 64 ram, i likely wouldn't bother with any version of ubuntu and just install damnsmalllinux
[06:20] <nilson> LjL I'm trying to install NFS on a new install of ubuntu-server and aptitude wants to remove ubuntu-standard
[06:20] <slick_nick> is it just me or do apps in kubuntu eat up a *lot* of memory? I've got 1.25GB of RAM and i've barely ever seen it using less than 1GB
[06:20] <nilson> which contains all the base Linux system
[06:20] <nilson> I cant remove that
[06:21] <mp__> hmmm. where is the iptables config file stored in Ubuntu?
[06:21] <mp__> (when using firestarter)
[06:21] <LjL> !sdparm | grout, perhaps this. but i bet it really depends on which specific drive
[06:21] <ubotu> sdparm: Output and modify SCSI device parameters. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.98-1 (edgy), package size 94 kB, installed size 324 kB
[06:21] <evad> slick_nick: Unlike Windows Linux does not try to use up as little memory as possible - it's use of memory is not a bad thing - whats wrong with using what you have?
[06:21] <Rossdokta> btw, can I ask you, if I would have to use some bash=???? (I am only sure in MSDOS, bash seems really diffferent...
[06:21] <Rossdokta> ???
[06:21] <LjL> nilson, i asked you *which specific package* you are installing.
[06:22] <slick_nick> evad: nothing...except it's using it up just when i have lots of apps open...I haven't actually started using them yet! can't imagine hat things are going to look like when i open up OO.o or something..
[06:22] <nilson> LjL: nfs-kernel
[06:22] <nilson> which tries to install nfs-common
[06:22] <nilson> which has the conflicting dependency
[06:22] <LjL> !info nfs-kernel | nilson
[06:22] <ubotu> Package nfs-kernel does not exist in any distro I know
[06:23] <Phuzion> I'm using 6.06, how do I get firefox 2.0 to install?
[06:23] <LjL> nilson: i suppose it's nfs-kernel-server that you mean?
[06:23] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Phuzion about firefox | Phuzion, you have a private message from Ubotu
[06:23] <nilson> yeah I think so
[06:23] <Ayabara> hi guys. anyone know of a good mplayer quick reference? I would like to know the most common/significant improvements I can do, but the documentation is just too much for me...
[06:24] <kishan> Can any one help is it safe to install ntfs to read write on windows drive
[06:24] <LjL> nilson: do you have either knfs or nfs-server installed? type "apt-cache policy knfs" and "apt-cache policy nfs-server" to know
[06:24] <sn9> Ayabara: such is the nature of mplayer
[06:24] <sn9> !ntfs-3g | kishan
[06:24] <ubotu> kishan: ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[06:24] <LjL> kishan: to read, yes, to write, not at all
[06:25] <sn9> LjL: WRONG!
[06:25] <nilson> LjL I have neither
[06:25] <Wyvern|> Well, I'm still fighting with this printer. Where in the system are printers "located"? (eg. /dev/printer1 or something like that)?
[06:25] <Ayabara> sn9, I know. I use actually use kaffeine and vlc a lot, because I have this fear that my mplayer is badly configured  :-)
[06:25] <kishan> LjL: so u suggest better to not write on ntfs, one more question how can i read linux from windows
[06:26] <LjL> !ext3 | kishan
[06:26] <ubotu> kishan: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[06:27] <sn9> Ayabara: it's easy to badly configure vlc, too
[06:27] <Ayabara> sn9, arghh. now I can only use kaffeine ;-)

[06:30] <dv5237_> does anyone here know a easy to use CLI based wireless scanning tool?
[06:30] <LjL> sn9: not causing problems to *you*, or not causing problems in general?

[06:31] <Misnix2> too bad about the data
[06:31] <phil717171> 6.06 Desktop, can Samba be configured in the GUI or do I have to edit files?
[06:32] <Wyvern|> Hm. Are there any commandline-wizard for configuring printers (or the rest of the system for that matter) at all in ubuntu-server?
[06:32] <GoClick> <rant type="random">Binary drivers are evil!</rant>
[06:32] <jbroome> !swat
[06:32] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[06:32] <dv_> unfortunately, you have to edit the files
=== Misnix2 is now known as Misnix
[06:32] <Wyvern|> or is everything based around apt-get and config files?
[06:32] <Roger_The_Bum> ooh
[06:32] <dv_> swat is a pain to set up
[06:32] <Roger_The_Bum> that seems nice
[06:32] <jbroome> ahh, didn't mention easy of setup, just asked if it could be done with a gui. :)
[06:32] <GoClick> I'm suprised there isn't a decent free GUI GNOME config editor for SAMBA I can't imagine it'd be overly hard to write....
[06:32] <phil717171> Thanks!
[06:33] <dv_> well, if you already need a web server, swat might be for you
[06:33] <dv_> otherwise...
[06:33] <bruenig> GoClick, you should write one
[06:34] <fourat> Hello all
[06:34] <GoClick> It's not like it's a hard config to edit tho... pretty pleased with the config format for SAMBA
[06:34] <dv_> well it can be hard

[06:34] <ubotu> fourat: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:34] <dv_> getting the permissions to work can be a real pain
[06:34] <GoClick> bruenig I'm too busy, and maybe that's the problem is that it's too easy of a config and anyone who could write one is too busy to bother making something so easy, easier
[06:34] <fourat> bruenig, greetings :)
[06:34] <dv_> as well as the issue with different charsets
[06:35] <Roger_The_Bum> utf-8 ?

[06:36] <mydani> Hi all. Is there a mac-like panel for gnome? :D
[06:36] <GoClick> "Using Samba" by Robert Eckstein, David Collier-Brown and Peter Kelly is available fopr free online at http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/samba/chapter/book/
[06:36] <bruenig> mac-like, meaning a dock menu?
[06:36] <Roger_The_Bum> mydani: I'm fairly sure I saw it in the themes menu
[06:36] <mydani> yeah, right
[06:36] <fourat> Openoffice does not start on my edgy, it splash the splashscreen for some 2 seconds and then close down
[06:36] <Roger_The_Bum> oh
[06:36] <mydani> I'll try to complete my beryl-look - and such a panel is really necessary
[06:36] <GoClick> Mac didn't come up with the idea of a doc....
[06:36] <dv5237_> does anyone here know a easy to use CLI based wireless scanning tool?
[06:37] <dv_> mydani, you use beryl?
[06:37] <mydani> dv_, yepp
[06:37] <dv_> do you have an nvidia card?
[06:37] <dv_> -n
[06:37] <mydani> yes
[06:37] <fourat> dv5237, iwlist
[06:37] <dv_> do you run GL apps in beryl?
[06:37] <mydani> nvidia beta drivers without xgl/axgl
[06:37] <dv_> I tried, but the system freezes after a while
[06:37] <mydani> dv_, I do and it worked the last 36h
[06:37] <dv_> without beryl its all fine
[06:38] <fourat> Openoffice does not start on my edgy, it splash the splashscreen for some 2 seconds and then close down
[06:38] <dv_> I mean I can run beryl perfectly as long as I dont fire up complex GL apps using framebuffer objects or similar
[06:38] <Roger_The_Bum> isn't beryl alpha?
[06:38] <dv_> yeah
[06:38] <dv_> but this seems more like a nvidia bug to me
[06:38] <Roger_The_Bum> <insert nvidia binary driver tirade here>
[06:39] <Roger_The_Bum> </insert>
[06:39] <dv_> since they changed substantial parts of their core, I guess this is still a bit shaky
[06:39] <finalbeta> fourat, start by running it from the commandline and see what error it gives you.
[06:39] <dv_> but hey.... for me there is no alternative since I do code a lot with pixel shaders etc.

[06:44] <bunnythebunny> Hey guys, do KDE programs have compatibility issues with GNOME?
[06:44] <dv_> no
[06:44] <lir1> LjL: Ok, let's check :)
[06:44] <dv_> well,
[06:45] <dv_> obviously kde programs cannot make use of gnomevfs

[06:45] <dv_> and vice versa
[06:45] <dv_> but thats the only thing I can think of right now
[06:46] <bunnythebunny> Well, for example, i got various kde based guitar software, and they don't work properly. They get in, but the terminal gives me some odd errors and..
[06:46] <lir1> LjL: ok I'm left with the 26-686/386 which I'll keep for now as backup...
[06:47] <bunnythebunny> I don't know.
[06:47] <LjL> lir1: well at least one backup is probably a good idea
[06:47] <lir1> LjL: yeap, thanks.
[06:47] <ivoks> if programs works, just ignore errors :)
[06:47] <bunnythebunny> It gets in -- but it doesn't do what its supossed to...but that may be cause i haven't got the guitar identified, or i don't know.

[07:04] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[07:04] <flujan> the 192.168.3.2 machine cant ping 192.168.3.1 too
[07:04] <justin_> MsClock: Well umm, because the Ubuntu community is family based.. and yeah fack could always be misinterpreted.
[07:04] <justin_> MsClock: Anyways this conversation should be in ubuntu-offtopic.
[07:04] <MsClock> Really..? It's about Ubuntu, just the community as opposed to the actual technical side.
[07:04] <bruenig> !offtopic
[07:04] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[07:05] <twotone> stojance: now what?
[07:05] <stojance> twotone: now open terminal and write sudo nautilus /usr/lib/firefox/plugins  , the in the window that will show slightly after that paste the files there and close the window. Then start/restart firefox so the changes can take effect
[07:05] <MsClock> "Family" based makes it sound like only certain people should be using the distro to begin with.
[07:05] <justin_> MsClock: Well this is for Ubuntu itself, not a discussion about the community -- its about the software, and the technical side.
[07:05] <MsClock> Hmm
[07:05] <mat1> can any one help me?
[07:05] <twotone> stojance: awesome. Thank you.
[07:05] <stojance> Test it?

[07:06] <bruenig> !hi | J_P
[07:06] <ubotu> J_P: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!

[07:08] <Misnix> marin, sorry, still running amsn 0.95 here
[07:08] <justin_> mat1: Check your ram.
[07:08] <Jager-> you talking to me bruenig?
[07:08] <dfgas> bruenig: i am using mc now, but it give me 2 screens, skip and delete to go to next file
[07:08] <mat1> kk
[07:08] <bruenig> Jager-, no
[07:09] <Jager-> okay
[07:09] <Jager-> would someone look at this log - http://www.originalwebconcepts.com/Whatever/gparted_details.htm
[07:09] <J_P> bruenig: ok, but pentium D is not 64 bits ?
[07:09] <mat1> do the whole test?
[07:09] <justin_> That is usually caused by faulty RAM, whereas Windows will continue most of the time until it ends up putting something in the bad RAM address, Linux will stop right away before it boots if it detects bad ram.
[07:09] <stojance> Now can someone help me. How do I replace the main hotkey command for Music Player, not to start Rhythmbox but Banshee
[07:09] <mat1> justin_: run the whole test?
[07:09] <justin_> mat1: Yes, get a RAM tester -- that is most likely a bad ram error. --
[07:10] <frogzoo> stojance: prefs -> kb shortcuts
[07:10] <LjL> justin_, mat1: there is a fine RAM tested on the Ubuntu CD (Memtest++) - it can be started by booting the CD and selecting the memory testing option
[07:10] <mat1> justin_: i'm using the memtest+86
[07:10] <stojance> frogzoo: I know, but it doesn't specify the command to be executed
[07:11] <justin_> LjL: Whatever one :)
[07:11] <justin_> Just get one
[07:11] <LjL> just mentioning
[07:11] <bruenig> J_P, don't think so. Wikipedia certainly doesn't indicate that it is. Even if it were 64 bit, it would still run the i386.
[07:11] <LjL> memtest is probably among the best ones around
[07:11] <justin_> mat1: Do the full test, it will take some time -- but it will be worth it to know if you have bad ram, it will save you time -- and frustration.
[07:11] <bruenig> J_P, oh wait, yes it does, I was on the wrong article. It is 64 bit
[07:11] <mat1> justin_: cd boots up fine buth wen i boot the enter to ubuntu or install it just wont go in
[07:12] <LjL> well, *don't* do the full test if you're using memtest, because that will probably take days ;-) just let it run for... a while
[07:12] <guiden> how long will it take untill everyone has migrated over to 64 bit processors?
[07:12] <bruenig> J_P, it should still be backwards compatible to i386. So then you can choose which you want
[07:12] <sbarn> hello could someone tell me wth ubuntu moved the /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware directory?
[07:12] <Jager-> could saomeone help me?
[07:12] <mat1> justin_: so i might have bad ram?
[07:12] <justin_> mat1: I'd say with 90% certainty that is your problem -- bad ram, or bad slots.
[07:12] <frogzoo> stojance: configuration editor - look under metacity settings
[07:13] <mat1> justin_: kk thnx
[07:13] <stojance> How can I change Banshee as my Default Music Player not Rhythmbox

[07:18] <ubotu> For a few common problems when installing, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall also make sure you have read !install

[07:19] <frogzoo> !doesn't work

[07:19] <Jager-> Ive asked my question a dozen times.. never get a repsone from anyone...
[07:20] <sod75> it is a bit hectic here....
[07:20] <[eLD] Nuggy> From the installer's boot prompt, enter
[07:20] <[eLD] Nuggy> linux acpi=off
[07:20] <Chetic> Why do applications take a really really long time to start up?
[07:20] <Spee_Der> !more beer
[07:20] <mat1> man i have 1gb ram:P taking a long time but i got check it
[07:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about more beer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:20] <[eLD] Nuggy> wheres the installers boot prompt?
[07:20] <LjL> Jager-: run a checkdisk and a defrag on your NTFS filesystem before trying again
[07:20] <Spee_Der> o
[07:20] <LjL> !botabuse | Spee_Der
[07:20] <ubotu> Spee_Der: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[07:20] <sethk> Jager-, people join and leave all the time.  for example, I don't know what you asked
[07:20] <bruenig> Chetic, perhaps you have a low end computer
[07:20] <Jager-> Okay I did chkdsk /f and now ill do defrag
[07:20] <Chetic> bruenig, It wasn't like this a few days ago. And I know I don't!
[07:20] <sethk> Jager-, but it sounds like you got an answer  :)
[07:20] <Jager-> Yes, finally, thank you :)
[07:21] <Aranel> [eLD] Nuggy: I believe you need to press F1 or something like that to get a boot prompt. I haven't used the installer in awhile.
[07:21] <sethk> Jager-, although I'm having difficulty imagining what defragging is going to do here.
[07:21] <Jager-> someone suggested it
[07:21] <IRC__> how do i launch gparted?
[07:21] <sethk> Jager-, yes, I know.  to solve what problem?
[07:21] <[eLD] Nuggy> is that the first screen booting from the cd Aranel?
[07:21] <Jager-> read this log, http://tinyurl.com/y95xvq
[07:22] <Jager-> it cant resize the hdd
[07:22] <Aranel> Yes
[07:22] <[eLD] Nuggy> ok
[07:22] <Jager-> thats the only place it fails
[07:22] <Pensacola> how to install a 386 kernel in edgy?
[07:22] <LjL> sethk, i'm not so familiar with parted and NTFS resizing. however, i've heard many times that if the NTFS FS is fragmented, parted may not be able to shrink it enough. and since he wasn't getting any answers...
[07:22] <[eLD] Nuggy> well if im back in a bit it hasnt worked. If im back after a long while its installed and ive got irc running. Thanks Aranel :)
[07:23] <bruenig> !info linux-image-386
[07:23] <Aranel> Good luck!
[07:23] <ubotu> linux-image-386: Linux kernel image on 386.. In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.17.10 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[07:23] <IRC__> how do i launch gparted on my computer
[07:23] <Jager-> I might as well do a defrag, no harm in that
[07:23] <sethk> Jager-, you are simply trying to resize your partition too much, given the data on it.  remember that there is file system overhead, and you can't shrink it to a size that's the same as the "used" space.
[07:23] <nu> If i downloaded a dont, which dir do i put it in to use it?
[07:23] <sethk> Jager-, no, I suppose it won't hurt anything, but it won't get you very far.
[07:24] <Jager-> Its not. the used space takes up like 56gb
[07:24] <Jager-> i tried making the whole thing about 64gb
[07:24] <afief> Every time i try to burn a DVD i get an unhandled error. what should i do?
[07:24] <bruenig> IRC__, generally it is located in system>administration>gnome partition editor, or you can just type gksudo gparted to run it from the terminal
[07:24] <sethk> Jager-, the log you pointed me at says "spacee in use, 61088mb"
[07:24] <Chetic> Why do applications take a really long time to start up for me? It wasn't like this a couple of reboots (and days) ago :(
[07:24] <Jager-> gparted recommend that i resize it ever smaller
[07:24] <justin_> How much space does the default Ubuntu install consume?
[07:24] <frogzoo> afief: first check you have a large enough tmp space, then try burning slower
[07:24] <justin_> Is it 2 gigs?
[07:24] <Jager-> arg xD
[07:24] <justin_> or 4..
[07:25] <bruenig> justin_, I think they say 2 gigs minimum, might be 3 gigs now
[07:25] <Kvek> what do i need Ram wise
[07:25] <RaiderX> i need help with installing the rar package
[07:25] <frogzoo> Kvek: need 256, but more is preferable
[07:25] <Kvek> I have that
[07:25] <Jager-> where in the log do you see that sethk?
[07:25] <RaiderX> i downloaded rarlinux-3.5.1.tar.gz
[07:26] <sethk> Jager-, just search for "space in use"
[07:26] <justin_> Is there a tool native to Ubuntu that can list directories by size ... --- keep in mind that I use Xubuntu --- so Nautilus = no n.
[07:26] <Jager-> oh.. okay i see it
[07:26] <RaiderX> where do i put the rar folder?
[07:26] <afief> frogzoo: i got a 9.2 GB free on my root, and already burn at 2X, the error occures before any burning starts
[07:26] <Jager-> i wonder why gpart is showing me ~56gb then..
[07:26] <dfgas> how long should fsck on a 40gig take?
[07:26] <frogzoo> justin_: you might like filelight
[07:26] <justin_> RaiderX: It will create it automatically --- tar -xvf 'filename'
[07:26] <justin_> frogzoo: Filelight? can list dir contents by size?
[07:27] <Jager-> it shows me just what windows shows me.. does gpart calculate space in a differnet base or something crazy?
[07:27] <sethk> Jager-, that I don't know, I don't use it.
[07:27] <bunnythebunny> Does anyone know where i can get rpm2cpio?
[07:27] <frogzoo> justin_: sorry, thought you meant directory size - what's wrong with ls -l ?
[07:27] <eNons3nse> i'm having problems searching for wireless networks.  in the Networking config menu it doesn't show any networks in the area even though I'm positive there are a few, one in the same room even.
[07:28] <ripper> justin try du -h /path/to/directory
[07:28] <sod75> RaiderX: just try installing "unrar" from the repository
[07:28] <alecjw> how do i reset the config for my gnome panels?
[07:28] <Kvek> the reason i'm trying to install Ubuntu 6.06 is i'm tired of win 98
[07:28] <Jager-> Well then in that case, ill go try to resize it to like 67 gb or something
[07:28] <Celldweller> thanks alecjw
[07:28] <sethk> Jager-, try it.  it will tell you, at least, whether size is the root of the problem, or not.
[07:28] <nu> Kvek: what problem(s) are you having?
[07:28] <bunnythebunny> anyone? rpm2cpio?
[07:28] <Jager-> Oh one more thing, how can I get my wireless adapter (Netgear MA101) working with ubuntu?
[07:28] <RaiderX> justin_  ive been trying that, but for some reason, even as the root user, i get an error saying that i cant change ownership o.O
[07:28] <eNons3nse> my wireless was working fine a couple weeks ago.  it found everything automatically.  now it doesn't do that and wont give me any options for networks in the area.
[07:28] <Celldweller> worked perfectly
[07:28] <Kvek> it freezes during the installation process
[07:28] <frogzoo> bunnythebunny: why not alien ?
[07:29] <justin_> RaiderX: Really? weird, perhaps you can try a chmod u+x on the file
[07:29] <afief> frogzoo: any way i can identify the problem?
[07:29] <justin_> ripper: du -h is too cryptic
[07:29] <alecjw> please help me, this is important!
[07:29] <nu> Kvek: do you know which part?
[07:29] <bunnythebunny> frogzoo, well i want to use this klik program and it keeps asking me for rpm2cpio to download a file.
[07:29] <frogzoo> afief: strace might give more info, or try a different burning prog
[07:29] <pequatre> hello. expr 2 * 3 tells me there's a syntax error. What's the pb ? (sorry if i'm dumb)
[07:29] <nu> Kvek: usually it says what it's doing
[07:29] <sethk> RaiderX, you tried    sudo chown whatever filename?

[07:29] <frogzoo> bunnythebunny: just a sec
[07:30] <bunnythebunny> frogzoo, alright.
[07:30] <sethk> bunnythebunny, what about rpm2cpio?
[07:30] <afief> frogzoo: already tried the nautilus built in and gnomebaker. how do i use strace?
[07:30] <LjL> pequatre: try "expr 2 \* 3"
[07:30] <bunnythebunny> sethk, i need to get in order to get klik working
[07:30] <bunnythebunny> get it in order*
[07:30] <LjL> pequatre: i guess the shell is interpreting the "*" as a wildcard
[07:30] <pequatre> LjL, right :)
[07:30] <sethk> bunnythebunny, so install it.
[07:30] <RaiderX> sethk i get "chown: missing operand after `rarlinux-3.5.1.tar.gz'"
[07:30] <justin_> ripper: Because instead of being able to delete and browse contents, I have to memorize all of the big folders and such.. --- and of course it's nice to know simply the "size" but without knowing all the contents I could be deleting the wrong stuff.
[07:30] <eNons3nse> are there problems with wireless network discovering in linux?
[07:30] <bunnythebunny> sethk, can't find it in the repositories and google isn't telling much either
[07:30] <sethk> RaiderX, you entered the command incorrectly.
[07:30] <pequatre> LjL, thx i didn't think of that
[07:31] <RaiderX> this si what i tried:  sudo chown rarlinux-3.5.1.tar.gz
[07:31] <justin_> RaiderX: :p its a Gzip -- you have to gzip it first I believe
[07:31] <sethk> RaiderX, plus you don't want to change the ownership of the tar file
[07:31] <Kvek> any ideas on what i can do ?
[07:31] <frogzoo> bunnythebunny: install pkg 'rpm'
[07:31] <sethk> justin_, tar has a built in convenience feature where you can directly untar from a gzip'd file using z
[07:31] <RaiderX> gzip it? o.o
[07:31] <sethk> RaiderX, no, that's not the problem
[07:31] <justin_> sethk: Yeah, I just realized that now
[07:31] <RaiderX> ok
[07:32] <justin_> What does "." represent in du -h ---- my home folder?
[07:32] <sod75> justin_: current folder
[07:32] <sethk> RaiderX, changing the ownership of the tar file doesn't accomplish anything
[07:32] <Terminus> justin_: the current directory. ie, the one that pwd displays.
[07:32] <bunnythebunny> frogzoo, what do you mean?
[07:32] <RaiderX> ok, well then what should i do?
[07:32] <sethk> RaiderX, particularly, it doesn't change the ownership of the files within the archive
[07:32] <justin_> Alright, du -h is not what I need.. useless ..
[07:32] <sethk> RaiderX, first, extract the files
[07:32] <Morrissey> Hi! I have a ATI Radeon 9000 with fglrx drivers. When I am not running Xgl, I get everything ok from "fglrxinfo" and "glxgears" and DRI is enabled ... but when I log into my xgl verything is very slow, I can see no effects and I get from "glxgears": "Xbfree86-DRI missing on display 1:0" :( Any ideas?
[07:32] <nu> Kvek: usually it says what it's doing
[07:32] <nu> If i downloaded a dont, which dir do i put it in to use it?
[07:32] <RaiderX> i have extracted them
[07:32] <nu> a font*
[07:33] <sethk> justin_, if you want the space used by the entire tree, use du -sh
[07:33] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell nu about fonts | nu, you have a private message from Ubotu
[07:33] <sethk> RaiderX, ok.  is this a source archive?
[07:33] <pequatre> now can anyone help me with this one: `sed -n `expr $i + 4`"p" test.txt | awk -F\" '{print$ 2}'` the problem is the nested " ` " are not parsed correctly. anyone knows how to do ?
[07:33] <Kvek> yeah it goes through the ok bit but gets stuck on the configuring power managment
[07:33] <RaiderX> no, binary
[07:33] <sethk> pequatre, you use   $(whatever) instead of `whatever`
[07:33] <bunnythebunny> frogzoo, i know how to install packages (well i don't, i use alien to turn them into debs, and then install ), but what i don't know is where to get rpm2cpio.
[07:33] <ripper> justin_ du -h will show the directory size and list it
[07:33] <sethk> pequatre, it's a good idea to _never_ use ``, and always use $(...)
[07:33] <sod75> Morrissey: have you started compiz-manager and changed your window manager to xompiz ?
[07:33] <designdream> anyone know of a site such as userscripts but for bash scripts?
[07:34] <pequatre> sethk, of course ! i knew it damnit ! thx :)
[07:34] <Morrissey> sod75, Im using beryl-manager .. not compiz
[07:34] <Morrissey> sod75, do I need compiz instead?
[07:34] <justin_> ripper: Still I have to memorize all of it, I want to browse and delete things I know I do not need -- anyways thanks guys, Im going to try Filelight.
[07:34] <sethk> pequatre, np.  `...` is brain dead c shell syntax  :)
[07:34] <mat1> justin_: wat if i boot ubuntu on my other pc that worked with my ram???\
[07:34] <sod75> Morrissey:no,  same thing
[07:34] <Morrissey> sod75, ok, then yes .. I have started beryl-manager
[07:35] <Kvek> so what can i do?
[07:35] <Morrissey> sod75, it doesnt seem to give me the proper 3d acceleration ..
[07:35] <justin_> mat1: Should if your ram is good on that PC :) if you still reach an error on another PC -- with the same error code, it could be a bad CD -- the 10% :P

[07:36] <sod75> Morrissey: change your window manager vie Beryl-manager to the non gnmoe non-kde one ?
[07:36] <gubluntu> ps -e shows a process called "logger" is that legit or have i been hax0red?
[07:36] <justin_> mat1: Alright then like I said test your ram, thats most likely your problem.
[07:36] <Morrissey> sod75, Ive did that .. its still very slow and all ... (even though I changed the window manager to the kde and the beryl thingy)

[07:46] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell sanitarium about xgl | sanitarium, you have a private message from Ubotu
[07:46] <sethk> tengo
[07:46] <sethk> tengo, sure
[07:47] <sethk> tengo,  by default it is mounted so that only root can access it.
[07:47] <The> sethk, it is asking for my password, but when I type it, nothing comes up.
[07:47] <sethk> tengo, you can use options on the mount command to make the drive files look like they are owned by another user. (other than root, that is, namely, you)
[07:47] <qman|A64z> tengo: the problem is that windows doesn't normally support ext3, and linux doesn't normally support ntfs, so manufacturers use FAT because of it's compatibility
[07:47] <LjL> The: just type the password and press enter. nothing is *supposed* to come up
[07:47] <tengo> sethk, its formatted under ntfs
[07:47] <sethk> The, you get no error messages?
[07:48] <tengo> sethk, which is the windows crap formmat
[07:48] <tengo> tengo, which one should i change it to
[07:48] <sethk> tengo, yes, I know what ntfs is.

[07:51] <sethk> The, if the reconfiguration program is running, just answer all its questions
[07:51] <qman|A64z> Arcy, you should try booting with noacpi...I don't remember the exact syntax
[07:52] <qman|A64z> I think if you press F6 during boot and add "noacpi" to the end
[07:52] <made> I'm trying to track a lost phone via gps before the battery runs out.. any ideas?
[07:52] <sethk> mat1, highly unlikely that it's the motherboard

[07:56] <The> The resolution is the regular monitor type. I need 1280 x 800, widescreen.
[07:56] <sethk> The, ok.  do you mean the program is running and asked you whether to autodetect video hardware?
[07:57] <sethk> The, or are you still getting a different initial screen?
[07:57] <The> no, it does not ask to auto detect.

[07:58] <foo> Ah, there is 190 to 220 processes in uninterruptable sleep (according to vmstat). If I kill apache, that number goes down to 0. So, it has to be apache. What could be causing this? How can I narrow it down? hmm
[07:58] <sethk> Archy, and after that?
[07:58] <Archy> it freezes
[07:58] <Archy> doesnt go on doing anything
[07:58] <The> seth, http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v331/AniCrosserX/Screenshot-3.png
[07:59] <sethk> foo, remember that apache spawns a bunch of processes, and spawns more processes after a certain number of connections.
[07:59] <sethk> Archy, I don't think that message is the reason, because I've seen it come up on other boxes and then just continue.

[08:01] <sethk> The, hmm, find the right driver and select it.  we only want the monitor configuration portion anyway.
[08:01] <foo> sethk: So, you're saying those processes in the uninterruptable sleep are apache spawning his children? Hmm

[08:01] <sethk> Daviey, the host is refusing the connection for some reason.  are you sure XDMCP is enabled on the target machine?

[08:04] <sethk> Daviey, I'm not clear, possibly, on exactly what you are doing.  When I use xdmcp, I use it to get the login screen from the remote machine.
[08:04] <jimmygoon> Terminus: do you know of any other way of "solving" my dilemna?
[08:04] <Archy> sethk u got any other idea that might help me?
[08:05] <sethk> Daviey, I run a local X server, and I start the local X server with an argument telling it the IP of the remove server I want to connect to, and I get the login screen from the remote server.
[08:05] <Daviey> sethk, thats exactly what i want.  But when i select a remote host, screen goes black then returns to the original local login screen

[08:07] <The> sethk, so, which driver would I choose?
[08:07] <sethk> The, hold on a moment
[08:07] <jimmygoon> Terminus: I could... I'm thinking it would be easier just to pass "feh" (the image viewing program) a config file found on the PC... that has a list of the folder/pictures that he wants and then whip together a simple interface for him
[08:07] <The> mkay
[08:07] <sethk> Daviey, but it should be equivalent to what you are doing.
[08:07] <Terminus> jimmygoon: then again, windows can't create symlinks through samba anyway...
[08:07] <Daviey> sethk, so will that pop up on display:0 or a fresh one.  (ie will i need to kill :0?)
[08:07] <sethk> Daviey, it may be a red herring, let me check.
[08:08] <sethk> Daviey, _if_ you do it that way, you are starting an X server and the current one needs to be killed first.  but it should still work the way you are doing it.
[08:08] <sethk> Daviey, it might be good to do it the other way around for troubleshooting purposes, though.
[08:08] <Terminus> jimmygoon: if that's what you want, the only way i see to do it is to make the software for the frame more flexible/user friendly/whatever...
[08:09] <jimmygoon> Terminus: say I've mounted my samba share at "/media/desktop-pc" ... I can create a list of his pictures/folders and call it "/media/desktop-pc/config" and then have FEH load the images from that list.... and then I could throw something together in Visual Basic to let him make that config file or something :S
[08:09] <axisys> what is a good search tool for 10G of compressed data?
[08:09] <Daviey> sethk, what logs can i check.  I have tried it using 2 x edgy (connecting both ways) and using a dapper client to connect to the two.  All work using localhost
[08:09] <jimmygoon> Terminus: yea... its a WIP
[08:09] <sethk> Daviey, you are logging in to the remote server with a userid and password that definitely exists on the remote machine?
[08:09] <axisys> i want users to be able to access it thru web
[08:09] <RaiderX> hah i just installed winrar through wine and it worked :P thansk sethk  and every1 else who helped!
[08:10] <sethk> Daviey, working with localhost suggests that it is a permissions problem.
[08:10] <Daviey> sethk, i'm not getting that far!  It bums out when i select a host
[08:10] <Terminus> jimmygoon: i wouldn't even deal with vb. i'd just cronjob the script that creates the config file, scanning dirs periodically.
[08:10] <sethk> Daviey, oh, ok, sorry, yes, you said that.
[08:10] <alecjw> how do i reconfigure my gnome panel?
[08:10] <Hoagie> Hi. Is there any way to change user details without using the System menu? I tried preventing one user from doing administrative actions, and it seems to have affected both. How do I get my main user back to full rights?
[08:10] <foo> sethk: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33719/ - any ideas on this? Apache is causing there to be processes in uninterruptable sleep. I think I have a hardware bottleneck with disks. I have SATA on this thing... not too sure what's going on.
[08:10] <jimmygoon> ah, thats not the issue... feh will go recursive... I just want to be able to pick and choose what pictures to use without copying them... HD space is (sadly) precious
[08:11] <Terminus> jimmygoon: so all he has to do is stuff the pictures in the appropriate directory. config file gets updated 5 minutes later or something...
[08:11] <sethk> foo, one moment, I'll look but let me answer another question first.
[08:11] <The> sethk, so, which driver would I choose?
[08:11] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: You probally need to boot with the install disk, mount the partition and change the files back
[08:11] <Terminus> jimmygoon: well, you can try to google and find out if there's an article somewhere on how to read .lnk files.

[08:12] <Ernz> Hi everyone am trying to install Ubuntu 6.06 on an older computer with 750Mhz Athlon, 650MB RAM, 64MB NVidia Grphx card. Should this work??
[08:12] <foo> sethk: Sure :) Thanks
[08:12] <Terminus> Ernz: it should.
[08:12] <jimmygoon> Terminus: will do.. then I could just have something that scans the folder (cron) and strips out whatever and replace "C:\Shared\Picutres" with "/media/desktop-pc/" or whatnot.......
[08:13] <Terminus> jimmygoon: yeah... that kind of stuff...
[08:13] <Terminus> jimmygoon: don't you just love windows?! =P
[08:13] <anton_> hi everybody :)
[08:13] <Ernz> Terminus: I am getting to the "This is Ubuntu Live CD." "For the default live system, press ENTER." - But the cursor isn't flashing and nothing happens when I hit ENTER of F1, whats the deal?
[08:13] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Err. You mean the live CD? I'm a total newbie, so I'm not exactly sure how to do that
[08:14] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Yeh the live cd
[08:14] <anton_> doesn't sound good, ernz
[08:14] <jimmygoon> Terminus: :( such a seemingly simple thing...
[08:14] <Ernz> anton_ Suggestions?
[08:14] <Kingsqueak> http://www.kingsqueak.org/stuff/AFGUIDEDMISSILE.wav
[08:14] <anton_> have you tried another live cd? maybe you have some strange hardware
[08:14] <Terminus> Ernz: hmmm... i've never encountered that problem. then again, i never use the livecd.
[08:14] <anton_> maybe try something like dsl to begin with. see if it boots
[08:15] <Ernz> Anton_ I sure do! Some of this stuff is archaic. I will try the install CD.
[08:15] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Alright, I'll give it a go. Cheers
[08:15] <sethk> The, take a look at this url:  http://www.geocities.com/stomljen/
[08:15] <The> ok.
[08:15] <darko3d> how can i backup the programs i installed via add/remove, so i don't have to reinstall them every time i format?
[08:15] <sethk> The, it's relevant to the non-standard (wide screen) resolution that you need
[08:15] <anton_> if you don't mind running the risk of hosing your hard drive, ernz :)
[08:15] <sethk> The, and incidentally should also tell you what driver you need.
[08:15] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: How do I mount the partition, by the way?
[08:16] <RaiderX> hey is there anything like check disk in ubuntu?
[08:16] <Zaggynl> Are the Ubuntu devs aware of the slow burning problem?
[08:16] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: mount /dev/yourpartition /mnt
[08:16] <anton_> once you've installed them darko, that could be difficult (or take a long time). if i remember correctly, there's a how-to somewhere detailing how to turn your computer into an update repository
[08:16] <RaiderX> hey is there anything like check disk in ubuntu?
[08:16] <Terminus> RaiderX: fsck
[08:16] <RaiderX> thx
[08:16] <Ernz> anton_: Ideally I would boot into ubuntu 1st because I need to write a CD of stuff currently on the 20GB HDD.
[08:16] <Terminus> RaiderX: use it carefully. =)
[08:16] <sethk> foo, that doesn't look abnormal to me
[08:17] <kitche> Zaggynl: what are you burning since usually the burning has to deal with how fast your drive can burn data
[08:17] <foo> sethk: CPU Usage: u379.12 s1209.51 cu0 cs0 - 2.04% CPU load
[08:17] <RaiderX> wut woudl be the syntax to check a removable drive?
[08:17] <anton_> ernz: well if it won't boot you're going to have to use plan b :)
[08:17] <sethk> foo, apache always has processes in that mode, that wake up periodically to check for a new connection
[08:17] <Elohimus> I'm having an issue with resolving hostnames to IPs. It takes about 4 seconds to resolve any host. Anything I can do?
[08:17] <darko3d> anton_:do you have any links, until now i only installed xchat
[08:17] <Terminus> RaiderX: normally, you should never need to run it manually. it should automatically run when you boot after an improper shutdown and stuff.
[08:17] <sethk> foo, use ps, you can't really paste the output of top (I think it's top that I'm seeing)
[08:17] <Ernz> anton_ plan B? :S
[08:17] <Zaggynl> kitche, DVDs and CDRs both burn no faster then 3x with every burning app I tried on a 16x DVD Benq burner
[08:17] <foo> sethk: yup, but the processes in interruptable sleep. Oh, yeah, that is top
[08:17] <anton_> darko: i'd have to dig something out... gimme a second
[08:17] <Zaggynl> this thread shows I'm not the only one: v
[08:17] <sethk> RaiderX, I think you mean umount
[08:17] <Zaggynl> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=128721&page=7&highlight=burning+slow
[08:17] <Terminus> RaiderX: depends on the filesystem. fsck won't work if the drive is ntfs
[08:17] <kitche> Zaggynl: and have you choosen 16x as the speed? it might be set at 3x
[08:18] <Zaggynl> kitche, I did choose 16x
[08:18] <sethk> foo, uninterruptable means _externally_ uninterruptable
[08:18] <whta> Hey, can anyone help me to get these ATI drivers installed right? I downloaded the .run file but it's giving me stuff about character codes not being able to be read
[08:18] <sethk> foo, doesn't mean that the process is dead.
[08:18] <anton_> ernz: i dunno :) maybe use a different distribution to boot, or build the hard drive into another computer
[08:18] <RaiderX> Terminus , i need to check an external drive because i deleted a 450mb file through nautilus and it didnt free any space although the file is gone
[08:18] <Ernz> anton_ I think it may be an Ubuntu issue :( I am trying a "Mandriva" liveCD that I just HAPPEN to have and it seems to be booting A-OK.
[08:18] <Terminus> RaiderX: and the drive is ext3?
[08:18] <RaiderX> no
[08:18] <RaiderX> its a memory stick, so fsck wont work?
[08:19] <sethk> Ernz, I'm sure it is a ubuntu issue; that doesn't mean there isn't a workaround.  (nor that it is)
[08:19] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: It says only root can do that..
[08:19] <anton_> cool, ernz :) vive la france!
[08:19] <sethk> RaiderX, the fact that it's a memory stick makes no difference.  what matter is the type of file system
[08:19] <Terminus> RaiderX: well, fsck can do vfat. never used it myself though.
[08:19] <whta> Hey, can anyone help me to get these ATI drivers installed right? I downloaded the .run file but it's giving me stuff about character codes not being able to be read
[08:19] <sethk> Hoagie, only root _can_ do that.  use sudo
[08:19] <RaiderX> yea, i know, i implied that i woudltn format a memory stick in ext3 =p
[08:19] <Ernz> antonanton_:  Maybe I should give Edgy a shot? I think I read that is supposed to have better legacy support?
[08:19] <kitche> whta: why don't you install the ati package?
[08:19] <darko3d>  the Ubuntu software channel that includes 'Terminal Program - Super User Mode' is not enabled.<---how do i enable that
[08:20] <livingtm> where can i get help with udev?
[08:20] <whta> kitche: is that in synaptic? >_>
[08:20] <Terminus> RaiderX: just make sure and use the appropriate fsck. =)
[08:20] <sethk> RaiderX, I format memory sticks with ext3 frequently.  there is no reason not to
[08:20] <kitche> !ati|whta
[08:20] <ubotu> whta: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:20] <anton_> ernz: i'm using edgy myself atm, and it runs okay (not perfect, but okay). but then i never had any problems with drake either
[08:20] <RaiderX> hm
[08:20] <sethk> RaiderX, the only time I use fat is if the stick has to be read by windows
[08:20] <Ernz> anton_ are you using an older machine?
[08:20] <sethk> RaiderX, ext2 is good enough, though.
[08:20] <The> sethk, its really confusing.
[08:20] <strabes> ext2/ext3 can be read/written to by windows
[08:21] <strabes> www.fs-driver.org
[08:21] <anton_> ernz: unfortunately not :( but i have a pentium II from 1997 at home under edgy, and it runs okay :)
[08:21] <phas> hi, i'm trying to make bindings of libid3
[08:21] <RaiderX> well, its a PSP memory stick, the reaosn not to is because the PSP wont uinderstand ext3,  think its fat32
[08:21] <phas> with c2hs
[08:21] <phas> but when i try to comile my lib i get
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[08:21] <sethk> strabes, good point.  it doesn't help, though, if you use a memory card formatted by some device (such as a camera)
[08:21] <phas> c2hs: Error in C header file.
[08:21] <phas> /usr/include/bits/pthreadtypes.h:69: (column 6) [FATAL] 
[08:21] <phas>   >>> Syntax error!
[08:21] <phas>   The symbol `;' does not fit here.
[08:21] <Ernz> anton_ As luck has it, I have a PIII kicking around somewhere ;)
[08:21] <Terminus> RaiderX: well, if you're sure it's fat32, go ahead and use fsck.vfat. just don't blame us if it breaks. =P
[08:21] <yolope> hey i have a problem with ubuntu. when i start up now i get "/usr/sbin/pam_getenv: line 3: =head1: command not found" repeating over and over again and i cant get past it. i've logged in recovery mode and startx... has anyone got any ideas how to fix this?
[08:21] <phas> i seriusly doubt that this library is broken
[08:22] <RaiderX> lol
[08:22] <sethk> RaiderX, I don't know what PSP is, but you are probably correct.
[08:22] <RaiderX> ill chekc to make sure
[08:22] <RaiderX> playstation portable
[08:22] <RaiderX> =p
[08:22] <darko3d>  i'm downloading a software, but i'm getting this:the Ubuntu software channel that includes 'Terminal Program - Super User Mode' is not enabled.<---how do i enable that
[08:22] <sethk> yolope, that's a syntax error; your script wat barfed.  how did you do that?
[08:22] <yolope> if i run pam_getenv from shell now i get the same error
[08:22] <Terminus> RaiderX: fsck.vfat --help to see the options
[08:22] <RaiderX> ok
[08:22] <Ernz> Anyone know what the resident file explorer is in Mandriva???
[08:22] <yolope> dunno, i didnt do anything, i installed some software the correct way
[08:22] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Alright, I mounted it. No error message, so I assume it worked. How do I change user settings?
[08:23] <Terminus> RaiderX: or man fsck.vfat
[08:23] <anton_> ernz: konqueror
[08:23] <cwillu> !cifs
[08:23] <yolope> is it possible to fix it? what would be the best way?
[08:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cifs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[08:23] <sethk> yolope, sorry, I didn't read carefully
[08:23] <cwillu> anybody know where mount.cifs went in edgy?
[08:23] <sethk> yolope, is perl installed on your machine?
[08:23] <Ernz> anton_ So it is...
[08:23] <yolope> yeah, i installed perl yesterday
[08:23] <yolope> sorry
[08:23] <Terminus> !info smbfs edgy

[08:23] <yolope> i installed imagemagick for perl
[08:24] <anton_> ernz: it's a kde installation. konqueror is pretty impressive software :)
[08:24] <mabus> Does ubuntu have a client that can make remote desktop connections to windows?
[08:24] <Terminus> cwillu: should be still in smbfs
[08:24] <sethk> yolope, make sure  /usr/bin/perl   exists
[08:24] <anton_> mabus: vpnclient
[08:24] <cwillu> ahh neat, thanks
[08:24] <Terminus> cwillu: don't take my word for it. i don't run edgy. =P
[08:24] <anton_> mabus: sorry, vncclient
[08:24] <yolope> ahh
[08:24] <sethk> mabus, linux has a windows terminal server client
[08:24] <Terminus> mabus: yes, it does.
[08:24] <yolope> root@earthtone:~# /usr/bin/perl
[08:24] <yolope> /usr/bin/perl: line 1: nice:: command not found
[08:24] <sethk> mabus, then there is also vns, but vnc is a dog.
[08:24] <cwillu> Terminus: no problem;  smbfs just isn't installed by default anymore :)
[08:24] <darko3d> how do i enable univers and multiuniverse?
[08:24] <yolope> yes i have some problems here :/
[08:24] <sethk> mabus, and has to be running at both ends.
[08:24] <Terminus> mabus: go to Applications -> Internet -> Terminal Server Client
[08:24] <Ernz> anton_ Whats the command to mount NTFS hda1?
[08:24] <jimmygoon> How does smbfs compares to CIFS?
[08:24] <cwillu> brief wtf moment copying and pasting in fstab from a different working config :)
[08:25] <sethk> yolope, ok, now you are on track to fix it.
[08:25] <mabus> Terminus: and that's already installed?
[08:25] <jimmygoon> !info cifs edgy
[08:25] <ubotu> Package cifs does not exist in edgy
[08:25] <yolope> hehe i hope, thanks for the pointer
[08:25] <mabus> sethk: vncclient doesn't actually use the RDP though does it?
[08:25] <Terminus> mabus: it should be by default. it's compatible with the RDP windows uses. so you can just setup windows to allow remote connections and you should be able to login.
[08:25] <mabus> Isn't it sort of it's own thing?
[08:25] <cwillu> jimmygoon: cifs is smb, only different
[08:25] <mabus> Terminus: awesome
[08:25] <sethk> mabus, no, it doesn't
[08:25] <anton_> ernz: i imagine mandriva will mount it with a simple mount command
[08:26] <cwillu> a few different options, which I happen to need
[08:26] <sethk> back in a few minutes
[08:26] <Hoagie> How do I change user privilages from the Live CD? Anyone?
[08:26] <sethk> mabus, yes, vnc is separate, and has a windows side and a linux side and you have to run both.
[08:26] <RaiderX> fsck works for fat16?
[08:26] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: There in the file /etc/passwd
[08:26] <sethk> mabus, you also, as I said, have a windows terminal server client
[08:26] <Terminus> mabus: oh, and that client can also connect to vnc. =)
[08:26] <anton_> ernz: if it doesn't, you're in trouble... (missing ntfs libraries)
[08:26] <Ernz> anton_ Only KB working at the mo everything is being done from terminal
[08:26] <sethk> mabus, that's awful syntax, a client for windows terminal server.  :)
[08:26] <The> sethk, its really confusing.
[08:26] <sethk> The, I know.
[08:26] <jimmygoon> cwillu: I was just working on fstab and cifs/smbfs ... and for whatever reason it wouldn't work with fstab unless I used cifs :S
[08:26] <mabus> Terminus: So if I run Terminal Services from ubuntu I can get the graphical output from the serving windows bx?
[08:26] <mabus> s/bx/box/
[08:26] <The> so.. how do i do this.
[08:27] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: And /etc/group, you can add users to the administrator group in there
[08:27] <anton_> ernz: something like mount /dev/hda1 <mountpoint> should work for root :)
[08:27] <sethk> The, I have to go for a bit, but I'll be back.  perhaps someone else can help.  I'm not doing too well with you anyway, unfortunately.
[08:27] <julio1> i need a spanish room
[08:27] <Terminus> mabus: yep. i used to do it a lot.
[08:27] <The> ok.
[08:27] <Terminus> mabus: i don't think audio gets forwarded though.
[08:27] <The> ...so.. can anyone hep me
[08:27] <yolope> cheers sethk, getting there, lots of nice errors :)
[08:28] <anton_> mabus: audio doesn't get forwarded, trust me, i use vnc at work :(
[08:28] <salah> hello. just installed mysql5.0 on a ubuntu-server (dapper 6.10). how do I log in for the first time
[08:28] <mabus> anton_: I'm hoping to use terminal services, not vnc
[08:28] <Ernz> anton_ lol - Drive is empty.
[08:28] <anton_> salah: tricky. have you got a user?
[08:28] <mabus> But when I use RD from windows to windows, I leave sound at the target box anyway
[08:28] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: How do I get into my HD after mounting it? :x
[08:28] <salah> anton_, no, how do I do that?
[08:28] <anton_> mabus: sorry :) i haven't been paying attention :)
[08:28] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: It should show up as the /mnt directory
[08:29] <anton_> salah: there's some good documentation for mysql on the webpage. it can explain it a lot better than me
[08:29] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Aha!
[08:29] <whta> OK, question about this ATI driver.. suposedly it comes with ubuntu, right? but my screen seems sluggish and glxinfo | grep vendor says:  "libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b"
[08:29] <anton_> ernz: what does cat /proc/partitions say?
[08:29] <H3g3m0n> So you probally want to edit /mnt/etc/group find the admin line and add your username after it depending on how you disabled the admin access
[08:30] <Ernz> anton_ Dunno, I just rebooted. I am going to load fail safes on the Mobo and try again. I ahve suspicions that that may be it.

[08:31] <ubotu> zainka: Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[08:31] <anton_> chris_swift_kubu: what does cat /proc/partitions say?
[08:31] <yolope> i think my packages are screwed :( bah, i think fixing this might be bodging it
[08:31] <paitart> hi! i just updated from 6.06 to 6.10 -- i don't notice any changes in the desktop's look. why is that?
[08:31] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> !hardware
[08:31] <ubotu> For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[08:31] <H3g3m0n> Cannon do have some linux drivers around afaik although mt ip1300 didn't when i got it (and it broke like a few weeks later)
[08:31] <H3g3m0n> but they did release some for it
[08:32] <anton_> ubuto: is all printing done with cups, or just network printing?
[08:32] <Jager-> sethk : I tried resizing it to 77 gb... and it still says it cant resize
[08:32] <darko3d> i ran this in the terminal, wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/quinn.key.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add - and i'm getting Connecting to ubuntu.beryl-project.org|80.77.247.17|:80... connected.
[08:32] <darko3d> HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found 19:30:37 ERROR 404: Not Found.  gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
[08:32] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Neither password nor group are in there :S
[08:32] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> anton: What? If your on bout compatabitility I have an idencticle drive that is detected
[08:32] <darko3d> what should i do?
[08:32] <anton_> darko: sounds like you need a pgp key to get in.
[08:32] <Terminus> anton_: ubotu is a bot, and yes, all printing is done through cups. when you use the wizard, it adds the printer in cups.
[08:32] <whta> OK, question about this ATI driver.. suposedly it comes with ubuntu, right? but my screen seems sluggish and glxinfo | grep vendor says:  "libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b"
[08:32] <nub_> i'm trying to install the newer nvidia glx drivers from the nvidia site, and it's hanging on looking for a kernel module. what do i do to fix that?
[08:32] <yolope> thanks
[08:33] <anton_> terminus: thanks :) you learn something new everyday :)
[08:33] <darko3d> anton_: i'm trying to install beryl, and i followed the steps
[08:33] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: The files themselfs? or the admin group isn't in there?
[08:33] <anton_> chris_swift: just wondering if it's recognised by the system
[08:33] <darko3d> on here http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/AiGLX#How-to_install_Beryl_with_AIGLX_on_Dapper
[08:34] <mordof> alright, so i'm on the aspire 5610 notebook, i can't find the page for the compatibility list anymore... anyone know off hand weither dual core AND wireless work on this thing yet?
[08:34] <Terminus> anton_: cups is sweet. i even have windows connecting to it directly. no more messy samba configs. =)
[08:34] <Jager-> Anyone know for sure if a badly fragmented hdd will cause problems when trying to resize it and create a partition?
[08:34] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: The files themselves
[08:34] <dcordes> are there any known issues with ddclient and dyndns.org?
[08:34] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> anton_: It is partitioned ext3 by GParted on this system
[08:34] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: There's no /etc/group and password
[08:34] <anton_> terminus: oh god, i once had to share a printer using samba, it was a nightmare :(
[08:34] <anton_> so where's the problem, chris? :)
[08:34] <nub_> ok, the nvidia installer script is saying that the connection to the nvidia site has timed out, yet i can connect just fine. anybody know what's up?
[08:35] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> I cant access it or find it in my folders
[08:35] <anton_> jager: it'll just take a long time to do
[08:35] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Are you sure your looking at the files on your hdd in /mnt/etc and not the livecd's /etc ?
[08:35] <whta> OK, question about this ATI driver.. suposedly it comes with ubuntu, right? but my screen seems sluggish and glxinfo | grep vendor says:  "libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b"
[08:35] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Also its passwd not password
[08:35] <mordof> nub_, possibly installer script is using an old location to the files... make sure you're using the most up to date drivers...?
[08:35] <Terminus> anton_: just use ipp if all your winboxen are win2k+. winme and below require samba though.
[08:35] <nub_> i just downloaded it today, mordof
[08:35] <coyotex> quick question , how can i add a program in boot time ?
[08:35] <anton_> terminus: the problems are now behind me :) i only use linux and solaris now :)
[08:35] <mordof> k then i have no idea, hehe.. i'm not actually on ubuntu but am trying to get info to see if it will work on my laptop
[08:36] <Terminus> coyotex: update-rc.d if it has an init script, add it to rc.local if it doesn't.
[08:36] <anton_> coyotex: init.d :)
[08:36] <sprizz> question: how can i remove the freeglut3 package without removing x?
[08:36] <Spec> anton_ why solaris?
[08:36] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> anton_: Sorry bout repeat but you may not of noticed I cant access the drive or see any folders for the drive
[08:36] <Quantur> hi folks
[08:36] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> hi
[08:36] <anton_> spec: curiosity. to be honest, gentoo works better on the sun computers i've got...
[08:36] <whta> umm, i have a problem. sound doesn't work in anything but flash
[08:36] <anton_> chris: is the drive mounted?
[08:36] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: I think so. I mounted the drive, and I'm looking in the mnt folder in filesystem
[08:36] <nub_> ok, how can i change my dns servers in the command line?
[08:37] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> anton_: was just going to ask how  to mount
[08:37] <darko3d> any help??
[08:37] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: is the drive ntfs?
[08:37] <Spec> anton_: heh, i installed gentoo on the sun server we got... :p
[08:37] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> Anton_: nope ext3
[08:37] <anton_> chris: a-ha! first one checks to see if the drive is recognised as hardware by the system :) (cat /proc/partitions)
[08:37] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: if it's ntfs, mount it using mount -t ntfs -o umask=0222 /dev/hda /mnt/point
[08:37] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: hmm its possible its hiding them somehow, maby try a looking at them in a terminal as sudo root. If those files arn't on you hdd then you shouldn't even beable to login
[08:38] <anton_> spec: and don't you just feel superior once you've done that :) i had to recompile the kernel 5 times before it booted
[08:38] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: oh... ext3. where'd you mount it?
[08:38] <sprizz> anyone know how to remove the freeglut3 package without removing x?
[08:38] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> I havent yet, asking how to
[08:38] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: permission problem? if so chmod it.
[08:38] <Spec> anton_: it was easy; our sun server has an x86 chipset
[08:38] <Spec> it's not even sparc
[08:38] <anton_> spec: oh :( and i'm struggling with an ultrasparc workstation :(
[08:38] <darko3d> the beryl installation guide, says: Make sure to get the public key for the repository, what does that means?
[08:38] <whta> Sound works only in flash videos. Tried loading an mp3 into xmms and got nothing. any ideas?
[08:38] <Jager-> Anyone know for sure if a badly fragmented hdd will cause problems when trying to resize it and create a partition?
[08:39] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: mount /dev/hda /mnt/point where hda is the drive device node and /mnt/point is where you want it to go.
[08:39] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> I know it's SDB from GParted
[08:39] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: hda1 or whatever i mean. the letter is the drive and the number is the partition
[08:39] <Terminus> !mount | Chris_Swift_Kubu
[08:39] <ubotu> Chris_Swift_Kubu: Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[08:39] <anton_> darko: to limit access to the repository you need a key. getting it shouldn't be a problem, however.
[08:40] <whta> Sound works only in flash videos. Tried loading an mp3 into xmms and got nothing. any ideas?
[08:40] <darko3d> how do i get it?
[08:40] <sorush20> hi I'm being asked for my cups password, what is this password and where is ti?
[08:40] <anton_> darko: that should be mentioned in the documentation, i'd have thought. i'm afraid i can't help
[08:40] <kitche> whta: for mp3 playback you need the mp3 library
[08:40] <paitart> hi! i just updated from 6.06 to 6.10 -- i don't notice any changes in the desktop's look. why is that?
[08:40] <Terminus> Chris_Swift_Kubu: sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb should list all the partitions on that drive and the appropriate device nodes.
[08:41] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> It's a single partition

[08:41] <anton_> sorush: oh cups password. i think you need to configure a superuser for cups. there is a command to do that. don't ask me what it is. try apropos cups and see what gets spat out
[08:41] <Jager-> Im planning on moving all my non-game apps over to linux once i get it installed, and just use windows for games. so after i uninstall all the apps i can use on linux (or open source equivalents) will i be able to reduce the size of the windows partition and give it to linux?
[08:42] <Jager-> and vice-verse (in case i need more room on the windows partition)
[08:42] <Terminus> anton_ and sorush: you have to add the cups user to the shadow group first. it can't read the password otherwise. then you just use your username and password if your user is in the lpadmin group. (it is by default)
[08:42] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: Yes, you can use gparted on the live cd to resize them
[08:42] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: How do I look in sudo root?
[08:43] <Jager-> Well currently i cannot
[08:43] <Jager-> but thats what im trying to figure out
[08:43] <PupenoR> H3g3m0n: can parted resize NTFS ?
[08:43] <anton_> oh cool, thanks terminus :) i've spent my whole life configuring a user to do it...
[08:43] <Jager-> gpart on the live disk gives me an error when i try to shrink the windows partition
[08:43] <nub_> isn't writing to ntfs from linux kind of dangerous to the ntfs data?
[08:43] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Open up a terminal, 'sudo -i', 'file /mnt/etc/groups'
[08:43] <Jager-> soi im going to try to create a partition for linux while im on windows
[08:43] <Terminus> anton_: lol. /etc/shadow is unreadable to anything that's not root or in the shadow group. =)
[08:43] <PupenoR> Jager-: I wouldn't expect (g)parted to be able to resize or modify NTFS partitions in any way.
[08:44] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Thats group not groups sorry
[08:44] <anton_> terminus: it doesn' even make that much sense, if you're root...
[08:44] <whta> Sound works only in flash videos. Tried loading an mp3 into xmms and got nothing. any ideas?
[08:44] <mat1> justin_: u here?
[08:44] <Terminus> anton_: but the cupsys daemon doesn't run as root. more secure that way. hence the need to add it to the shadow group.
[08:44] <Jager-> PupenoR: oh? So then how am I supposed to install linux?...
[08:44] <anton_> terminus: makes sense :) thanks for the tip :)
[08:44] <Terminus> anton_: and it's not in the shadow group by default because of paranoia. ;)
[08:44] <kitche> !mp3>whta
[08:45] <kitche> whta you should of gotten a pm from ubotu
[08:45] <darko3d> Anybody here knows how to get an OpenGPG key for installing beryl?
[08:45] <CharonX> Anyone know of a way to view the httpd.conf file of a running apache service ? (If the httpd.conf files has been deleted)
[08:45] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> thanks guys i have now mounted
[08:45] <Terminus> anton_: np. also, the fact that cupsys doesn't run as root is because of security again. =)
[08:45] <anton_> this shadow stuff can be trouble. i once tried to use yellow pages to manage passwords and stuff. try getting that to export /etc/shadow...
[08:45] <whta> i should have said it's not just mp3s, also ogg files :o
[08:45] <wilee85> where is the modprobe.conf file?
[08:45] <kitche> whta: you have to install the codecs for them
[08:46] <Terminus> anton_: well, only root has rw to shadow...
[08:46] <whta> kitche: doesn't linux come with built in support for free formats..?
[08:46] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Alright, it said "/mnt/etc/group: ASCII text"
[08:46] <kitche> whta: you need the codecs to play them though not sure if ubuntu comes with them by default
[08:46] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: 'gksu gedit /mnt/etc/group'
[08:47] <whta> kithce: the files that came in the UBUNTU EXAMPLES FOLDER had no sound, I'm assuming they were supposed to come with it =\
[08:47] <degus> hi guys!
[08:47] <sprizz> does anyone know how to remove freeglut3 without removing x?
[08:47] <anton_> whta: sounds like your sound isn't working okay. does ubuntu come with alsaconf?
[08:47] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: "GtK - WARNING **: cannot open display:"
[08:48] <whta> anton_: strange thing is some sound works. it's an odd problem. tell me how to check for alsaconf and i'll look >_>
[08:48] <anton_> whta: open a terminal, log in as root and type 'which alsaconf'
[08:48] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Try in a new terminal, I think it lost your display environment variable when you ran sudo -i
[08:48] <Ernz> anton_ Fixed our what my problem was with that boot screen...
[08:49] <heehoww> how can i install libdvdcss on dapper?
[08:49] <anton_> ernz: do tell :) (you didn't have your monitor plugged in?)
[08:49] <whta> anton_: that doesn't give me anything
[08:49] <PupenoR> Jager-: if you only have one big NTFS partition you'll need to backup, destroy and re-install. Alternative I belive there are some othe (proprietary) programs that can let you shrink an NTFS partition.
[08:49] <mats> heehoww: you have to enable the universe-multivere at /etc/apt/source.list
[08:49] <martin_> Nat spricht deutsch?
[08:49] <anton_> whta: then it's not there. mm, sound just worked for me, so i haven't got to grips with installing a sound card in ubuntu
[08:49] <mats> english
[08:50] <abo_> mount.ntfs-use is peaking in top every 3-4 seconds periodically, anyone had this problem before?

[08:50] <Nat_> martin: no in fact
[08:50] <Ernz> anton_ Correction: "Figured". lol - No, bizzarrely enough the USB keyboard works in the BIOS, works with a Mandriva boot, but not with Ubuntu. Very odd. I noticed it when I got a "Disk Read Error" and the thing wouldn't retry when I hit the Any key...
[08:50] <heehoww> mats: how can i do that??
[08:50] <Jager-> Gpart made to 1.4 gb partitions. One is "extened" one is "logical" and the logical is Linux swap2
[08:50] <whta> anton_: the first time i installed ubuntu there were no problems with sound. since then i've reformatted and got a new motherboard so that might be it.. but I don't get why some sound works and other sound doesn't
[08:50] <Jager-> is this normal?
[08:50] <mat1> heehoww i did it already befor u it dont repeat
[08:50] <anton_> whta: it's a complicated world. not all sound cards are the same
[08:51] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Alright, that's opened it... Now do I just add the user to root?
[08:51] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Theres a special admin group
[08:51] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Both of my users are in "adm"
[08:51] <Ernz> anton_ I just degaussed this 21" Compaq MONSTER by accident! Scared the hell out of me!
[08:51] <whta> I would have tried to install linux drivers for my card but I can't find any =\
[08:51] <Jager-> H3g3m0n: How can I go about creating a 10gb partition for linux? It doesnt seem to work in Gpart
[08:51] <Ernz> Thought I was being electrocuted.
[08:51] <heehoww> matl: sorry man....
[08:52] <anton_> ernz: if you have a cat, check to see what its fur is doing :)
[08:52] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Ah, silly me
[08:52] <scheuri> hi all...I have an odd problem with my USB-mass-storage devices lately...from one day to another I can not access them anymore...I plut them in, the usual window pops up, but nothing after...the device is mounted but not accessible with my normal user
[08:52] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: adm isn't admin, check down the bottom
[08:52] <mats> heehoww: hm?
[08:52] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Added it.. Just save and reboot?
[08:52] <mat1> heehoww: its ok:P
[08:52] <Ernz> lol
=== mordof2 is now known as mordof
[08:52] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: Do you have the space free?
[08:52] <Jager-> yea
[08:52] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Yep that should be it
[08:52] <Jager-> about 17 gb
[08:52] <anton_> scheuri: which distribution?
[08:52] <heehoww> mats: i wasnt here when u taught that
[08:52] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Here goes ;)
[08:52] <scheuri> ubuntu 6.06.1
[08:52] <mats> heehoww: oh ;)
[08:52] <scheuri> anton_: ubuntu 6.06.1
[08:53] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: Try cfdisk if gparted isn't working, you will also need to mkfs.ext3 the partition you make in cfdisk though
[08:53] <Ernz> anton_ Thanks for your help there. I think I manage from here.
[08:53] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: Good luck
[08:53] <Jager-> I need two partitions, one for / and one for swap. correct?
[08:53] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: Yep
[08:53] <mat1> any got any ideals on the EIP problem other then ram is not the problem...
[08:53] <anton_> scheuri: strange, i thought problems with usb were ironed out. haven't had any myself for ages. when you put the usb drive in, how is it mounted? (cat /etc/mtab)
[08:53] <Jager-> should i be able to get wireless working while running on the live cd??
[08:54] <darko3d> ok, i had it with this shit, does anybody know wherte i can find a guide on how to install beryl aiglx on dapper, other then the shitty guide on beryl's wiki
[08:54] <Block> is there a way to run mac apps on an ubuntu system?
[08:54] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: If your installing ubuntu then the installer will probally beable to allocate the space to the largest free region on your hdd
[08:54] <scheuri> anton_: funny thing is...my usb-HDD and my usbstick worked like a charm...until a few days ago
[08:54] <scheuri> anton_: same problem with PC at work...but much earlier...did not really bother, thought was another problem
[08:54] <mat1> darko3d: try searching berylonaiglx
[08:54] <ragamuffin> Can i comment out memtest and recovery mode from grub?
[08:54] <Jager-> H3g3m0n: so what option should I chose
[08:55] <anton_> ragamuffin: if you want
[08:55] <mats> Block: why would you do that? :p
[08:55] <mats> Block: then you have to emulate it
[08:55] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: In the installer for using free region or cfdisk for making a new parition?
[08:55] <zainka> I've tried to download some printer drivers from linuxprinting.org, but my Archive manager reported that "Archive type not supported.". I downloaded the "cnijfilter-common-2.60-1.i386.rpm" package + another one (same result for both)
[08:55] <anton_> scheuri: it's probably a rights problem
[08:55] <scheuri> anton_: oh...there is no usb-device in mtab...
[08:55] <Jager-> H3g3m0n: the installer
[08:55] <anton_> scheuri: and you've plugged it in?
[08:55] <Clansman> hola
[08:55] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: It worked! I will love you forever, thanks a load! It makes me happy that people are willing to help someone as dense as me. ;)
[08:55] <Block> emulate it? hmm..
[08:55] <ragamuffin> anton_: I will have to add # in all lines dealing with the respective boot items or only the first line?
[08:55] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: nps =P
[08:55] <scheuri> anton_: I just did...the window popped up.....
[08:56] <jcsteele> on dapper i use to be able to browse the available wireless networks using the "networking" diaglogs in the system menu...now i cannot.
[08:56] <anton_> scheuri: before plugging it in, type tail -f /var/log/messages in a terminal
[08:56] <thompa> checking system monitor I only show 1 cpu
[08:56] <scheuri> anton_: hmm...aye...
[08:56] <jcsteele> does anyone know of a good way to browse the wireless networks available?

[08:56] <anton_> ragamuffin: all lines, i think (grub isn't that intelligent, if i remember)
[08:56] <thompa> anbody know what up with that, I always showed 2 cpus before now one
[08:56] <Jager-> H3g3m0n: whenever I chose "resize (hdd name) and use freed space" it wont let me resize it

[08:57] <pixel> hi
[08:57] <zainka> Archive manager reports for some .rpm's that "Archive type not supported.". I downloaded the "cnijfilter-common-2.60-1.i386.rpm" package + another one (same result for both) from linuxprinting.org
[08:57] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: When you say you have free space, is it free space on a windows/other partition or unpartitioned space?
[08:57] <thompa> do i need to install a different kerenl for duo core?
[08:57] <anton_> liquidboy: windowmaker must have a conf-file. try ls -a in your home directory and look for something like .desktop, or .windowmaker or similar
[08:58] <Jager-> its free space on a windows partition
[08:58] <pixel> Jager-: how you going?
[08:58] <degus> My sound aint working(Creative Soundblaster X FI) ive read that there are no support for it yet(drivers will be availble around sumer 2007)  but now iam just wondering if there is some drivers that acctually works with my sound card? not fully functional just some sound mono or something just so i can listen to music..
[08:58] <Jager-> Hi pixel
[08:58] <dani_> hi
[08:58] <thompa> with the cdrom running i have 100% cpu usage and no 2nd cpu showing, weird

[09:00] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: "ERROR: Extended record needed (1048 > 1024), not yet supported! Please try to free less space."
[09:00] <anton_> pixel: look at run levels in /etc/rc.d
[09:00] <Jager-> H3g3m0n: (Thats an older log, but all Ive done after this is change the size I tried changing the windows partition to)
[09:00] <scheuri> anton_: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33732/
[09:00] <dani_> nem tudtok magyarul beszlni??????????????
[09:00] <H3g3m0n> Jager-: just don't try to free that much space, try a smaller number
[09:00] <mat1> nub_: try searching berylonaiglx
[09:00] <zainka> Is Krusader file manager ported to Ubuntu???
[09:00] <Jager-> H4g3m0n: Ive tried down to 4gb

[09:01] <anton_> scheuri: i can't see your usbdisk anywhere :(
[09:01] <darko3d> the beryl installation guide, says: Make sure to get the public key for the repository, where do i get that?????????????????
[09:01] <gleesond> is there a walkthough for upgrading to edgy from dapper.
[09:01] <pixel> anton_: there is no file called rc.d in my /etc
[09:01] <scheuri> anton_: oh my god....I just checked the /media-directory...there is an file called sda1...if I make a "more" it turns out to be my ddclient-config file

[09:02] <NET||abuse> hey guys,, what would you guys suggest as the best virtual hosting control panel system? Hopefully a free one too :)
[09:02] <anton_> pixel: there's one folder for each run level.

[09:02] <NET||abuse> i'm lookin at ispconfig at the moment, but i would rather check out a few options :)
[09:02] <anton_> scheuri: that doesn't sound good... i'd delete that one

[09:03] <LjL> mat1: wouldn't even know where to start troubleshooting
[09:03] <batrix> can anyone help me on connecting to an access point using iwconfig?
[09:03] <TMX> I've been trying to install ubuntu on my machine, but the xserver doesn't want to work.  It has dual NV 7800GT's. I've poked around using various options on the boot screen, and tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, changing the driver to NV and then VESA, and the colour down to 16 bit, 640x480 and a few other bits, but the result is always the same.
[09:03] <TMX> anyone any ideas?
[09:03] <Jager-> *sigh* defragging takes HOURS :'(
[09:03] <anton_> batrix: start be setting the name using iwconfig <device> essid "name of net"
[09:04] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, what are you defragging, and why?
[09:04] <scheuri> anton_: just deleted the file...now I can manually mount the usb-stick again...but still...after konquerer pops up asking if I want to open a new konquerer for the stick nothing happens...hmmm
[09:04] <H3g3m0n> TMX: Might be worth trying the nvidia binary drivers
[09:04] <scheuri> anton_: I must have been blind...sorry....did recon the file there
[09:04] <TMX> H3g3m0n: sorry, should have said, this is the installation CD
[09:04] <GeForce> TMX: The latest nvidia's drivers's name is nvidia btw, in your xorg.conf
[09:04] <batrix> anton_ ok i got that much
[09:04] <Jager-> nolimitsoya: Aparently that will fix the problem Im having resizing my qwindows partition
[09:04] <anton_> batrix: then set the key, if there is one
[09:04] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, the only linux fs i know ofthat has a defragger would be xfs, and that defragger is both fast and effecient
[09:04] <liquidboy> can anyone tell me what handles the desktop icons in xfce?
[09:04] <TMX> GeForce: sorry, should have said, this is the installation CD
[09:04] <batrix> anton_ there isn't a key
[09:05] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, aha, well, defragging ntfs is painfull :)
[09:05] <GeForce> tmx: oh, you mean on livecd?
[09:05] <Jager-> nolimitsoya: Im on widows defragging.. so that I can resize it using Gpart
[09:05] <TMX> GeForce: yes
[09:05] <Jager-> nolimitsoya: lol yes
[09:05] <anton_> batrix: then start the dhcp client ( i think thats dhcpclient in ubuntu, but i may be wrong)
[09:05] <GeForce> tmx: then you might have to use the Alternate install CD
[09:05] <Jager-> My god my hdd is fragmented
[09:05] <H3g3m0n> TMX: Tried VGA maby? Otherwise might be worth removing one of the cards for installation and instlaling the nvidia driver then adding the other card
[09:05] <Jager-> I havent defragged in like.. 2 yeara lol
[09:05] <anton_> scheuri: well, at least it's working manually.
[09:06] <H3g3m0n> TMX: Its probally possible to use the binary drivers on the live cd anyway
[09:06] <batrix> anton_ is that like dhcpd wlan0?
[09:06] <TMX> VGA mode had the same effect, yeah
[09:06] <sloncho> hi. is there a way to make Totem to autolaunch when I insert DVD?
[09:06] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, check out dirms & buzzsaw. its a free defragger that get the job done in the background, and defrags in a (very thorough) way that reduces future fragmentation
[09:06] <elubie> Hi! I'm trying to install the nvidia-glx drivers on Edgy with the generic kernel (AMD Athlon X2) and it wants to install linux-image-2.6.17-10-386 which I think I don't want?
[09:06] <sloncho> auto launch and auto play
[09:06] <anton_> batrix: dhcpcd eth0, or ath0 or whatever. not wlan0
[09:06] <TMX> H3g3m0n: it can?
[09:06] <scheuri> anton_: well, yes...but now I run into the old rights-problem....only root can mount and access it...:(
[09:06] <GeForce> elubie: Yes you do
[09:06] <Jager-> nolimitsoya: windows apps?
[09:06] <GeForce> elubie: Just means the driver needs an updated kernel
[09:06] <batrix> anton_ i get some licensing thing which i can't use dhcpd
[09:06] <TMX> *fires up lynx and gives it a go*
[09:07] <anton_> scheuri: yep, you're right there :( but you're also at the edges of my knowledge :(
[09:07] <Block> kitche: Yeah, I heard about the switch to intel cpus, but that dosn't make them a pcs in my world. I doubt that apple releases drivers for the mixed hardware in the pc realm..
[09:07] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, it might also be quite a bit faster, if you use the "ugly" (=almost as any other defragger, but slightly better) defrag option, and yes its a windows app :)
[09:07] <H3g3m0n> TMX: livecd should be a fully functional system, just will loose everything when you reboot :)
[09:07] <anton_> batrix: you have to do that as root
[09:07] <TMX> -bash: lynx not found ;_;
[09:07] <scheuri> anton_: well, thank you very much anyway...I am a step closer to a solution for sure
[09:07] <darko3d> the beryl installation guide, says: Make sure to get the public key for the repository, where do i get that?????????????????
[09:07] <batrix> anton_ i am root
[09:07] <TMX> does the livecd come with a text mode browser?
[09:07] <GeForce> tmx: sudo apt-get install lynx
[09:07] <bruenig> TMX, sudo apt-get install lynx, the default text browser is w3m
[09:07] <elubie> GeForce: I think that was why after installing them once ubuntu only recognized one processor
[09:08] <TMX> ah, of course
[09:08] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, dirms is a defrager, and buzzsaw is a background realtime defragtool making sure you never have to bother with defraging again

[09:08] <degus> after installing nvidia kernel and glx do i have to reboot?
[09:08] <TMX> *hasn't used ubuntu in a while*
[09:08] <batrix> anton_ oh shit lol i'm in the wrong channel i'm trying to do this for slackware sorry hehe
[09:08] <TMX> I'd forgotten how simple software installation was :)
[09:08] <H3g3m0n> Personally i prefer elinks and links2 over lynx
[09:08] <anton_> batrix: okay :) lots of fun with slackware :)
[09:08] <GeForce> Elubie: well, if it stops recognizing your 2 cpus, from the boot screen, you can switch back
[09:08] <barrett9h> TMX: try links
[09:08] <barrett9h> it was installed here by default
[09:09] <TMX> nah, no links either
[09:09] <barrett9h> iirc
[09:09] <anton_> degus: you have to restart x-windows. the kernel module should be loaded automagically
[09:09] <Jager-> nolimitsoya: Awesome! Thanks :)
[09:09] <NET||abuse> hmm, i have apache2 and openssl, but do i also need an apache-mod-ssl package to run ssl certificates?
[09:09] <elubie> GeForce: ok, will try then, thanks for the help
[09:09] <NET||abuse> i don't see it anywhere in the deb's

[09:10] <Hoagie> Alright, different issue I'd like to sort! Do you -need- an internet connection to install programs? I mean, is it possible to download them on this computer, and transfer them to my ubuntu machine to install? I've not had the time/money to go out and buy a router yet
[09:10] <darko3d> no, it's not
[09:10] <barrett9h> is there an easy way to setup internet connection sharing with bluetooth?
[09:10] <Hoagie> But I'd quite like to get some swanky Gdesklets and such going
[09:10] <darko3d> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/AiGLX
[09:10] <elubie> GeForce: :)
[09:10] <GeForce> tmx: FYI btw, the way I installed the nvidia drivers was to do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx, but I have no idea if it works on a live cd
[09:10] <dabaR> hey, did you know that suckas pack yo' shi%?
[09:11] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: You can just download the .deb files
[09:11] <TMX> GeForce: ty, I'll give that a try before I do it manually
[09:11] <anton_> okay, everybody. i'm rebooting into mandriva. see you later :)
[09:11] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: http://packages.ubuntu.com/
[09:11] <ink251> what ubuntus default porn browser?
[09:11] <GeForce> tmx: yeah it's sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx, then sudo nvidia-xconfig
[09:12] <mborohov> hey guys
[09:12] <ink251> hey
[09:12] <GeForce> tmx: Litttle warning tho. I dunno if they support Crossfire (or nvidia's equivalent) in linux yet
[09:12] <w30> ink251, xxxorg
[09:12] <ink251> heh ok
[09:12] <darko3d> the beryl installation guide, says: Make sure to get the public key for the repository, where do i get that. it's not in the tutorial http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/AiGLX
[09:12] <Hoagie> H3g3m0n: Ah, nice! Thanks again!
[09:12] <mborohov> im having issues getting compiz to work, is there a tutorial of sorts on the web? i suppose its easiest to do it through AiGLX? then again, i dont really know very much about compiz.
[09:12] <TMX> GeForce: SLI isn't supported, but it falls back to single mode nicely, or it did in 5.10
[09:12] <ink251> yeah i did it through aiglx
[09:13] <GeForce> tmx: oh ok
[09:13] <H3g3m0n> Hoagie: The main problem with doing it that way is dependencies though, if you have another ubuntu install thats the same verison/arch you can install the programs on that and then copy all the /var/cache/apt files across
[09:13] <mborohov> oh, and im running edy
[09:13] <mborohov> edgy*
[09:13] <GeForce> mborohov: Which video card are you using?
[09:13] <sc0tty> is there a guid to install ubuntu booting from something else than a cd ?
[09:13] <darko3d> the beryl installation guide, says: Make sure to get the public key for the repository, where do i get that. it's not in the tutorial http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/AiGLX
[09:14] <flugh> darko3d, it says right below 'get the key' a commandline to import the key
[09:14] <mborohov> GeForce: I'm using a...
[09:14] <mborohov> nVidia Corporation GeForce Go 6200 TurboCache
[09:14] <mborohov> says lspci
[09:15] <flugh> darko3d, the .asc file is an ascii file with the public key of the person responsible for signing the packages. it's piped to apt-key and added to your keyring
[09:15] <nolimitsoya> does anyone know of a good(=fast, fully functioning and unbloated), gui bittorrent client that can be configured to automaticaly load all torrents within a specified directory? preferably gtk, but qt as acceptable
[09:15] <nolimitsoya> *is acceptable
[09:15] <mournsanity> anyone know where I can download the source for the wanda fish applet
[09:15] <bruenig> utorrent

[09:16] <GeForce> but it works ok now
[09:16] <aldo> hi
[09:16] <mborohov> i dont know how to set it up is the main issue

[09:16] <GeForce> mborohov: might wanna check #ubuntu-xgl
=== DreamSlayer is now known as GrimWald
[09:16] <mborohov> are you using compiz or beryl?
[09:16] <flugh> mournsanity, do you have source repository entries enabled for apt? apt-get source 'package' should work (forgive me if it doesn't, been away from ubuntu/debian/apt a while :))
[09:16] <nolimitsoya> bruenig, thats what im using now, but id like a linux naitive app. besides, it doesnt seem to accept incoming connections in linux through wine, though is does in windows
[09:16] <zebulon25> Hi
[09:16] <barrett9h> how do I setup internet connection sharing with bluetooth?
[09:16] <bruenig> nolimitsoya, works great here, but perhaps I got lucky
[09:16] <mournsanity> thanks flugh, ill try it
[09:17] <fourat> when i plug a hard disk on the IDE interface, ubuntu freezes, is there anyway to hot-plug it ?
[09:17] <nolimitsoya> bruenig, what version of wine are you using?
[09:17] <ink251> get a usb mount
[09:17] <aldo> do you know what's the command to check and repair a damaged filesystem from a live cd?
[09:17] <bruenig> 0.9.22
[09:17] <darko3d> flugh:i ran that from the beginning andf i got, HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found 20:14:24 ERROR 404: Not Found.  gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
[09:17] <mat1> u cant hot-plug a ide
[09:17] <nolimitsoya> fourat, pata (if thats what you mean by ide) are not generaly hotswapable.
[09:17] <TMX> GeForce: that works a treat, ty, albeit the the screens are the wrong way around, but I think I can live with that for 15 minutes while I finish installing :P
[09:18] <GeForce> tmx: YAY I fixed a problem! :) gl
[09:18] <flugh> darko3d, back up to the front page of that site, they have a corrected command to import the key (i just checked it)
[09:18] <ryanakca> how do I find out what port a service runs on again? grep svn /etc/?
[09:18] <thompa> the generic kernel does not work, im only showing one cpu
[09:18] <flugh> ryanakca, /etc/services
[09:18] <ryanakca> ty
[09:18] <aldo> nobody knows?
[09:19] <nolimitsoya> thompa, you would want the server/smp kernel, wouldnt you?
[09:19] <newpZ> what is the best method to convert a xvid/divx file into a dvd and burn? tovid+k3b?
[09:19] <thompa> nolimitsoya: ill try that
[09:19] <nolimitsoya> newpZ, devede :)
[09:19] <newpZ> nolimitsoya, havent heard of that... looking it up now!
[09:19] <thompa> nolimitsoya: i did have 2 cpus showing the last time i installed ubuntu and it was generic kernel
[09:19] <nolimitsoya> newpZ, apt-get
[09:19] <newpZ> looks PERFECT!
[09:19] <newpZ> thanks!
[09:19] <some> Hello, is it possible to make the livecd to be shared for pxe client? I a laptop without cdrom which i want it to boot on the livecd
[09:20] <nolimitsoya> thompa, yes, but that would have been the smp version of a generic kernel
[09:20] <GeForce> tmx: BTW, FYI, if u fizzle in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you can swap the screens around, should be relatively easy (There might also be an option in Gnome, no idea tho)
[09:20] <jamesb2147> anyone know why it prompts for a password whenever i use a sudo command?
[09:20] <bruenig> !sudo | jamesb2147
[09:20] <thompa> maybe so whcih should i choose  smp?
[09:20] <ubotu> jamesb2147: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:21] <GeForce> jamesb2147,  to simplify it, sudo  = SuperUser Do
[09:21] <bruenig> jamesb2147, because the command needs root privileges. It is a safety precaution so that people don't get on your computer and just start deleting and destroying everything
[09:21] <thompa> nolimitsoya: right now im locking up on 100% cpu if i even play a cd
[09:21] <nolimitsoya> thompa, the ending just tells you about compile-time optimizations. -generic is meant to replace all the -686, -k7 and so on using modules instead, but i dont think is has smp support built in. i dont even think its possible todo so...
[09:21] <mat1> jamesb2147: use ur password:P
[09:21] <wilee85> anyone know where I can find the modprobe.conf file?
[09:21] <TMX> GeForce: yeah, it happens on all distro's I've usd, it's simple to fix tho.  No GUI tool to do it yet though
[09:21] <thompa> nolimitsoya: the generic kernel should have smp
[09:22] <GeForce> tmx: lol I always free a partition in Windows before installin linux
[09:22] <pixel> is there a plugin for Firefox that supports resume downloads from websites please?
[09:22] <nolimitsoya> pixel, flashgot
[09:22] <GeForce> All I do is tell it: "Use the free partition space"
[09:22] <thompa> nolimitsoya: linux-686-smp obsoleted by genric it says
[09:22] <bruenig> flashgot requires a download manager though, I think
[09:22] <TMX> *has no spare partitions
[09:23] <thompa> nolimitsoya: i can install it and see what happens
[09:23] <nolimitsoya> thompa, then im in at the deep end :)
[09:23] <GeForce> tmx: Then bend over and pray! lawls
[09:23] <barrett9h> flashgot + freeloader?
[09:23] <pixel> nolimitsoya: thanks

[09:23] <thompa> nolimitsoya: i think something is wrong either in hardware detection or my hardware maybe, but it worries me
[09:24] <GeForce> uh-huh
[09:24] <GeForce> And you are an unofficial user now eh? lol
[09:24] <TMX> so they gave me a free copy of the version to be released in 4 days time :)
[09:24] <GeForce> ah ok lol
[09:24] <sloncho> hi. is there a way to make Totem to autolaunch when I insert DVD?
[09:24] <thompa> nolimitsoya: im going to go back to kanotix and see if it detects 2 processors
[09:24] <GeForce> I personnally am not using vista yet. Waiting for January.
[09:24] <GeForce> And hell, Ubuntu is helping me greatly in my Vista craving
[09:25] <TMX> GeForce: I was going to wait, but I like playing with shiny new things :)
[09:25] <GeForce> Ubuntu + AIGLX ftw
[09:25] <qman|A64z> ok...I attempted to put the ubuntu live CD on my usb stick, but I'm having problems
[09:25] <GeForce> Yeah I know the feeling
[09:25] <qman|A64z> I followed a guide for knoppix
[09:25] <jamesb2147> vista really isn't great.  can't even burn a dvd properly yet
[09:25] <Wyvern|> Does anyone have experience with installing a printer on Ubuntu server?
[09:25] <TMX> jamesb2147: did for me :)
[09:25] <GeForce> tmx: When you say that not too long ago, I almost felt like wiping XP and reinstalling ME just to see a good ol' BSOD...
[09:25] <qman|A64z> my stick is bootable, it contains the entire live CD
[09:25] <nolimitsoya> qman|A64z, dont. follow the ubuntu guide in the wiki instead
[09:25] <qman|A64z> where is that
=== Smoki is now known as lamez
[09:25] <qman|A64z> because I can't find it
[09:26] <GeForce> qman|A64z, : That's wrong in a couple of ways :D
[09:26] <Jager-> I hope vista turns out good, but Id still rather see linux preinstalled on factory built machines
[09:26] <TMX> GeForce: if you miss the BSOD's there is a registry patch you can add to make it BSOD on demand :)
[09:26] <nolimitsoya> qman|A64z, besides, many motherboards cant boot from usb correctly, so your stick might be just fine - and still not working
[09:26] <qman|A64z> no
[09:26] <qman|A64z> it boots
[09:26] <GeForce> tmx: haha yeah I know
[09:26] <Cosmonaut3030> Hello. Can someone help me set up my IPW card?
[09:26] <qman|A64z> but, it can't find the kernel image
[09:26] <qman|A64z> it says /casper/.vml not found
[09:26] <qman|A64z> I have it booting and it has the ubuntu logo and all that
[09:26] <elubie> GeForce: The X-Server didn't start after I installed nvidia-glx and booted into generic. Error message was something like The NVIDIA is kernel module version 1.0_8774 and the X module version is 1.0_8776
[09:27] <Cosmonaut3030> Hello. Can someone help me set up my IPW card?
[09:27] <jamesb2147> i got a couple burnt, but as soon as my C:/ drive had less than 5 gbs avail, it all went kaput
[09:27] <qman|A64z> I can't use the CD to install, it refuses to work
[09:27] <GeForce> elubie: Hmmmm, the nvidia-module is of a higher version, odd
[09:27] <qman|A64z> so I need a guide to put it on my USB stick
[09:27] <qman|A64z> I had 6.06 running on this same machine already, upgraded from 5.10
[09:28] <jamesb2147> it also wouldnt let me switch to my E:/ drive to store temp files.  D:/ it would, but not E:/, which had 28gbs free
[09:28] <cmweb> Can any one help me install dhcp support on my PC?
[09:28] <GeForce> elubie: Wait, reinstall the nvidia-glx with the new kernel, that might be it
[09:28] <mat1> n why couldnt u do dist-upgrade?
[09:28] <qman|A64z> it didn't work
[09:28] <qman|A64z> I ran dist upgrade and it simply didn't uprade
[09:28] <qman|A64z> upgrade
[09:28] <elubie> GeForce: eh the other way round, nvidia is lower version
[09:28] <qman|A64z> no errors
[09:28] <qman|A64z> just didn't do it
[09:28] <qman|A64z> I had a couple other broken things anyway and wanted to start fresh
[09:28] <GeForce> elubie: Then sorry, I got no idea.... I just know that's how I did it
[09:28] <mat1> u try sudo dist-upgrade?
[09:29] <qman|A64z> I know how to dist upgrade
[09:29] <nolimitsoya> ok, anyone else got a good suggestion for a linux native, non bloated torrent client that can load torrents from a directory automaticaly?
[09:29] <elubie> GeForce: np, might try to install nvidia-glx again
[09:29] <TMX> hmm, I wish the installer would tell you how big each mountable partition is when choosing the mount point.  Now I have to play a game of "guess which drive I am"
[09:29] <qman|A64z> that's irrelevant now anyway, because the disk is already reformatted
[09:29] <TokenBad> ok has something got changed for rar files...i tried to install rar but got not found..
[09:30] <GeForce> elubie: inside the new kernel tho. If you do it on the old kernel, it wont work, I think
[09:30] <qman|A64z> I need to get the live CD booting from my USB stick
[09:30] <nolimitsoya> TokenBad, no, nothing has changed. shows up just fine on an apt-cache search
[09:30] <qman|A64z> and I can't find a guide for ubuntu
[09:30] <TokenBad> I did apt-cache and it says not there....
[09:30] <TMX> nolimitsoya: I think azureus can do the autoloading, but it's quite heavy
[09:30] <qman|A64z> I found one for gentoo which is useless and one for knoppix which got me where I am
[09:30] <Jager-> nolimitsoya: does dirMS usually perform faster than the windows defragger?
[09:31] <nolimitsoya> TokenBad, then you havnt got the right repos
[09:31] <elubie> GeForce: hmm, that would mean the module on the generic kernel is older than the one on the 386 kernel
[09:31] <nolimitsoya> TMX, yes, know. that why i added the 'non bloated'-line. thank anyway. :)
[09:31] <cmweb> Can any one help me install dhcp support for my ethernt network?
[09:31] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, in my experience, yes
[09:31] <Jager-> -_-
=== keegan_ is now known as KeeganX
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, unless you do the thorough defragmentation... that takes ages, but reduces future fragmentation a great deal
[09:32] <TokenBad> nolimitsoya, I find unrar...but not rar...I used to use rar
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> TokenBad, as i said, open the right repos and you find it just fine :)
[09:32] <TokenBad> nolimitsoya, I have them all open...I just did that...
[09:32] <jamesb2147> how do i exit X server?
[09:32] <TokenBad> and updated
[09:32] <Farhad> with witch command I can find bad sectors on my hard disk?
[09:33] <Jager-> Ah dirms isnt freeware
[09:33] <cmweb> !dhcp
[09:33] <ubotu> dhcp: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0pl5-19.4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 108 kB, installed size 308 kB
[09:33] <GeForce> elubie: I know that when u install the driver, it installs a kernel module. If the module is installed on the wrong kernel.....
[09:33] <GeForce> o well'z
[09:33] <ryanakca> is there a good frontend to iptables?
[09:33] <mat1> jamesb2147 try ctrl +alt+backspace
[09:33] <nolimitsoya> TokenBad, still shows up just fine here. are you using dapper, or edgy? anyway, i find p7zip-full to be a much moreattractive piece of software
[09:34] <sukeltje> hi
[09:34] <TokenBad> nolimitsoya, dapper
[09:34] <Farhad> How I can find bad sectors on my hard disk?
[09:34] <nolimitsoya> Jager-, yes it is. you register for free, but have to renew the registration every month unless you pay a small fee
[09:34] <mat1> scandik
[09:34] <nolimitsoya> TokenBad, ah, then i cant check for you... might be they took it out of dapper for some reason
[09:35] <nolimitsoya> ryanakca, firestarter for a simple, user friendly gtk version, and shorewall for more advanced configuration
[09:35] <sukeltje> i have a question about a plugin, i found this on e107coders.org, the article name is: Submit Article - v1.0. I have a problem with it, i can submit an article, and accept it. Than it tells me it has been written to the database. But i dont know how to make: new article catagory's nor where to get the articles page where they are shown? any1 knows this plugin or can help me with it?
[09:35] <Varjat_by> HI! Is anybody know how to fix problem during LIRC driver compilatuin process. Error is "/bin/sh: scripts/genksyms/genksyms: No such file or directory"
[09:35] <Varjat_by> ?
[09:36] <eNons3nse> ok.  i'm having a wifi problem.  i can use a wired connection straight to my router just fine.  i can connect to my wireless router just fine and network-manager even says i'm at 95-100% signal strength.  when i'm connected to wireless though my desktop internet doesnt work.  almost like i don't really have a connection.  everything worked fine with my wireless a couple weeks ago.
[09:36] <nolimitsoya> eNons3nse, sounds like a dns/router problem to me, and not an ubuntu one...
[09:36] <qman|A64z> eNons3nse: is your DNS set up correctly?
[09:36] <TMX> eNons3nse: can you ping the router?
[09:37] <Farhad> I want help!!!! How I can find bad sectors?
[09:37] <nolimitsoya> Farhad, scandisk
[09:37] <Jowi> eNons3nse, see if another channel on the router works better. might be interference

[09:37] <Mongey> how do i disable Ipv6 ?
[09:37] <eNons3nse> I don't know anything about changing DNS settings.  How do I ping my router?  like I said, up untill about a week and a half ago my wireless was working fine straight out of the box.
[09:37] <jamesb2147> oh how i long for the days of ctl alt del...  i need to know how to properly install 3d acceleration nvidia drivers
[09:38] <TMX> eNons3nse: open up a shell, type "ping " then the address of the router
[09:38] <ompaul> !nvidia | jamesb2147
[09:38] <ubotu> jamesb2147: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:38] <TMX> then execute it
[09:38] <degus> how do i do to  get wpa_supplicant to run automaticly when i start my computer (seems like i have to manually run wpa everytime to get my wireless to start
[09:38] <Mongey> !ipv6
[09:38] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[09:38] <Farhad> nolimitsoya, Thanks
[09:38] <Mongey> !permissions
[09:38] <ubotu> The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[09:38] <elubie> GeForce: It worked! I just found out that there were newer linux-generic-restricted modules in the repo. After updating that it worked! Yikes!
[09:38] <TokenBad> nolimitsoya, got it from rar website but it don't allow me to install it...just lets me run it from the extracted dir
[09:38] <yakumo> hi, how do install grub?
[09:38] <eNons3nse> TMX: would that be 192.168.100.1?
[09:39] <elubie> GeForce: so, many thanks :)
[09:39] <GeForce> elubie: grats :)
[09:39] <TMX> yup, so run "ping 192.168.100.1"
[09:39] <Jowi> !grub | yakumo
[09:39] <ubotu> yakumo: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[09:39] <eNons3nse> ok.  one sec i have to connect to it so i'll loose this connection.
[09:39] <nolimitsoya> TokenBad, you could get over to #ubuntu-motu and ask them what they did to your package :)
[09:39] <TMX> ok
[09:39] <TMX> you should see something like :
[09:39] <TMX> 64 bytes from 66.102.9.104: icmp_seq=3 ttl=244 time=171.057 ms
[09:40] <TMX> (except that was me pinging google, not your router:))
[09:40] <yakumo> if install windows my grub will be lost right?
[09:40] <TMX> yes
[09:41] <TMX> if you create a boot floppy though, you can reinstall it
[09:41] <Zaggynl> better install windows, then linux :)
[09:41] <nolimitsoya> how do i "alt+f4" an application in a terminal/console?
[09:41] <Zaggynl> nolimitsoya, CTRL-C should do
[09:41] <Jowi> yakumo, not quite. your MBR will be overwritten but that can be fixed. see the grub page here
[09:41] <Jowi> !grub

[09:41] <Zaggynl> nolimitsoya, You're welcome.
[09:41] <grego> van itt magyar?:-)
[09:41] <yakumo> thnks
[09:41] <anton_> (alt + f4?)
[09:42] <eNons3nse> TMX: I guess not.  I kept getting "Destination Net Unreachable" errors.
[09:42] <GeForce> Damn, Steam seems to have crashed X
[09:42] <GeForce> :(
[09:42] <TMX> eNons3nse: sounds like a problem with the router is most likely, has somebody mucked about with the wirless settings maybe?
[09:43] <wilee85> how to I make it so a service automatically starts when the computer does?
[09:43] <Jowi> eNons3nse, try with another channel on the router
[09:43] <sukeltje> hey is there any1 here that is good with plugins?
[09:43] <TMX> sukeltje: plugins for what?
[09:43] <Zaggynl> anton_, (What you do in windows to shutdown an application)
[09:43] <Kalist00> does anyone know if ATI drivers support dual screen with DRI?
[09:43] <Jowi> eNons3nse, for example, if you use 6 now, set it to 3 or 9 or something. after that restart the wifi on the router and try again.
[09:43] <conor> !ipv6
[09:43] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[09:44] <eNons3nse> TMX:  actually.  I've never been able to change my wireless settings from the default.  the default admin password/username dont work.
[09:44] <mborohov> anyone know why some things are just plain black in beryl?
[09:44] <sukeltje> TMX: for e107 :P can you help me with that?
[09:44] <mborohov> like the menu?
[09:44] <eNons3nse> Jowi, how do I do that?
[09:44] <eNons3nse> TMX: so i can't get into the settings inside my router, but no one else can either.
[09:44] <eNons3nse> TMX: since no one knows the name/password.
[09:45] <conor> y0 i need ipv6 help
[09:45] <sukeltje> TMX: i have a question about a plugin, i found this on e107coders.org, the article name is: Submit Article - v1.0. I have a problem with it, i can submit an article, and accept it. Than it tells me it has been written to the database. But i dont know how to make: new article catagory's nor where to get the articles page where they are shown? any1 knows this plugin or can help me with it?
[09:45] <Jowi> eNons3nse, depends on the router. log in to it. if you can not login with the default username/password there is always a way to physically reset it.
[09:45] <thinh> i have a question
[09:45] <TMX> sukeltje: I'm afraid I've never used it, I'm a wordpress kinda guy :)
[09:45] <wilee85> how to I make it so a service automatically starts when the computer does?
[09:46] <thinh> on my computer i have 2 floppy
[09:46] <TMX> eNons3nse: it could be that someone has gained access to the router wirelessly and guessed the username and pass
[09:46] <thinh> floppy1 and a floppy drive
[09:46] <Jowi> wilee85, see update-rc.d
[09:46] <eNons3nse> Jowi: it's a linksys wrt54g and admin/admin doesn't work for the user/pass.  i tried pushing the reset button on the back and it still doesn't work.
[09:46] <thinh> floppy 1 is pointing to /dev
[09:46] <TMX> eNons3nse: I have one of those, its blank user, password admin
[09:46] <dot_j> wilee85: or system->prefs->session->startup tab
[09:47] <anirban> How can I install Baghira theme for KDE
[09:47] <sukeltje> TMX: no problem, do you know a different plugin that can do this: i want a plugin that lets members sumbit articles, witch have to be accepted by an admin. When they are added they come in a list witch can also be shown as a link in my menu, and preferably it should be possible to make article catagory's
[09:47] <conor> ok, my ipv6 problem, i deleted 2 things in my network settings... they had ipv6 on them
[09:47] <anirban> can I use apt-get
[09:47] <TMX> sukeltje: fraid not :(
[09:47] <thinh> i cant access floppy 1 but when i do properties on it it says it 182gb which is the size of my drive
[09:48] <Jowi> eNons3nse, leave the username field blank and enter "admin" without quotes as the password
[09:48] <eNons3nse> TMX:  i'll try that.  so once i'm there I should try to change the channel that it's running on?
[09:48] <TMX> change the channel, double check the settings are what you expect them to be
[09:48] <eNons3nse> ok.  back in a few.
[09:48] <TMX> and if it's been left at the default settings, it's ip address should be 192.168.1.1
[09:48] <sukeltje> TMX: darn, np... do you know a site that has GOOD easy plugins?
[09:49] <thinh> anyone help me with a floppy 1 issue
[09:49] <sgirc> hi all
[09:49] <matroblend> Can you remame a backup conf file from live cd?
[09:49] <qman|A64z> as long as the file is on a supported filesystem on a rewritable media
[09:50] <Jowi> matroblend, is the conf file on the harddisk?
[09:50] <sgirc> what is the command to plug /unplug a usb device (a modem i.e.) ?
[09:50] <matroblend> yes
[09:50] <conor> how do i reset my network settings to default ?
[09:50] <TMX> sukeltje: best bet is to see if there is an irc channel for e107 users, get their opinion
[09:50] <Jowi> matroblend, yes you can.
[09:50] <sukeltje> omg
[09:50] <anirban> I got it apt-get install kwin-baghira
[09:51] <TMX> sukeltje: try #e107
[09:51] <sukeltje> this is the ubuntu channel :P ROFL i didnt even see that!!! thought i joined #e107! ROFL :P HAHA ty anyway :D
[09:51] <sgirc> i just know lsusb that lists all connected usb devices
[09:51] <TMX> lol :D
[09:51] <matroblend> If I try to rename backup it says I can't write
[09:51] <sukeltje> yes, thanks :P omg STUPID ME :P hehe
[09:51] <sewoyl> sgirc: I was surprised too the first time^^
[09:51] <thinh> i have a floppy 1 that is point to /dev the size is 182gb which is the size of my hd, should that be my file system or hd?
[09:51] <sewoyl> i meant sukeltje
[09:51] <Jowi> matroblend, open a terminal and type "sudo -i" to get a root prompt. now you can rename it with "mv oldname newname"
[09:51] <sukeltje> rofl :P
[09:51] <sgirc> sewoyl: and now ?
[09:52] <cmweb> Ok i installed the DHCP and it failed to start up any one?
[09:52] <sewoyl> sgirc: i didnt mean you, sorry :)
[09:52] <sgirc> ok
[09:52] <eNons3nse> TMX & Jowi:  that doesn't work.  still can't get into my router settings.  tried the routers reset button as well.
[09:52] <sewoyl> sgirc: what r you trying to do ? i just got here
[09:52] <ciaron> once i've booted off my ubntu live cd
[09:52] <ciaron> how do i mount my windows drives?
[09:52] <matroblend> Jowi Ty I can do that from a live cd?
[09:52] <TMX> eNons3nse: ah, if you've reset it that completely wipes the routers memory
[09:53] <sewoyl> ciaron: arent they mountent automatically ?
[09:53] <ciaron> no
[09:53] <TMX> eNons3nse: the essid will be linksys now, with no encrption
[09:53] <ciaron> and when i try and browse it in "Places" it gives some error about it not being removable
[09:53] <Jowi> matroblend, yes
[09:53] <Jowi> matroblend, you need to mount your hard disk partition first but that's it
[09:53] <sewoyl> ciaron: forst,create a folder for each windows drive in /media/
[09:53] <ciaron> ah its a 6.06 "feature"
[09:53] <matroblend> Jowi k will try
[09:53] <eNons3nse> TMX: maybe the reset didn't work then because it's still coming up as the old name for the router.
[09:54] <mborohov> hey guys
[09:54] <mborohov> so i have beryl sort of working
[09:54] <mborohov> except now every single window i open is black
[09:54] <mborohov> any ideas?
[09:54] <sgirc> sewoyl: when I lust want to safely unplug my usb modem so thaht next time I plug it is automatically recognized
[09:54] <TMX> eNons3nse: are you connected to it by wires?
[09:54] <Jowi> eNons3nse, if the reset worked its ip address should be 192.168.1.1
[09:54] <sgirc> sewoyl:  I just want to safely unplug my usb modem so that next time I plug it, it is automatically recognized
[09:55] <sewoyl> sgirc: sorry I have no experience with usb modems whatsoever, always had ethernet modems :s
[09:55] <sewoyl> sgirc: which by the way, should be the onlymodems manufactures ^^
[09:55] <sewoyl> manugactured*
[09:55] <thinh> can i delete a device that is pointing /dev?
[09:55] <eNons3nse> TMX: no.  when i'm on this wired connection i'm running an ethernet cord straight from my modem.
[09:55] <mirak> FATAL: Error inserting lirc_serial (/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/misc/lirc_serial.ko): Device or resource busy
[09:55] <mirak> how can I know wich module is blocking the device ?
[09:56] <matroblend> Jowi Why can't I just click on the gui file and rename it?
[09:56] <DreamerHxC> hi everyone
[09:56] <Jowi> matroblend, because the GUI is not root/admin user
[09:56] <matroblend> Jowi Oh grrr
[09:57] <TMX> eNons3nse: maybe try wiring straight into the router, and trying to access the routers control panel
[09:57] <Pelo> matroblend,   open the terminal ,  type  gksu nautilus,  that will open nautilus as root, you can rename your file from there, in gui form
[09:57] <thinh> i have an extra floppy 1 on my  computer desktop, how do i get rid of it, it is mount to /dev for some reason
[09:57] <eNons3nse> TMX: i don't have enough eithernet cables.  only have the one.
[09:57] <eNons3nse> ha
[09:57] <RaiderX> does anyone know how to fix the problem with Photoshop 7 in Wine failing "to initialize VBox"?
[09:57] <eNons3nse> well.  let me check.
[09:58] <aMohammed> hey there ! Is it possible to install GDM on KDE without Gnome core ?
[09:58] <Jowi> eNons3nse, actually, what you should do is to call linksys support if you can not login to it or reset it
[09:58] <Pelo> RaiderX,   try in  #winehq
[09:58] <RaiderX> ok pelo thx

[09:58] <conor> how do i reset my network settings to default ?
[09:59] <matroblend> Pelo ty can you do that from a live cd to the hd
[09:59] <Jowi> eNons3nse, yep. but they might help you reset it or even replace it if it is faulty.
[09:59] <Pelo> matroblend,  don't know , try it
[09:59] <matroblend> Pelo ty
[09:59] <eNons3nse> Jowi: what happens when I tell them I'm using Linux?  haha.  "sorry sir, we're not handled to support you."
[09:59] <tonyyarusso> eNons3nse: You don't tell them.  Period.  Make it up if you have to.
[09:59] <Hexidigital> can someone help me with iptables?  i have a router behind my ubuntu machine, dns resolves names and addresses for client machines, however they cannot view web pages
=== Bilange is now known as Bi|ange
=== Bi|ange is now known as Warbird_
[10:00] <Jowi> eNons3nse, shouldn't matter. (used to work for ughhhh D-Link support and we didn't care which OS was used)
[10:00] <TMX> eNons3nse: just don't tell them that :P I do it all the time, just silently transpose windows instructions to linux ones :)
[10:00] <tonyyarusso> yep
[10:00] <eNons3nse> i actually found another e-net cable.
[10:01] <Jowi> eNons3nse, ...or do what TMX say :)
[10:01] <Morrissey> Ok, with a clean user (wich I just added to kde) I can run beryl-xgl with no problems :) But when I try to use it with my default user (wich Ive used for over a year with all of my settings) I get "Another window manager is allready running." and "No managaeble screens found on display" Can anyone help?
[10:01] <TMX> linksys are pretty god with linux anyway, almost all their router firmware is embedded linux
[10:01] <aMohammed> Is it possible to install GDM on Kubuntu without Gnome core ?
[10:01] <tonyyarusso> TMX: Not v5
[10:01] <Hoagie> Hey. I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. I'm trying to use a USB ASDL modem, but I'm not quite sure where to start. I only installed ubuntu a few hours ago, so I'm a total newbie.
[10:01] <TMX> tonyyarusso: *almost* :)
[10:01] <dsnyders> Hi all!  How do I add my floppy drive to /media?
[10:02] <Jowi> Hoagie, in a terminal - "sudo pppoeconf" and follow the instructions
[10:02] <Kengur> hi
[10:02] <tonyyarusso> TMX: Which is why I bought the new GL one :)
[10:02] <Kengur> can anyone help with network problem?
[10:02] <Hoagie> Jowi: Cheers
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> dsnyders, make a directory, and moun with 'sudo mount /dev/fd0 -t dosfs /media/<directory you created>'
[10:03] <nolimitsoya> !ask | Kengur
[10:03] <ubotu> Kengur: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:03] <TMX> tonyyarusso: I've got an original wrt54g v3 :)
[10:03] <ryanakca> does anybody know of a good, easy to use frontend for iptables? or even a link to a iptables howto?
[10:03] <ryanakca> !iptables
[10:03] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[10:03] <aMohammed> Is it possible to install GDM on Kubuntu without Gnome core ?
[10:03] <Jowi> ryanakca, firestarter is ok
[10:03] <TMX> !gdm
[10:03] <ubotu> gdm: GNOME Display Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 1686 kB, installed size 12300 kB
[10:03] <TMX> hmm, no extra info there :/
[10:04] <dsnyders> nolimitsoya, Perhaps I mis-stated the problem.  /media contains dynamic mount points, but when I put a floppy in the drive one is not created.
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> ryanakca, i awnsered you once alreadly. firestarter or shorewall depending on your needs,and 'man iptables' at a console to read the documentation
[10:04] <Kengur> i get a ADSL over PPPoE, so i basically have a eithernet connection, and i have constant network getting down for no reason
[10:04] <tonyyarusso> TMX: apt-cache show gdm, and look at the depends
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> dsnyders, well, youll have to mount manualy i think... i dont use floppies much :)
[10:04] <Pelo> ryanakca, http://qtables.radom.org/
[10:04] <Jowi> Kengur, so the connection works but disconnects after awhile?
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> (anymore)
[10:04] <Kengur> dmesg says something like this...  Neighbour table overflow.  printk: 15 messages suppressed.
[10:04] <ryanakca> nolimitsoya: firestarter doesn't answer my needs... and shorewall seems overly complicated for what I'm trying to do :)
[10:04] <ryanakca> Pelo: thanks :)
[10:04] <Moosejaw> hey all
[10:05] <dsnyders> nolimitsoya, I don't either.  However, I have a few things I need to get off of some floppys.
[10:05] <Kengur> Jowi: yes, i use torrent most of the time at 90 percent of my bandwidth, that's it
[10:05] <Moosejaw> do i have to install ndiswrapper from a specific place for it to install correctly?  Currently I am compiling the source and installing from Desktop but it doesnt seem to be working
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> dsnyders, well, manual mount is always painless :)
[10:05] <whta> Hello again, I need some assistance mounting my other hard drives so I can get to them from ubuntu :o
[10:05] <Jowi> Kengur, does it only disconnect when using high bandwidth?
[10:05] <Moosejaw> i have also tried to do sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper but i get a cannot locate E: error
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> !mount | whta
[10:05] <ubotu> whta: Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[10:06] <dsnyders> nolimitsoya, Oh I wish that were so.
[10:06] <TMX> aMohammed: it doesn't look like it i'm afraid, has a boatload of dependancies.  do it via apt-get install and it will tell you what it needs before installing
[10:06] <Kengur> um, dunno, does the dmesg log says anything that might give a clue?
[10:06] <nolimitsoya> dsnyders, when has it ever failed? :) or is it now?
[10:06] <Kengur> Neighbour table overflow.  printk: 15 messages suppressed.
[10:06] <whta> umm.. System > Administration > Disks does not exist
[10:06] <aMohammed> ok , thanks
[10:07] <nolimitsoya> whta, then type 'man mount' in a terminal
[10:07] <Moosejaw> can someone help me with my ndiswrapper questions?
[10:07] <dsnyders> nolimitsoya, I've had problems in the past.  No point getting into them.
[10:07] <Kengur> i mean it usually get's down when i'm not around, so i can't say if it's actively downloading or not
[10:07] <whta> nolimitsoya: done..
[10:07] <Jowi> Kengur, not sure. Maybe it is possible to change the MTU value in the modem. depends on modem to modem. if you can login to a web based setup page in the modem it should be possible to change some values. but you need to contact your ISP to see which MTU or other settings that should be there.

=== Warbird_ is now known as Bilange
[10:09] <Kengur> Jowi: the problem is it never appeared under windows or fedora core
[10:10] <Jowi> Kengur, disconnections can be tough to troubleshoot. see if you can use a livecd (of fedora or something) to see if the problem exist there. if not, it is something wrong with the driver. if the same problem exist, contact your isp.
[10:11] <Kengur> Jowi: can it be that someone outside is trying to bring the connection down? may be i need a firewall or smthng?
[10:11] <eNons3nse> OK.  the reset worked and i could get into my router settings wirelessly.  I canged the channel and that didn't work.  I also hooked up a wired connection through my router and that didn't work either.  so is it pretty safe to say that it's a problem with my router.
[10:11] <Jowi> Kengur, not likely.
[10:11] <Hoagie> I'm trying to get my internet working under ubuntu. I'm using a USB BT Voyager 105 modem. When plugged into my laptop, I get the power light, but the DSL light is off. How can I sort it?
[10:11] <Jowi> Kengur, might be a problem with A. settings or driver or B. hardware (filter, modem, cables)
[10:12] <mirak>  setserial /dev/ttyUSB0
[10:12] <mirak> Cannot get serial info: Invalid argument
[10:12] <mirak> anyone already had this ?
[10:12] <Hoagie> I've used pppoef config, with no result.
[10:12] <Pelo> Hoagie,   look up your modem model and number in the forum
[10:13] <Kengur> Jowi: i didn't have this problem under fedora core, so it might be ubuntu thingy =(
[10:13] <Jowi> Kengur, might be. hard for me to make an oppinion about at this moment unfortunatly
[10:13] <emilia> hey does anyone know what i could use to receive faxes in ubuntu?
[10:13] <Jowi> Hoagie, did pppoeconf detect your modem?
[10:13] <g333k_work> hi, how to comment an amount of lines in dhcpd.conf?
[10:13] <Kengur> well anyways, i'll google a bit on this one... how do i change grub boot option permanently?? i need to use "noapic"
[10:14] <Hoagie> Jowi: Nope.
[10:14] <DreamerHxC> I have problems with my ATI card, sometimes I can boot in graphic mode, sometimes I cannot. I have just entered in graphic mode and I have pasted my xorg.conf, Xor.0.log and my fglxinfo, can somebody help me please?
[10:14] <wilee85> how do I run a program in terminal so it will run the program in the background and I can continue using terminal?
[10:14] <Jowi> Hoagie, then the driver is not loaded probably. hang on
[10:14] <yaloki> Kengur: /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:14] <bluefox83> Kengur, man grub, find the file you need to change..think it's in /boot/grub/
[10:14] <Kengur> thanks
[10:15] <dot_j> wilee85: command &
[10:15] <sgirc> sewoyl: Sorry I was disconnected I just want to safely unplug my usb modem so that next time I plug it, it is automatically recognized
[10:17] <Kengur> anyone here actually from development or release team?
[10:17] <Kengur> well um.. i guess i am =)
[10:17] <sn9> Kengur: sometimes they are, but not usually
[10:18] <Majic> Nope, just a bunch of people who helped develop it. :p
[10:18] <yaloki> Pelo: why, no ubuntu packagers around here ?
[10:18] <bill-barriere> ?
[10:18] <bill-barriere> what a weird distro
[10:18] <yaloki> Majic: you're an apt committer ?
[10:18] <Majic> 0.o  No...
[10:19] <qman|A64> well, I finally got things working
[10:19] <sewoyl> sgirc: sorry I dont know anything about usb modems
[10:19] <Kengur> Pelo: i just think i might have a point that is useful to consider... i used to spend a while myself to resolve it
[10:19] <Pelo> bill-barriere,  what is so weird about it ?
[10:19] <qman|A64> it's formatting the drive partitions right now
[10:19] <Jowi> Hoagie, see what you can get from this page: http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ (follow the instructions and see if you can find your modem in the list)
[10:19] <Pelo> Kengur,   that's what the forum is for
[10:20] <sn9> sgirc: you have a usb modem? my, how i don't envy you...
[10:20] <Hoagie> Jowi: Thanks a billion. I've really gotta go offline now, but I'll bookmark it.
[10:20] <Kengur> Pelo: but it would be nice to switch this on by "default"
[10:20] <DreamerHxC> I have problems with my ATI card, sometimes I can boot in graphic mode, sometimes I cannot. I have just entered in graphic mode and I have pasted my xorg.conf, Xor.0.log and my glxinfo, can somebody help me please?
[10:20] <Jowi> np Hoagie I hope it sort itself
[10:20] <dts> I just tried to plug in my ipod and it shows up on the computer, but if i try to click on it i get mount: /dev/sdb already mounted or /media/usbdisk busy
[10:20] <Hoagie> Jowi: Cheerio!
[10:20] <dts> eventhough it's not mounted anywhere
[10:20] <sgirc> sn9: I consider myself lucky coz I found drivers...

[10:21] <qman|A64> I need to break down and buy some more memory for that thing...the live environment runs like absolute crap on 256MB, I had to turn on the swap partition to get it to be responsive
[10:21] <whta> I'm still having trouble figuring out how to mount a drive i have =\
[10:21] <sn9> sgirc: oh, cable. i thought you were talking about usb dial-up
[10:21] <Kengur> Pelo: in previous version of kernel by SATA drive (no raid) worked fine, and now it doesn't untill i use "noapic", nForce4 is pretty widely used for that matter...
[10:22] <sgirc> sn9: yes ADSL
[10:22] <Pelo> emilia,  menu  applications > add/remove , search for fax
[10:22] <Kengur> Pelo: nobody actually gave me any clues about this
[10:22] <Pelo> Kengur,  I can'T help you
[10:22] <sethk> whta, what kind of drive, file system, etc?
[10:22] <sn9> sgirc: adsl isn't as big a deal, unless you're on pppoa or something
[10:23] <sethk> Kengur, if it works with noapic, then what's the problem?
[10:23] <GhoSt_DoG> Hi, how i install codecs ?
[10:23] <sgirc> sn9: I'm  on pppoa
[10:23] <GhoSt_DoG> sudo apt-get install w32codecs ?
[10:23] <MitchM> since my install of 6.10 sudo no-longer requires the password after the "first" time a user correctly enters a password. How can I change this?
[10:23] <whta> sethk: regular ol' IDE HD, ntfs but I only need it for reading files anyway
[10:23] <MitchM> /etc/sudoers does not seem to be the problem

[10:23] <sgirc> sn9: ADSL line is up
[10:23] <Cpudan80> Hello everyone
[10:23] <sethk> MitchM, visudo, get rid of the NOPASSWD modifier(s)
[10:23] <Cpudan80> Where can I find an Ubuntu DVD?
[10:23] <MitchM> sethk, none there.
[10:24] <Pelo> Cpudan80,   easiest way is  torrents
[10:24] <Cpudan80> ubuntu.com offers up a single CD --- but I have a feeling that isn't the whole thing
[10:24] <fabiim> good lightweight laptop for linux , not powerfuul graphics , lots of  ram , small disk ,  where to find ?
[10:24] <qman|A64> whta: sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/disk (assuming hda1 is it and /mnt/disk is where you want it)
[10:24] <MitchM> sethk, Doesnt seem to be a problem with /etc/sudoers
[10:24] <Kengur> sethk: I'm quite a newb myself, but there might be other people who are even more newbies than myself =) they might not get this sorted out
[10:24] <sgirc> sn9: and I configured a ppp interface, but when lanching pppd I get an error in my logs
[10:24] <whta> thanks qman, i'll try it out
[10:24] <MitchM> After sudo'ing the file sudo_as_admin_successful is left in the $HOME dir
[10:24] <MitchM> but removing it also does not make them type the passwd again
[10:24] <sethk> MitchM, I'd get rid of sudo altogtether, the way ubuntu sets it up it's a huge security hole.  set the root password, remove all sudo permissions.
[10:25] <MitchM> sethk, I have one user that needs sudo access.
[10:25] <sethk> MitchM, ok
[10:25] <gouki> sethk: Why is it a security problem, the way the sudo is configured?
[10:25] <sethk> MitchM, let me see if there is a global configuration for that
[10:25] <MitchM> sethk, without _all_ of the root privleges.
[10:25] <sethk> MitchM, ok, let me see if there is any global config
[10:25] <qman|A64> actually, sudo is meant to improve security...just configure the sudoers file with visudo
[10:25] <sn9> sgirc: i knew someone who used mandrake because it had out-of-the-box support for pppoa adsl over usb, but he hated mandrake. i had him try ubuntu, and he loved it, but he did have to buy a different adsl modem
[10:25] <sethk> gouki, one password allowing you to do _everything_?  and not even an admin password?  ugh.
[10:25] <Kengur> sethk: might be a good option to turn this on by default if the system has nforce and sata drive
[10:26] <sethk> Kengur, I don't disagree
[10:26] <whta> qman: Says the mount point does not exist
[10:26] <MitchM> in /etc/pam.d/sudo it had two include lines
[10:26] <qman|A64> whta: you must create a folder to mount it to
[10:26] <MitchM> but i do not know if those are the cuplrits or not
[10:26] <MitchM> culprits*
[10:26] <gouki> sethk: If you didn't have sudo, you would need to enter SU mode, which, also let's you do everything. At least with sudo, it's only temporary SU powers
[10:26] <qman|A64> whta: mkdir folder
[10:26] <sethk> MitchM, I'd have to look.  I don't have edgy on this box and I can't get to my edgy box at the moment.
[10:27] <sethk> gouki, not true.  they allow sudo -i
[10:27] <qman|A64> sethk: that's what visudo is for
[10:27] <qman|A64> it allows you to choose who can do what
[10:27] <qman|A64> by default, the first user is allowed full privileges
[10:27] <qman|A64> the whole point of sudo is securing root privileges
[10:27] <sethk> qman|A64, I said the way _ubuntu_ sets it up by default is a huge security hole.  not that it can't be properly configured, that it _isn't_ properly configured
[10:28] <sn9> qman|A64: by default, it goes by group, not user, iirc
[10:28] <sgirc> sn9:there is really no other solution ?
[10:28] <gouki> sethk: You only use sudo -i IF you want it. I'm sure most of the new people don't even know it's possible to do that
[10:28] <tonyyarusso> How do I launch getty/login for ttys greater than 6?
[10:28] <sn9> sethk: nobody has it "properly" configured by default
[10:28] <whta> qman: Now it says "special device hda1" does not exist. I'm not POSITIVE which hda# this drive is, but eh, what do you suggest?
[10:29] <sethk> gouki, hiding a capability is not security
[10:29] <gouki> sethk: IMHO, sudo -i and SU are almost the same thing. While sudo is the safer...
[10:29] <sn9> sgirc: there wasn't then, when 5.04 was the latest release and 5.10 was just about to be
[10:29] <sethk> gouki, no, sudo -i is worse, because it can be configured to not require any password.
[10:29] <sn9> sgirc: i haven't investigated it since
[10:29] <Varjat_by> HI! Is anybody know how to fix problem during LIRC driver compilation process. Error is "/bin/sh: scripts/genksyms/genksyms: No such file or directory"?
[10:30] <PriceChild> How can i get a wiki page to redirect to another one?
[10:30] <yaloki> sethk: arguably, if you don't give the permission to do so in the first place, you can't do that. the problem is rather having that preconfigured for the non-root user by default on ubuntu.
[10:30] <qman|A64> whta: sudo fdisk -l, it will tell you what disks are where
[10:30] <gouki> sethk: Weren't you talking about DEFAULTS? By default, sudo -i REQUIRES password - I'm sure with some hacking, su can be configured to not ask a password either
[10:30] <yaloki> sethk: eh, oh, which is your original point ^^ indeed, I agree ;)
[10:30] <RaiderX> How do you check terminal output?
[10:30] <Pelo> PriceChild,  this is hardly the channel for that question
[10:30] <GhoSt_DoG> how i install codecs for totem ?
[10:30] <Olathe> How do I shut Xorg down ?
[10:30] <sewoyl> RaiderX: output of what?
[10:30] <sn9> GhoSt_DoG: 6.06 or 6.10?
[10:31] <PriceChild> Pelo: I'm sorry, but i'm unsure as to where to ask it
[10:31] <spacebear> same do i wonder...how to reconf xorg and shut it down
[10:31] <sewoyl> Olathe: restart with ctrl alt backspace
[10:31] <Varjat_by> Olathe: ctrl+alt+backspace
[10:31] <Cpudan80> Pelo: I still only see a CD ISO...
[10:31] <RaiderX> sewoyl any program thats running
[10:31] <Cpudan80> Shouldn't it be like 5 CDs?
[10:31] <PriceChild> GhoSt_DoG: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[10:31] <Pelo> PriceChild,  I am sure there is a  #wiki channel somewhere
[10:31] <RaiderX> like when i run something in wine
[10:31] <MitchM> sethk, Found it; timestamp_timeout=0
[10:31] <Jager-> is there a key combo to open the process manager thing.. similar to ctrl+alt+delete?
[10:31] <whta> qman: ok, got it mounted. now how do I make this folder accessible?
[10:31] <sewoyl> RaiderX: usually if you start the programfrom a terminal youll get the output
[10:31] <MitchM> sethk, Had to add that to /etc/sudoers
[10:31] <Pelo> Cpudan80,  try www.torrentz..com
[10:31] <Pelo> www.torrentz.com
[10:31] <sethk> MitchM, amazing, I didn't think they could make the default configuration worse, but they did.
[10:31] <sethk> MitchM, thanks.
[10:31] <RaiderX> ok sewoyl ill try to figure this out
[10:32] <Olathe> I don't want to restart it.
[10:32] <PriceChild> Pelo: maybe docs...
[10:32] <sgirc> sn9: I'm feeling I'm close to make it run! but I think the problem lies in my peers config file. What I need know is the command one must use to disable a usb device (not specifically a modem). In example to unplud a usb drive you type umount /mnt/uba but when its not a storage device how to do that ?
[10:32] <Olathe> I want to stop it.
[10:32] <ryanakca> nolimitsoya: ok, I have firewall script loaded, but I can still ftp to my host... what's going on? (script) http://rkavanagh.homelinux.org/firewall1
[10:32] <sewoyl> RaiderX: for exemple type in gedit in the terminal
[10:32] <ryanakca> Olathe: ctrl-alt-backspace... or ctrl-alt-f1, log in, go "sudo killall Xorg"
[10:32] <MitchM> sethk, :) thank you
[10:32] <mborohov> so im now running Xgl
[10:32] <mborohov> and its working fine
[10:32] <Viroo> hi
[10:32] <mborohov> it just doesnt work with AiGLX apparently
[10:32] <sn9> sgirc: if it's not a storage device, just unplugging is usually good enough
[10:32] <mborohov> yay

[10:33] <ryanakca> Olathe: I mean "sudo killall X"
[10:33] <ryanakca> Olathe: might want to go "sudo killall gdm" as well :)
[10:33] <spacebear> in dmesg i find early in log -- Console colour VGA+ 80x25  <---- how do i change that
[10:33] <sgirc> sn9: I do it that way, the next time I plug it,linux doesn't recognize it, untill I reboot
[10:33] <Cpudan80> Pelo: Does the DVD include packages from KDE? Like ehh Konversation?
[10:33] <Cpudan80> Or will I need Kubuntu to get both
[10:33] <sethk> spacebear, change it to what?
[10:33] <tonyyarusso> I don't have X running and would like to create more consoles than the default 6 - how?
[10:33] <Fackamato> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop is better imo
[10:34] <spacebear> so it uses my fullscreen
[10:34] <Pelo> Cpudan80,   probably,  are you looking for kubuntu ? because there are dvd for that to
[10:34] <spacebear> it uses just a square in the middle
[10:34] <sethk> Cpudan80, you can install anything in regular ubuntu that you can install in kubuntu
[10:34] <ryanakca> Fackamato: of course :)
[10:34] <qman|A64> nice, my network card works by default in 6.10
[10:34] <sn9> sgirc: after unplugging, but before replugging, try unloading the driver with rmmod
[10:34] <qman|A64> had to use ndiswrapper before
[10:34] <sethk> spacebear, try adding     vga=ask        to your kernel command line in menu.lst
[10:34] <Cpudan80> Pelo: sethk No -- I like GNOME -- but I do like some of the KDE apps
[10:34] <Cpudan80> Like Konversation
[10:34] <ryanakca> Cpudan80: sudo apt-get install konversation ?
[10:35] <sethk> Cpudan80, I'm a kde user, so I won't argue.  my answer is the same.  you can install any kde program you want.  the package manager will take care of any dependencies
[10:35] <Pelo> Cpudan80, it is probably in there,  it's the dvd it contains all the packages, only the install is for gnome instead or kde
[10:35] <sgirc> sn9: no param ?
[10:35] <spacebear> ok thnx ill try
[10:35] <sn9> sgirc: the name of the module
[10:35] <Cpudan80> Pelo: Ok thanks -- was just wondering
[10:35] <Cpudan80> Suse 10.1 has been misbehaving
[10:35] <Cpudan80> So its getting the axe
[10:35] <whta> qman: when i try to chmod my directory I mounted the disk to, it won't change. it says it's changed to "read-only file system" but I can't get into it
[10:35] <ryanakca> lol
[10:36] <sethk> whta, that has nothing to do with the permissions of the mount point
[10:36] <sethk> whta, you need the options uid= and gid= on the mount command.
[10:36] <Pelo> missbehaving or not it should get the axes just because of the MS deal
[10:36] <bruenig> There is supposed to be a FreeSuse fork
[10:36] <sgirc> sn9: sorry I don't know the name of the usb driver module ...
[10:36] <whta> sethk: hmm, what do i have to do to repair this?
[10:36] <sethk> whta, it's a kludge for handling file systems that don't implement permissions
[10:36] <qman|A64> whta: ntfs can only be mounted read only, write support is unstable
[10:36] <Pelo> bruenig,  there is opensuse
[10:36] <sethk> whta, umount it, and mount it again with the options.
[10:36] <bruenig> opensuse is not the same as this fork
[10:36] <sethk> whta, if it's ntfs, qman has a good point
[10:36] <aka_druid_> bruenig: really? With only free software in it?
[10:37] <bruenig> as it is tied to novell
[10:37] <kishan> how to mount my ntfs hard drive in ubuntu live
[10:37] <kishan> can any one help plese
[10:37] <Kengur> err... i got this http://nice3z.myfinejob.com/node/3 but i can't figure out how to echo into that var with sudo =( says permission denied
[10:37] <sethk> whta, there is ntfs write support that is supposedly safe, but it is much too new to rely on IMO
[10:37] <sn9> sethk: a read-only fs is not a permissions error
[10:37] <sethk> sn9, I didn't say it was
[10:37] <sn9> !ntfs-3g | whta
[10:37] <ubotu> whta: ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[10:37] <whta> sethk: I don't need the write support at the moment so read only is fine
[10:37] <sgirc> sn9: usbcore ?
[10:38] <sethk> whta, hmm, then I must have misunderstood your question.
[10:38] <sn9> sgirc: no, that's all of usb. you want the one specific to your device
[10:38] <kishan> can any one help me to mount the ntfs harddrive when i boot from kubuntu live cd
[10:38] <kuzmaster> hey all
[10:38] <whta> sethl: don't worry. i just need to be able to get into the folder to access the files.. unless i need write support to do that? I don't think I needed it before
[10:38] <cmweb> Does any one know what a good "C++" Compiler is?
[10:38] <kuzmaster> i have a really quick question.......
[10:38] <sethk> whta, anyway, what I was talking about applies to which user can access the files.  even on a read only mount, you may need uid=/gid= to allow the desired user to read the files.
[10:38] <cmweb> I mean where i could get one
[10:39] <sethk> whta, you don't need write support to read.  :)
[10:39] <yaloki> cmweb: a lie
[10:39] <sn9> sethk: umask= is more convenient for that anyway
[10:39] <yaloki> cmweb: gcc-c++
[10:39] <whta> sethk: so what would the command be? what do i put for uid and gid?
[10:39] <kuzmaster> how do i mount a hardrive from the live ubuntu 6.06?
[10:39] <cmweb> :-X
[10:39] <Pelo> cmweb,  check synaptic and try them out
[10:39] <sethk> sn9, I don't think it is, but convenience is a matter of opinion.
[10:39] <cmweb> Why a lie?
[10:39] <kuzmaster> the file system is fat16
[10:39] <bruenig> kuzmaster, sudo mount -t (whatever the filesystem is) /dev/(harddrive name) /mount/point
[10:39] <aka_druid_> bruenig: sounds like a very good idea. When its releasing?
[10:40] <kuzmaster> k thanx...................
[10:40] <cmweb> gcc-c++, is not a package in Synaptic
[10:40] <sethk> whta, at the command prompt, do the "id" command.  it will tell you the user and group IDs
[10:40] <yaloki> cmweb: because C++ is awful in the first place but well..
[10:40] <yaloki> cmweb: dunno what the cryptic name is on ubuntu
[10:40] <ryanakca> I have my firewall script loaded into iptables, but I can still ftp to my host... what's going on? (script) http://rkavanagh.homelinux.org/firewall1
[10:40] <rushdy> cmweb, theres a package build-essential
[10:40] <sn9> cmweb: it's just g++
[10:40] <ryanakca> g++
[10:41] <cmweb> g+++ how original
[10:41] <whta> sethk: will doing this add that awesome hard drive icon onto my desktop too? ;D
[10:41] <Pelo> cmeme,  just seach for  C ++ compiler , don'T search for a specific app
[10:41] <kuzmaster> bruenig: so where you wrote "what ever the file system is" i just replace that with "fat16"?
[10:41] <sgirc> sn9: pppoatm.ko ? does this seems a possible module to remove ?
[10:41] <bruenig> kuzmaster, if it is fat16, then yes. I haven't seen a fat16 filesystem in forever. So make sure that is what it is.
[10:41] <cmweb> TOO many choices what do i pick for the search C++
[10:41] <sethk> whta, I don't think so, no.  I don't bother with icons.
[10:41] <aka_druid_> bruenig: Im very interested. Would you please keep me informed? Or show me a place where we can discuss that
[10:41] <bruenig> aka_druid_, probably just a thought now. Here is the story http://boycottnovell.com/2006/11/22/suse-ubuntu/
[10:42] <sethk> cmweb, build_essential installs the c compiler and I believe the c++ portion as well.
[10:42] <kuzmaster> it is, i just made it fat16 cos i want to install windows 3.1 :)
[10:42] <sethk> cmweb, install it, then if g++ exists, you have it.  otherwise, g++ needs the common part and the C part anyway, so you lose nothing
[10:42] <sn9> sgirc: that one handles the pppoa protocol, but i'm thinking you want the one that drives the usb adsl device itself
[10:43] <cmweb> sethk: What? install what Build _essentials i thought it was just an installation option
[10:43] <aka_druid_> bruenig: I understand. Unfortunately its hard to run thoughts in my computer. I will be glad to help when there is software instead of thoughts
[10:43] <sethk> cmweb, there is a package named "build_essential"   no capital letters, no extra spaces, no s at the end
[10:43] <kuzmaster> !mount
[10:43] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[10:44] <bruenig> aka_druid_, I bet it comes. If ubuntu did what novell did, I would be all for a FreeUbuntu fork. I could certainly see Suse users who think the same
[10:44] <sn9> cmweb: there is a metapackage called "build-essential" (dash, not _) in synaptic
[10:44] <cmweb> sethk: No theirs not i just synaptic it. No results
[10:44] <yaloki> bruenig: well, ubuntu is already a fork
[10:44] <aka_druid_> bruenig: I understand
[10:44] <cmweb> sn9, ive already got build-essential
[10:45] <sethk> cmweb, I might have typed _ instead of -, sorry
[10:45] <sethk> cmweb, do:   which g++
[10:45] <sethk> cmweb, see if it's there
[10:45] <sn9> cmweb: then just add g++. if you want something graphical, try anjuta
[10:45] <cmweb> :-)
[10:46] <cmweb> YAY a gui
[10:46] <sgirc> sn9: to make my system recognize the modem I had to put the firmware file cxacru-fw.bin in /lib/firmware. is it what I need to remove ?
[10:46] <bruenig> yaloki, good point???
[10:46] <sn9> sgirc: no
[10:46] <cmweb> OKedokie im downloain
[10:46] <kingace> hello, once ubuntu is installed, can you add a swap parition?
[10:46] <kingace> *partition
[10:46] <yaloki> bruenig: well it just seems you like forks ^^
[10:46] <bruenig> kingace, you could
[10:46] <qman|A64> kingace: if you have enough space left on the disk to put it on
[10:47] <bruenig> yaloki, no reason to start from scratch when a solid base exists
[10:47] <sgirc> sn9: it's the only thing that is specific to my modem !!
[10:47] <sn9> sgirc: sudo rmmod cxacru
[10:47] <kingace> but how exactly would you do it
[10:47] <yaloki> actually, one could even say ubuntu is a hostile fork
[10:47] <kingace> add the partition and mount it?
[10:47] <kingace> and thats it?
[10:47] <qman|A64> you can do it after anyway, but it gets more complicated if you only have one big partition filling hte disk
[10:47] <yaloki> bruenig: indeed
[10:47] <kingace> qman: no that isnt the situation
[10:47] <bruenig> kingace, you would need to create it. Put an entry in the fstab and that would be it
[10:47] <kingace> alrighty thanks
[10:47] <qman|A64> to use a swap partition, just use 'sudo swapon /dev/hda2' or whatever it is
[10:47] <cmweb> !gamepad
[10:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gamepad - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:47] <sgirc> sn9: ok thanks I will try it this right now
[10:48] <aka_druid_> bruenig: you are assuming debian is a solid base, right?
[10:48] <bruenig> aka_druid_, not necessarily. I would just defending the practice of forking. In this case, ubuntu would be a solid base
[10:48] <kuzmaster> what is the command line for copying files from one place to another?
[10:49] <kuzmaster> please?
[10:49] <bruenig> kuzmaster, cp file newfile
[10:49] <cmweb> Ok wile my Compiler is downloading, does any one know how to install a "Game Essentials" Game Pad?
[10:49] <kuzmaster> thanx
[10:49] <aka_druid_> bruenig: based in another solid base, then
[10:49] <aka_druid_> otherwise it woudlnt be solid
[10:49] <kishan> kuzmaster, were you be able mount the hard drive
[10:49] <Morrissey> Ok, I have two questions concerning beryl. 1. Can I make windows only show on the desktop they are opened it on the taskbar? So if "xchat" is on one desktop, it doesnt appear on other. 2. how can I disable transperancy (Since its slowing my computer). In advance, thanks
[10:49] <Pelo> kuzmaster, http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[10:49] <kuzmaster> so... cp (old location) (new location)
[10:49] <kuzmaster> thanx pelo
[10:49] <bruenig> debian is fairly solid at least abstractly. The debs and the repos and whatnot.
[10:49] <sn9> cmweb: it might just work if you just plug it in
[10:50] <cmweb> sn(, i just did and the stuff aint working. It has a mouse and i pressed the button for the mouse and it wont move
[10:50] <uyann> I'm in installing Java using automatix, and this licence agreement from Sun pops-up.. there is an Ok button that I can't click on... I tried pressing Enter and spacebar.. none of them will let me continue...
[10:51] <bruenig> uyann, you need to use the tab to get to the ok
[10:51] <quicoju> keep getting this error using gpc: gpc error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot open crt1.o: No such file or directory
[10:51] <bruenig> !automatix | uyann
[10:51] <ubotu> uyann: automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[10:51] <quicoju> any suggetion?
[10:51] <Pelo> uyann,  try tabing to the location
[10:51] <sn9> cmweb: it would probably be seen as a joystick device, not a mouse device
[10:51] <sethk> quicoju, that file is part of the standard C library.  how are you getting that?
[10:51] <Pelo> !works for me > Pelo
[10:51] <cmweb> Sn9, ok il see what i can do
[10:51] <uyann> let me try tabbing
[10:52] <uyann> thank you!!
[10:52] <uyann> it worked!
[10:52] <uyann> :)
[10:52] <quicoju> sethk: trying to compile a program
[10:52] <quicoju> sethk: gpc -g world.pas
[10:52] <ikonia> chaps, is there an application in the ubuntu repo's that can rip the sound off a dvd rom into mp3 format ?
[10:53] <ikonia> I'm not big on multimedia aps
[10:53] <sethk> quicoju, quicoju it's normally in one of the gcc-lib directories
[10:53] <sethk> quicoju, did you install the build-essential package?
[10:53] <sn9> ikonia: try dvdrip
[10:54] <Asc> Is there any way to back up the file/directory structure of a filesystem (FAT) so that it can be restored in the case of corruption?
[10:54] <Rumpanzle> Q: I can log into a termina with my name/password containing a german letter (), whereas I can't use that same password for the desktoplogin anymore. that is after reinstalling grub after installing windows...if I press the "" it shows as nothing, remember the terminal let me log in?!
[10:54] <Pelo> ikonia,  maybe sound juicer can do it
[10:54] <ikonia> sn9, doesn't that rip the whole movie
[10:54] <bruenig> !backup | Asc
[10:54] <ubotu> Asc: There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !cloning
[10:54] <quicoju> sethk: i don't what is that package
[10:54] <ikonia> Pelo, thats an interesting thought
[10:54] <sn9> ikonia: you can cut it up later
=== PriceChild is now known as PriceChild_away
[10:54] <sethk> quicoju, it's a metapackage that installs the stuff typically needed to build software from source
[10:54] <sethk> quicoju, install it.  It should take care of crt1.o.
[10:54] <ikonia> sn9 ok
[10:55] <quicoju> sethk: ok! thanks :)
[10:55] <sethk> quicoju, it could be a path issue also, but try build-essential first.
[10:56] <Legendre> having some wifi wierdness.. it works fine and all.. but I can only contact machines on the internet.. can't contact any hosts on the LAN
[10:56] <cmweb> SN9, is their a configuration for a joystick type thing? i cant find anything that will allow me to configure it
[10:56] <Legendre> is this some security setting?
[10:56] <maghat> Legendre: That problem is most likely related to your LAN mask or router setup
[10:57] <Legendre> maghat security settings on the router side?
[10:57] <maghat> Legendre: *or* firewall
[10:57] <sn9> cmweb: i think there might be a pkg to install for that, but i don't remember what it is
[10:57] <sethk> Legendre, you mean you can't connect to other wireless machines?  Or wired machines on the lan which the AP connects to?
[10:57] <Legendre> maghat well, this is just a fairly plain Edgy install on a thinkpad
[10:57] <maghat> Legendre: maybe ... can you ping a LAN address from the command line?
[10:57] <Legendre> sethk - can't connect to other wired machines.
[10:57] <cmweb> sn9, i got to wait then im installing another thing
[10:58] <gansinho> hello ppl, I would like to know why the new amarok isn't in repos?
[10:58] <Legendre> maghat can only ping the router/gateay
[10:58] <sethk> Legendre, the default route has to be correct, or you wouldn't reach the internet either
[10:58] <Pelo> is these some default /hidden firewall that install with ubu 6.10,  I'm getting a message from frostwire that I am firewalled ?  but not from anything else
[10:58] <Asc> bruenig: Those links all appear to be related to backing up files, correct me if I'm wrong.
[10:58] <bruenig> gansinho, no one in here controls the repos. What version are you looking for?
[10:58] <sethk> Legendre, that actually sounds like the netmask in the AP may be wrong (the netmask of the ap connection to the wired network).  although that's odd, also, since internet traffic also passes through it.
[10:58] <bruenig> Asc, if you backup all the files of a disc, would that not be backing up a disc?
[10:59] <sethk> Legendre, try a traceroute to one of the machines you can't reach, see where it dies.
[10:59] <Jowi> no Pelo there are nothing blocking unless you installed a firewall yourself
[10:59] <sn9> cmweb: btw, anjuta would still need g++ to handle c++ rather than just c
[10:59] <Pelo> Jowi,  thanks
[10:59] <Legendre> sethk - and also odd, since they are one in the same.. netgear wireless/wired router
[10:59] <sethk> Asc, I've never seen a structural dump of FAT
[10:59] <Legendre> sethk - ok will do. One other piece of info, tho..
[10:59] <sethk> Asc, it might be possible.  it's a windows file system, so it's perfectly possible that it's possible to dump it, and I don't know about it.
[10:59] <Jowi> Pelo, if you're using a router try opening/redirecting the correct ports
[10:59] <gansinho> bruenig, 1.4.4
[10:59] <whta> sethk, could you run that mount command by me one more time? with the uid and gid?
[11:00] <sethk> Legendre, oh, that's a bit different
[11:00] <Asc> bruenig: The trouble is that the disk I want to back up is 25 times larger than the other disk I have handy, which makes copying the files themselves infeasable.
[11:00] <Legendre> sethk - ubuntu thinks that this machine is connected with a wire :)
[11:00] <bruenig> Asc, ah, well I just triggered the factoid
[11:00] <sethk> whta, if you are doing, say:   mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/something, you would do:  mount -t ntfs -o 'uid=500,gid=500' /dev/hda1 /mnt/something
[11:00] <Pelo> Jowi,  thanks but no router,  just a plain dsl bridge modem, if there is anything it's software related,  probably a frostwire bug ,  I can still ul/dl  but it's just annoying to see that icon
[11:00] <sethk> whta, of course 500 is an example, you have to use the correct numbers.  :)
[11:00] <maghat> Legendre: have you stopped the eth0 device in networking config?
[11:01] <Asc> sethk: I'll look into that.
[11:01] <whta> ok thanks sethk
[11:01] <sethk> Legendre, is the box wired into the ap also?
=== sgirc is now known as RealSgirc
[11:01] <Jowi> Pelo, ah, hehe, yeah if you can dl/ul there is nothing blocking the traffic :)
[11:01] <sethk> Legendre, I assumed it's a wireless connection to the ap
[11:01] <Pelo> Jowi,  it is very slow ...
[11:01] <Legendre> this is a laptop, just wifi
[11:01] <Legendre> but the network config shows the wifi to be disabled and not configured
[11:01] <bruenig> gansinho, http://www.debianadmin.com/install-amarok-144-music-player-in-ubuntu-edgy.html
[11:02] <maghat> Legendre: almost every laptop has a LAN port :D
[11:02] <sethk> Legendre, almost all laptops also have a wired LAN port
[11:02] <sethk> Legendre, in fact, it's been years since I've seen one that doesn't.
[11:02] <Legendre> sethk - it has a wired lan port.. but it's not in use
[11:02] <whta> thanks sethk, got it working
[11:02] <Legendre> ubuntu thinks it is..
[11:02] <josorio> hola...
[11:02] <sethk> whta, excellent.
[11:02] <sethk> Legendre, does  ifconfig   show that you have an eth0 configured with your ip?
[11:03] <sethk> Legendre, because if ubuntu thinks it is talking to a wired port, then it is.
[11:03] <Legendre> sethk - no, it shows eth1 configured.
[11:03] <Legendre> both eth0 and eth1 show up in the LAN stuff, nothng in wireless
[11:03] <Jowi> Legendre, install network-manager-gnome. logout and login again and see what the network manager say. you will also be able to see the available connections and what you're connected to at the moment.
[11:04] <Zlax> hi!!!
[11:04] <Zlax> can someone help me with resolution problems?
[11:04] <josorio> hola...

[11:04] <mmisiek3> anyone here can help me with scrolling in Ubuntu??
[11:04] <Pelo> Zlax,  what resolution problem ?
[11:04] <yaloki> mmisiek3: trolling ?
[11:04] <sethk> sounds like there are two wired ports.  perhaps one in the laptop and another in a docking station?
[11:04] <sgbuntu> hi
[11:05] <Jowi> Legendre, no idea. just installed it myself to get my intel mac mini wireless to work. just to see if it works or not. not using it myself :)
[11:05] <yaloki> ah, "scrolling" ^^
[11:05] <mmisiek3> yes
[11:05] <quicoju> sethk: it worked thanks! :)

[11:06] <redDEADresolve> I am having a problem with my internal card reader in my desktop. It's a LINKSKEY LKA-CR15B 19-in-1 USB 2.0 Card Reader/Writer. In Dapper it worked no problem. When I upgraded to Edgy it doesn't read cards, although the light goes on. I'm confused to whats happened. The USB slot works, it reads and writes data but the card slots don't. I've tried a couple of cards and have no idea what to do.
[11:06] <sn9> mirak: what are you trying to do?
[11:06] <whta> anyone happen to know the exact path to my firefox profile folder?
[11:06] <Jowi> Legendre, network-manager-gnome will give you a clear view of what is going on
[11:06] <sethk> mirak, that's a dynamic port, it will only exist when whatever device it corresponds to is connected and powered up.
[11:06] <Zlax> can someone help me in private  about desktop Resolution
[11:06] <anton_> nooo! the sound of a thousand voices crying out in terror and suddenly silenced! www.peugeot.fr has just killed my firefox browser! and i was downloading a film from google videos and it was 75% done!

[11:10] <sethk> mirak, well, in my setup, that port (ttyUSB0) is used by my palm pilot
[11:10] <mirak> sethk: what you said

[11:10] <mirak> sethk: but you have a serial to usb device ?
[11:10] <anton_> (i wonder if there's a firefox plug in to grab stuff from google videos? let's see...)
[11:10] <sethk> mirak, the module has visor in the same.
[11:11] <rodox> there is no way to do it by the hand?
[11:11] <sethk> mirak, at work I have one, yes
[11:11] <mirak> sethk: mine is pl2303

[11:11] <sethk> mirak, I didn't bring it home with me.  we have two different ones, I don't remember the models, though.
[11:11] <amicke> suddenly my ubuntu started acting weird... i can't open "menu layout" anyone know why?
[11:11] <mmisiek3> i have problem with scrolling in window (opera, mozilla, gnome) it's sharppening all the time. That's very annyoing... I have Ubuntu 6.10 and s3 unichrome, on 6.06 there was no problem
[11:11] <TTownMan> Can I ask a question re: CUPS config with a NetGear router?
[11:11] <redDEADresolve> yes you have to download the fonts and then follow this guide http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241196&highlight=installing+fonts
[11:12] <Zlax> please i tried the faq for setting correct resolution but i can't get it to work
[11:12] <barrett9h> how do I setup internet connection sharing with bluetooth?
[11:12] <redDEADresolve> zlax whats wrong
[11:12] <sethk> TTownMan, sure, but what does CUPS have to do with routers?
[11:12] <sgirc> hello
[11:12] <sn9> mirak: is the adapter plugged in?
[11:12] <mirak> sn9: yes
[11:12] <mirak> sn9: at least it creates the device

[11:14] <redDEADresolve> i already am talking to you in private

[11:15] <HolyManOfGod> hmm
[11:15] <rainbow> hi

[11:16] <hikenboot> hello all--question anyone know wherer dhcpd and bind log their errors to?
[11:16] <mirak> sn9: setserial gives you at least information about the port
[11:16] <sn9> mirak: but they're not usb
[11:16] <mirak> sn9: I need them anyway
[11:16] <sethk> mirak, it may not use the same UART chip, so the fact that it responds differently is not definitive
[11:17] <sethk> mirak, I wish I had it here so I could try it for you, but I don't
[11:17] <sc0tty> hello
[11:17] <sn9> there is no uart in a PL2303
[11:17] <anton_> mm, wget doesn't like google videos. can't say i blame it
[11:17] <sc0tty> I installed ubuntu 6.10
[11:17] <sethk> redDEADresolve, I would boot dapper, do:   lsmod > outputfile       then boot edgy, do the same thing, e.g., lsmod > outputfile2
[11:17] <sc0tty> I'm looking at the /etc/fstab file, to add a new HD, but it seemd ubuntu now uses some kind of UUID instead of the classic stuff it used to use in 6.06
[11:18] <sethk> redDEADresolve, then do:   diff outputfile outputfile2
[11:18] <sc0tty> how can I add a new HD ?
[11:18] <mirak> sn9: so how do i use it ?
[11:18] <mirak> sn9: for exemple with lirc
[11:18] <mirak> sn9: I also want to plug a infinty usb phoenix on it
[11:18] <sethk> that may show you a module that needs to be inserted.  it might show you a bunch, and it may not help, but it may help.
[11:18] <sethk> redDEADresolve, it almost surely is a kernel module that needs to be loaded, or possibly needs to be built and then loaded.
[11:18] <redDEADresolve> sethk how would i boot into dapper use a live CD?
[11:19] <noomz> Excuse me, Why I can start Xgl from gdm but not from gdm.conf-custom?
[11:19] <sethk> redDEADresolve, that's one way.  I was assuming you still have your dapper installation available
[11:19] <sn9> mirak: you have an IR dongle attached to a usb serial adapter? i'm not sure it's even possible for that to work on any OS
[11:19] <redDEADresolve> no clean 6.10 install
[11:20] <sethk> sc0tty, the way it works in earlier versions still works, even if there are additional configuration methods.
[11:20] <sethk> redDEADresolve, too bad.
[11:20] <sc0tty> ok thanks :)
[11:20] <sgirc> sn9: now that I know how to unplug my usb modem I can switch between my native windows connection and try to make it run from my vmware loaded ubuntu
[11:20] <cmweb> Can some one help me with anjuta?
[11:20] <sethk> redDEADresolve, booting the live cd is a reasonable thing to do, if the thing is accessible that way.
[11:20] <sethk> cmweb, possibly, depends on what problem you are having.
[11:21] <sgirc> sn9:could you be kind enough to help me to set my connection ?
[11:21] <cmweb> yeah i guess. How do i set the executable file for my progect
[11:21] <Zlax> :(
[11:21] <rodox> can anyone help me to install a TTF font in ubuntu?
[11:21] <Zlax> ;(
[11:21] <redDEADresolve> sethk it is i have it right next to me, but when i run lsmod > outputfile2 i get nothin in edgy
[11:21] <sgirc> sn9: logs are here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33749/
[11:21] <Zlax> :'(
[11:22] <mirak> sn9: well I would like to do that, but if it's not possible I can plug my other device on it
[11:22] <jared_> how can i get the bookmarks imported from a bookmark.html   into mozilla
[11:22] <sethk> might need sudo
[11:22] <sethk> redDEADresolve, leave off the > outputfile2 part, then you'll see what the output of lsmod is.  see if it's an error message.
[11:23] <Marlun> When I try to install Ubuntu 6.10 on my laptop I get "* Checking file systems..." and then "fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)" and then nothing happends.
[11:23] <sethk> redDEADresolve, try sudo lsmod      I don't have an edgy machine at my fingertips here.  you don't need sudo for lsmod on any other linux variant I've tried, but ...
[11:23] <sn9> mirak: most devices, unless they're really high-speed, should just work by being plugged in; no setserial involved. the command that sets the port settings is stty
[11:23] <redDEADresolve> sethk it worked
[11:23] <sethk> Marlun, are you sure?  is the disk activity light on?
[11:23] <sgirc> does somebody know how to restore the default file /etc/ppp/options ?
[11:24] <Marlun> sethk: nope.
[11:24] <sethk> Marlun, is the system dead?  does the caps lock light work?
[11:24] <fabien> join #ubuntu-fr
[11:25] <sethk> cmweb, sorry, did you get an answer to your anjunta question
[11:25] <sethfelder> hello peoples!
[11:25] <cmweb> sethk, no
[11:25] <sethk> Marlun, that's nasty.  is this a system that used to work?
[11:25] <sgirc> rseth: hello
[11:25] <sethfelder> eek, i cant believe i said that
[11:25] <sethk> cmweb, what was the question?  I was away for a few minutes.
[11:25] <Marlun> sethk: when I hit caps-lock theres no light coming on.
[11:26] <mirak> sn9: so what I must do is plug the device to the cable, and then  plug the cable ?
[11:26] <sn9> sgirc: it looks like you're trying to use br2684 and pppoa at the same time. i could be wrong, but i don't think that would work
[11:26] <Marlun> sethk: only with Windows, first time I've tried to install linux.
[11:26] <cmweb> sethk, I keep getting an error saying that the progrect has no executable output how do i fix this
[11:26] <sethfelder> can someone please go through step-by-step on how to mount a drive in ubuntu  live CD?
[11:26] <sethfelder> PLEASE!?!?!?
[11:26] <sethk> Marlun, try adding   ide=nodma to the kernel command line
[11:26] <sn9> mirak: just run whatever software communicates with the serial device
[11:26] <Marlun> sethk: I also get "mount: Function not implemented" before the "checking file systems..."
[11:26] <Ick> how do i get libdvdcss to work?
[11:27] <sn9> !dvd | Ick
[11:27] <ubotu> Ick: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[11:27] <sethk> Marlun, what file system type did you use for the root file system?
[11:27] <sethk> sethfelder, an IDE drive?
[11:27] <mirak> stty --file /dev/ttyUSB0               speed 9600 baud; line = 0;  -brkint -imaxbel
[11:27] <sethfelder> yeah
[11:27] <mirak> sn9:
[11:27] <Marlun> sethk: and before the "mount: ..." there are a "* Activating swap...".
[11:27] <sethk> cmweb, have you created a project?
[11:27] <sethfelder> im pretty sure it is
[11:27] <sethfelder> im doing it in vmware...........
[11:28] <sethk> sethfelder, I'll give you an example; you can adjust the numbers.   mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/something
[11:28] <sethfelder> ok, thanx
[11:28] <sethk> sethfelder, /mnt/something is any directory, -t ext3 is just a guess at the file system type
[11:28] <Marlun> sethk: Right now I've got Windows installed on a NTFS partition, and I've got another NTFS partition which I was going to install linux on but I never get that far.
[11:28] <mirak> sn9: at least when I used plugued the phoneix card reader the connection was happening
[11:28] <sethk> sethfelder, and /dev/hda1 assumes first partition on first ide drive.
[11:28] <sn9> mirak: i forget the exact syntax, but that doesn't look familiar
[11:28] <sethfelder> k
[11:28] <sethk> Marlun, so you are running the installer?  You've lost me, I thought it died on an fsck.  am I confusing two people?
[11:28] <sethfelder> ill give it a try.....
[11:29] <sethk> mirak, you probably need sudo to change the port configuration
[11:29] <Zlax> I got problem with desktop resolution.
[11:29] <Zlax> I installed nvidia drivers and they are working correctly ( tested in cedega, played Warcraft III :) )
[11:29] <Zlax> but for desktop resolutions i was offered only 3 resolutions with 60Hz refresh
[11:29] <Zlax> i have 21 inch monitor capable of displaying 1600x1024 at 100Hz (in windows)
[11:29] <Zlax> i edited xorg.conf to add Modelline generated online and added that resolution
[11:29] <Zlax> to Screens section for 24 bit color depth.
[11:29] <Zlax> Problem is that i can select 1600x1024 but at 50Hz which displays incorrect ( much darker image )
[11:29] <sgirc> sn9: before I change config files /etc/ppp/options and /etc/ppp/peers/peers-pppoa the log was different. there a little more line saying that a conextion is being initiated. Do u know how I can restore these files so that I can try again. Idont emember exactly which paameters I modified
[11:29] <cmweb> sethk, sorry yes i have
[11:29] <Moosejaw> do i have to install ndiswrapper from a specific place for it to install correctly?  Currently I am compiling the source and installing from Desktop but it doesnt seem to be working
[11:29] <gnomefreak> Zlax: please use pastebin
[11:29] <Moosejaw> i have also tried to do sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper but i get a cannot locate E: error

[11:30] <TokenBad> whats best way to install nvidia drivers for dapper?
[11:30] <sgirc> sn9: unfortunately no :(
[11:30] <sethk> Marlun, now I'm completely confused, because you wouldn't be doing a mount unless the install was completed and you were trying to boot the o/s.
[11:30] <gnomefreak> TokenBad: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[11:30] <Zlax> tokenbad: via envy for 6.10
[11:30] <sethk> cmweb, try bringing up the project settings, and look for a place to set the output exe name.
[11:30] <sethfelder> sethk: when doing to above, i get this "mount: mount point /mnt/somthing does not exist"
[11:30] <sethfelder> i probably did somthing really stupid
[11:31] <sethfelder> and obvidous
[11:31] <sethk> sethfelder, that's why I said "/mnt/something is any directory"
[11:31] <sn9> sgirc: well, at least you saw what was there -- i didn't. so you're in a better position to know how to fix it than i am
[11:31] <sethfelder> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[11:31] <sethk> sethfelder, just create a directory to mount it on
[11:31] <sethfelder> so i need to make it first?
[11:31] <jared_> hey i have a buddy that wants to make a car stereo linux mp3 video player and possibly do a gps    i was thinking to load up server eddition and then get a program or two to run this...   any sugestions?
[11:31] <anton_> sethfelder: you have to create it
[11:31] <sethfelder> k
[11:31] <sethk> sethfelder, right
[11:31] <Moosejaw> after doing a make install of the ndiswrapper source i still get an error that ndiswrapper not found...can someone please help me?
[11:31] <sethk> sethfelder, doesn't have to be in /mnt, although that's typically where one puts it.
[11:31] <cmweb> sethk, this is what i get The target executable does not exist for this Project
[11:31] <anton_> sethfelder: you can, of course, mount it anywhere you like. i wouldn't advise you try /bin, however
[11:31] <Marlun> sethk: no, I put in the CD and when the menu comes I choos "Run or install Ubuntu" (or something like that) the progress bar apears, after a while I get these messages: "* Activating swap..." "mount: Function not implemented" "* Checking file system..." "fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)".
[11:32] <sethk> cmweb, well, it wouldn't, until you build it.  let me see if I have anjuta on this box.
[11:32] <anto9us> make that #ubuntu-trivia folks, sorry for any inconvenience this error may have caused :P
[11:32] <sethk> Marlun, oh, ok.
[11:32] <Nlytn_> hi - my system is having serious conflicts with the edgy 2.6.17 kernel - is there someway i can downgrade using a repositary, say to 2.6.10 or so?
[11:32] <sethk> Marlun, sounds like either (1) a bad download, check the md5sum of the downloaded file, (2) a bad burn, or (3) try the text mode install if neither 1 or 2 is true
[11:32] <mirak> sethk: I am always in root
[11:32] <mirak> sethk: in fact I log on gnome with root
[11:33] <mirak> sethk: I am kidding
=== PriceChild_away is now known as PriceChild
[11:33] <sethk> mirak, good.
[11:33] <sethk> mirak, I think not setting the root password is dumb, but logging in as root is even dumber  :)
[11:33] <sethk> mirak, I'll install anjuta here, hold on.
[11:33] <anton_> question for the people using edgy: how many updates do you tend to get each week?
[11:34] <timo90> not many
[11:34] <timo90> about 2
[11:34] <lufis> How do I check an ext3 filesystem for corruption?
[11:34] <sethfelder> grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[11:34] <anton_> me neither. when i was using drake, i got about 10 updates a day (well, it felt like it)
[11:34] <sethfelder> it keeps comming up with tthe usage
[11:34] <timo90> i KNOW
[11:34] <Marlun> sethk: I ran the "Check CD for defects" and it found no checksum errors.
[11:34] <timo90> its stable thou rifght
[11:34] <sethk> Marlun, check cd doesn't do checksums
[11:35] <sethk> Marlun, check cd only makes sure that every sector is readable without an error
[11:35] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/
[11:35] <sethk> Marlun, but it does eliminate #2 (bad burn), almost certainly.
[11:35] <anton_> sethk: i thought it calculated an md5sum of all packages and compared them to the list
[11:35] <TokenBad> gnomefreak, but what about making sure its activated
[11:35] <sethk> anton_, I don't think so, because you can change the cd and it doesn't complain
[11:35] <timo90> anton:it does

[11:36] <sethk> Marlun, usually there is a file in the same directory, either one for each download file, or one for the entire directory, with the md5 sums.
[11:36] <sethk> anton_, I could be wrong.
[11:36] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/
[11:37] <anton_> sethk: i doubt it :)
[11:37] <Hexidigital> how can i create a script at boot that needs to be run by root?
[11:37] <sethk> Marlun, hopefully it is fairly evident.  if you can't find it, tell us the url and we'll look.
[11:38] <sethk> Hexidigital, do you really mean create the script at boot?  or do you mean create a script that will run at boot?
[11:38] <Hexidigital> sethk: yes, the latter :)
[11:38] <Marlun> sethk: found it :)
[11:38] <Hexidigital> sethk: i can easily create a script when i boot
[11:38] <sethk> Marlun, good.  probably will match, but it's easy to check, so check it.
[11:38] <solo> im sorry but, originall from gentoo here...       trying to install ndiswrapper for my WLAN card   BCM4318 ( a pain) and when making ndiswrapper   i get a stdlib.h no file or dir found,    well obiously im missing somthing   but what,  ??  and remember no net on that machine, (got to boot to xp partition to download and xfer files)
[11:38] <sethk> Hexidigital, just chown root:root scriptname
[11:38] <anton_> Hexidigital: if i remember correctly, any script you put in one of the /etc/rcx.d directories will be run at boot with root rights
[11:38] <sethk> Hexidigital, with sudo, if you aren't root when you run the chown
[11:39] <Nlytn_> my system if having serious conflicts with the 2.6.17 edgy kernel, is there a way to downgrade without recompiling a new kernel (crash before it completes), ie an older kernel in a repository?
[11:39] <sn9> solo: you don't need ndsiwrapper for that
[11:39] <Hexidigital> sethk, anton_ :: thanks
[11:39] <sethk> anton_, that's true, providing root has x privilege for the file.  doing a chown ensures that it does.
[11:39] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/ please take a look :'(
[11:40] <sn9> solo: use the bcm43xx-fwcutter, and the rest will work automagically
[11:40] <solo> ok
[11:40] <solo> thank you :)
[11:40] <solo> a yr ago BCM drivers on linux was a ******$%@%!@%!$#! of a time
[11:40] <solo> lol\
[11:40] <anton_> mon dieu. my firefox has just crashed again. this is getting annoying.
[11:41] <sethk> anton_, is the crash related to any particular plug in?
[11:41] <sgirc> sn9: I found the error message I had in my browser history. "LCP: Timeout Sending Config-Request". Does this make sense for you ?
[11:41] <Hexidigital> ubotu: paste
[11:41] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:41] <sn9> solo: you haven't tried in a whole year???
[11:41] <Hexidigital> sorry, that was meant for me... i forgot /msg
[11:41] <sethk> anton_, i've heard some talk about one of the plugins (not flash, but something of that sort) causing frequent crashes.
[11:41] <solo> sn9 how do i start the bcm cutter ,   site says its included in my kernel
[11:41] <anton_> sethk: difficult to say. i think it's because i haven't got a clue what i'm doing with firefox :)
[11:42] <sn9> sgirc: that's part of the ppp handshaking
[11:42] <sethk> anton_, I get crashes with ff 2, but not all that frequently.
[11:42] <Nlytn_> my system if having serious conflicts with the 2.6.17 edgy kernel, is there a way to downgrade without recompiling a new kernel (crash before it completes), ie an older kernel in a repository? anyone please? :(
[11:42] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/
[11:42] <micktm> hi!!
[11:42] <Marlun> sethk: yes it did match.
[11:42] <Zlax> hi
[11:42] <bruenig> anton_, try moving the plugins, then running firefox. If it doesn't crash, you can conclude it is one of the plugins.
[11:42] <micktm> In filenames I can't use chars such as ...
[11:42] <Marlun> sethk: how do I test the text mode install?
[11:42] <sethk> Marlun, ok.  I would try the text mode install next.  unfortunately, it's on the alternate cd.
[11:42] <sn9> solo: no, the driver is included in the kernel. the fwcutter is a separate pkg
[11:42] <micktm> how can i solve this problem?
[11:42] <anton_> sethk: bruenig: it doesn't really bother me atm. and these are the first plugins i've ever installed :)
[11:42] <solo> ok so just install fwcutter and i should b ok?
[11:42] <bruenig> anton_, or you can do the same for extensions. I had a bad cocktail of extensions cause firefox to crash everytime I opened
[11:42] <sn9> solo: yup
[11:43] <Dex-Freudii> how is "ubuntu" pronunced?
[11:43] <bruenig> oooooo - bunt - oooooo
[11:43] <sn9> solo: sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
[11:43] <sethk> micktm, what's your LOCALE?  (your language settings?)
[11:43] <TokenBad> gnomefreak,  last time I did that it would crash....
[11:43] <Marlun> sethk: oh, ok, I'll get that then.
[11:43] <micktm> italian
[11:43] <sgirc> sn9: Do you think it is a better posture than the current one ?
[11:44] <gnomefreak> TokenBad: do you have the linux-restricted-modules for your kernel installed?
[11:44] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/ please tell me if you dont know how ?
[11:44] <anton_> bruenig: that sounds bad :( if firefox ever gets that bad on me, i'll go back to lynx :)
[11:44] <heanol> anyone know if it's possible to use fglrx in xen?
[11:44] <TokenBad> not right now...just reinstalled....but last time I did
[11:44] <sn9> sgirc: ppp problems, whether dial-up or dsl, are not at all easy to track down
[11:44] <Hexidigital> can someone help me make a script out of this for NAT to start at boot? here is what i need to run http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33753/
[11:44] <bruenig> anton_, all I had to do was delete the .mozilla directory and then it was fine
[11:45] <anton_> bruenig: all i'm trying to do is find a torrent for gentoo... www.gentoo.org is being really slow.
[11:45] <micktm> sethk: italian
[11:45] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/
[11:45] <sethk> Hexidigital, all you need to do is create the file (which you already did, it appears), copy it to /etc/init.d, then put links to it at the run levels you want it to run  (as in /etc/rc1.d, )
[11:46] <sethk> micktm, you see all the prompts and messages and such in Italian?
[11:46] <Hexidigital> sethk: do i have to add any #!/bin/bash stuff to it? or leave it as is
[11:46] <Hexidigital> ?
[11:46] <micktm> sethk: yes
[11:46] <wilee85> rogue780, sdumfwgu
[11:46] <rogue780> wilee85, thanks
[11:46] <anton_> bruenig: the .mozilla directory is really useful :) question: i often spend time on lots of different computers and want to keep my internet preferences with me. (passwords, favourite pages etc). does anybody know of an internet service which offers this, or is that a little javascript project for me at some stage?
[11:46] <bruenig> anton_, http://btjunkie.org/torrent?do=download&id=464068ae998b2616f94139345c9d87b5c222bf69bb00.torrent
[11:46] <micktm> sethk: only in filenames I see a question mark instead of 
[11:46] <sethk> Hexidigital, the default is #!/bin/sh, so you can leave that line out for shell scripts
[11:46] <TokenBad> hope to brb
[11:46] <bruenig> anton_, that is for dvd though
[11:46] <Hexidigital> sethk: thanks much
[11:46] <sgirc> sn9: ok. I think the best strategy to solve this is to try to get back to the original situation where my system is waiting with the other peer LCP response, and then I will see with my ISP.
[11:47] <sethk> micktm, but in text with accents, you see the correct thing, the letter with the accent?
[11:47] <Hexidigital> be back
[11:47] <anton_> sounds good, bruenig :)
[11:47] <sn9> sgirc: sounds good
[11:47] <micktm> sethk: wait... I never noticed this...
[11:47] <AstuteCat> i'm having trouble starting ubuntu (6.06) on the livecd on my alienware aurora m9700 -- it hangs at startup on 'Starting kernel log' - it does, however, respond to ctrl-alt-delete and reboots, but it never gets to starting X.
[11:48] <Zlax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33752/
[11:48] <AstuteCat> anyone got any ideas? i'm stumped.
[11:48] <tengo> can someone help me
[11:48] <tengo> emergency
[11:48] <tengo> i just changed the screen resolution
[11:48] <tengo> and now i can't log onto gnome
[11:48] <micktm> sethk: yes, I can see them...
[11:48] <sn9> tengo: does the login screen still come up?
[11:48] <micktm> sethk: but not in latex documents
[11:48] <tengo> sn9 yes
[11:49] <anton_> oh baby, that torrent's flying :)
[11:49] <sethk> micktm, ok.  do this in a directory that has the bad file names:     ls | hexdump -C > outfile
[11:49] <tengo> sn9 but if i put in my usr name and password, after, it just goes back to the logon screen like a loop
[11:49] <sn9> tengo: what error does it give when you try to log in?
[11:49] <sethk> micktm, that creates a file named "outfile" with a dump of the text from ls
[11:49] <Zlax> can someone read what i type??????????
[11:49] <anton_> bruenig: i hope it isn't a link to your /dev/random, the torrent :)
[11:49] <tengo> sn9 after you log in, it just goes back to log on
[11:49] <sethk> micktm, edit that file, and see if the letters displaying as ? are in fact correct.
[11:49] <sethk> Zlax, I can't.
[11:49] <sn9> tengo: if you have a file ~/.ICEautority, delete it
[11:50] <sethk> micktm, I'm not sure how latex handles accents, so that doesn't tell me anything
[11:50] <tengo> i can't even log on sn9
[11:50] <sethk> micktm, but a dump of the ls output will.
[11:50] <sn9> tengo: login in text mode
[11:50] <sethk> tengo, did you try a console login?
[11:50] <gyaresu> sn9: tengo make sure your /home directory isn't full. CTRL+ALT+F2 then run 'df -h' to check. (this happens to me sometimes.)
[11:50] <tengo> how do i do that sethk
[11:50] <micktm> sethk: ok, done, and now what I have to do?
[11:50] <Zlax> :)
[11:51] <solo> is their like a fwcutter deb file??
[11:51] <sn9> solo: yes
[11:51] <mat1> tengo: crtl +alt F1
[11:51] <tengo> gyaresu its not full
[11:51] <sn9> solo: sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
[11:51] <gyaresu> tengo: cool.
[11:51] <sn9> tengo: ctrl-alt-F2
[11:51] <tengo> i changed my rez to 1280x1024 and now its not working
[11:51] <tengo> i'm there sn9
[11:52] <sethk> micktm, can you post it on the paste web site?
[11:52] <ctkroeker> Has anyone had any luck with skype on an ltsp client? referring to sound
[11:52] <sethk> tengo, if you have multiple resolutions defined, try cycling through them with control-alt-+  (that's control alt plus)
[11:52] <solo> sn9 : couldn't find package bcm43xx-fwcutter   :P
[11:53] <sn9> tengo: you logged in?
[11:53] <micktm> ok
[11:53] <tengo> sn9 yes
[11:53] <tengo> sethk, how do you get out of the console mode
[11:53] <sethk> tengo, control-alt-f7
[11:53] <sn9> solo: oh, that's right, it's in a non-default repository
[11:53] <bruenig> ctrl + alt + f7
[11:53] <mat1> alt f7
[11:53] <micktm> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33754/
[11:53] <tengo> how do you get out of safeterminal
[11:54] <solo> sn9: and that means....???

[11:55] <solo> so download the sep rep, and install fwcutter from their?
[11:55] <navyseal_> i already went to the printer menu but can't install it
[11:55] <sethk> micktm, give me the name of one of the files that shows the question marks.
[11:56] <ortega10> i need a good bittorrent client other than azureus (that lately refuses to work properly), any suggestions?
[11:56] <narrchy> Can anyone link me to a guide for burning Ubunto to CD-R?

[11:56] <narrchy> Anyone have any idea?
[11:57] <sn9> tengo: delete the file ~/.ICEauthority
[11:57] <tengo> how
[11:57] <tengo> sn9 how
[11:57] <sn9> tengo: rm ~/.ICEauthority
[11:57] <sethk> micktm, and give me another
[11:57] <micktm> sethk: there's only that one!
[11:58] <sethk> micktm, ok.  let me check one thing here quickly...
[11:58] <bruenig> navyseal_, mplayer plugins, sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer. You may also need some codecs. I am not positive
[11:58] <ortega10> narrchy: i can't give you a guide, but you can just download the iso image, and burn it with a program like infra burner
[11:58] <navyseal_> bruenig nop
[11:58] <sybariten> fastest FTP server to set up on a headless ubuntu box ?
[11:58] <navyseal_> it doesn't work at all
[11:58] <navyseal_> mplayer loads the video content
[11:58] <navyseal_> but don't plays it
[11:58] <tengo> sn9, i deleted it, but it still goes in a loop
[11:58] <sn9> tengo: hmm
[11:59] <ortega10> i need a good bittorrent client other than azureus (that lately refuses to work properly), any suggestions ?
[11:59] <kevin> try rebooting
[11:59] <narrchy> well
[11:59] <narrchy> ortega
[11:59] <bruenig> navyseal_, it played here. Are you sure you have all the codecs and stuff installed. w32codecs etc.
[11:59] <navyseal_> i think so
[11:59] <navyseal_> :S
[11:59] <sesamebike> hi! I don't understand dd. I'm doing a backup of a harddrive "Disk /dev/hda: 20.4 GB, 20490559488 bytes" using the live CD and the command "dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/sda1/backup". Problem is that it just keeps going. the backup file is now 3709825024 bytes and increasing (command still running). What am I missing here?
[11:59] <sn9> tengo: that happened to me before, but i don't remember how i fixed it -- but deleting that file was involved
[11:59] <narrchy> my friend and i are trying to burn it and he burned it with Isorecorder as a .iso onto the CD-R and the ysstem is not recognizing it
[11:59] <sethk> micktm, it looks like the filename is correct, and the problem is that it is showing you the ? in the terminal window
[11:59] <solo> ok sn9
[12:00] <sethk> micktm, because the character at that position is hex 2e, and question mark is hex 3f
[12:00] <sybariten> how do i find out if my machine already has an ftp server ?
[12:00] <micktm> it's...
[12:00] <solo> i understand the rep page,    but how am i to download them in a console without a working internet on the machine im workin on, is their a direct download for a massive pkg or what
[12:00] <tengo> sn9, i reverted back to 800x600 and it works
[12:00] <sethk> micktm, you'll notice (if you look) in the hexdump output that it's displayed as "." which means hexdump doesn't know how to display it.
[12:00] <brainsforsale> hey
[12:00] <anton_> sybariten: try it out :)
[12:00] <brainsforsale> i need some help
[12:00] <narrchy> Ortega, you see what I said?
[12:00] <tengo> sn9 any reason why?
[12:00] <brainsforsale> i am completely new to linux
[12:01] <brainsforsale> i have an old custom machine
