[12:01] <GigaClon> any page
[12:01] <sjbrown> is the link "#"
[12:01] <majestyelias> i just installed xmms and i cant read what it says when i left click for the menu.any suggestions to fix it?
[12:01] <GigaClon> no and it doesn't happen all the time
[12:01] <lullabud> majestyelias:  learn to read?  =P
[12:01] <Allz> okey where do i get .ubuntu .i just gonna burn it and start that way .ljl ,.can you post the site
[12:01] <lullabud> majestyelias:  what's the problem?  is it invisible, or colored wrong, or what?
[12:01] <sjbrown> dunno
[12:01] <LjL> slavi1: no idea, i can't even transliterate the first letter, the rest being "tvoi papa" i think
[12:01] <GigaClon> it select the link but doesn't actually click the link
[12:02] <LjL> Allz, get ubuntu? uh?
[12:02] <Allz> aha
[12:02] <Doow> Allz, www.ubuntu.com?
[12:02] <LjL> Allz, just start the CD
[12:02] <rickympl> im learning to prog in c++, and someone mentioned anjuta as an ide, but when i try to execute the prog a window appears asking for arguments,(dont really know wut o put) i click ok and an error stating that the file is not local, wut am i doing wrong?
[12:02] <LjL> Allz: just like you did when installing it
[12:02] <rickympl> sorry if im being a newb, i really am though
[12:02] <slavi1> LjL: how do I change it?
[12:02] <slavi1> !ru
[12:03] <ithicine> Oh, hey, question: can I enable xgl on only one display in a xinerama setup?
[12:03] <LjL> slavi1: you don't, because the bot is absent in the first place. if you give it to me i'll add it
[12:03] <Flannel> ithicine: #ubuntu-xgl
[12:03] <GigaClon> rickympl, for simple programs try SciTE it has a mini-ide for C++
[12:03] <slavi1>    #ubuntu-ru     .
[12:03] <jessicafl> How can I tell if Ubuntu is using my nVidia card?  I've heard the drivers might already be installed.
[12:03] <LjL> slavi1, thanks. will be added as soon as the bot is back
[12:03] <ithicine> Flannel: thanks
[12:03] <rickympl> GigaClon, thx
[12:04] <slavi1> jessicafl: in terminal 'glxinfo | grep direct'
[12:04] <rickympl> ill try that
[12:04] <GigaClon> sjbrown, any ideas
[12:04] <Antrixx_> rickympl: this isnt really a direct answer to you question, but I would recommend learning the basics of automake. Once your project has been set up and you understand your basics you will benefit from using an IDE such as anjuta later but also have a fair understanding of what is happening behind the scenes.
[12:04] <slavi1> if it says Direct Rendering: yes then you have hardware accelaration
[12:04] <ithicine> Flannel: woops, sorry, I meant glx
[12:04] <jessicafl> slavil: thanks.  looks like a no for me
[12:04] <GigaClon> rickympl, also learn about Scons its spiffy
[12:05] <brlancer> I can't play restricted formats with xine (edgy upgrade) - ogg works, mp3 and xvid give errors "The stream 'There is no mrl.' use
[12:05] <jessicafl> Second question :) How do I enable it?  Drivers from nvidia?  Debian package?  Thanks! :)
[12:05] <Flannel> ithicine: eh? what are you trying to do?
[12:05] <brlancer>  an unsupported codec:"
[12:05] <unfo> hi all, can i do an apt-get clean from within synaptic?
[12:05] <Doow> rickympl, what's the exact error message?
[12:06] <brlancer> things worked fine in dapper, and I've installed everything I could find that was in edgy repositories
[12:06] <rickympl> program "so and so" is not a local file
[12:06] <rickympl> Program '/home/rickympl/Projects/4-----6' is not a local file
[12:06] <dcordes> how can i convert .wav to .mp3?
[12:06] <ithicine> Flannel: I've got a Radeon 9000 (DRI is no problem), but I've got an S3 ViRGE in a PCI slot I'd like to use without losing GLX on my 9000 (primary display)
[12:06] <slavi1> jessicafl: I am not familiar with nvidia drivers ... look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia?highlight=%28binarydriver%29
[12:06] <jessicafl> slavil: thanks for all your help!!!!
[12:06] <sjbrown> dcordes, don't you want .ogg?
[12:07] <slavi1> np
[12:07] <slavi1> night all
[12:07] <dcordes> sjbrown: i would like to if my phone supported ogg :-(

[12:08] <rickympl> Doow, the error message is: Program '/home/rickympl/Projects/4-----6' is not a local file

[12:09] <Flannel> aktiwers: ##java is what you want
[12:09] <Doow> rickympl, I don't know what would make it say that, sorry
[12:09] <sjbrown> dcordes, search for "enc" with apt
[12:09] <aktiwers> ups.. sorry.. on the wrong channel
[12:09] <Lars_G> Ohhhkay, hi all
[12:09] <aktiwers> heh I do this all the time
[12:09] <kiersie> hi there
[12:09] <rickympl> doow, thx
[12:09] <dcordes> sjbrown: there are too many packages containing enc
[12:09] <Doow> rickympl, I'd recommend #anjuta on GIMPNet if it wasn't so damn quiet
[12:09] <kiersie> who has got a node list for gnuttella-gift

[12:12] <Doow> dcordes, it has some info about that
[12:12] <Lars_G> Doow: good call
[12:12] <Lars_G> Any tips on my question?
[12:12] <kiersie> Whoos got nodes list from gift-fnutella
[12:12] <CharlieSu> Anyong in here use encryption for a partition?
[12:13] <unfo> CharlieSu: try channel ##security
[12:13] <CharlieSu> unfo: I've found an error with the Ubuntu Docs though..
[12:13] <jessicafl> Prolly stupid question.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia says for prerequisites i need 'lspci | grep - i nvidia' to work (it does) and i need hardware accelerated 3d support (that's the nvidia card, right!??) thanks
[12:13] <unfo> CharlieSu: with the wiki? anyone can edit the wiki.
[12:13] <dcordes> Doow: restricted formats was a good idea. soundconverter is what is was looking for.
[12:13] <CharlieSu> unfo: no, the official docs
[12:14] <dcordes> thx
[12:14] <Doow> dcordes, great =)
[12:14] <unfo> oh. :( I wish there was a "feedback" textbox at the bottom of those docs.
[12:14] <zach634> what command extracts zip archives?
[12:14] <lullabud> jessicafl:  yes, the nvidia card would provide the hardware 3d support so long as you have the proper driver loaded.
[12:14] <CharlieSu> unfo: How can I report the error?
[12:15] <jessicafl> ok! thanks lullabud
[12:15] <unfo> CharlieSu: there is a Ubuntu Documentation Team mailing list.
[12:15] <unfo> dunno how to subscribe. google for it.
[12:16] <MR_Frigz`x-chat> irc.brasnet.org
[12:18] <bimberi> zach634: unzip
[12:19] <altrd-bst> anyone know if there is a bootcamp for linux?
[12:19] <altrd-bst> or if not, can ubuntu install on intel macs?
[12:19] <`Bleu> anyone got Openwebmail installed on Ubuntu Server 6.06?
[12:19] <unfo> `Bleu: no, but I just installed a squirrelmail variant an hour ago
[12:20] <unfo> i like squirrelmail.
[12:20] <Flannel> altrd-bst: You can.
[12:20] <altrd-bst> natively? without virtualization?
[12:20] <unfo> !intel macs
[12:20] <unfo> !intel mac
[12:20] <Flannel> ubotu is dead at the moment. hmm.
[12:20] <majestyelias> i just installed xmms and i cant read what it says when i left click for the menu.any suggestions to fix it?
[12:21] <unfo> ubotu: ping
[12:21] <altrd-bst> unfo: you're saying flannel is wrong?
[12:21] <majestyelias> i just installed xmms and i cant read what it says when i left click for the menu.any suggestions to fix it?
[12:21] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: There are instructions on wiki.ubuntu.com for installing on intel macs, it is mostly the same as PC's but the few differences are crutial.
[12:21] <altrd-bst> cool, i'll see if i can find it
[12:21] <`Bleu> Thanks ufo, im currently using openwebmail on another linux box, but i just built an ISPconfig box running 6.06 and would like to get openwebmail working on that.  It seems that squirrelmail is the most mentioned for ubuntu
[12:21] <unfo> altrd-bst: no, i just wanted to see what would happen. maybe ubuntu was merely wonky instead of down?
[12:21] <unfo> well, i guess not.
[12:21] <`Bleu> sorry unfo
[12:22] <hamdinp> where is the downloaded .deb packages with Synaptic Packet Manager in local drives?
[12:22] <altrd-bst> jordan: any chance you can help me find a link?
[12:22] <unfo> `Bleu: i think squirrelmail is the most popular webmail anywhere.
[12:22] <unfo> hamdinp: /var/cache/apt/archives -- but why do you ask?
[12:22] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: Which mac are you installing on?
[12:22] <hamdinp> info
[12:22] <`Bleu> unfo, any opinions on RoundCube?
[12:23] <unfo> `Bleu: never tried it. try channel #web maybe.
[12:23] <landan> its tight
[12:23] <landan> but buggy
[12:23] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: macbook , imac, mac pro etc?
[12:23] <ithicine> okay, to answer my own question, it looks like the S3 ViRGE can be used with GLX, hopefully meaning I might have accelerated 3D on both Xinerama displays.  If anyone wants to know if this works with ATI's binary drivers, I'll be sure to help anyone out who wants to try the same
[12:23] <unfo> CharlieSu: how did it go?
[12:23] <altrd-bst> well, just looking for answers right now
[12:23] <altrd-bst> but would be a mac pro
[12:23] <unfo> ithicine: if you want to help out, feel free to post a little page on the wiki.
[12:24] <unfo> s/a little page/a note
[12:24] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: Nice, that is the only model with the option of an Nvidia card :)
[12:24] <zach634> well, i guess I should believe in karma, because now my ubuntu server wont work ><
[12:24] <jessicafl> slavil and lullabud thanks!  it's looking good so far.  gotta reboot.  THANKS!
[12:24] <altrd-bst> i see you have an allegiance, sorry, I don't ;)
[12:24] <Flannel> altrd-bst: intel mac?  Installation is normal, except you need to get elilo (lilo for EFI), and... I dont know if theres a wiki page, if you google there's howtos, I know that much.
[12:25] <CharlieSu> unfo: good, thanks for asking
[12:25] <lifepositive> hi
[12:25] <xTERMiNATOR> Hi friend :)
[12:25] <altrd-bst> flannel: cool, i'll check it out
[12:25] <lifepositive> xTERMiNATOR: hello friend
[12:25] <unfo> The word "hi" takes up 80 chars of screen space (1 square inch) on IRC.
[12:25] <Flannel> altrd-bst: but, the only issues you might have is the bootloader, after that, I believe it's all fine.
[12:26] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: If you use elilo you can't use nvidias drivers, bootcamp is the way to go IMHO.
[12:26] <altrd-bst> yeah, that was the problem
[12:26] <kiersie> who have got gift-gnutella
[12:26] <altrd-bst> how to get a linux install disc that supports EFI
[12:26] <unfo> does the standard Ubuntu 6.06 CD install elilo?
[12:26] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: Are you sure you want to boot with EFI instead of BIOS emulation?
[12:26] <unfo> (when used on macs)
[12:27] <Flannel> unfo: not that Im aware of
[12:27] <neobonzi> How do I load up a module with modprobe by default when ubuntu starts up? (its for my wireless card()
[12:27] <altrd-bst> according to wikipedia, only gentoo has an efi install disc
[12:27] <Jordan_U> neobonzi: /etc/moduals add it there
[12:27] <altrd-bst> jordan: so if I use boot camp it will do the bios emulation?
[12:27] <Flannel> altrd-bst: I believe someone has an unofficial Dapper EFI install disk
[12:28] <Terminus> altrd-bst: http://bin-false.org/?p=17
[12:28] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: Yes, and you can use the regular install CD.
[12:28] <altrd-bst> okay, thanks
[12:28] <altrd-bst> i had never used boot camp before
[12:28] <neobonzi> Jordan_U, the problem is im not exactly sure what to add - i kinda skim through these directions whenever i want wireless http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/INSTALL
[12:28] <altrd-bst> so one you mod your bios with bootcamp
[12:28] <unfo> Jordan_U: then how will he get elilo?
[12:28] <altrd-bst> *once
[12:28] <WonderWal> am i correct ISPConfig works on both console and X?
[12:29] <altrd-bst> it will boot any el torito disc?
[12:29] <Killerkiwi> what package is iostram.h in?
[12:29] <Killerkiwi> iostream.h
[12:29] <Jordan_U> unfo: You don't need elilo, grub works fine with a little tweaking.
[12:29] <bruenig> !info libboost-iostreams1.33.1
[12:29] <ithicine> Killerkiwi: apt-get install build-essentials
[12:29] <WonderWal> nevermind.
[12:30] <zach634> build-essential
[12:30] <altrd-bst> okay, sounds like it can be done without too much trouble
[12:30] <altrd-bst> thanks for the help
[12:30] <altrd-bst> this is totally off-topic to ubuntu, but since I'm here and talking about it
[12:30] <Killerkiwi> Itcharlie,  did that no luck
[12:30] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacBook?highlight=%28macbook%29 most of this should apply to the mac pro also.
[12:30] <altrd-bst> thanks jordan
[12:30] <Killerkiwi> ithicine, no luck
[12:30] <Jordan_U> altrd-bst: #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[12:31] <altrd-bst> okay, fair enough ;)
[12:31] <superkirbyartist> How do you set the keyboard to canadian french?
[12:31] <ithicine> Killerkiwi: omit the 's' there... zach was right, it's build-essential
[12:31] <snwyvern> Anyone have familiarity with Edgy / pcmcia ?
[12:31] <unfo> snwyvern: about half here use edgy.
[12:31] <Killerkiwi> Itcharlie,  Ive got that installed
[12:32] <snwyvern> I'm having some serious difficulties getting a PC Card to work.
[12:32] <Killerkiwi> Itcharlie,  fusecram.c:44:22: error: iostream.h: No such file or directory
[12:32] <unfo> superkirbyartist: there was an option to do so when you installed Ubuntu.  If you didn't choose it, look in System > Preferences > Keyboard.
[12:32] <grebe> arg :-(
[12:33] <Killerkiwi> ithicine,   fusecram.c:44:22: error: iostream.h: No such file or directory
[12:33] <grebe> Is there a yahoo chat, which has webcam, that works with v4l2 ???
[12:33] <grebe> webcam support in linux apps is seriously pissing me off.
[12:33] <ithicine> Killerwiki: did you install build essential?  If you did, it's almost certainly a problem with the sources you're compiling.  Maybe your PATH isn't set correctly, too...
[12:34] <Flannel> grebe: Not the webcams, the protocols.  Yahoo hasn't exactly opened their video protocols.
[12:34] <grebe> Flannel, .....
[12:34] <grebe> Flannel, you're not hearing me.
[12:34] <snwyvern> Does anyone know where I should look when lspcmcia gives me a "No Driver" error/
[12:34] <grebe> Flannel, gyachi WORKS... but... I can't find a cam off the shelf today, that speaks V4L1
[12:35] <grebe> Flannel, or, if it does.. the driver is too stupid to resize to the image format that gyachi wants.
[12:35] <WonderWal> anyone using ubuntu on a commcercial server?
[12:35] <Flannel> grebe: really?  Wow.  I know lots of them that do.  Heck, my $10 one from target does
[12:35] <Killerkiwi> ithicine, trying a reinstall of build-essential
[12:35] <grebe> Flannel, I jus tfinished trying three different webcams that i bought off the shelf from Microcenter.
[12:36] <haxality> hey..
[12:36] <grebe> none of them worked
[12:36] <grebe> NONE.
[12:36] <unfo> grebe: ebay?
[12:36] <haxality> can I get some help, I'm kind of having a serious problem
[12:36] <Jordan_U> haxality: Sure, just ask :)
[12:36] <unfo> haxality: if you tell us your question, if someone knows the answer, they'll tell you.
[12:36] <Flannel> grebe: did they get recognized by the kernel?  What device numbers?
[12:36] <haxality> my video drivers are severely messed up
[12:36] <grebe> but even then, there isn't a definitive list of "Hey, this hardware works."
[12:36] <unfo> !smart questions
[12:36] <haxality> like, I can still run GNOME
[12:36] <grebe> Flannel, yes... but one of several things usually happens.....
[12:36] <ithicine> Killerkiwi: I'm not sure a *re*install is going to fix anything, if it's already there.  What are you trying to compile, anyway?  I'm willing to bet your sources aren't using the correct path
[12:37] <haxality> but when I move or resize windows, their output gets garbled
[12:37] <Doow> unfo: ubotu seems to be dead atm
[12:37] <Killerkiwi> cramfs, works without iostream
[12:37] <haxality> also when I scroll on webpages, etc, it gets severely messed up
[12:37] <Jordan_U> grebe: Yes there is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras?highlight=%28webcam%29
[12:37] <unfo> sad. who is ubotu's sysadmin?
[12:37] <haxality> I've tried googling and searching the forums and I can't find anything
[12:37] <grebe> Flannel, (1) the image format isn't correct, so gyachi displays a white display... (2) v4l2 only, so I get a nasty popup, (3) CAN'T SET CAMERA PROPERTIES
[12:37] <Doow> unfo: Seveas
[12:37] <haxality> I tried to reconfigure xorg but to no avail
[12:38] <ailean> Lahey,
[12:38] <unfo> Seveas: ping. Ubotu is down, any clue please? :)
[12:38] <haxality> any kind of input would be greatly appreciated
[12:38] <grebe> Jordan_U, are any of these things actually on the shelf at normal computer stores? or do I have to buy it used off Ebay?
[12:38] <unfo> haxality: when did the problem start?
[12:38] <haxality> today, when I installed ubuntu
[12:38] <haxality> :P
[12:38] <unfo> grebe: what's wrong with ebay? shopping there is pleasant.
[12:38] <adilson> ola
[12:38] <unfo> and cheap.
[12:38] <haxality> and, I've used linux before, but I just recently installed it
[12:38] <grebe> Jordan_U, I ask, because these are totally logical questions that normal people will ask.
[12:38] <adilson> please I need help
[12:38] <Jordan_U> grebe: No clue, my built in webcam worked out of the box.
[12:39] <SilentDis> hello :)
[12:39] <snwyvern> any ideas?
[12:39] <Jordan_U> grebe: Other than that I havn't done much with webcams
[12:39] <adilson> debian etch with sata 3112.... please, what is the correct parameter for boot prompt?
[12:39] <haxality> the only clue I could find was a vague mention of video troubles someone had while installing redhat on this model laptop
[12:39] <unfo> adilson: wrong channel.
[12:39] <sjbrown> adilson, don't ask to ask, just ask
[12:39] <haxality> something about acceleration being disabled
[12:39] <adilson> sorry,
[12:39] <adilson> could you help me....???
[12:40] <unfo> adilson: no. wrong channel. :(
[12:40] <unfo> sorry.
[12:40] <haxality> I mean, I understand if that's a tad too obscure
[12:40] <tazzix> Any guru out there have some fusesmb knowledge?
[12:40] <haxality> but I was hoping someone in here had seen something similar before
=== animal__ is now known as animal_
[12:40] <unfo> tazzix: maybe try #samba or the fuse lists.
[12:40] <tazzix> thnks
[12:40] <snwyvern> I have a orinoco chipset PC Card that is not auto-recognized by Ubuntu Edgy Eft. I do see a "Driver not loaded" message in lspcmcia when the card is instereted. Anyone have any ideas?
[12:40] <Lars_G> I guess there's no response to me
[12:41] <unfo> haxality: try the mailing lists or www.ubuntuforums.org. describe your problem well: google for the Smart Questions web page.
[12:41] <Lars_G> that means, I'll have to do it by hand
[12:41] <Lars_G> poor hands.
[12:41] <Lars_G> they've done so much
[12:41] <haxality> thanks, unfo
[12:41] <unfo> :)
[12:41] <jvai> lol @ lars
[12:41] <Lars_G> :)
[12:41] <haxality> so far no one has responded to my ubuntuforums post, but hopefully that will change
[12:41] <haxality> :P
[12:41] <Lars_G> what's your post on haxality ?
[12:41] <snwyvern> I had great help from there last time I had an issue, haxality.
[12:41] <edg1> hey, Ubuntu sucks it doesn't allow installing a boot-loader to floppy?
[12:42] <Flannel> edg1: it does.
[12:42] <unfo> haxality: buy a new video card at ebay or see www.freecycle.org and see if another one works better perhaps.
[12:42] <Lars_G> Flannel: I think he means the dialog/X11 installer
[12:42] <Lars_G> Oh gods
[12:42] <haxality> it's a laptop, unfortunately
[12:42] <Lars_G> haxality: Fighting an Ati card?
[12:42] <snwyvern> Blah.
[12:42] <haxality> no, I believe it's an obscure Trident Cybersomething or other actually
[12:42] <Lars_G> haxality: I'm sorry dude. When you go insane we'll miss you
[12:43] <haxality> the xorgconfig actually autodetected it once
[12:43] <haxality> hahahaha
[12:43] <Lars_G> haxality: Hmmmm what laptop, an older toshiba?
[12:43] <haxality> much appreciated
[12:43] <haxality> yes, actually
[12:43] <haxality> Tecra M1
[12:43] <Jordan_U> haxality: lapci should tell you.
[12:43] <haxality> roughly 3-4 years old
[12:43] <unfo> haxality: you may save time if you just try a variety of linux distributions. if ubuntu has the problem, consider OpenSuse or (ugh) Fedora.
[12:43] <kek> anyone know a standalone program which can show the debian menu of installed programs if you don't use gnome/kde/windowmaker?
[12:43] <ithicine> edg1: it can still be done, there just isn't a handy-dandy graphical tool to do it with (that I know of)
[12:43] <haxality> aw, but I like ubuntu
[12:43] <unfo> me too.
[12:43] <Doow> kek: dselect
[12:43] <Lars_G> haxality: Yes I fought a similar one not long ago. There WAS a driver for it on 2.4 IDK if it was ported to 2.6 it surely was. the problem you'll have is to find and enter the adecuate scan values for Xorg.
[12:43] <Flannel> kek: or aptitude
[12:44] <edg1> when i choose to install grub to (fd0) i rebooted and found no boot-loader on floppy?
[12:44] <haxality> ahhh ok
[12:44] <haxality> hmmm
[12:44] <haxality> hmmm
[12:44] <motin_> shit - upgrading to edgy broke down my system!
[12:44] <kek> Doow: no, i don't want to install, i want to start/browse installed programs
[12:44] <haxality> its weird, because
[12:44] <motin_> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/71979
[12:44] <haxality> the last Ubuntu distro I used was dapper drake
[12:44] <Lars_G> haxality: give me a second....
[12:44] <haxality> and it didn't have any of these problems
[12:44] <motin_> going in for a total restore from backup now
[12:44] <haxality> by all means, Lars_G
[12:44] <unfo> haxality: dapper is good too.
[12:44] <Lars_G> haxality: So are you missing the dirver, or having problems with the Xorg config?
[12:45] <edg1> how do i install grub to floppy during install? anyone know?
[12:45] <haxality> I think I do have the driver
[12:45] <SilentDis> i've herd of too many problems at this point.  I'll stay on dapper :)
[12:45] <haxality> but the xorg config is being difficult
[12:45] <Doow> kek: you mean to replace the menu bar?
[12:45] <Lars_G> good, good
[12:45] <snwyvern> Anyone, pcmcia?
[12:45] <haxality> it's odd
[12:45] <haxality> because
[12:45] <tuskernini> i have edgy and dapper..
[12:45] <haxality> it autodetected it perfectly
[12:45] <haxality> but the problems didn't go away
[12:45] <tuskernini> dapper is just wating there untill edgy goes wrong... still waiting
[12:45] <Lars_G> what problems you have exactly?
[12:46] <kek> Doow: yeah you could say that, or another example: accessing the debian menu from w9wm
[12:46] <SilentDis> question:  anyone know of a batch interface to lame?  gui would be nice, but I'm comfortable enough at the prompt :)
[12:46] <ithicine> edg1: you sure the floppy works?  I have never, ever seen such a problem before.  You say the install lets you put grub on a floppy?  (About to find out when I install Edgy in a minute... sitting on Windows ATM (ugh))
[12:46] <haxality> lots of garbled window output
[12:46] <Lars_G> Nod.
[12:46] <haxality> particularly when I scroll
[12:46] <Lars_G> It's odd toshiba continued to use these chips
[12:46] <haxality> move, or resize
[12:46] <Doow> kek: sorry, can't help you there, didn't even know there was a gui independent debian menu
[12:46] <tuskernini> SilentDis, just write one yourself, its quite fun...
[12:46] <haxality> yeah, seriously
[12:47] <edg1> ho, did anyone manage to install grub to floppy during install? how did they do it? thanks
[12:47] <haxality> they're the only company that kept using trident chips after like 1996
[12:47] <Jordan_U> haxality: In the short term you can always use VESA.
[12:47] <haxality> now that's the odd thing
[12:47] <haxality> maybe xorgconfig just didn't write the file or something
[12:47] <haxality> but
[12:47] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  i know some scripting, but no where near skilled enough yet to do it as a bash or nautilius script yet :(
[12:47] <haxality> I set it to use vesa
[12:47] <haxality> and it was still ganked
[12:47] <haxality> it seems to be almost like video acceleration isn't working at all
[12:48] <snwyvern> Anyone feel like fielding the driver issue?
[12:48] <tuskernini> SilentDis, me neather and i did it... wait...
[12:48] <Discerer> when trying modprobe ndiswrapper I get "FATAL: error inserting ndiswrapper: invalid argument". This is just after I had run upgrades on the system, it worked before. ideas?
[12:48] <noelferreira> lupine_85: are you there?
[12:48] <kek> Doow: yes, debian packages register themselves with a menu system. i think i found a package though: pdmenu
[12:48] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  i assume, also, i'd have to learn to use something to read out id3 tags, to preserve them.  not sure of a command line tool to do that
[12:48] <unfo> Discerer: avoid ndiswrapper :) you can buy cheap wireless miniPCI cards on ebay.
[12:49] <noelferreira> hi people
[12:49] <sgp> /quit
[12:49] <unfo> Discerer: does your wireless card have native drivers?
[12:49] <elknof1> hey
[12:49] <haxality> any ideas?
[12:49] <Discerer> well currently that's not an option unfo :p
[12:49] <elknof1> hi everybody
[12:49] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working with edgy?
[12:49] <unfo> elknof1: please, one hello only.
[12:49] <elknof1> dows anyone knows how to mount ipod in amarok?
[12:49] <Discerer> no unfo i've been forced to use ndiswrapper (the card has a marvell chip)
[12:49] <Lars_G> haxality: I'm looking at other tecra users, saddly the ubuntu user had no troubles, like you at first.
[12:49] <snwyvern> Mine has naitive drivers, but they're not working...
[12:49] <tuskernini> SilentDis, i did not do tags... here is how i did it from mp4 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32024/
[12:49] <Lars_G> haxality: We need people with troubles who managed to overcome them
[12:49] <haxality> yeah
[12:50] <haxality> I definitely see this as a super-obscure problem
[12:50] <chopchop_> hi, i have successfully config the box to use dual screen display but i got trouble when run mplayer or other apps that use xv. When i move the mouse to the second screen, the mplayer screen moves. Can anyone help me out?
[12:50] <unfo> Discerer: there are likely also free wireless 802.11B cards on www.freecycle.org.
[12:50] <Jordan_U> haxality: THe Edgy boot splash has srewed graphics up before, albiet not in this way that I know of, try booting without the "splash" kernel parameter.
[12:50] <unfo> or USB sticks.
[12:50] <haxality> oh really
[12:50] <haxality> intriguing
[12:50] <Lars_G> haxality: It's not always as obscure as you thing
[12:50] <haxality> that's just in the grub config file, right?
[12:50] <Lars_G> haxality: try what you've been suggested
[12:51] <tuskernini> SilentDis, pacpl is a nice perl audio converter... try to install it
[12:51] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  ahh, i wanted something to basically 'downmix' my mp3s.  the MP3 cd player at work, as well as the one in my car, don't handle anything but 128cbr files well (i encode to 224vbs usually)
[12:51] <haxality> ok, my last question is how do I modify the kernel boot params
[12:51] <Jordan_U> haxality: You can do it from the grub prompt when you boot also, grub allows you to edit the kernel parameters at boot time.
[12:51] <Discerer> yeah, but this card worked just a couple of minutes ago before I upgraded, that's the weird thing unfo
[12:51] <haxality> alrigh
[12:51] <haxality> t
[12:51] <haxality> thank you guys very much
[12:52] <haxality> I will see you on the other side, so to speak
[12:52] <haxality> :)
[12:52] <Lars_G> bingo
[12:52] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  i take it that app isn't in the repositories?
[12:52] <tuskernini> SilentDis, so just use ... lame -h -b 128 file.wav file.mp3
[12:52] <tuskernini> SilentDis, dont know... try
[12:53] <Lars_G> you know haxality is just the kind of user I like to help
[12:53] <Lars_G> Proactive noncombatant cheerfull user
[12:53] <Lars_G> why can't I have more like these over the phone?
[12:53] <edg1> hey anyone manage to get grub on floppy during the ubuntu install?
[12:53] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  yes, that would be fine... except when theres nearly 300 songs to convert... one by one... by hand...
[12:53] <ngd> hey guys, is anyone using Ubuntu on Mac and remaped their Caps Lock to Control
[12:53] <Lars_G> So who wants to help me before I go mad?
[12:53] <Jordan_U> xmoto no longer runs and uotputs this when I try to start it: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[12:53] <Jordan_U> fatal exception : invalid or missing texture file (Textures/UI/Loading.png)
[12:53] <ngd> it doesn't work out of the box with XModmap or via Gnome
[12:53] <Lars_G> SilentDis: Use a short bash script.
[12:54] <tuskernini> SilentDis, thats why you do for i in *.mp3 do lame... etc etc

[12:54] <stankhorns_>       /msg nickserv link stankhorns_  1743299
[12:54] <tuskernini> SilentDis, first test it with a few copied files
[12:54] <lupine_85> w00t
[12:54] <Lars_G> stankhorns_: Good, now change your password first, and cry latter
[12:54] <SilentDis> larg_g:  and there's my sticker.  I can whip out PHP code like there's no problem.  this is an exceptionally simple thing, to my mind, to handle with a script.  problem is, of course, i have no clue when it comes to bash scripting rofl
[12:55] <FantasticFoo> what do you do if you get a kernel panic at bootup, and an error saying "unable to mount root fs on unknown block (8,3)" after upgrading to edgy?
[12:55] <FantasticFoo> it'd be kind of nice if i could boot up.
[12:55] <lupine_85> FantasticFoo: try the next kernel down in the list
[12:55] <Lars_G> SilentDis: simple do it all: for i in *.mp3; do lame <wathever wathever> $i;done
[12:55] <FantasticFoo> lupine_85: what "list"?
[12:55] <Lars_G> SilentDis: $i is exchanged for the file name
[12:55] <lupine_85> grub
[12:56] <Doow> SilentDis: you can do stuff like that with php if you want to
[12:56] <FantasticFoo> lupine_85: i don't have grub
[12:56] <scip> FantasticFoo:  sounds like /dev broken :/
[12:56] <snwyvern> Anyone know how to fix a driver that's not attatched to a card?
[12:56] <Doow> SilentDis: php isn' tonly for web
[12:56] <FantasticFoo> scip: is it fixable?
[12:56] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: You should, you can hit esc at boot to show the menu
[12:56] <lupine_85> then... you're using lilo?
[12:56] <Jordan_U> FantasticFoo: You have lilo?
[12:56] <FantasticFoo> Jordan_U: yeah
[12:56] <FantasticFoo> Jordan_U: i doo
[12:56] <lupine_85> yuk :D
[12:56] <scip> yuk
[12:56] <lupine_85> use a live CD instead, then
[12:56] <ActiVe> Hi, how can i tell if ubuntu is using both cores of my cpu correctly?
[12:56] <Doow> SilentDis: well, it might be better suited for web, but it can do local stuff too
[12:56] <Jordan_U> FantasticFoo: Do you have a backup of your lilo.conf?
[12:56] <FantasticFoo> Jordan_U: erm
[12:56] <lupine_85> edit your lilo config to use the old kernel, reboot
[12:56] <FantasticFoo> Jordan_U: no
[12:57] <SilentDis> Doow:  i know.  the problem is reading the output and such... I know i'd want a bit 'more' out of it, and I can't see how to do stuff like read output, etc.
[12:57] <lupine_85> do you know how to configure lilo?
[12:57] <noelferreira> hi lupine_85
[12:57] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: Basically it seems you are not using a initrd image, or your kernel has no access during boot time to the module required to read the FS your root is in, pretty common for self compiled kernels, odd for upgrade-kernels but you might be using JFS or XFS for your main system, idk
[12:57] <FantasticFoo> how do i edit lilo.conf without being able to boot up?
[12:57] <lupine_85> ^ with a live CD ^
[12:57] <edg1> ok, Ubuntu caused all those probs so people would go right back into mcsofts dirty hands right!
[12:57] <Jordan_U> FantasticFoo: LiveCD.
[12:57] <noelferreira> i installed rutilt to configure rt61 but i had problems
[12:57] <SilentDis> anyone have a quick link to 'bash scripting for dummies' or the like?  I'd probably be able to do it in a day with that rofl
[12:57] <FantasticFoo> ok
[12:57] <Doow> SilentDis: ok, I don't know any details of php, just that it can do it =)
[12:57] <Lars_G> ActiVe: "cat /proc/cpuinfo"  if you see both cpus listed, then it's ok
[12:57] <SilentDis> all the guides I've read are EXCEPTIONALLY light on it :(
[12:57] <FantasticFoo> how do i get it so that i use the old kernel?
[12:57] <lightup> hey can anyone help me please, I'm trying to install a package called qjoypad but it says I have an unsatisfiable dependency libqt3c102-mt even though I have qt3 installed in synaptic?
[12:57] <noelferreira> can you help me lupine_85?
[12:58] <Parisi> hmm.
[12:58] <lupine_85> noelferreira: does rutilt say you're connected?
[12:58] <noelferreira> no
[12:58] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: no, i'm using ext3
[12:58] <noelferreira> error code 95
[12:58] <tuskernini> SilentDis, you can learn loads from this script http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32030/
[12:58] <Parisi> Does Ubuntu support dual core Amd's by default?
[12:58] <lupine_85> b0rken partition maybe?
[12:58] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: It's an odd situation then, unless you did setup your own lilo and forgot to include the initrd on the load process
[12:58] <ActiVe> Lars_G i have a dual core cpu...does this still apply?
[12:58] <lupine_85> noelferreira: sorry, I have no idea what that is
[12:58] <Lars_G> It can also be a broken partition, or root fs too
[12:58] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: nope, i included initrd
[12:59] <lupine_85> I suspect it's to do with you using amd64
[12:59] <Lars_G> ActiVe: Yes, anything the system considers a cpu, be it an extra core, or another cpu, is listed there.
[12:59] <noelferreira> something related with tx
[12:59] <lupine_85> it's just strange that it worked before
[12:59] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: maybe somehow lilo.conf got overridden before?
[12:59] <edg1> sionora Ubuntu to bad it sucks mcsofts now;)
[12:59] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  you are a godsend, I can figure it out from that easily :)
[12:59] <noelferreira> transfer rate lupine_85
[12:59] <SperMite> how do i list what kind of cdrom i have in console?
[12:59] <lupine_85> maybe try building latest svn?
[12:59] <Lars_G> ActiVe: If you see only 1 cpu you most possibly using a single-proc kernel and need a smp (symetric multi processor) one
[12:59] <ActiVe> Lars_G i only see cpu 0
[12:59] <lupine_85> however, it's just about my bedtime, sorry
[12:59] <tuskernini> SilentDis, i think so... where they use ffmpeg... you just use lame
[12:59] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: It's odd. I'd boot with a live cd, check the partitions, run a fsck on the root system and then fix lilo
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> lemme try changing lilo.conf
[01:00] <[1] Gnewf> when my computer starts up, how can i have it log in to X automatically??
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> brb
[01:00] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: ok
[01:00] <ActiVe> Lars_G ok...i installed from the dapper drake dvd. Should i have downloaded an alternate install cd?
[01:00] <SilentDis> final quicky question:  anyone know of a tool to read out ID3 tags and dump them to veriables from the prompt?
[01:00] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: Do you know how to reinstall lilo using the live cd?
[01:00] <tuskernini> but be carefull, first test it with a couple of files you copied... strongs
[01:00] <noelferreira> lupine_85: critical error: can't get the Tx rate code:95
=== [1] Gnewf is now known as Gnewf
[01:00] <Lahey> has mosix been ported to Ubuntu?
[01:00] <Gnewf> when my computer starts up, how can i have it log in to X automatically??
[01:00] <SilentDis> tuskernini:  oh of course lol
[01:00] <Jordan_U> ActiVe: The alternate install is included on the DVD afik.
[01:01] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: no?
[01:01] <Doow> Gnewf: there's something about that on the wiki
[01:01] <lupine_85> noelferreira: that points to the driver being mean to you
[01:01] <Lars_G> ActiVe: No, check in your package list to install a linux-image package that's numbered the same as the kernel you're using (run uname -a) but that has the -smp suffix, and install that one
[01:01] <lupine_85> so try latest svn
[01:01] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: how do i run a fsck on the root system again?
[01:01] <lupine_85> http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/
[01:01] <gyop> Hello!
[01:01] <SilentDis> ok.  gonna go off and see what I can come up with.  tahnks again tuskernini :)
[01:01] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: i'm sort of a linux noob here
[01:01] <Jordan_U> FantasticFoo: Curious, why lilo?
[01:01] <lupine_85> also, maybe try the "legacy" rt61 driver
[01:01] <FantasticFoo> brb
[01:02] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: Mount the hdd somewhere, like /mnt or /media, then bind your dev directory there: "mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev", finally change root to it: "chroot /mnt" and run "lilo" to reinstall
[01:02] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: oh ok
[01:02] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: thanks
[01:02] <Lars_G> np
[01:02] <Jordan_U> Lars_G: And /proc
[01:02] <Jordan_U> right?
[01:02] <Lars_G> Jordan_U: Not always needed but yeah proc to.
[01:02] <ngd> control key remapping anyone?
[01:02] <Lars_G> FantasticFoo: do to proc the same you do to dev: "mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc"
[01:02] <FantasticFoo> Lars_G: ok
[01:03] <Lars_G> Ok i guess the answer to my question is NO so I'll leave you guys, have luck and wish me luck
[01:03] <scip> FantasticFoo: you can mark it as needing rechecking (man tune2fs I believe) then reboot, or go single user (telinit 1) then fsck.    probably. :)
[01:03] <AsheD> anybody familiar with the xvid settings for mencoder?
[01:03] <variant> FantasticFoo: just do mount -o proc none /mnt/proc
[01:03] <snwyvern> pcmcia driver not loading? Anyone?
[01:03] <Badman> bonne nuit
[01:03] <Doow> FantasticFoo: you could boot from a live-cd too and the do a fsck from there
[01:03] <FantasticFoo> Doow: that's what i'm planning on doing
[01:03] <teledyn_> something is going wrong - all CD's i try to burn under ubuntu are messed up.  any ideas?
[01:03] <Lars_G> Doow: I sugested that
[01:04] <Doow> Lars_G: oops, I missed that
[01:04] <Lars_G> teledyn_: I'm going but: A) defined "messed up", B) Ubuntu is not a burning program, what software and burner are you using?
[01:04] <Jordan_U> teledyn_: It may be burning at a higher speed than the CDRs support.
[01:04] <teledyn_> Lars_G, Jordan_U: i'm using k3b at the moment and consistently get errors
[01:05] <teledyn_> under debian/sid i never had problems with k3b
[01:05] <elknof1> bye everyone
[01:05] <teledyn_> i also tried nero linux and its also frying CDs
[01:05] <haxality> oi..
[01:05] <haxality> so
[01:05] <haxality> I disabled the splash screen
[01:05] <haxality> no go
[01:05] <teledyn_> could it maybe be the automount "feature" in ubuntu causing an issue?
[01:06] <haxality> and no one is responding to my forum post
[01:06] <Jordan_U> haxality: What is the model of your card?
[01:06] <teledyn_> !tell haxality about enter
[01:06] <haxality> heh, sorry teledyn_, bad habits die hard
[01:06] <ActiVe> Lars_G im using amd64 3800x2 would i need a 64 bit kernel for dual core support? I cannot  see a 386-smp kernel.
[01:06] <Lars_G> haxality: Ha I just sent you a memo
[01:06] <Lars_G> haxality: the configuration in this link might give you tips to missing/bad stuff in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf    : http://tuxmobil.org/toshiba_tecra_m1.html
[01:06] <haxality> ah awesome
[01:07] <Lars_G> Ok now I'm gone
[01:07] <haxality> thanks a lot
[01:07] <Jordan_U> haxality: Is this edgy?
[01:07] <haxality> yes, Jordan_U
[01:08] <teledyn_> how do i disable the automount feature in ubuntu?
[01:08] <jvai> the debian channel moves like mollasses
[01:08] <Jordan_U> haxality: You may need to turn off composite support ( I'm looking for the lines to do that now ).
[01:08] <haxality> oh, ok
[01:08] <haxality> take your time, seriously
[01:08] <ActiVe> does anyone know if there is a 32bit kernel that supports dual core amd64 cpus?
[01:08] <idan> need help implenting prism54 drivers for setting up my wireless smc2802 card ... anyone got some docs about it ?
[01:08] <haxality> I appreciate any help to begin with :)
[01:09] <idan> LjL are you here ?
[01:11] <wilkin> i need some kernel help
[01:11] <zspada15> whats the problem wilkin?
[01:11] <wilkin> i've installed linux-headers and linux-source, but nothing shows up in /usr/src....any ideas?
[01:12] <zspada15> wilkin: is there a symlink in /usr/src?
[01:12] <ActiVe> I have read that the generic kernel will support smp. Can i simply install this throught synaptice to get dual core support?
[01:12] <wilkin> nothing in there...when i do ls -l in /usr/src, i get  "Total 0"
[01:12] <Jordan_U> haxality: try adding: Option  "Composite" "Disable"
[01:12] <Jordan_U> to the extensions section of your xorg.conf
[01:12] <`Bleu> anyone have any ideas why im getting Data Dir doesnt exist?  Im installing squirrelmail on ubuntu 6.06 server
[01:13] <idan> !Wireless
[01:13] <Jordan_U> haxality: I am just guessing at this point FYI
[01:13] <Jordan_U> idan: ubotu is dead :(
[01:14] <zspada15> wilkin: did you install it via package management?
[01:14] <wilkin> did apt-get for both
[01:14] <idan> Jordan what happend to him !?
[01:14] <LjL> idan: yes, bit busy, but go on
[01:14] <zspada15> wilkin: is it in your grub menu?
[01:14] <hhhjr> can somebody tell me what I have to add to my apt/sources.list in order to get the nvidia drivers installed?

[01:15] <wilkin> not following you, i'm just shy of being a noob at this
[01:15] <l337f00l> hi all, my problem is I just upgraded to Edgy from Dapper but when I goto login into KDE all I get is a tan background and the cursor and nothing else and I don't know what to do
[01:15] <sgp> `Bleu: I'd look at config files, been a while but maybe it's looking in /usr/mail not /var/mail?
[01:15] <teledyn_> ah i think the cd burning problem was being caused by vmware
[01:15] <Jordan_U> hhhjr: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[01:15] <wilkin> know enough to be a danger
[01:15] <zspada15> wilkin: restart your computer, in your boot loader menu, it should be listed in there, ubuntu does it automagically for you
[01:15] <sgp> bonsoir slb177 :)
[01:15] <hhhjr> ok I look there again thanks
[01:15] <LjL> idan: oh, sorry but haven't the slightest idea about anything wireless, all wired here
[01:15] <idan> LjL , im gonna need some reading stuff about implenting prism54 ( thats the chipset driver for my smc 2802 card )
[01:15] <bariel> hello, i am trying to send mail with postfix, i see in /var/log/mail a row like from=<>, size=... so that my mail is rejected by some host, what is wrong?

[01:16] <idan> LjL , oh .. ok .. know some 1 who has an idea ?
[01:16] <idan> LjL , or maybe some docs for it? a good site ?
[01:16] <LjL> !wifi | idan, no
[01:16] <wilkin> i do uname -r and it gives me the kernel version
[01:16] <wilkin> so i know it's loaded
[01:16] <zspada15> wilkin: apt-geting it, adds it to the menu automatically and defaults it
[01:16] <idan> LjL , thanks any how
[01:17] <teledyn_> shoot, its still messed up.  it successfully wrote the CD but doesn't recognize it now
[01:17] <wilkin> it's just not showing up in /usr/src
[01:17] <SLB177> onsoir  sgp
[01:17] <zspada15> restart your computer and see that the kernel you just upgraded is the one being loaded
[01:17] <zspada15> wilkin: apt-get doesn't install the source, just the .deb
[01:17] <wilkin> trying to install Cisco client and i have nothing to show the kernel version

[01:19] <neobonzi> GAHHHH someone help me with my stupid wireless! gah!
[01:19] <neobonzi> its like beating up a tub of jello, im not getting anywhere
[01:19] <Jordan_U> hhhjr: sudo software-properties -e restricted
[01:19] <wilkin> variant: I do the uname -r and it gives me the kernel version...when I go to install the Cisco client, it's looking for the kernel source which is by default shown in /usr/src...there's nothing in there
[01:19] <elkbuntu> neobonzi, that is not going to achieve you anything. i cannot read your mind to figure what part of it is not working, nor can anyone else. please explain your problem
[01:20] <teledyn_> neobonzi: what card?
[01:20] <variant> !kernel
[01:20] <cfedde> venting is good for the soul
[01:20] <elkbuntu> cfedde, not in noisy channels. it is not
[01:20] <neobonzi> I just installed the linux driver for 3945ABG and had it working but when i restarted i cant figure out how to load it up again
[01:20] <Jordan_U> neobonzi: Do you know what kernel module it was?
[01:20] <teledyn_> neobonzi: load the module?
[01:20] <variant> wilkin: apt-get install linux-source
[01:21] <zspada15> wilkin: make sure your sudo that
[01:21] <wilkin> i've done that and apt-get install linux-header...to no avail...can try again
[01:21] <neobonzi> lsmod shows that ieee is loaded and ipw3945 is using it. ipw3945 module does not load though
[01:21] <variant> wilkin: what is in /usr/src/?
[01:21] <variant> wilkin: you will probably have to symlink it your self
[01:22] <wilkin> variant: should be kernel header
[01:22] <Jordan_U> wilkin: The headers aren't the full source.
[01:22] <variant> wilkin: ln -sf /usr/src/linux-2.6etcetc /usr/src/linux
[01:22] <hhhjr> Jordan_U that returns software-properties: command not found
[01:22] <neobonzi> i type modprobe ipw3945 it just goes to a new line, when i lsmod its not there
[01:22] <LjL> !kernel
[01:22] <Ubotwo> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[01:22] <variant> Jordan_U: yeah, he installed linux-source
[01:22] <zspada15> neobonzi: run sudo ifdown eth0 or whatever your wireless interface is then sudo ifup eth0
[01:23] <neobonzi> says "cant read interfaces file"
[01:23] <rBlong2us> hi
[01:23] <alanhaggai> Hi friend :)
[01:23] <haxality> ok.
[01:23] <haxality> so
[01:23] <haxality> if I edit my xorg.conf file and place it in /etc/X11, will it automatically use it the next time Xorg runs?
[01:23] <rBlong2us> is there a pinball game for Ubunut?
[01:23] <neobonzi> zspada: this is the error ifdown: couldn't read interfaces file "/etc/network/interfaces"
[01:23] <variant> haxality: if it replaces the existing /etc/X11/xorg.conf then yes
[01:23] <haxality> alright.
[01:23] <variant> haxality: back up the existing file!!!!
[01:23] <variant> haxality: back up the existing file!!!!
[01:23] <haxality> of course
[01:23] <haxality> already did
[01:23] <haxality> :)
[01:24] <variant> :)
[01:24] <haxality> heh, I learned my lesson fast on that one
[01:24] <haxality> whoa doggies
[01:24] <haxality> inverted colors
[01:24] <haxality> awesome
[01:24] <haxality> well, so much for that
[01:24] <neobonzi> teledyn_: these are the instructions im following http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/INSTALL
[01:24] <LjL> rBlong2us: there is a "pinball" package
[01:24] <wilkin> variant:  did that...to no avail
[01:24] <kevman_> Are all the repos for egdy working?
[01:24] <idan> Anyone got a single clue on wireless here ?
[01:25] <variant> wilkin: type readlink /usr/src/linux and tell me the output
[01:25] <cactus_sediento> kevman i was asking myself the same question....
[01:25] <rBlong2us> LjL: where at? I think I need to edit my sources
[01:25] <LjL> rBlong2us: universe
[01:25] <cactus_sediento> not receiving an update since the upgrade to edgy two weeks ago...
[01:25] <LjL> !universe
[01:25] <SethP> I managed to screw myself over pretty good... I acidentally unplugged my computer, and now it hangs whenever I get to "GRUB loading." Also, I can't get the liveCD to boot. Any chance someone can help me?
[01:25] <Ubotwo> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[01:25] <teledyn_> neobonzi: what does "lspci" command say the card is?
[01:25] <wilkin> variant:  readlink is hashed (/bin/readlink)
[01:25] <wilkin> bash: type: /usr/src/linux: not found
[01:26] <haxality> SethP, was it booting from the CD before?
[01:26] <kevman_> Becuase the main repo keeps giving me a "gzip: stdin: not in gzip format" error
[01:26] <kitsuneofdoom> I just got edgy. now vnc4server will not work, saying I don't have the fixed font. Purge/reinstall didn't work to solve it
[01:26] <neobonzi> teledyn_: it says its 0b:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection (rev 02)
[01:26] <kevman_> SethP: go into your BIOS and make sure CD-ROM is first in the boot order
[01:26] <SethP> haxality, no, I had a full edgy install that I was running when it crashed
[01:26] <variant> wilkin: then you didnt do the comand i told you
[01:26] <rBlong2us> lj
[01:26] <variant> wilkin: do you have anything in /usr/src/?
[01:26] <variant> wilkin: ls /usr/src/
[01:26] <rBlong2us> LjL: ok I added universe and multiuniverse
[01:27] <wilkin> nothing
[01:27] <haxality> SethP, I'm going to PM you so it doesn't get lost in the sea of text
[01:27] <LjL> rBlong2us: fine, do a "sudo apt-get update" to update the cache, and then you'll have the package available
[01:27] <SethP> kevman_, I get to the menu, but when I go to "start/install ubuntu", it starts loading but hangs when X server initializes (I think, it hangs on a black screen)
[01:27] <variant> wilkin: so you need to apt-get install linux-source
[01:27] <SethP> ok, thanks haxality
[01:27] <teledyn_> neobonzi: do this:  in a terminal run this:  sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
[01:27] <wilkin> variant:  i did the ln -sf /usr/src......
[01:27] <variant> wilkin: you need to install the source code first
[01:28] <teledyn_> neobonzi: then in another terminal: modprobe ipw3945
[01:28] <wilkin> variant:  ok
[01:28] <rBlong2us> LjL: thanks
[01:28] <neobonzi> teledyn_: k did that
[01:28] <wilkin> i just did it
[01:28] <cactus_sediento> have you received any update on the last two weeks?
[01:28] <wilkin> variant: i just did it
[01:28] <teledyn_> neobonzi: run iwconfig and see if it lists your device
[01:28] <variant> wilkin: so now if you type ls /usr/src/ there should be somthing there?
[01:28] <kitsuneofdoom> I just got edgy. now vnc4server will not work, saying I don't have the fixed font. Purge/reinstall didn't work to solve it
[01:29] <teledyn_> neobonzi: or see if it lists in syslog after you modprobe the driver
[01:29] <wilkin> when i did it, it got...0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded
[01:29] <kevman_> SethP: seems like a hardware problem... Try unplugged your computer for about 3 minutes. Your video card might be in a funky mode
[01:29] <neobonzi> teledyn_: says no wireless extensions for lo, eth0, or sit0, but im using gnome network manager - does that make a difference?
[01:29] <variant> wilkin: ok
[01:29] <kitsuneofdoom> usually wireless is eth1
[01:29] <neobonzi> teledyn: where do i access syslog?
[01:29] <wilkin> variant:  i do ls -l and get "total 0"
[01:29] <variant> wilkin: sorry, i can't help you then. i dont know what the problem is. if ls /usr/src/ shows nothing then somthing is wrong
[01:29] <SethP> thanks kevman
[01:29] <SethP> kevman_*
[01:30] <SethP> I'll try that
[01:30] <teledyn_> kitsuneofdoom: please don't interfere.  i'm handling this.  you'll only create more confusion
[01:30] <wilkin> i appreciate your help
[01:30] <wilkin> variant:  i've done this with redhat before and no problems
[01:30] <kitsuneofdoom> teledyn_: sorry
[01:30] <wilkin> Variant: i wanted to try Ubuntu but this is my only hangup
[01:31] <variant> wilkin: you need to install the linux source code and symlink it to /usr/src/ that is all you have to do
[01:31] <gu014> what video format is a normal DVD Widescreen in1080i/1080p/720p ??
[01:31] <wilkin> variant: ok...i will try that...thanks again for your help

[01:31] <Ubotwo> linux is the kernel (core) of the Ubuntu operating system. Many operating systems use Linux as kernel. For more information on Linux in general, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux

[01:31] <neobonzi> !syslog
[01:31] <allz> hello :) i am on ubuntu now
[01:31] <teledyn_> neobonzi: the tail command i just gave you
[01:31] <gyop> I need help to open openGL for NVIDIA =o\
[01:32] <allz> !nvidia
[01:32] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:32] <teledyn_> neobonzi: did you run the binary that they gave you?  ipw3945d
[01:32] <kevman_> STUPID ADEPT. Works with an amazing 0% of packages
[01:32] <neobonzi> teledyn_: i'm not sure if i ran the binary or not?
[01:32] <teledyn_> my god the state of 802.11g wireless under linux is a complete disaster
[01:32] <teledyn_> neobonzi: ps -e |grep ipw3945
[01:33] <nrdb> I need some help with openvpn, I am trying to setup a server at the moment, but I keep getting a 'FAILED' message whenever I try to start openvpn.  I can't find out why can anyone help.
[01:33] <mythtv> would anyone mind pointing me to something that explains what I need in Linux to play DVDs, I installed mplayer, but I still can't play anything
[01:33] <teledyn_> if this was an evil plan by some large corporations to screw linux, its been very effective
[01:33] <neobonzi> teledyn_: alright i got a list of 4 odd numbers
[01:33] <teledyn_> neobonzi: well you should see if there's a running process for it or not.  if so you'll see a PID number for the process
[01:34] <jvai> mythtv, u can use totem-gstreamer.. i'm looking @ italian job right now w/ totem
[01:34] <neobonzi> teledyn_: i get  3175 ?        00:00:00 ipw3945/0
[01:34] <neobonzi>  3176 ?        00:00:00 ipw3945/1
[01:34] <rBlong2us> hi is there a checkers game on ubuntu?
[01:34] <teledyn_> neobonzi: good
[01:34] <FantasticFoo> allright.
[01:34] <jvai> but i had to use easy ubuntu for the libdvdcss2
[01:34] <neobonzi> teledyn_: and 2 more like that
[01:34] <FantasticFoo> i fixed lilo, and now i can at least boot up into edgy
[01:34] <mythtv> when I insert a dvd totem will not let me play it
[01:35] <teledyn_> neobonzi:  hmm
[01:35] <FantasticFoo> but now X doesn't work, and xorg.conf is exactly the same...
[01:35] <jvai> mythtv did u enable universe & multiverse?
[01:35] <variant> teledyn_: really it just depends on what wifi card you have. some are very well supported some are not at all supported and it is entirely the fault of the hardware manufacturer
[01:35] <mythtv> yes
[01:35] <neobonzi> teledyn_: its so odd because when i first ran through the install a little while ago it turned on then when i restarted i had no idea how to get it back
[01:35] <nrdb> mythtv: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[01:35] <teledyn_> neobonzi: according to the INSTALL doc you should see a process for ipw3945d
[01:35] <jvai> did u add easy ubuntu or automatix?
[01:36] <rBlong2us> looking for a checkers game
[01:36] <_whynot_> I keep getting an error message whenever I try to install SDL. can anyone help?
[01:36] <mythtv> totem says, no URI handler for DVD
[01:36] <kitsuneofdoom> I recently upgraded to Edgy. Now, I am having problems running vnc4server. When looking at the logs, it tells me it cannot find the default font fixed.
[01:36] <mythtv> no, neither
[01:36] <neobonzi> teledyn_: does that mean i need to modprobe ipw3945d ?
[01:36] <Tenshi> does anyone know how I can run a command and find out what the command returned (not the stdout, but the actual 0, 1, -1, etc ... that tells the success/failure code of the command itself) ?
=== mythtv is now known as matts03441
[01:36] <jvai> look @ the link nrdb gave.. it'll point u to the right codecs
[01:37] <rBlong2us> hi does sdl work with the vesa driver?
[01:37] <rBlong2us> I don't have a openGL
[01:37] <teledyn_> neobonzi: there is a driver,  ipw3945, and the binary,  ipw3945d  they are not the same thing.  their instructions were to set it up so that somehow when you load the module it starts the daemon
[01:37] <neobonzi> teledyn_: i installed from the driver ipw3945-1.1.2 but i also downloaded drivers from somewhere on their site called ipw3945d-1.7.22
[01:37] <rBlong2us> I wanna know whether sdl based games play with vesa
[01:37] <_whynot_>  I keep getting an error message whenever I try to install SDL. can anyone help?
[01:37] <teledyn_> neobonzi: ps -C ipw3945d      what does that say?
[01:38] <_whynot_> it tries to install a file and it tells me that the destination file is locked
[01:38] <neobonzi> teledyn_:   PID TTY          TIME CMD
[01:38] <teledyn_> neobonzi: so its not running
[01:38] <jvai> mythtv.. read nrdb's link & use this link - http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ for the restricted codecs
[01:38] <neobonzi> teledyn_: alright so my problem is the daemon is not running?
[01:39] <teledyn_> my god, doesn't ubuntu provide a ready-made driver for this?
[01:39] <teledyn_> maybe its too bleeding edge
[01:39] <neobonzi> teledyn_: im on edgy :/ it didnt autodetect it haha
[01:39] <allz> !nvidia
[01:39] <teledyn_> neobonzi: yeah its not running
[01:39] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:39] <neobonzi> teledyn:_: it worked fine in 6.06 but like many things it stopped in 6.10
[01:40] <teledyn_> neobonzi: did you copy it to /sbin like the instructions say?
[01:40] <neobonzi> yes
[01:40] <teledyn_> neobonzi: what happens if you manually run it?
[01:40] <matts03441> ok, sorry, but I'm stuck on this part: "o to System -- Administration -- Synaptic Package Manager -- Settings -- Repositories and then click Add."
[01:40] <matts03441> I don't see where it says "Add"
[01:40] <idan> does anyone have a prism54 driver ?
[01:41] <neobonzi> teledyn_: how would i manually run it? just in the bin folder run 3945d?
[01:41] <teledyn_> neobonzi: keep an eye on the syslog tail while you run it
[01:41] <ChocoCid> matts03441  go to the third party tag first,
[01:41] <teledyn_> neobonzi: sudo /sbin/ipw3945d
[01:41] <matts03441> yup, then what am I supposed to add?
[01:42] <neobonzi> teledyn_: OH MY GOD
[01:42] <neobonzi> teledyn_: It works!!!!!!
[01:42] <Jordan_U_> :)
[01:42] <matts03441> ok, I think I know
[01:42] <jvai> i used an orinoco 11g card on a thinkpad 600x... network-manager didnt work properly with it, i had to configure it thru the network gui @ matts03441
[01:42] <haxality> also hooray linux torrents
[01:42] <neobonzi> teledyn_: Okay okay okay okay, so now how do i make it go automatically so i never have to do this again?
[01:42] <teledyn_> neobonzi: so for whatever reason loading the module doesn't launch that daemon.  you can figure out how to do that or just launch it manually
[01:43] <matts03441> third party support, then add, and then what do I say?
[01:43] <cc77> How do I completly deinstall vmware? I quit during the install of first vmwareplayer using vmware.com tar.gz install and then uses vmwareplayer on multiverse (which gave me error messages). Now I want to install wmware server but complains about previous install and not finding its uninstall file.
[01:43] <neobonzi> teledyn_: can i add it as a startup command?
[01:43] <teledyn_> neobonzi: re-read the instructions and/or maybe google around for answers
[01:43] <neobonzi> teledyn_: thanks a lot buddy
[01:43] <teledyn_> neobonzi: of course you could easily write your own script to do it
=== Jordan_U_ is now known as Jordan_U
[01:43] <neobonzi> teledyn_: how would i do that? :D
[01:44] <rag> teledyn_: hi!
=== AfterDeath_ is now known as afterdeath
=== afterdeath is now known as AfterDeath
[01:44] <Admiral_Chicago> are any of the repos down+
[01:44] <teledyn_> neobonzi: just create a small shell script in /etc/rcX.d (where X is your default runlevel) with a line to run the daemon.  it might be a good idea to put a conditional in there that runs ps to check if its not already running
[01:44] <cc77> can I just delete any folder thats contains vmware?
[01:44] <rag> somebody please, do you know what GUI wifi where work dhclient perfect?
[01:45] <Jordan_U> rag: Network-manager?
[01:45] <rag> wireless assistant dont did dhclient for me on all wifi cards models
[01:45] <rag> Jordan_U: is for wifi? no...
[01:45] <neobonzi> teledyn_: alrighty
[01:45] <rag> Jordan_U: true?
[01:45] <Jordan_U> rag: Yes...
[01:45] <teledyn_> neobonzi: something like if ! ps -C ipw3945d; then /sbin/ipw3945d fi
[01:46] <Jordan_U> rag: It is for wifi
[01:46] <rag> Jordan_U: ok look it
[01:47] <teledyn_> neobonzi: also make sure that the driver is loaded;  if ! lsmod |grep ipw3945; then modprobe ipw3945 fi
[01:47] <FantasticFoo> for some reason after edgy upgrade, X doesn't recognize my "fglrx" driver anymore

[01:58] <matti> jvai: Yes.
[01:58] <jamesbrink> Jordan_U: did you use it as a module or did you build it into the kernel? i used to use it on gentoo with no problems, but it was built in
[01:58] <soundray> dnite: you might want to have a look at garnome
[01:58] <matts03441> I'm using edgy

[02:06] <matts03441> wow, playing DVDs is a pain in linux
[02:07] <Jordan_U> haxality: If you want to use edgy, try booting from the Edgy liveCD and using the xorg.conf from dapper
[02:07] <jrib> qc_: try rxvt, I only have experience with that
[02:07] <soundray> matts03441: DVD is a heavily encumbered format, not easy to support legally on a free OS.
[02:07] <jrib> qc_: well, urxvt at least
[02:07] <qc_> jrib: i have this as well
[02:07] <qc_> jrib, give me a command to try

[02:10] <FearMoth> hi, I have a USB external hard drive enclosure with a WD1600 hard drive inside. When I plug it in, kubuntu doesn't detect it, and it's not listed when I run sudo fdisk -l. Does anyone know why it's not detected? It works fine in windows xp.
[02:10] <astronouth7303> how can I get sound working again?
[02:10] <drayen> FearMoth: can you see it when you run lsusn
[02:10] <jvai> matti, you're using edgy.. i may be wrong, but it's still in "testing".. in dapper.. it's all good, dvd play
[02:10] <drayen> lsusb even
[02:10] <qc_> jrib, is this monospace?
[02:10] <matti> jvai: I downloanded 6.10 today.
[02:10] <soundray> jvai: no, edgy is released.
[02:10] <jvai> whaaat
[02:11] <FearMoth> drayen: no, just my mouse, the other two ID's are 0000:0000 ..
[02:11] <matts03441> OK, i've done all thats stuff, libdvdread3, libcss, gstreamer codecs...
[02:11] <jvai> wow.
[02:11] <jvai> i stand corrected
[02:11] <jrib> qc_: well it should be Bitstream Vera Sans mono, but you can try monospace.  The font itself is monospaced, yes
[02:11] <matts03441> just doesn't work
[02:11] <at0m> whats a good gui based unrar archiver?
[02:11] <pianoboy3333> Has anyone here ever used CensorNet?
[02:11] <Jordan_U> FearMoth: Is it formatted NTFS?
[02:11] <jrib> at0m: file roller
[02:11] <drayen> FearMoth: u sure the drive is working... if lsusb doesnt see it, you've got problems
[02:11] <FearMoth> Jordan_U: yes
[02:11] <drayen> FearMoth: (im no expert)
[02:12] <soundray> Jordan_U: irrelevant if lsusb doesn't list it
[02:12] <FearMoth> drayen: I'm sure it's working.. even if it was formatted ntfs it would show up still though wouldn't it?
[02:12] <qc_> jrib, hrm... how can i find a list of all the fonts i can use?
[02:12] <unfo> astronouth7303: hey! (i'm unforgettableid)
[02:12] <Jordan_U> soundray: I hadn't read that yet when I commented :)
[02:12] <soundray> FearMoth: have you tried plugging it in another port?
[02:12] <unfo> astronouth7303: lspci
[02:12] <drayen> FearMoth: as far as i know it should be in lsusb

[02:13] <byteshack> can someone help me with pptpconfig?
[02:13] <jrib> qc_: xlsfonts shoudl list the fixed ones and fc-list should list all of them (I don't really know the correct terms to use here)
[02:13] <jvai> ok uall.  i gotta bounce
[02:13] <jvai> i'm sorry @ matt
[02:13] <byteshack> I'm trying to VPN to work, which uses a M$ VPN
[02:13] <jrib> qc_: the ones you get with xlsfonts you should be able to use without 'xft'
[02:13] <byteshack> and I get: Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP
[02:13] <soundray> FearMoth: you may also see an error message logged if you run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' while you plug in the drive

[02:14] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:14] <astronouth7303> ok, that was weird; I adjusted my volume (not from mute), and it suddenly worked
[02:15] <unfo> astronouth7303: mixer problem? maybe the startup volume is zero but the volume control thinks it's nonzero?
[02:15] <astronouth7303> unfo: how can I tell?

[02:15] <unfo> you may have to be root.
[02:15] <unfo> that reloads sound settings from disk. see if it mutes the sound.
[02:16] <astronouth7303> "unknown command 'reload'..."
[02:16] <unfo> ok, it's alsactl restore
[02:16] <unfo> forgot.
[02:16] <soundray> Is there a way to boot a CD image from the hard disk?
[02:16] <allz> please can someone go to nvidia what to do
[02:16] <allz> or post me in here:S
[02:16] <FearMoth> soundray: I get usb-storage: device found at 12; usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning; usb-storage: device scan complete; usb 2-2: usb disconnect, address 12; 4:0:0:0:0: scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery ... any idea what that means?

[02:17] <allz> soundray
[02:17] <unfo> allz: please use English standard spelling for best results.
[02:17] <allz> please can you paste me all the stuff
[02:17] <drayen> FearMoth: humm... i dont know - if you know that the ports work (testing with your mouse) and you cant get it in lsusb in any of them, yet your SURE its working in windows...then i duno... sorry.
[02:17] <unfo> astronouth7303: play a sound
[02:17] <unfo> if it mutes things, do a hard reboot (start gedit, type "asdlkf" hold down power button for 5 seconds) and boot again. see if its messed up again.
[02:17] <unfo> if it is, that might be a bug.
[02:17] <ChocoCid> ...ahhaha
[02:17] <unfo> then the question is how to trigger the bug.
[02:18] <ChocoCid>  do a hard reboot (start gedit, type "asdlkf" hold down power button for 5 seconds  <-- this is hilarious
[02:18] <soundray> FearMoth: IMO it is a problem with the drive. Probably the Linux usb subsystem is more finicky or more careful than the Windows one.
[02:18] <astronouth7303> unfo: still works
[02:18] <hhhjr> ok here is a spupid newbie question. How do you terminate a x session?
[02:18] <unfo> astronouth7303: so dunno what triggered it.
[02:18] <unfo> hhhjr: why?
[02:18] <ChocoCid> control-alt-backspace restarts one
[02:18] <unfo> ChocoCid: no
[02:18] <astronouth7303> I'll come back if it reoccurs, then
[02:18] <bruenig> hhhjr, ctrl + alt + backspace is a nice restart shortcut
[02:18] <l337f00l> jrib: I added a new user and nothing changed still same error
[02:18] <unfo> ChocoCid: it kills all your unsaved work then restarts one :)
[02:18] <shingalated> How do I find the IP of someone I am talking to through AIM?
[02:19] <unfo> shingalated: why?
[02:19] <ChocoCid> unfo: well yes
[02:19] <ChocoCid> actually i'd like to know
[02:19] <shingalated> because I want to know if they are the one that is downloading a bunch of stuff from my web server
[02:19] <hhhjr> cause I am trying to use the guide frome nvidias site and it tells me to terminate the x-session before I can continue
[02:19] <unfo> ChocoCid: very important to mention that when you mention the shortcut.
[02:19] <unfo> :)
[02:19] <ChocoCid> i'm going to have to ssh into someone's box at some point
[02:19] <bruenig> shingalated, ha, yeah they try not to make that easy. If you can get a direct connect with them, there is a way to do it, but I don't remember off hand.
[02:19] <soundray> ChocoCid, unfo: no, Ctrl-Alt-Backspace kills the X session. If it restarts afterwards, that is the work of a display manager.
[02:19] <jrib> qc_: no, you can use any font you want afaik with urxvt
[02:19] <unfo> ChocoCid: they should go to www.whatismyip.com then.
[02:19] <ChocoCid> and i'd rather not have to send them to whatismyip
[02:19] <ChocoCid> :(
[02:19] <jrib> l337f00l: check ~/.xsession-errors
[02:19] <qc_> jrib, whats a nice looking one?? lol
[02:19] <unfo> ChocoCid: we are starting to trust you less and less :)
[02:20] <ChocoCid> mainly because they're the paranoid type who don't know enough about computers and will go "OH NO I'M BROADCASTING MY IP""
[02:20] <reflex> does anyone know how i can load the kernel module for an intel gigabit ethernet card?
[02:20] <ChocoCid> :(
[02:20] <drayen> anyone able to offer any help getting spam filtering to work in evolution...?
[02:20] <unfo> reflex: is it not loaded? type: lsmod
[02:20] <shingalated> OH NO IM BRODCASTING MY IP?!?
[02:20] <Jordan_U> ChocoCid: Give them a link to a picture on your server?
[02:20] <jrib> qc_: I just use the regular bitstream vera sans mono.  Terminus is ok as a fixed font
[02:20] <b1ackBart> what's the best way to get Flash working with Opera on Ubuntu edgy?
[02:20] <nzeembo> .
[02:20] <ChocoCid> well, "my server" is really "my school's server" and as such i don't think i have access to the ip logs
[02:20] <reflex> unfo: doesn't look like it
[02:20] <qc_> jrib, i dont see "terminus" in my xlsfonts list
[02:20] <reflex> unfo: this box is pretty broken
[02:21] <Toma-> is there a way to re-generate fstab?
[02:21] <rgginer> can any one of you please paste me ,all the stuff .how to install nvidia driver :( on my pm :S
[02:21] <reflex> unfo: i need to bring up the network to get the data offit
[02:21] <octan> the kernel. does it have support for the iptables "owner" modules henc ->iptables - m owner --cmd-owner name fooblah,, stuff ? do anyone know?
[02:21] <l337f00l> jrib: there is no such file
[02:21] <Apex> What's a good firewall for Ubuntu Edgy?
[02:21] <ChocoCid> blackbart: go to adobe.com and find their flash 9 beta and read the instructions
[02:21] <bruenig> Toma-, sudo gedit /etc/fstab, start chugging away
[02:21] <unfo> Toma-: why?
[02:21] <jrib> qc_: hmm I may have installed it myself
[02:21] <octan> im running a 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic kernel
[02:21] <Toma-> bruenig: :< ive lots of partitions...
[02:21] <soundray> Apex: there is an excellent one in the kernel by default
[02:21] <unfo> reflex: I don't remember the command, maybe sudo modprobe e1000
[02:21] <ChocoCid> i know on firefox it's as simple as dropping libflashplayer.so into the /plugins dir
[02:21] <soundray> !iptables
[02:21] <kitsuneofdoom> I recently upgraded to Edgy. Now, I am having problems running vnc4server. When looking at the logs, it tells me it cannot find the default font fixed.
[02:21] <Toma-> unfo: i re-ordered and resized some partitions now i get nothing but /home and /
[02:21] <Ubotwo> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[02:21] <qc_> jrib, is installing them hard?
[02:21] <b1ackBart> thanks, ChocoCid
[02:22] <bruenig> haha ubotwo
[02:22] <FearMoth> thanks for the info drayen, soundray i'll have to do some googling
[02:22] <unfo> Toma-: it's a good idea to research these things before you start. :) sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[02:22] <jrib> qc_: it's packaged so just search for terminus
[02:22] <Toma-> unfo: yeh i know how to edit fstab, but its going to be a monumental task.
[02:22] <qc_> jrib,  the only thing i found was a .ttf file
[02:22] <soundray> FearMoth: I hope you get it replaced
[02:22] <Jordan_U> bruenig: I think ubotu #1 got kicked off freenode for making too many posts.
[02:22] <qc_> is this what i need?
[02:22] <Apex> I've tried Firestarter, but it's using 55% of my CPU
[02:22] <Toma-> might be easier to code a scipt to re-build it
[02:23] <Apex> Wanted to see if there was something better
[02:23] <reflex> unfo: lsmod shows it's loaded after the modprobe, but it still doesn't appear as an interface.  any more ideas?
[02:23] <drayen> FearMoth: no worries - dont supose you know how to set up spam filtering in evolution - do you?
[02:23] <bruenig> Jordan_U, you would think a channel such as this could get such a thing hammered out and not allow such kicking off to happen as big and popular as it is
[02:23] <Xappe> hmm, Xv stopped working tonight after I tried beryl...i'm using the free radeon driver. any suggestions?
[02:23] <haxality> ok.. new problem
[02:23] <unfo> reflex: does it show up? when you do ifconfig -a
[02:23] <jrib> l337f00l: idk, may want to try in #ubuntu as well.  It sounds like a kde-specific problem so they may be aware of it
[02:23] <FearMoth> drayen: not a clue :) pretty new to linux sorry
[02:23] <reflex> unfo: nope
[02:23] <haxality> installing Xubuntu dapper drake, in the liveCD everything worked fine, but now my wireless card isn't showing up
[02:24] <drayen> FearMoth: :) me too (ish)
[02:24] <unfo> reflex: maybe this? sudo ifup eth0
[02:24] <FearMoth> well i'm going to reboot into windows and double check that this thing still works, thanks for the help guys
[02:24] <reflex> unfo: nah, unknown interface
[02:24] <qc_> jrib, i actually found "xfonts-terminus" in synaptic" - is this what i need
[02:24] <Jordan_U> bruenig: Looking back, it see "<-- ubotu has quit (SendQ exceeded)"
[02:25] <Jordan_U> *I
[02:25] <gimmulf> Whats the spftware called which is used in genom to change between themes?
[02:25] <haxality> apparently NONE of my networking hardware works, actually
[02:25] <unfo> reflex: sudo rmmod e1000 && sudo modprobe e1000 && dmesg | tail
[02:25] <jrib> qc_: sounds like that may be it
[02:25] <unfo> reflex: paste us the last 4 lines.
[02:25] <Jordan_U> haxality: Wow, even ethernet?
[02:25] <haxality> yeah
[02:25] <haxality> it just hangs at 'activating interface eth0'
[02:25] <knix> How can I limit a user hdd space?
[02:25] <haxality> after like a minute it says it's active, but it has no IP or anything
[02:25] <unfo> knix: why?
[02:26] <soundray> knix: activate quotas
[02:26] <bruenig> unfo: why why?
[02:26] <soundray> !quota
[02:26] <qc_> jrib, ok i installed it, and can now select "terminus" under gnome terminal - but how do i load it via aterm or rxvt?
[02:26] <Jordan_U> haxality: Is your DHCP server ( router ) working?
[02:26] <knix> can i use webmin?
[02:26] <haxality> absolutely
[02:26] <unfo> bruenig: i find it's a good habit to ask why people want to do things.
[02:26] <meatball> has anyone set up dovecot here?
[02:26] <unfo> bruenig: often there is a better way to do what they are really trying to do.
[02:26] <Abobo> I was hoping someone could help me with a compiler error when trying to build the 2.6.17-14 kernel.  I am on Ubuntu Edgy and I can build the 2.6.18.1 kernel just fine.
[02:26] <haxality> also, I should mention this, on boot it hung on 'hardware drivers' and then said 'failed'
[02:26] <bruenig> unfo, I find it is intrusive and annoying. They want to do something. Allow them to do so without justifying it
[02:26] <rezn> tryn to go from a clean dapper install to edgy.  is "gksu update-manager -c" correct?
[02:26] <unfo> bruenig: i hear your point.
[02:27] <Abobo> After I run:make-kpkg clean
[02:27] <Abobo> fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-custom kernel_image kernel_headers
[02:27] <reflex> unfo: i can't paste it because i can't access the machine, but basically it loads the e1000 driver
[02:27] <haxality> haha its like I get to have either video or networking
[02:27] <haxality> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
[02:27] <Abobo> ...

[02:27] <jrib> qc_: same way as before, with -fn
[02:27] <unfo> Abobo: why are you recompiling your kernel again?
[02:27] <idan> !compile
[02:27] <Ubotwo> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[02:27] <soundray> !info quota
[02:28] <unfo> reflex: ok. try: sudo rmmod e1000 && sudo strace -f modprobe e1000
[02:28] <Abobo> I use MythTV and I need to compile in some patches to tuner_types.c, so I wanted to make sure I could compile clean before patching the file.
[02:28] <knix> soundray, I just dont want them to use all my hdd space with pix,  so what do I need to do?
[02:28] <Jordan_U> haxality: Can you pastebin the outpus of: sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0
[02:28] <Toma-> i doubt therell be any info on quotas
[02:28] <jrib> qc_: oh, xfontsel is a command you might be interested in as well
[02:28] <unfo> Abobo: architecture? kernel? compiler?
[02:28] <startswithz> hello
[02:28] <alanhaggai> Hi friend :)
[02:28] <haxality> well, no, since I have no network access
[02:28] <haxality> I will type it out onto this computer
[02:29] <Jordan_U> haxality: Also try installing restricted-modules
[02:29] <haxality> ok
[02:29] <qc_> jrib, ahhh, does this set the font for the terminal i ran that cmd on?
[02:29] <reflex> unfo: loads of output...  the module is loaded
[02:29] <soundray> knix: either install and configure the quota package, or have separate partitions for your $HOME and the other users' home directories.
[02:29] <Abobo> I can show you all the steps, I am using.  AM64, 2.6.17-14, whatever gcc comes with Ubuntu 6.10
[02:29] <jrib> qc_: hmm I don't think so.  It just lets you browse them
[02:29] <unfo> reflex: any errors?
[02:29] <knix> ok, ty
[02:29] <Abobo> I am using this howto: http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
[02:30] <Jordan_U> haxality: But you are going to need to sneakernet the .debs to get the restricted modules .debs
[02:30] <reflex> unfo: nope
[02:30] <rezn> can anybody tell me how to upgrade from dapper to edgy? without a format?
[02:30] <haxality> Jordan_U, the ifup/ifdown command is spitting out a lot of DHCPDISCOVER messages
[02:30] <haxality> it almost seems like there is no DHCP like you said

[02:32] <unfo> what errors do you get now? any message with an Esomething return value is an error.
[02:32] <unfo> Abobo: Linux myth?
[02:32] <haxality> ok.. Jordan_U, apparently ifup/ifdown cannot contact the DHCP server
[02:32] <unfo> is this mythknoppix?
[02:32] <haxality> and due to lack of internet, I can't use synaptic to install restricted-modules
[02:32] <Abobo> Mythtv, i named the machine "myth"
[02:32] <haxality> or can I..
[02:33] <haxality> huh.
[02:33] <haxality> I can't do anything because of lack of internet

[02:37] <unfo> reflex: oh.
[02:37] <unfo> reflex: also: did you try rebooting the machine and/or booting into SimplyMEPIS or Knoppix and/or just burning the data to DVD?
[02:37] <unfo> reflex: or you could plug in a USB HDD and copy the data there.
[02:37] <cornell> I'm having trouble with mysql with ubuntu server, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31801/, can anyone help?

[02:39] <Abobo> No one else has seen this compiling their kernels?
[02:39] <Abobo> arch/x86_64/kernel/built-in.o: In function `get_smp_config':
[02:39] <reflex> unfo: that's what i mean
[02:39] <reflex> unfo: it doesn't know about lvm
[02:39] <Abobo> I googled around but each post I found had no responses to it.
[02:39] <unfo> reflex: oh. :( maybe you need an LVM livecd.
[02:39] <soundray> cornell: you are meant to replace "local-machine-name" with the actual name of your machine.
[02:39] <reflex> unfo: is there such a thing?
[02:40] <unfo> reflex: no. what i mean is, i wonder what liveCDs support lvm.
[02:40] <soundray> cornell: also, you're better off following ubuntu-specific instructions instead of the debian ones
[02:40] <lullabud> unfo:  i think all the edgy cd's do LVM.
[02:40] <unfo> reflex: also, with the ubuntu livecd, can't you do this? /etc/init.d/lvm start
[02:41] <unfo> s/can't/can
[02:42] <soundray> cornell: it's somewhat buried in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
[02:42] <unfo> Abobo: try a different gcc version (3.4 or 4.0) or try different compiler options or try a 2.6.18 or 2.6.15 or 2.6.9 or 2.4 kernel maybe.
[02:42] <highneko> Has anyone tried mint linux?

[02:43] <highneko> unfo: sudo apt-get install gnome-dictionary
[02:44] <Abobo> I am a newb to Linux.  Since I can compile the 2.6.18.1 kernel, will it be a pain to try and run it instead of my existing 2.6.17-10?

[02:44] <jrib> moonwatcher: what does that program do?  Just display a bunch of widgets?
[02:44] <unfo> Abobo: it should be fine.

[02:45] <Abobo> Sorry, maybe I am not using the nVidia binary driver, I am using the ones that come with Edgy's packages.
[02:45] <Abobo> I have asked over there, but this is a compiling the kernel issue, so they sent me here.

[02:49] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: please see the Smart Questions webpage :)
[02:49] <ChocoCid> !beryl
[02:49] <Ubotwo> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[02:49] <unfo> webhed: see #ubuntu-xgl then :)
[02:49] <webhed> Beryl is a Compiz deal - cool desktop effects
[02:49] <skreet> anyone here using flash?
[02:49] <K-Rich> anyone willing to help a guy with samba issues (i can connect to the breezy maching from the dapper maching but not from breezy to dapper, it asks for a password, it never did from dapper to breezy)
[02:50] <phatAlbert> I was just wandering... what is the command to see what charset I'm using ?
[02:50] <unfo> skreet: probably at least sixty people
[02:50] <K-Rich> maching = machine
[02:50] <luminousnerd> Hi all.  I tried to enable beryl and now can't log into gnome (it just flashes a beryl logo, goes black for a minute, then goes back to login screen)
[02:50] <lllloo> u need to reinstall the video drivers
[02:50] <skreet> unfo: any advice on finding an older plugin that isn't broken?
[02:50] <phatAlbert> or the "locale" if you like
[02:50] <unfo> luminousnerd: Control+Alt+F1 then log in then sudo apt-get remove beryl then reboot.
[02:50] <unfo> skreet: i don't use flash.
[02:50] <Web-kanotix880> How do I get 610 reinstalled and not lose my data from 606
[02:50] <highneko> luminousnerd: beryl shouldn't be starting when you login.
[02:50] <lllloo> that buddy is a driver issue
[02:51] <skreet> unfo: Thanks.
[02:51] <jrib> skreet: how is the current one broken?
[02:51] <lllloo> u have to enable ur driver first correcT?
[02:51] <skreet> jrib: I heard it was a known issue if you install flash via firefox
[02:51] <noxxle> where is the wpa_supplicant.con file located
[02:51] <skreet> visit website with flash, firefox closes itself
[02:51] <noxxle> i want to see my current settings, after installing network manager with automatix i cant find it
[02:51] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: try this dangerous set of commands: sudo mkdir /z && sudo mv /home /z && sudo rm -rf /[a-y] * && sudo reboot
[02:51] <luminousnerd> highneko: why not? Doesn't it integrate itself with Gnome?
[02:51] <startswithz> whenever I boot ubuntu it takes a while at the ubuntu logo screen.  how can I speed this up?
[02:51] <jrib> skreet: what bit-depth are you using?
[02:51] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: your computer will reboot and not work anymore.
=== mikm[laptop]  is now known as mikm[wtflag] 
=== mikm[wtflag]  is now known as mikm[laptop] 
[02:51] <luminousnerd> unfo: I did that, can I just ctrl-alt-backspace rather than reboot?
[02:51] <highneko> luminousnerd: It's not a good way of testing beryl. it's ok when you have a working beryl.
[02:51] <anan> is there a command to remove all files except 1 particular file ?
[02:52] <unfo> luminousnerd: i'd reboot.
[02:52] <unfo> luminousnerd: or live on the edge:
[02:52] <jrib> anan: do you happen to use zsh?
[02:52] <unfo> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[02:52] <skreet> jrib: 16
[02:52] <Web-kanotix880> Then why would I ever do thart
[02:52] <luminousnerd> unfo: run that?
[02:52] <unfo> luminousnerd: yes
[02:52] <luminousnerd> ok coo thanks
[02:53] <jrib> skreet: skreet please see https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911
[02:53] <teledyn_> anyone know why my burned CD's are messed up?  i've used k3b and nero and have the same problem.  disks are not recognized after burning.
[02:53] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: then install Ubuntu but set it to use your existing Linux partition. also set it not to reformat the drive or delete any existing files.
[02:53] <skreet> jrib: looking, thanks
[02:53] <gray> Ok Here is my current problem. I am locked int to a really boring job. I feel like I am losing my programming skills due to lack of use
[02:53] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: then all your home directories will be in /z, and everything else will be gone.
[02:53] <unfo> gray: see www.fsf.org
[02:53] <Web-kanotix880> Oh ty
[02:53] <unfo> gray: they have a list of cool projects for you to help on. :)
[02:53] <phatAlbert> is there someone who knows how to change de "locale" of a system ?
[02:53] <unfo> phatAlbert: yes
[02:53] <phatAlbert> how ?
[02:54] <unfo> phatAlbert: are you sure that's what you want? what language do you speak?
[02:54] <Web-kanotix880> unfo Should I go back to the 606 version
[02:54] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: yes.
[02:54] <noxxle> where is the wpa_supplicant.con file located
[02:54] <noxxle> i want to see my current settings, after installing network manager with automatix i cant find it
[02:54] <unfo> noxxle: see #automatix
[02:54] <luminousnerd> Didn't work,  beryl still start on luminousnerd account
[02:54] <phatAlbert> the best should be french canadian
[02:55] <gray> So I create little projects for myself todays problem is : when ever a usb device is connected I want a "hello World" window to pop open
[02:55] <Lahey> clustering expertise needed
[02:55] <gray> how do I capture the USB event
[02:56] <Pelo> phatAlbert,  what about french canadian ?
[02:56] <gray> oh by the way I'll make sure to check out the Ubuntu home page for some projects
[02:56] <lullabud> Lahey:  what's this about clustering?
[02:56] <phatAlbert> I want to know because some character like in firefox bookmark or with beep media player is not right
[02:56] <phatAlbert> it's like a question mark in a box
[02:56] <luminousnerd> Also I don't really want beryl to be uninstalled, I'd rather it just work
[02:56] <Lahey> lullabud: can you give me a hand with some q's about Open Mosix and VM's
[02:56] <unfo> phatAlbert: don't you want to switch your entire computer to french?
[02:57] <phatAlbert> so I would like if it's possible to change the locale
[02:57] <lullabud> ah, that i don't know about...
[02:57] <phatAlbert> no
[02:57] <keegan_> !restricted
[02:57] <Ubotwo> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[02:57] <Pelo> phatAlbert,  should those letters be accented like    and such ?
[02:57] <unfo> phatAlbert: maybe you just need to change your keymap?
[02:57] <phatAlbert> I just want the system to render the accented character
[02:57] <phatAlbert> Pelo, yes
[02:57] <DeViL_BoY> in #pr-linux
[02:57] <lullabud> Lahey:  sorry, i'm not familiar with that.  you might find it interesting though that ubuntu supports the whole GFS platform that redhat touts on its enterprise level stuff.
[02:57] <highneko> luminousnerd: Try asking in #ubuntu-xgl it's better because less people asking questions so more likely more people will see your question and know the answer.
[02:57] <noxxle> does ubuntu make anyone elses nvidia card screech?
[02:58] <phatAlbert> unfo, I don't know want I have to change but I want to change it anyway :P
[02:58] <Pelo> phatAlbert,  have you loaded the french language pack for ff ?
[02:58] <phatAlbert> I'm able tought to write like "?"
[02:58] <teledyn_> phatAlbert: apt-get install locales localeconf; dpkg-reconfigure localeconf
[02:58] <teledyn_> or i think just run localeconf
[02:58] <teledyn_> UTF-8 is the best
[02:58] <teledyn_> if my microwave is strong enough to disriupt the 802.11 does that mean its leaking a lot of radiation?
[02:59] <unfo> Pelo: he doesn't want to get french UI.
[02:59] <Lahey> lullabud: how do i get to that in Ubuntu, and is it like Open Mosix by any chance
[02:59] <teledyn_> phatAlbert: you need a locale and the application must support the locale for the character(s) in question
[02:59] <teledyn_> phatAlbert: and also an input method
[02:59] <Pelo> unfo,  if missed the first part
[02:59] <lullabud> teledyn_:  no, your microwave interrupting your wireless doesn't mean it's leaking too much radiation.
[02:59] <teledyn_> if you want to input it
[02:59] <phatAlbert> is firefox supposted tio support it ?
[02:59] <lullabud> Lahey:  no, GFS is a filesystem for clustering.
[02:59] <teledyn_> lullabud: really?  why would it disrupt it then?
[02:59] <lullabud> Lahey:  openmosix is computational clustering.
[03:00] <lullabud> teledyn_:  because that's what happens with microwaves.  they leak radiation, but it doesn't mean that it's unsafe.
[03:00] <teledyn_> phatAlbert: using a UTF-8 locale you will be able to get all characters from all languages
[03:00] <devaudio> is there a good application that swithes your x.org conf around? i.e. i have a laptop with xinerama at work, but just a single display at home, and manually copying the files and killing X is a pain
[03:00] <Lahey> lullabud: what do you mean by that, what is the type that Ubuntu has?
[03:00] <phatAlbert> hum...
[03:00] <lullabud> Lahey:  do some research on openmosix and then alternately do some research on GFS.
[03:01] <teledyn_> phatAlbert: but the font you're using must support it, so it goes on an app-by-app basis
[03:01] <phatAlbert> in beep media player "winamp clone" it give me an error about utf-8
[03:01] <Rob125> oh, wow, people here who know language stuff!
[03:01] <jamesbrink> what command do i run after i edit the apt source.list to update the lists?
[03:01] <Pelo> phatAlbert,  you don'T have to use ff in french but downloading the language pack may reslove the character issue
[03:01] <Rob125> question for polytonic greek
[03:01] <phasegen> I've found an unusual problem.  If I try to copy and paste from open office writer to thunderbird, open office crashes...
[03:01] <Daehlie> apt-get update
[03:01] <jamesbrink> thanks
[03:01] <jamesbrink> lol
[03:01] <teledyn_> phatAlbert: not all apps are up-to-date yet with UTF-8 support, although they should be because its the future
[03:01] <highneko> a='*'; for ((i=0;i<20;i++)); do echo "$a" | sed  -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,77\}$/ & /;ta'; a="$a**"; done; for ((i=0;i<2;i++)); do echo '*****' | sed  -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,77\}$/ & /;ta'; done
[03:01] <Rob125> there's dead keys assigned to semicolons and whatnot but they don't seem to display, despite utf-8 and correct font
[03:01] <VikJES> anyone here using Edgy on an "Intel Core 2 Duo" desktop?
[03:02] <phatAlbert> ok
[03:02] <Lahey> lullabud: ok, just so i know, what does GFS stand for
[03:02] <lullabud> Lahey:  global file system
[03:02] <teledyn_> Rob125: for xkb options select either rwin or ralt as compose     ralt:compose
[03:02] <Lahey> lullabud: k i shall do my best
[03:02] <phatAlbert> ok thank's
[03:02] <teledyn_> Rob125: using compose key is vastly better than deadkey BS
[03:02] <phatAlbert> just did a test
[03:03] <phatAlbert> when I change the bookmark manually with the acceted character all is ok
[03:03] <Rob125> teledyn_: can you elaborate? i'm really a newb at multiple languages/keyboard layouts
[03:03] <K-Rich> can anyone with samba knowledge /msg me, i need some help and it's fairly difficult to explain
[03:03] <jman_> anyone know anything about shell scripting?
[03:03] <phatAlbert> the problem is probably because I imported it from a ntfs partition
[03:03] <unfo> jman_: yes
[03:04] <dw868> Hi
[03:04] <teledyn_> Rob125: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    when it asks for xkb option  input   compose:ralt
[03:04] <unfo> K-Rich: you need channel #samba.
[03:04] <phasegen> Has anyone else experienced this???  "If I try to copy and paste from open office writer to thunderbird, open office crashes"
[03:04] <dw868> have any of you ever run steam on Ubuntu?
[03:04] <Pelo> jman_,  this might be usefull to you http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[03:04] <unfo> dw868: see channel #winehqq
[03:04] <Rob125> thanks, tele.
[03:04] <unfo> oops i mean #winehq
[03:04] <dw868> Thanks
[03:04] <unfo> K-Rich: when you PM for help, you deny everyone else the ability to learn from the help.
[03:05] <unfo> dw868: note: they won't help you unless you read the topic. :)
[03:05] <K-Rich> unfo: i'm in #samba and not understanding...
[03:05] <teledyn_> Rob125: then restart X.   now you will be able to input stuff with ralt + other keys.  e.g.  ralt + ' + e  = 
[03:05] <jman_> unfo: whenever I try to run frostwire I get this syntax error:  44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")...the output for line 44 is this:   potential_java_dirs=(`ls -d1 "$JAVADIR"/j* | sort | tac`)
[03:05] <Rob125> oh, bless your soul
[03:05] <unfo> jman_: i never volunteered to help you :) ask the channel.
[03:05] <K-Rich> unfo: i know that and i'\m sorry for the request... i just think it is an issue that may take some time and i'm having one hell of a time trying to follow the channel
[03:05] <unfo> K-Rich: maybe #ubuntu+1 will help you then.
[03:05] <teledyn_> ralt + " + a =        ralt + = + e = 
[03:06] <unfo> K-Rich: else www.ubuntuforums.org :)
[03:06] <Web-kanotix880> Unfo I closed the chat window and lost what you told me to do to save my dir
[03:06] <phatAlbert> thx you guys
[03:06] <K-Rich> i've tried the forums with no issue... i didnot know there was an ubuntu+1 channel... thank you
[03:06] <luminousnerd> What's the beryl channel again?
[03:06] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: do you have logs?
[03:06] <bruenig> luminousnerd, #ubuntu-xgl
[03:06] <luminousnerd> the ubuntu-XXX chanel I can't remember the three letters
[03:06] <e-maff> ubuntu is real nice i have to say
[03:06] <luminousnerd> Thanks a lot
[03:06] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell luminousnerd about beryl
[03:07] <Web-kanotix880> Unfo if I do I don't know how to get to them
[03:07] <gray> I am off to see a man about a horse
[03:07] <K-Rich> unfo: it says ubuntu+1 is for Fiesty
[03:07] <LjL> indeed it is
[03:07] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: ok. do this: sudo mkdir /z && sudo mv /home /z && sudo rm -rf /[a-y] *
[03:07] <cobelloy> hi - I need to move my home folder to another partition, or maybe home and /usr - how do I do it without breaking the system?
[03:07] <devaudio> is there a page that tells you how to update to edgy from dapper using apt-get ?
[03:07] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: if it went ok, then reboot into the 6.06 livecd and run the installer. have it NOT repartition and NOT reformat. :)
[03:07] <bruenig> cobelloy, you want to move it or just copy it?
[03:08] <LjL> !upgrade | devaudio
[03:08] <sally2> how does one re install the sound drivers?  I've lost sound to my computer?
[03:08] <Ubotwo> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:08] <unfo> devaudio: is there a certain feature you need in edgy?
[03:08] <sally2> thanx LjL!
[03:08] <e-maff> i have ubuntu on my laptop and almost everything just works, and the stuff that doesnt is caue of lack of drivers
[03:08] <e-maff> cant say the same for my slackware desktop
[03:08] <devaudio> ehh i just always like going to latest versions
[03:08] <cobelloy> bruenig: I am running low on space on the part it is installed on
[03:08] <cobelloy> so I need to move the biggest folders to a different part
[03:08] <LjL> sally2: uh? actually, i was talking to the guy called devaudio =)
[03:08] <Pelo> sally2,  try resintalling alsa-mixer from synaptic
[03:08] <Lahey> lullabud: i have looked on google but i cant seem to find any links that are relevant
[03:08] <LjL> !sound | sally2
[03:08] <Ubotwo> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[03:08] <sally2> awww!
[03:08] <devaudio> !upgrade
[03:08] <Ubotwo> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:09] <sally2> thanks pelo and ljl!
[03:09] <dxdemetriou> I have problem with the cdemu. when I mount an image, it isn't the same encoding like as burnt on cd/dvd
[03:09] <bruenig> cobelloy, did you think maybe you could use the other partition to host all of your personal files to free up space in /home
=== Crankymonky is now known as Y|PE
[03:09] <Web-kanotix880> Unfo OK tyt very much
[03:09] <unfo> dxdemetriou: what is cdemu?
=== Y|PE is now known as Crankymonky
[03:09] <unfo> Web-kanotix880: no problem :)
[03:09] <cobelloy> bruenig: i already have most of my personal files on a seperate part
[03:09] <cobelloy> theres nothing of any great size in my home folder
[03:10] <Web-kanotix880> Do I sudo fo the live cd?
[03:10] <dxdemetriou> unfo, a command line program that mounts the bin/cue images
[03:10] <cobelloy> what I could really do with is to move the entire install to the bigger partition
[03:10] <snwyvern> Hi all.
[03:10] <Pelo> snwyvern,  hello
[03:10] <bruenig> cobelloy, well, it can be done. I wouldn't be confident enough to guide you because of the chance of failure (I don't want that over my head).
[03:10] <Rob125> bbiab, restarting x
[03:11] <unfo> dxdemetriou: i just do sudo mount file.iso /dev/loop/0 -oloop
[03:11] <unfo> dxdemetriou: it works for me.
[03:11] <bruenig> !worksforme
[03:11] <Ubotwo> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[03:11] <newpZ> hi for some reason when i do an "apt-get dist-upgrade" it still holds back a bunch of packages and my sources.list is exactly whats on ubuntuguide.org
[03:11] <snwyvern> I'm having a massive issue trying to install a PCMCIA card.
[03:11] <unfo> bruenig: please read what i wrote again :)
[03:11] <Web-kanotix880> Unfo Do I sudo from konsole to mkdir?
[03:11] <bruenig> unfo, I just see trigger words
[03:11] <unfo> newpZ: is that bad?
[03:11] <unfo> bruenig: please do not assume from trigger words.
[03:12] <newpZ> nope, not anymore. just figured it out:)
[03:12] <ademan__> eclipse is giving me: "error notifying a preference change listener. Check log for details" what should i do?
[03:12] <unfo> ademan__: see #eclipse :)
[03:12] <unfo> ademan__: and, of course, check the log.
[03:12] <devaudio> but back to my original question.. is there an app that can detect if i am using my laptop screen/ xinerama display @ work and adjust the xorg.conf file accordingly? rather than copying two xorg files depending on if i am at home or at work
[03:12] <ademan__> unfo: can't for the life of me find the log
[03:12] <ademan__> its not in ~/.eclipse and there's nothing in my home dir
[03:12] <newpZ> nope.. still holding stuff back!
[03:12] <ademan__> and yes, i'm in #eclipse :-)
[03:12] <unfo> ademan__: dunno. google or #eclipse could tell you.
[03:13] <unfo> try the eclipse faq.
[03:13] <bruenig> newpZ, what are you trying to do, if you are just trying to upgrade your software do, sudo apt-get upgrade not sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:13] <unfo> ademan__: also try googling the exact error message.
[03:13] <snwyvern> Any takers?
[03:13] <unfo> devaudio: try channel #xorg or google.
[03:13] <newpZ> i did but its holding back....   hpijs python-egenix-mxproxy python-egenix-mxstack python-egenix-mxtexttools python-egenix-mxtools python-htmltmpl python-ldap python-pgsql python-pylibacl x-window-system-core
[03:13] <sally2> ubotwo thanks!
[03:13] <Ubotwo> sally2: Error: "thanks!" is not a valid command.
[03:13] <unfo> newpZ: do you use any of those? ever???
[03:13] <unfo> :)
[03:13] <bruenig> !bot | sally2
[03:13] <Ubotwo> This is just a temporary bot. Ubotu is currently unavailable. "!info" is not available.
[03:13] <sally2> lol!
[03:13] <newpZ> python i cod ein
[03:14] <sally2> i was wondering with the 'bot' in the name, but...
[03:14] <newpZ> and x-windows-system-core sounds like something i should upgrade :)
[03:14] <bruenig> newpZ, if you want those, just do sudo apt-get install hpijs python-egenix-mxproxy python-egenix-mxstack python-egenix-mxtexttools python-egenix-mxtools python-htmltmpl python-ldap python-pgsql python-pylibacl x-window-system-core.............however it might be holding them for a reason so....
[03:14] <snwyvern> lspcmcia is giving me a no driver error.
[03:14] <unfo> newpZ: those upgrades are not so important. if they are held back, leave it alone.
[03:14] <cobelloy> bruenig: is there any way to resize the root partition while ubuntu is running?
[03:14] <unfo> cobelloy: bad idea.
[03:14] <bruenig> cobelloy, no
[03:14] <bruenig> cobelloy, go into the live cd
[03:15] <cobelloy> I just used a different live cd to try
[03:15] <newpZ> ahhh yeah,, i remebr that from a while back with debian
[03:15] <newpZ> thanks
[03:15] <cobelloy> but I think it wont let me resize because the parts are all inside an extended partition
[03:15] <neman> hello, i use dapper 6.06
[03:15] <newpZ> first time i see stuff held back on ubuntu for no good rason
[03:15] <bruenig> cobelloy, yeah you can't resize beyond an extended partition
[03:15] <newpZ> and yup.. they are all installed now.. thanks
[03:15] <neman> i want install nvidia driver for apt
[03:16] <neman> he install, but in the moment to edit xorg.conf
[03:16] <newpZ> except for   x-window-system-core: Depends: xorg but it is not going to be installed
[03:16] <bruenig> cobelloy, you are not in a good situation. It will be near impossible to resize your root partition without losing all your data, at least from what I am thinking your situation is
[03:16] <cobelloy> bruenig: I have an extended with three parts in it, I want to delete one and extend another in to the empty space
[03:16] <newpZ> which is weird
[03:17] <snwyvern> Orinoco PCMCIA? Anyone?
[03:17] <cobelloy> bruenig: even from the live cd?
[03:17] <bruenig> cobelloy, oh, well delete the other partitions in the extended partition, and extend the root partition, should be fairly simple
[03:17] <cobelloy> from the live cd?
[03:17] <bruenig> cobelloy, yeah
[03:17] <Rob125> well... that did nothing.
[03:17] <Pelo> snwyvern, if no one can help try looking up your card model number in the forum
[03:17] <cliffd> can I install 6.10 server onto a dmraid boot disk? does the cd support dmraid out of the box?
[03:17] <bruenig> cobelloy, the only reason I balked was because I thought you were trying to make the root partition  bigger than the extended partition, which obviously is troublesome
[03:17] <cobelloy> bruenig: ok - will give that a try then - thanks
[03:18] <snwyvern> Pelo: Been there, it seems that my problem is unique.
[03:18] <Pelo> snwyvern,  you must feel so special
[03:18] <snwyvern> Yeah, special ed.
[03:18] <cobelloy> bruenig: yes - it is hard to give a complete explanation in one sentence ;)

[03:18] <Pelo> snwyvern,  the makser's site then
[03:19] <ravi> i'm new to irc
[03:19] <ravi> what makes it better than yahoo?
[03:19] <snwyvern> It is giving power to the card, it shows up in lspcmcia but it's not... making that critical leap to load the drivers.
[03:19] <LjL> !offtopic | ravi

[03:20] <ravi> ahhh

[03:22] <AlanHaggai> How to get syntax coloring in VIM?
[03:22] <snwyvern> neman: I'm pretty sure you can just apt-get the nvidia system.
[03:22] <Pelo> neman  try to state your problem in one paragraph , it makes it easier to follow
[03:22] <bruenig> AlanHaggai, the command line vim doesn't have colors, I don't think
[03:22] <neman> yeah!
[03:22] <LjL> !nvidia
[03:22] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[03:23] <neman> by nvidia
[03:23] <LjL> uhm, no, just follow that link above
[03:23] <snwyvern> Is there a method to point modprobe at a driverless device?
[03:23] <bruenig> AlanHaggai, ok, well I have never had color in any distros I have used I am looking through the flags now and I don't see anything for colors
[03:23] <Pelo> LjL,  he means the instructions

[03:26] <cliffd> anyone know anything about installing 6.10 server on a box with dmraid nforce disks?
[03:26] <neman> the repository native from ubuntu
[03:26] <snwyvern> It only says it has one proc, but...
[03:26] <Pelo> neman,  I can'T help you I don't know anything about nvidia, but for now it sounds like you just need to start X so I would concetrate on that ,  look it up in the forum
[03:27] <neman> thanks!
[03:27] <neman> 4Pelo
[03:27] <bruenig> startx starts X
[03:27] <snwyvern> Pelo: Do you happen to know how the system recognizes hotplug devices, then loads the appropriate driver?

[03:32] <dennister> it's what i use; just type in the gateway address into a web browser
[03:32] <blackgraz> ok
[03:32] <world_citizen> how do use www-apt-get.net?
[03:32] <blackgraz> now maybe you can help me with something else
[03:32] <world_citizen> do you go on the internet with this address
[03:32] <blackgraz> i got 2 wifi cards on pcmica and one minipci
[03:32] <dennister> heheh...if it's simple enuf
[03:33] <dennister> ok, out of my league...i've only used wifi on other windoze boxes
[03:33] <blackgraz> now the pcmcia is keeping my minipic one from getting connect to my AP
[03:33] <neman> where say search a package
[03:33] <Pelo> world_citizen,  forget that www-apt-get-net thing
[03:33] <blackgraz> i dunno if its a route issue or what

[03:33] <neman> you do click there
[03:33] <neman> and write the package
[03:34] <dennister> mysql help anyone?
[03:34] <Pelo> DekKeD,  I've been looking for that for month and I haven't figured it out yet ,  if you find out let me know
[03:34] <newpZ> is there any reason that using the same win32codecs videos are blotchy and get all squares in them when you  forward or skip in totem/gxine  and do not do that in mplayer? is there a way to fix this?
[03:34] <DekKeD> Pelo: ok, I can do almost all keystrokes with AltGr but I am still accustomed to using Alt :P
[03:34] <Pelo> dennister, maybe you should look for a myslq channel
[03:35] <neman> something know about wmv in linux?
[03:35] <dennister> that's an idea...re-new to irc
[03:35] <sally2> I reinstalled alsamixer, but still get...
[03:35] <sally2> Failed to start Volume Control: Failed to execute child process "gnome-volume-control" (No such file or directory)
[03:35] <Pelo> neman,  that's a propriatary format , you need to use either automatix or the restricted packages to get it working
[03:36] <neman> thank
[03:36] <Pelo> !restricted | neman

[03:36] <neman> and, i want see this movie
[03:37] <Pelo> neman,  if it is a drm  wmv you'll still need to get the autorisation
[03:37] <Pelo> or whatever
[03:37] <neman> :S
[03:37] <neman> xD
[03:37] <snwyvern> I think I found my problem-- A typo in the source. How gay
[03:38] <LjL> !language | snwyvern
[03:38] <Ubotwo> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:38] <snwyvern> LjL: What's wrong with frivolity?
[03:38] <Pelo> maybe someone should edit the bot for family oriented,  ,  friendly is a bit overstating it
[03:38] <LjL> snwyvern: there's something wrong with using the word gay as a pejorative
[03:39] <Lahey> anybody use CoMosix
[03:39] <LjL> Pelo: or perhaps it's underrespected
[03:40] <itrebal> whats the current Testing branche?
[03:40] <newpZ> its wierd.. totem and gxine will not play wmv or flv files but yet mplayer will
[03:40] <newpZ> is this a path issue?
[03:40] <LjL> !feisty | itrebal
[03:40] <Ubotwo> The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is pre-alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty
[03:40] <newpZ> im gonna dist-upgrade to that
[03:40] <snwyvern> is there an apt-get flag to automatically install recomended files?
[03:40] <neman> and, what happened with gnome 3?
[03:40] <Pelo> newpZ,  I can play wmv in totem,  might just be a codes issue
[03:40] <itrebal> would it be unwise to use it in its current state?
[03:41] <Pelo> snwyvern,  if you use automatic  dependencies should get installed as well
[03:41] <newpZ> Pelo, you know how or where you setup the path to the codes?
[03:41] <Nukez> hi
[03:41] <Pelo> newpZ,  no, I just used automatix and it worked
[03:42] <LjL> snwyvern: there's a config file option, don't remember it though. or you can use aptitude that does that by default
[03:42] <MarianoGuerra> #join grulic
[03:42] <Nukez> I need some help with my wifi card
[03:42] <Pelo> MarianoGuerra,  that's  /join #grulic
[03:43] <Nukez> I have looked through alot of the docs and cant figure this out
[03:43] <Pelo> ! wireless | Nukez
[03:43] <Ubotwo> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:43] <MarianoGuerra> thanks
[03:43] <MarianoGuerra> its been a lot of time that  i dont use irc
[03:43] <Nukez> when I run dhclient eth1 It repeatedly says "network unavaliable"
[03:43] <air0day> i'm about to install my first app from source in linux EVER.  so i'm joining early, knowing i'll have trouble :)
[03:44] <skelter> air0day: ./configure; sudo make install
[03:44] <skelter> voici voila.
[03:44] <air0day> well, ive got to check it out of svn first
[03:44] <Pelo> air0day,  first use synaptic to install build-essential
[03:44] <air0day> okay
[03:44] <itrebal> Edgy is the current version of Ubuntu then?
[03:44] <Pelo> itrebal,  yes
[03:44] <air0day> im having trouble with the make -f Makefile.cvs
[03:45] <Nukez> have they fixed the default ati support?
[03:45] <air0day> it tells me i need autoconf (im building ktorrent)
[03:45] <Nukez> cause the resolution stinks on my comp
[03:45] <Pelo> air0day,  that is why you need the build-essentials
[03:45] <air0day> that includes autoconf?
[03:45] <Pelo> air0day,  I think there is a package for ktorrent in synaptic
[03:45] <itrebal> alright, thanks
[03:45] <air0day> pelo: yeah, but its not recent enough. i need the latest one
[03:45] <air0day> trying to get one that has rss
[03:46] <snwyvern> Hey. The driver typo is included in the PCMCIA source, which is built into the kernel... How do I fix this?
[03:46] <air0day> and azureus eats my machine for lunch
[03:46] <Pelo> air0day,    I use ubuntu  running on wine ,
[03:46] <Pelo> air0day,  I mean I use utorrent running on wine
[03:46] <air0day> yeah, im trying to not have to do that, but i might wind up doing that as well
[03:46] <air0day> i miss utorrent from windows more than anything else
[03:46] <air0day> foobar next :)
[03:47] <Pelo> air0day,  I even manage to have wine match the theme with a little work
[03:47] <snwyvern> Anybody care to field that one?
[03:47] <Pelo> snwyvern,  I would love to help but it's over my head
[03:48] <snwyvern> This fills me with sadness.
[03:48] <air0day> so im trying to do make -f Makefile.cvs and it keeps telling me "autoconf not found"
[03:48] <air0day> i used synaptic to install both autoconf 2.60-1 as well as build-essentials
[03:48] <Byan> what's the command to open up x-chat?
[03:48] <Pelo> air0day,  did you run ./configure first ?
=== AfterDea2h_ is now known as AfterDeath
[03:48] <skelter> byan: xchat
[03:48] <Pelo> Byan,  look in the menu
[03:48] <air0day> it says to do that after the make -f Makefile.cvs
[03:48] <Byan> oh, there we go
[03:49] <ne78> Which one is better (more features i don't care about patent in my country) mplayer from multiverse or mplayer from www.debian-multimedia.org ?
[03:49] <Byan> Pelo: using from shell
[03:49] <skelter> air0day: sudo apt-get install autoconf
[03:49] <air0day> i already installed autoconf
[03:49] <skelter> then it shouldn't be not found!
[03:49] <skelter> autoconf by itself in the terminal works?
[03:50] <air0day> yeah. it says autoconf: no input file
[03:50] <matts03441> hi if I've follow everything on this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[03:50] <tevfikt> Hello
[03:50] <matts03441> to get DVDs to work, but Totem still says I don't have the plugins, after installing gstreamer
[03:50] <tevfikt> Where can i find my terminal logs?
[03:50] <matts03441> what could be wrong?
[03:51] <air0day> so why is it complaining about autoconf if i have it?
[03:52] <highneko> matts03441: Pages like that probably won't be of any help. Try ubuntu forums. I suggest removing totem and installing mplayer + amarok.
[03:53] <GjM> can anyone help with a radeon 9600/X server problem?
[03:53] <matts03441> well mplayer freezes when I try to play a dvd so
[03:53] <matts03441> I tried to get it working in mythtv but it just goes to a blank screen and goes back to the menu
[03:54] <FantasticFoo> after an upgrade from dapper to edgy, i try and start x and i get some weird thing like (EE) FGLRX DOESN'T EXIST!! AUGHGHG UNKNOWN DRIVER X CAN'T START
[03:54] <FantasticFoo> it won't recognize my fglrx driver somehow
[03:54] <tevfikt> Where can i find my terminal logs?
[03:54] <FantasticFoo> can anybody help?
[03:54] <noodles13> FantasticFoo: reinstall them?
[03:54] <FantasticFoo> noodles13: tried it.
[03:54] <highneko> FantasticFoo: Maybe holding ctrl+shift when you login.
[03:55] <FantasticFoo> highneko: ??
[03:55] <highneko> FantasticFoo: ??
[03:55] <FantasticFoo> highneko: i don't think holding crtl+shift will somehow magically get X to recognize my fglrx drivers
[03:56] <Pelo> tevfikt,  system > admin > log viewer  should be in there
[03:56] <highneko> FantasticFoo: Yea, ok, just saw someone suggest it once. i did say maybe.
[03:56] <FantasticFoo> highneko: oh
[03:56] <FantasticFoo> highneko: ok
[03:56] <tevfikt> Pelo thank you
[03:56] <FantasticFoo> highneko: thanks anyway though
[03:56] <Pelo> tevfikt,  but I might be wrong
[03:56] <tevfikt> there are system logs
[03:57] <tevfikt> im lookin it
[03:57] <air0day> if i wanted to associate a file format with something other than a plain executable file, what would i do? specifically, i want to associate .torrent files from firefox with "wine utorrent.exe"
[03:57] <highneko> FantasticFoo: Maybe using a live cd, change your root, and remove the drivers?
[03:57] <FantasticFoo> highneko: actually i  think i have an idea
[03:57] <Pelo> air0day,  you are using utorrent after all ?
[03:58] <FantasticFoo> the mesa lib upgrade probably overrode the fglrx driver
[03:58] <FantasticFoo> hmm
[03:58] <air0day> pelo: well, i want ktorrent to work, but nobody is answering my question about it so i'm giving up and moving on
[03:58] <Pelo> air0day,  hold on
[03:58] <five_laptop> how does ubuntu handle switching to an external monitor?
[03:58] <five_laptop> on a laptop
[03:58] <air0day> its no big deal. i'll take any solution really. ktorrent is ideal, but utorrent in wine is fine i guess
[03:58] <bruenig> utorrent is great
[03:58] <Pelo> air0day,   http://www.securenet.net/members/jeanpelo/linux_guide.html ,  I wrote this a few months ago , it's not up on the site yet
[03:58] <wasabi_> Anybody know where the ocfs2 kernel modules are?
[03:59] <Pelo> air0day,  you can't realy associate the .torrent files with ut for somne reason but you can use the autolaod feature,  it's in the guide
[03:59] <astronouth7303> how do I copy an NTFS partition from hdd1 to hda5?
[03:59] <SperMite> Is there a way where i can stream movies off my linux box on my to my windows box? I tired using winscp but didn't work
[03:59] <wasabi_> astronouth7303: try ntfsclone
[03:59] <nomasteryoda|w> astronouth7303, gparted is the best way... the live cd version
[04:00] <Clin1> Does any one know of a free internet accelarator?
[04:00] <nomasteryoda|w> it works
[04:00] <nomasteryoda|w> i have done that
[04:00] <air0day> Pelo: well I'm looking for a way to make firefox .torrent files trigger into utorrent. that's not possible?
[04:00] <nomasteryoda|w> also slower... from cli ... dd if=/dev/hdd1 of=/dev/hda5
[04:01] <Clin1> Room | Do you know of a free internet accelarator?
[04:01] <nomasteryoda|w> man dd or google the command dd
[04:01] <Pelo> air0day,   I haven'T found a way to do it ,  but here is what I do,   set the autoload folder in ut to the desktop and save torrent files to you desktop from  ff,   they will get loaded automaticaly
[04:01] <air0day> :/
[04:01] <air0day> alright
[04:01] <Surghi> hi
[04:01] <air0day> nobody knows how to make ktorrent from svn build right?
[04:02] <bruenig> air0day, go into utorrent, options>preferences>Other, click the automatically load torrents in directory, set the directory to where ever your firefox default download directory is. When you download a torrent save it in that directory and utorrent will prompt, that is assuming you have it open
[04:02] <cafiending> if I connect over over my LAN with SSH from one linux box to another, how do I copy files from one PC to another?
[04:02] <Pelo> air0day,   in ut prefs under other,  check the option to delete the torrent from the autoload folder,    and specify another folder to store the torrents
[04:02] <ChocoCid>  cafiending: scp
[04:02] <ChocoCid> you don't want to be ssh'ed in when you do it though
[04:02] <cafiending> Or should a different protocol be used?
[04:02] <air0day> yeah, i get it. ive used utorrent a long time ;)
[04:02] <ChocoCid> (so open another terminal or whatever)
[04:02] <bruenig> Clin1, what does an accelerator even do. I always assumed it was just like some sort of cache/pre-fetching thing or am I wrong?
[04:02] <cafiending> sftp?
[04:02] <cafiending> scp
[04:02] <cafiending> thanks
[04:02] <ChocoCid> do man scp
[04:03] <cafiending> thanks
[04:03] <Clin1> Accelerator puts seaarching and browsing through a faster server
[04:03] <ChocoCid> it's something like scp /home/laptop/image.jpg /public_html/directory or w/e
[04:03] <Pelo> bruenig,   I have finaly figured out how to get ut to look like it belongs in ubuntu with matching themes if you are interested
[04:03] <evilmegaman> hi, I deleted my ubuntu partitions and tried to install another OS, But GRUB still tries to boot... Is there any way to fix this? it's very extremely annoying
[04:03] <evilmegaman> I get error 17 btw
[04:03] <air0day> god i hope someone ports utorrent to gnome
[04:04] <Pelo> air0day,  it is unlikely to happen,  ludde was not interested
[04:04] <Clin1> I got a wine question : Does it run all windows programs incuding ports, and what OS is it similar to?
[04:04] <bruenig> Pelo, yeah I could look at it, I would be content in knowing where that stupid tray icon is so I can edit it and make the background transparent and to be able to have the icon load in the bar on the top instead of that default no icon thing
[04:05] <bruenig> EvilGrin, you need to overwrite the MBR
[04:05] <dennister> Mythtv question (and please don't direct me to #mythtv-users): anyone here use it, an dmight be able to help me fix this internal tuner issue?
[04:05] <bruenig> evilmegaman, you need to overwrite the MBR, sorry tab completion failed me
[04:05] <noodles13> evilmegaman: what os are you trying to install? when i installed Suse 10.1 it fixed the mbr during the install
[04:05] <cafiending> I know this is the wrong channel, but I'm new to IRC.  What are all the diff networks for?
[04:05] <Pelo> Clin1,  wine is a windows platform running in linux.  it can match a several verison of windows if you need it
[04:05] <evilmegaman> noodles13: I am installing OSX lol
[04:06] <dennister> octan: how busy r u?
[04:06] <Pelo> bruenig,   the tray icon is builtin, there isn't much you can do about it and the skinning for that doesn't work in wine
[04:06] <noodles13> evilmegaman: lol on a non apple machine? there may be issues with that. I don't really know how they set it up
[04:06] <Clin1> OK, Thanks then i should be able to download everything i want... :)
[04:06] <cafiending> like EFnet, undernet, etc..  do they all have diff channels?
[04:06] <HipotermiA> Solarion,
[04:07] <evilmegaman> bruenig:  I don't know how to overwrite the MBR with a mac install CD XD
[04:07] <bruenig> Pelo, yeah I realized that after a long while searching, although I was pretty sure of that before I even began searching
[04:07] <noodles13> evilmegaman: do you have windows installed? and do u have a windows cd?
[04:07] <Elum> Has anyone in here managed to get Citrix 9 client to work with Edgy? I read the forum thread and I am receiving the error: glibc detected /usr/lib/ICAClient/wfica: double free or corruption (top). I have search on google with no resolve this this issue. Thanks in advanced
[04:07] <evilmegaman> noodles13: this isn't the first time it happened. Usually it happens whenever I try to install another linux
[04:07] <evilmegaman> noodles13: yep
[04:07] <Pelo> bruenig,  for the apps colour find the  /home/user/.wine/user.reg file , you can change the colours there manualy ,  take a screenshot of nautilus or something and sample the coolours from there using gimp to get the right codes and replace then in user.reg
[04:07] <evilmegaman> noodles13: I just had a revelation
[04:08] <noodles13> evilmegaman: you shold be able boot from the windows cd
[04:08] <noodles13> and fix the mbr
[04:08] <bimberi> Clin1: Wine doesn't run all programs.  Check winehq.org for a list.
[04:08] <evilmegaman> Use fixmbr on the windows cd
[04:08] <noodles13> and then try installing osx
[04:08] <evilmegaman> Genius :)
[04:08] <noodles13> lol yea
[04:08] <evilmegaman> :D alright thanks noodles13
[04:08] <noodles13> np
[04:08] <byteshack> when I do 'dpkg -l | grep "^rc"' I get a lot of packages
[04:08] <byteshack> how can I clear those out?
[04:09] <Lovloss> How do i lower my firewall so that I can reach more servers in gnutella?
[04:09] <Lovloss> it says i can "punch a hole" in it :P
[04:09] <bruenig> Pelo, what lines do I change?
[04:09] <air0day> how do i put an "launcher" in my Applications/Internet menu in gnome?
[04:10] <_azrael> I'm attempting to play Alpha Centauri on ubuntu, and it's getting an X error, major code 66, then dying. Does anyone know how to fix this?
[04:10] <bruenig> air0day, are you in dapper or edgy?
[04:10] <air0day> edgy
[04:10] <bimberi> byteshack: sudo apt-get remove --purge <package>
[04:10] <teledyn_> Lovloss: that means opening a port
[04:10] <Pelo> bruenig,   also take a screenshot of ut as it,  sample the colours you want to replace , search for those and replace with the colours you want from the nautilus screenshot
[04:10] <Lovloss> How do you open a port? whats a port? lol...
[04:10] <tonyyarusso> air0day: System > Preferences > Menu Layout, in Edgy
[04:10] <bruenig> air0day, there is something called menu editor somewhere in the menus, I don't remember where it was in edgy
[04:10] <Lovloss> all i know is i cant DL from limewire servers, connection gets refused
[04:10] <teledyn_> Lovloss: for example web http is port 80
[04:10] <Pelo> bruenig,  I did it by trial and error,  was pretty easy atcualy
[04:11] <air0day> awesome, thanks
[04:11] <Lovloss> okay... so... what do i do :P
[04:11] <teledyn_> Lovloss: do you even have a firewall?
[04:11] <byteshack> bimberi: thanks, so: dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | xargs apt-get remove --purge   should work?
[04:11] <Lovloss> Do i ? i dunno. :(
[04:11] <Pelo> air0day,  rightlick on the menu in the taskbar, pick alacart menu editor
[04:11] <Lovloss> i assume
[04:12] <Lovloss> i think maybe my fnew motherboard has one, and im on comcast
[04:12] <Pelo> Lovloss,  ubuntu doesn'T come with a firewall in the default install
[04:12] <Lovloss> right...
[04:12] <CowzRule> Hello
[04:12] <byteshack> bimberi: thanks, so: dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt-get remove --purge   should work?
[04:12] <bruenig> Pelo, is it hexadecimal or what?
[04:12] <air0day> where are all of the icons stored in linux? so i can select one for the menu item
[04:12] <Lovloss> dont comcast routers have firewalls?
[04:12] <teledyn_> air0day: /usr/share/pixmaps   /usr/share/icons for kde ones
[04:12] <bruenig> air0day, /usr/share/pixmpas
[04:12] <bruenig> maps*
[04:12] <air0day> awesome thanks
[04:13] <Pelo> bruenig,  it's rmvb or something    255 255 255 for withe 0 0 0 for black
[04:13] <Lovloss> I just want to be able to find results in gnutella, im only connecting to one server and it has zilch
[04:13] <teledyn_> Lovloss: possibly.  log in to your router and see.  it may be that you need to do port forwarding on the router for whatever port
[04:13] <Pelo> air0day,  you can also download one from the skin page of utorrent and store it in /home/user/.icon
[04:13] <bimberi> byteshack: ha, i was just typing an explanation as to why the first one wouldn't work.  That might work.  Add a -s (meaning simulate) to the apt-get to test it
[04:14] <Lovloss> how do you log into a router?
[04:14] <teledyn_> Lovloss: read the manual
[04:14] <air0day> holy crap. utorrent actually added a system tray icon to my tray
[04:14] <air0day> totally didnt expect that to work
[04:14] <Lovloss> c.c uh yeah ... manual
[04:15] <Pelo> Lovloss,   put your default gateway number in the browser's adress bar and for loggin try blank/blank , admin/admin/   admin/blank or bland/admin
[04:15] <teledyn_> Lovloss: sounds like you might want to pay an IT person to help you out
[04:15] <Pelo> air0day,  it does but not very well
[04:15] <Lovloss> maybe... this is all greek to me. Ports and such...
[04:15] <byteshack> bimberi: thanks
[04:15] <air0day> pelo: whats wrong with it? besides being ugly
[04:15] <teledyn_> Lovloss: yeah, if you don't know about most of this stuff its probably better to let someone who does do it
[04:16] <bimberi> byteshack: yw :)
[04:16] <Lovloss> i just used to use limewire very easily
[04:16] <martyyyr> does anyone know of some kind of post-it note application for ubuntu?
[04:16] <Pelo> air0day,  when I toggle utorrent on and off using the tray icon the window "climbs" up the desktop
[04:16] <bruenig> limewire/gnutella < bittorrent
[04:16] <teledyn_> Lovloss: it may also be that you just need to change the server your're connecting to.  as far as i know gnutella should operate fine behind a router
[04:16] <air0day> interesting
[04:16] <Lovloss> that may be, but its hard to find torrents of everything
[04:17] <Pelo> martyyyr,  rightclick on the taskbar,  add application ,   something called tommy in there that does what you want
[04:17] <Lovloss> change the server?
[04:17] <grout> how do i enable dual core in edgy?
[04:17] <Pelo> Lovloss,   you want torrents ?  www.torrentz.com
[04:17] <bimberi> martyyyr: tomboy (edgy) and a "sticky notes" applet is available in edgy and dapper
[04:17] <Lovloss> i ue torrentz
[04:17] <Lovloss> never mind... i dont know this stuff at all
[04:17] <air0day> do i need to conver the .ico file to a png or something to use it in the menu editor?
[04:18] <martyyyr> Pelo and bimberi, thanks... I had no idea those things were out there!
[04:18] <Lovloss> i just know how to download stuff off p2p stuff lol
[04:18] <grout> how do i enable dual core in edgy?
[04:18] <Pelo> air0day,  bmp or png , or jpg
[04:18] <bimberi> martyyyr: np.  tomboy is particularly cool imo (eg. its ability to link notes to each other)
[04:18] <air0day> so i need to convert the .ico file from the site?
[04:19] <Pelo> air0day,  you can try dragging the icon on the thinghy in the dialog box
[04:19] <air0day> whats a good program for that?
[04:19] <martyyyr> bimberi: tomboy crashes when I try to run it :)
[04:19] <Pelo> air0day,  just download the preview
[04:19] <air0day> oh.. but the preview has a bunch of different sizes on it
[04:19] <bimberi> martyyyr: :(
[04:19] <teledyn_> air0day: convert   its part of the imagemagick app
[04:19] <Pelo> air0day,  gimp is the program to edit and play aournd with image files in linux
[04:19] <grout> what kernel do i install for core duo?
[04:20] <teledyn_> Pelo: convert is much better for format conversion than gimp
[04:20] <vaccine> howdy folks
[04:20] <highneko> How can I use my computer to login to another cmoputer and see everything like using two computers with one monitor?
[04:20] <bimberi> grout: should be enabled by default.  check by seeing if 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' lists muliple processors
[04:20] <Pelo> i686 i think
[04:20] <teledyn_> highneko: vnc is one way
[04:21] <grout> bimberi just 1 processor
[04:21] <highneko> teledyn_: Ok, thanks.
[04:21] <kuja> Is there a AMD64 SMP kernel image (for 2.6) anywhere?
[04:21] <Clin1> Is their any good Broadcasting DJ software for Linux?
[04:21] <vaccine> I d/l'ed the desktop iso for 6.10, and I'm trying to get it installed on a PIII with only 128Mb RAM, how can I get it to install without it trying to load all the fancy graphics?
[04:21] <haxality> ok so
[04:21] <haxality> yet another problem
[04:21] <bimberi> grout: what's the output of 'uname -r'
[04:21] <haxality> whenever I close the screen on my laptop, the output gets garbled
[04:21] <grout> bimbero, it shows 2 processors
[04:21] <teledyn_> highneko: viewing a remote windows box from linux with vnc is usually ok, but i've always had problems trying to view another linux box via vnc
[04:22] <kuja> vaccine: You need to get the "Alternate" ISO, which uses the text-based installer.
[04:22] <vaccine> doh
[04:22] <grout> bimberi: 2.6.17-10-generic
[04:22] <Jordan_U_> haxality: Is that when it sleeps, or does the screen just turn off?
[04:22] <haxality> just when the screen turns off
[04:22] <haxality> hey, Jordan_U_, it's awesome that you're still here, heh
[04:22] <vaccine> kuja, the docs say that you can just type "server" at the boot options.. that's not true?
[04:22] <his_dudnes> vaccine you should get a xubuntu alternate install to be well with the RAM
[04:23] <Clin1> Is their any good Broadcasting DJ software for Linux?
[04:23] <grout> bimberi: so both cores are being used? i thought a had to install a 686 kernel
[04:23] <kuja> vaccine: I think you may have misread.
[04:23] <vaccine> kuja, wouldn't be the first time
[04:23] <vaccine> ;)
[04:23] <kuja> The Ubuntu "server" is everything without a desktop environment.
[04:23] <Pelo> Clin1,   have you searched synaptic for  broadcasting or other relevant words ?
[04:23] <his_dudnes> vaccine server was for 5.10 if i remember well
[04:23] <vaccine> ah ok
[04:24] <Clin1> Is their any good Broadcasting DJ software for Linux?
[04:24] <Pelo> Clin1,   have you searched synaptic for  broadcasting or other relevant words ?
[04:24] <vaccine> I was just following the docs https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems
[04:24] <vaccine> but, I'll start the other d/l.. thanks for the info =)
[04:24] <bimberi> grout: i'm not sure sorry - and struggling to find info.  I would have thought you'd see 2 procs but I don't have that sort of machine here to check
[04:24] <martyyyr> hm... where is my Thrash folder?
[04:24] <grout> bimberi: i do see two processors
[04:24] <Pelo> martyyyr, /home/user/.trash
[04:25] <bruenig> Martincho, ~/.trash
[04:25] <martyyyr> that simple eh?
[04:25] <Pelo> yep
[04:25] <kuja> vaccine: At least you know now :)
[04:25] <bruenig> or is it .Trash
[04:25] <grout> bimberi: so does that mean there both being used?
[04:25] <Clin1> I cant right now, im installing updates
[04:25] <kuja> vaccine: When in doubt, always ask
[04:25] <bruenig> it used to be .Trash
[04:25] <bimberi> grout: ah, i missed you saying so because of the mistyped nick :)
[04:25] <vaccine> kuja, yep.. thanks for info =)
[04:25] <bimberi> grout: yes
[04:25] <his_dudnes> vaccine i would advise you to avoid gnome and kde, so use a xubuntu alternate  install
[04:25] <grout> bimberi : so i dont have to install a smp kernel?
[04:26] <Pelo> Clin1,  do it when hyou are done
[04:26] <bruenig> xubuntu is great
[04:26] <bimberi> grout use the system monitor to check (system -> admin -> system monitor)
=== Jordan_U_ is now known as Jordan_U
[04:26] <bimberi> grout: no ...
[04:26] <bimberi> !generic | grout
[04:26] <Ubotwo> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[04:26] <Clin1> Can ubuntu be installed on a system with 64 MB Ram? its SDRAM
[04:26] <martyyyr> how can I delete the contents of a folder, but not the folder itself?
[04:26] <martyyyr> using a terminal..
[04:26] <kyrbe> how do I find out if I'm using edgy or draper?
[04:26] <his_dudnes> Clin1 practicaly no
[04:26] <bruenig> Clin1, I am sure the server could be installed, and xubuntu could also but even that would be a bit of a stretch
[04:27] <bimberi> !version | kyrbe
[04:27] <grout> bimberi : thanks alot
[04:27] <Ubotwo> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[04:27] <Clin1> Shoot i was hoping to make something out of my old 98
[04:27] <martyyyr> nvm... I'll start using the man pages more often :S
[04:27] <kyrbe> how do I upgrade to edgy?
[04:27] <bruenig> !upgrade
[04:27] <Ubotwo> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:27] <Pelo> martyyyr,  you'll find this usefull http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[04:27] <his_dudnes> Clin1 there are distros specialised on old hardware
[04:28] <martyyyr> thanks again Pelo
[04:28] <bruenig> damn small linux perhaps
[04:28] <Clin1> Wait does the server have ssh?
[04:28] <kyrbe> bruenig, why not?
[04:28] <Flannel> Clin1: not by default
[04:28] <kyrbe> All I want is for beryl to work, and I can't get it to work under draper for some reason
[04:28] <Flannel> Clin1: but yeah, server uses the same repositories as regular ubuntu
[04:28] <bruenig> Kyral, what?
[04:28] <Clin1> I dont want to download them, besides i cant install some of them, the bios also is extremly old ver .5
[04:28] <bruenig> kyrbe, what?
[04:29] <Flannel> kyrbe: ask in #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl
[04:29] <kyrbe> thanks flannel
[04:29] <Clin1> So ok, il try to install it um one min
[04:30] <vaccine> Solarion, is 6.10 server still ok for a box with only 128Mb of RAM?
[04:30] <madman91> i have a weird problem with my xorg.conf .... specifically my mouse.. i change a setting.. restart X .. its all good ... then i reboot ... same new settings.. old functionality ...
[04:30] <martyyyr> my final question for tonight... what does " exit.. there are stopped jobs"  mean, when I type " exit"  in a terminal?
[04:30] <bimberi> vaccine: should be fine
[04:30] <Flannel> martyyyr: that you have stopped jobs (programs running, but stopped)
[04:30] <highneko> teledyn_: When I use vncviewer and enter the remote password, I get a screen with lines on it and a cross cursor. Is this normal? What am I missing?
[04:31] <tim> anyone know if its possible to get deskbar to play audio files with banshee rather than totem?
[04:31] <bimberi> martyyyr: type 'fg' to bring the stopped jobs to the foreground
[04:31] <vaccine> what's the difference between alternate and server?
[04:31] <Flannel> martyyyr: use "jobs" to see them, then %# (where # is their number) to switch to that particular one
[04:31] <teledyn_> highneko: that sounds like an x session with no window manager running
[04:31] <martyyyr> Flannel: of course... but all I did in that terminal was "ls" .. so where do all these jobs come from?
[04:31] <Flannel> vaccine: alternate installs a desktop, or a GUIless one, server just installs GUIless, has the LAMP preinstall option, and installs a modified server kernel
[04:32] <highneko> I didn't specify a desktop on the remote machine, it jsut picked one. How do I know what one to use?
[04:32] <Flannel> martyyyr: if you ctrl-z, it stops a job
[04:32] <teledyn_> highneko: any one you want
[04:32] <vaccine> Flannel, thanks =)
[04:32] <martyyyr> Flannel, but .. I mean... ALL I did was " ls", and it had already finished when I typed exit..
[04:32] <highneko> teledyn_: I don't understand. What's this desktop perameter?
[04:33] <tokenbad> ok....I have a slave...and for some reason it has a 1 meg partition at the front of it...and I want to install vista to that drive...but when try its not registering the second partition...only the first partition...I tried gparted to get rid of the 1 meg partition and it will not remove it...is there something else or someway else to remove it?
[04:33] <Flannel> martyyyr: then you must have other stuff going on.  log back in, type jobs, see what's there
[04:33] <teledyn_> highneko: what are you logging in to?  a linux box?
[04:33] <Jimb1> my fstab file is read only. I need to edit it and I cant. How do I make it so I can write to it and save the changes?
[04:33] <highneko> teledyn_: yea
[04:33] <kitsuneofdoom> vnc4server stopped working with edgy, complaining about lacking a fixed font
[04:33] <Garcher> hey i was trying to install Firefox 2.0 on dapper, but i screwed up and now i dont have anything... i lost firefox!!! help plz~
[04:33] <teledyn_> highneko: and is it running x right now and a window manager?  kde or gnome or something?
[04:33] <Flannel> Jimb1: open it with gksudo/sudo
[04:33] <Pelo> Garcher,  reinstall ff1.5 from synaptic
[04:33] <martyyyr> Flannel:  typig jobs results in nothing.. maybe I just didn't something wrong, thanks anyway
[04:33] <highneko> teledyn_: gnoem yea
[04:34] <Flannel> Jimb1: like, gksudo gedit /etc/fstab  or sudo nano /etc/fstab
[04:34] <bhoover> i did an update from 6.06 to 6.10 and i cannot login with gdm now. says cannot find libpixbufloader-png.so. it is looking for it in /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0 but i have 2.10.0 there instead. advice?
[04:34] <Jimb1> ok thanx ill try that
[04:34] <bimberi> !tell kitsuneofdoom about vncfix
[04:34] <teledyn_> highneko: i don't know, i'm not a vnc expert.  sounds like you were able to connect.  i don't know why you don't see the gnome session
[04:34] <dennister> gues what ppls? i got it, i got it, i got it....yahoo! for the third time today!
[04:34] <adrenaline> hey anybody else having issues with lan browsing in edgy?
[04:34] <kitsuneofdoom> bimberi: muchas gracias
[04:34] <vaccine> well.. even if I couldn't actually run the installer, it still looked pretty up to that point =)
[04:34] <Garcher> Pelo will that do it? i tried to reinstall from a terminal but it didnt work...
[04:35] <highneko> teledyn_: When I try something it says "already running as :# I should probably logout and try that number.
[04:35] <bimberi> kitsuneofdoom: noa problemo :)
[04:35] <Pelo> Garcher,  that's the best advice I can give you
[04:35] <highneko> teledyn_: Thank you.
[04:35] <funkyHat> How do I tell apt/dpkg to redirect a file from a package? I'm setting up pulse audio and I want to keep esound installed so that gnome sounds still work, but need to move/remove /usr/bin/esd
[04:35] <Garcher> mmm.. ill try that.. thanks!
[04:35] <dennister> fixed the stb, then the mythconverg database, and for the first time:  <drumroll> live audio and video feeds from my tuner :)
[04:36] <funkyHat> Or would I have to roll my own esound deb to do that?
[04:36] <dennister> this noob is making so much progress with mythtv it's unreal
[04:36] <tokenbad> also in ubuntu I try to do sudo apt-get install whatever and it gives me a Segmentation faulty tree. error...
[04:36] <lin_christy> does anyone now where the repositories are for the new ubnutu alpha?
[04:36] <Pelo> dennister,  congrats
[04:36] <air0day> whats a good program to handle rar files?
[04:37] <tokenbad> air0day, do apt-cache search rar
[04:37] <bimberi> !rar
[04:37] <air0day> what's apt-cache?
[04:37] <tokenbad> there rar is part of ubuntu
[04:37] <Ubotwo> rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[04:37] <dennister> ty Pelo...not bad for a noob with no tech training, eh...
[04:37] <Flannel> air0day: it searches the cache of your package.lists
[04:38] <bhoover> can anyone help me with a gtk libs problem?
[04:38] <tokenbad> anyone know why would get the Segmentation faulty tree or how to fix it?
[04:38] <specialbuddy> is there a way to set it up so that everytime I plug in my portable hard drive with 3 partitions, the partitions will go to the same media folder everytime?
[04:38] <air0day> thanks
[04:38] <Pelo> dennister,  , what do you think I am ?
[04:39] <Pelo> bhoover,  try looking up your error message in the forum
[04:39] <Healot> just trivial, yet kinda important for me
[04:39] <bhoover> i did that. ran into lots of issues with folks compiling stuff. mine seems to just be a library path issue. i do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set so i didn't know what else to try.
[04:39] <Pelo> Healot, ???
[04:39] <Healot> anyone compressed ubuntu ISO with 7-zip ultra high compression, yet? the ratio
[04:39] <bhoover> is there a config file in x/gdm that says where to get the libs from?
[04:40] <highneko> teledyn_: I had to stop gdm. It worked by looked pretty bad. Was an interesting experience. Thank you.
[04:41] <teledyn_> highneko: you might need to specify the resolution

[04:42] <tokenbad> can someone help me fix a drive problem...I have a slave drive...and had it org in just 2 partitions...i then combined those partitions...but for some reason there is like 1 meg partition on the drive...and gparted will not remove it...I need to remove it so I can install another os to that drive...but the OS will not install with that partition on it...
[04:43] <Pelo> tokenbad,  try lowformating the drive first
[04:43] <Flannel> hanasaki: you'll need to edit the config file
[04:43] <pacman> thank you
[04:43] <hanasaki> Flannel:ya.. iam looking for theright place... the template?
[04:44] <Flannel> hanasaki: template?  no, it'll be /etc/exim/ or something (maybe exim#) where # is the exim number
[04:44] <tokenbad> Pelo, how?
[04:44] <specialbuddy> how come I can't change the permissions on my portable harddrive
[04:45] <air0day> god. i cant belive how much faster utorrent under wine is than either ktorrent or azeureus
[04:45] <Pelo> tokenbad,  lowformat is usualy in the bios,  be carefull not to format a drive you want to keep as is,  this is a very final solution,    and takes several hours
[04:45] <cliffd> is there a way to search for a package with apt-get?
[04:45] <tokenbad> Pelo, ok..thanks...will try it
[04:45] <Jordan_U> cliffd: apt-cache search
[04:45] <Flannel> cliffd: apt-cache search [stuff] 
[04:46] <ameyer> <3 not being able to use java in firefox and azureus at the same time
[04:46] <bhoover> tokenbad, rather than using bios LL format, see if the drive mfgr website has utils for the drive. there is usually something for writing zeroes to the drive. that's what i usually use.
[04:46] <Jimbo> I just formated my second hard drive to ext3 using gparted, and now it has a folder in it named Lost+found, which is unreadable and unwriteable, and the entire drive is also apparently unwritable, as I cannot right click and make a folder. What do I need to do to correct this?
[04:46] <torpedo|dog> Any tips on getting the IBM Active Protection System to work?
[04:46] <cliffd> Jordan_U, Flannel: thanks much.
[04:46] <torpedo|dog> or rather, hdaps-utils.
[04:46] <Pelo> ameyer,  don't use azureus
[04:47] <ameyer> seriously, azureus 2.5 is terrible
[04:47] <ameyer> utorrent in wine is better
[04:47] <torpedo|dog> I use Firefox Java and Eclipse at the same time all the time :-/
[04:47] <Pelo> ameyer, preaching to the choir
[04:47] <Jimbo> ??
[04:47] <Jordan_U> xmoto no longer starts ( it just crashes comlaining about drivers )
[04:47] <Pelo> ameyer,  actualy you're preaching to the preacher , I wrote the guide on getting ut to work in wine
[04:48] <Jimbo>  I just formated my second hard drive to ext3 using gparted, and now it has a folder in it named Lost+found, which is unreadable and unwriteable, and the entire drive is also apparently unwritable, as I cannot right click and make a folder. What do I need to do to correct this? Total n00b here...4 days with nix
[04:48] <ameyer> well, the problem is azureus needs to have java=gcj (or whatever is default) and java in firefox needs java = sun jre :|
[04:48] <Healot> sharing Eclipse JRE could save some space?
[04:49] <Pelo> Jimbo,  if no one here can answer you try looknig up your problem in the forum
[04:49] <ameyer> Jimbo: permissions?
[04:50] <Jimbo> ameyer...can u help?
[04:50] <Jimbo> im new with this os
[04:50] <cliffd> this is a stupid question, but is there some sort of rc-updater for ubuntu? how do I add things to auto start?

[04:50] <noodles13> ooh that was to cliffd
[04:50] <bimberi> Jimbo: make a folder on the drive with 'sudo mkdir /path/to/folder' then make it usable by your user with 'sudo chown username:username /path/to/folder'
[04:51] <ameyer> chmod -r /path/to/the/drive 777
[04:51] <Pelo> cliffd,  you can add progs to load at startup in   system > prefs > sessions
[04:51] <ameyer> or is it the other way around

[04:51] <noodles13> oh

[04:51] <Jimbo> no tremulous
[04:51] <Pelo> cliffd,  then I can 'T help
[04:51] <benplaut> oh
[04:52] <cliffd> Pelo: thanks.
[04:52] <ameyer> whoops, it'd be chmod 777 /path/to/drive
[04:52] <tokenbad> Pelo, there is no low level format in my bios
[04:52] <Jimbo> bimberi and ameyer ...will try those solutions now...brb
[04:52] <Jimbo> 777 gotcha

[04:53] <anacaona> i have a minor issue with jinzora
[04:53] <torpedo|dog> anacaona...that space was intentional, right?

[04:56] <manny0> im not sure what the downs are

[04:57] <ChocoCid> beryl replaces Metacity when you run it
[04:57] <manny0> oh
[04:57] <Jordan_U> On intel cards with edgy you just apt-get install beryl ( after adding a new repo )
[04:57] <luminousnerd> noo noo I mean beryl

[05:00] <luminousnerd> I didn't see anything anywhere lol
[05:00] <noodles13> yea.. right when you enter in your username
[05:00] <luminousnerd> Oky peace brb
[05:00] <manny0> how i set up 3d acceleration
[05:01] <ChocoCid> heh
[05:01] <ChocoCid> I think beryl may be out of your reach for now
[05:01] <ChocoCid> learn a bit more about linux and ubuntu at first, then try it later
[05:01] <ChocoCid> i hosed my system trying to install beryl on Dapper
[05:02] <ChocoCid> though that was entirely my fault, not beryl's

[05:02] <ChocoCid> i think XGL is what broke it for me though
[05:02] <manny0> k
[05:02] <ChocoCid> it's easier to get working on edgy, as i said
[05:02] <manny0> id like to do acceleration anyway
[05:02] <manny0> is there a how to?'

[05:02] <Jordan_U> :)
[05:02] <ChocoCid> what's the easy way to check if you have aiglx instead of fglrx?
[05:03] <Jimbo> when running chmod 777 /path/to/drive i get the following message  > changing permissions of `/media/hdb1/lost+found': Operation not permitted
[05:03] <Jimbo> jgh@Jgh-linux:~$
[05:03] <Jimbo> what is wrong?
[05:03] <ChocoCid> er, not instead, but w/e
[05:03] <manny0> i changed the fglrx
[05:03] <ChocoCid> Jimbo , you need to be root
[05:03] <manny0> to ati
[05:03] <manny0> and used the offical driver
[05:03] <ChocoCid> try doing sudo
[05:03] <ChocoCid> although why are you changing the permissions of lost+fouund?
[05:03] <Jimbo> chocoCid..how do I become root?
[05:03] <Jordan_U> ChocoCid: Check your xorg.conf for fglrx.
[05:03] <ChocoCid> !sudo > Jimbo
[05:03] <variant> why does internet explorer start faster than firefox?
[05:03] <Jimbo> ok thanx
[05:03] <Jimbo> will try that
[05:03] <ChocoCid> heh, figured. i'll pass on that, i was more wondering "how would a newbie know"
[05:04] <ChocoCid> variant: it's built into the operating system
[05:04] <Jordan_U> variant: Because most of IE is loaded at boot and constantly stored in memory.
[05:04] <ChocoCid> unless you mean IE through WINE
[05:04] <cliffd> so, if I wanted a service to start on boot and I have a script in say rc3.d S99service what else do I need to get it to start on boot? 6.10. thanks.
[05:04] <ChocoCid> but that would be odd!
[05:04] <variant> if you say its because its so much more integrated with the operating system i will just laugh, becaus it starts faster running under wine on linux than does firefox nativly
[05:04] <ChocoCid> firefox isn't really "native"
[05:04] <variant> ChocoCid: yeah, it's true
[05:04] <ChocoCid> it's not integrated into the OS
[05:04] <variant> ChocoCid: the binarly is and ELF executable, thats as native as you get
[05:05] <variant> ChocoCid: exscuse my poor english (i am scottish)
[05:05] <ChocoCid> cliffd  system-administration-services
[05:05] <variant> lol
[05:05] <Jordan_U> variant: Wow, how fast does FF open for you?
[05:05] <Jimbo> ChocoCid: can you be a little more clear re !sudo>jimbo
[05:05] <ChocoCid> !sudo
[05:05] <Ubotwo> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:05] <ChocoCid> should have sent it to you :(
[05:05] <cliffd> ChocoCid: is there a CLI version?
[05:05] <ChocoCid> cliffd: i'm sure there is, but i don't know what it is :P
[05:05] <ChocoCid> !services
[05:05] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com

[05:05] <Ubotwo> To add programs to start up when you log into your Gnome session https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup
[05:05] <ChocoCid> good enough? :\
[05:05] <Jimbo> ChocoCid: that just brings up usage and a bunch of letters
[05:06] <ChocoCid> Jimbo: if you do sudo command , it does that command as root (after prompting you for your password)
[05:06] <ChocoCid> for isntance
[05:06] <ChocoCid> apt-get install firefox will give you "cannot unlock directory, are you root?"
[05:06] <variant> ChocoCid: the truth is, firefox is slower than ie because firefox is not coded for a fast start up time
[05:06] <Clin1> Any one want a old upgradable pc for 200
[05:06] <Jimbo> k i tried putting sudo in front of chmod
[05:06] <ChocoCid> sudo apt-get install firefox prompts you for your password, then installs it
[05:06] <Jimbo> will try again
[05:06] <ChocoCid> the password will not show up at all in the ocmmand line, not even as asterisks
[05:06] <ChocoCid> that's normal
[05:07] <Jimbo> choco...is this right?   sudo chmod 777 /media/hdb1
[05:07] <noodles13> variant if you knew then were you just testing us?
[05:07] <Flannel> Jimbo: what are you doing?
[05:07] <variant> noodles13: yep
[05:07] <ChocoCid> looks like it, but why are you wanting to make an entire hard drive read-write-execute for everyone?
[05:07] <variant> noodles13: :)
[05:07] <noodles13> lol
[05:08] <variant> Jimbo: 775 is much much more secure
[05:08] <Jimbo> Flannel: trying to make the drive i just formated and mounted writable and readab;e
[05:08] <noodles13> ChocoCid: i think he formatted it to ext3 and he coudln't write to it
[05:08] <Zububwa> do you script the 'nickname:' format on your irc clients?
[05:08] <Flannel> Jimbo: change your fstab, not chmodding
[05:08] <Jimbo> noodles...correct
[05:08] <ChocoCid> if that's the case why would he need to chmod? he wants mount :(
[05:08] <Jimbo> i changed the fstab already
[05:08] <Flannel> Zububwa: most/all of them come with it
[05:08] <Jimbo> ill check to make dure
[05:08] <Jimbo> sure
[05:08] <Flannel> Jimbo: the umask in the fstab, that is
[05:09] <Zububwa> i use Tab to find the nick, do you have a personal script or just find the name each time
[05:09] <ChocoCid> tab here
[05:09] <Zububwa> i see
[05:09] <Jimbo> unmask?????
[05:09] <Flannel> Zububwa: most people use a few letters, then hit tab, and it adds the colon automatically
[05:09] <Flannel> Jimbo: umask
[05:09] <Zububwa> hmm, mine doesnt add a colon
[05:09] <ChocoCid> i set mine to NOT add the colon automatically because i like using nicknames in the middle of a line sometimes
[05:09] <Jimbo> Flannel what is umask?
[05:10] <Jimbo> flannel heres what I did
[05:10] <Zububwa> well there is my scripting task of the night...
[05:10] <Jimbo> I formated it then mounted it then put this in fstab file and saved    /dev/hdb1       /media/hdb1 ext3 defaults 0 0

[05:14] <Jimbo> congo  ?
[05:14] <Spawn311> does mplayer come with gui as default package?
[05:14] <cong0_natty> or auto,rw
[05:14] <haxality> ok
[05:14] <haxality> this is very interesting.
[05:14] <haxality> my wireless card fails to start
[05:14] <teledyn_> Spawn311: yes.  gmplayer is the binary name
[05:14] <haxality> but my ethernet adapter is supposedly operating fine
[05:14] <haxality> however
[05:14] <haxality> I cannot access the internet
[05:14] <Spawn311> thanks teledyn
[05:14] <Jordan_U> fatal exception : invalid or missing texture file (Textures/UI/Loading.png)
[05:14] <haxality> nor can I get an IP from my DHCP server
[05:14] <ArrenLex> !enter
[05:14] <Ubotwo> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[05:15] <Stephenishere> Hi im having problems with my sound, i get sound on the start up and log off but i dont get sound in like firefox and in wine, any help is appriciated...
[05:15] <ArrenLex> ...what happened to Ubotu? I see I've been gone too long.
[05:15] <glitch-> what is the best irc client for ubuntu, best graphics?
[05:15] <brett__> i am having trouble getting a 3d game to work on my kubuntu machine. The game is called tremulous and it runs super slow for some reason
[05:15] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Send quota ;)
[05:16] <Spawn311> teledyn what section is that under in synaptic?>
[05:16] <haxality> sorry Ubotwo.
[05:16] <brett__> the mouse takes a minute to move
[05:16] <haxality> any idea cong0_natty?
[05:16] <Jordan_U> brett__:  Have you set up the 3D drivers for your card?
[05:16] <ArrenLex> brett: Are you using 3d-capable drivers?
[05:16] <teledyn_> glitch-: best graphics for an irc client?   irc is inherently text-based
[05:16] <cong0_natty> erm Jimbo i ment auto,users,rw
[05:16] <eternalswd> I'm having problems with correctly reading a dvd+rw.  The drive mounts correctly to /media/cdrom and a nautilus window opens listing the files, but I can't read them.  also if I try to access the cdrom folder from the command line it says permission denied even though the folder is public readable.  I remember having this problem before and I think it had to do with the changing the type in fstab.  My current fstab line is /dev/hda /media/c
[05:16] <eternalswd> drom0 udf,iso9660 user,noauto 0 0
[05:16] <brett__> Jordan_U: i believe so
[05:16] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: can you read as root?
[05:16] <cong0_natty> haxality, do you have your ip set up proper?
[05:16] <cong0_natty> and dns?
[05:17] <brett__> Jordan_U: i have been installing all kinds of stuff and i believe the 3d drivers were installed
[05:17] <eternalswd> ArrenLex, how would I test that?
[05:17] <Jimbo> auto, users,rw  ??????????
[05:17] <haxality> this is so bizarre, eth0 is up but it won't get an IP
[05:17] <Jimbo> brb
[05:17] <Jordan_U> brett__: To check, run: glxinfo | grep direct ( it should say direct rendering = yes )
[05:17] <brett__> ArrenLex: i have played the game on this machine when windows was installed and it worked fine
[05:17] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: start a root shell and try to cd into the cdrom.
[05:17] <brett__> Jordan_U: then no
[05:18] <cong0_natty> yea auto will automaticaly mount it, users means anyone can mount or unmount it and rw means its readable and writeable
[05:18] <brett__> Jordan_U: it says it doesnt
[05:18] <Jordan_U> !fglrx | brett__
[05:18] <Ubotwo> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:18] <cong0_natty> ro = read only
[05:18] <glitch-> teledyn_:i know but some look irc clients are messy orders are well organized..do u advice any?
[05:18] <ArrenLex> brett: a) is it a Windows game which you are running on wine? b) Your video card can be capable of curing cancer and feeding underprivileged children on Windows, but if you don't have Linux drivers you're not squeezing anything beyond 2D out of it. What drivers?
[05:18] <cong0_natty> this room moves so fast with 846 people in it
[05:19] <re-align> Anyone have recommendations on which filesystem to use? Something good for older systems, non-journalised, and secure.
[05:19] <redDEADresolve> i need help, i killed my pc's bios any way i can fix this?
[05:19] <re-align> Something i can use shred on if I need to...
[05:19] <baxter_k> How can I disable my screensaver and/or screen blanking (in config files -- I'm using openbox)
[05:19] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: That doesn't work. Direct rendering != 3D acceleration.
[05:19] <hamburger_xie> hi, see if anyone could help. i wanna install gtk run-time and development environment in my xubuntu box. what should i do?
[05:19] <cong0_natty> redDEADresolve, replace the bios chip
[05:19] <cong0_natty> :P
[05:19] <redDEADresolve> how do i do that congo
[05:19] <cong0_natty> very carefully
[05:19] <cong0_natty> :))
[05:19] <Spawn311> baxter probably something with xset command
[05:20] <Spawn311> man xset
[05:20] <cong0_natty> its probably solder'd to your motherboard
[05:20] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: But direct rendering = no almost always means you don't have 3D accel
[05:20] <cong0_natty> if not then its just clipped in a little slot on your motherboard
[05:20] <redDEADresolve> yeah i don't want to do that, is that the only way. the pc frozen while updating the bios and now its a brick
[05:20] <IA-Outdoors> hey what does it mean when I run adept installer and some of the options are grayed out?
[05:20] <cong0_natty> its long rectangle has a buncha pins down each side about 2 inchs long about 1/2 inch wide says right on it
[05:20] <cong0_natty> well then your outta luck
[05:20] <IA-Outdoors> e.g. firefox, thunderbird, etc
[05:20] <IA-Outdoors> it's killing me
[05:21] <redDEADresolve> well what do i replace it with?
[05:21] <cong0_natty> yes if you flash the wrong bios or it screws up your outta luck
[05:21] <cong0_natty> then your pc is a brick
[05:21] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: how did you manage to bork a bios flash?
[05:21] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Yes, but not the other way around. If you just ask people to paste the output of "glxinfo | grep renderer", you will always get a correct answer: Mesa Indirect for no, or a driver name for yes.
[05:21] <redDEADresolve> the pc froze, just stopped dead for like 2 hours
[05:21] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: in the middle of a flash update?
[05:21] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: I was just confirming what I suspected, I know it doesn't work the other way around.
[05:21] <redDEADresolve> well if i take out the bios chip what do i replace it with
[05:22] <eternalswd> ArrenLex, okay, it can read it as root
[05:22] <cong0_natty> the same one you took out
[05:22] <glitch-> teledyn_:do u advice any?
[05:22] <Jimbo> still no luck
[05:22] <redDEADresolve> yup right in the middle up the update
[05:22] <cong0_natty> you will have to order it
[05:22] <teledyn_> glitch-: apt-cache search irc
[05:22] <matjan> where can i tell dapper that i want e.g. conky to execute automatically at the start of a session? i thought you can do that in the startup programs tab of preferences > sessions, but when i say that i want conky to start up, and i close and open again, the conky entry is gone...
[05:22] <redDEADresolve> i cant reflash my bios?
[05:22] <cong0_natty> look for the part # on the bios chip and look for a place you can order it
[05:22] <cong0_natty> no
[05:22] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: this is my cdrom fstab line, which gives me no problems. Perhaps it will be useful to you: /dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
[05:22] <cong0_natty> its dead dood
[05:22] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Although that is a better way to check either way, you'r right.
[05:22] <cong0_natty> the bios loads your hardware
[05:22] <cong0_natty> if you dont have a bios you cant boot your computer
[05:22] <cong0_natty> its fucked.
[05:23] <cong0_natty> forgive me for the language
[05:23] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: that's incredibly unlucky
[05:23] <highneko> matjan: Create a script to execute conky after a few seconds?
[05:23] <DBO> cong0_natty, forgiven but please dont let it happen again =)
[05:23] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: maybe contact your mobo mfg for customer support, warranty support
[05:24] <redDEADresolve> its dell laptop got it this week
[05:24] <eternalswd> ArrenLex, that's what I have already.  And I just made sure that my username is in the cdrom group, so I'm stumped.
[05:24] <metalhedd> i've got a file i'm trying to delete but the name is really strange and i cant seem to delete it.
[05:24] <Daylighter> Oh shit
[05:24] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: could you please pastebin the output of "ls -l /media"?
[05:24] <cong0_natty> DBO, i cant promise anything but i wont take offence if you take action i got a bit of a cussin problamo ...
[05:24] <cong0_natty> i been workin on it
[05:24] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: or find someone who sells one, or someone with an chip reader who can flash it
[05:25] <matjan> highneko, ?? it should work using as i said, i am wondering why in my case it does not...
[05:25] <DBO> cong0_natty, ;-)
[05:25] <redDEADresolve> ok if i found someone with a chip reader i could reflash them
[05:25] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: then warranty support is in order
[05:25] <gnu2it2> what apt-get do i need to run to get alsa-conf installed ?
[05:25] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: no you are not going to take apart your new laptop to do that.
[05:25] <thevenin> did you try sudo apt-get install alsa-conf
[05:25] <highneko> matjan: It loads behind the wallpaper I think.
[05:25] <Jimbo> ok..i got the drive to be writable, but since i formated to ext3 there is a folder on the drive named "lost+found"  that is still unreadable or writable. Anyone know what this might be?
[05:26] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: this was an update provided by dell?
[05:26] <redDEADresolve> yup
[05:26] <ArrenLex> thevenin: the second box on packages.ubuntu.com can help you answer that.
[05:26] <cong0_natty> :finaly got epsxe wokin! woot now i can play ff7
[05:26] <Jimbo> The main drive appears to be writable now
[05:26] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: even if it wasn't i'd just lie and have them fix it
[05:26] <cong0_natty> gonna slap it up on my server later its only 2mb just toss it in /opt
[05:26] <Jordan_U> redDEADresolve: then no problem, thier falt + under warrenty = free fix.
[05:26] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: lost+found is where the system puts files which have been orphaned by the filesystem (i.e. their nodes have been deleted)
[05:26] <eternalswd> ArrenLex, http://pastebin.ca/249794
[05:27] <redDEADresolve> yeah i just didnt want to play to ship it back, got it and screwed it up in one day
[05:27] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: well, there you go, silly. dr--r--r--
[05:27] <Jimbo> Arrent..is there away to get rid of it...its uneccessary isnt it?
[05:27] <Jordan_U> redDEADresolve: But if you try to fix it yourself you will likely just void your warrenty instead, and be STUCK with a brick.
[05:27] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: silly question, but was it plugged in when you ran the update?
[05:27] <cong0_natty> redDEADresolve, im sorry about your bios man thats pretty crumby
[05:27] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: you need x permission to cd into a directory.
[05:27] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: and did you press any keys or do anything to it while it was running?
[05:28] <Jimbo> I thought since i formatted the drive it would be clean
[05:28] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: make it look like drwxr-xr-x
[05:28] <redDEADresolve> it was plugged in i wasnt doing anything
[05:28] <brett> Hey thanks guys that fixed it
[05:29] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: you may also be able to exchange it at the dealer you got it from
[05:29] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: I wouldn't remove it if I were you... you can delete the FILES in it if you don't need them, but I'm pretty sure your filesystem needs that space.
[05:29] <Jimbo> Arrent, I cant see the files
[05:29] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: usually within 15 or 30 days
[05:29] <Jimbo> but they take up about 10 gigs
[05:29] <redDEADresolve> its a dell ordered it through them, got a year coverage
[05:30] <redDEADresolve> ill send it in
[05:30] <redDEADresolve> learned my lesson
[05:30] <gnu2it2> what apt-get do i need to run to get alsaconf installed ?
[05:30] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: if you don't need them, delete them as root, I guess.
[05:30] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: you have a right to a full refund also
[05:30] <eternalswd> ArrenLex, many thanks.  It works now :)
[05:30] <Jordan_U> redDEADresolve: Complain and you may get some free stuff to boot :)
[05:30] <Jimbo> Arrent Im new to this os. how do I delete them as root?
[05:30] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: maybe consider getting a thinkpad instead
[05:30] <ArrenLex> gnu2it2: You don't. There is no alsaconf in the ubuntu repos.
[05:30] <Jimbo> How can I make them visible?
[05:31] <redDEADresolve> i just want my laptop to work.
[05:31] <Stephenishere> would a program like cedega be better at running starcraft than wine?
[05:31] <ArrenLex> gnu2it2: I've kept the script from the debian package; I have it at http://arrenlex.diff.be/alsaconf if you want.
[05:31] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: you're welcome! :)
[05:31] <Jimbo> the folder has a lock icon on it and when opened shows no files but there is about 10 gigs missing
[05:31] <teledyn_> redDEADresolve: there's a higher probability of that always being the case if its a thinkpad  :-)
[05:31] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: look as root.
[05:31] <redDEADresolve> thanks for your help im gonna call dell now
[05:32] <Jordan_U> redDEADresolve: I feel your pain, my comp is in for repair and I am stuck using a liveCD on my sisters machine till it's fixed :(
[05:32] <cong0_natty> i paid the cost to be the boss
[05:32] <aloon> hello
[05:32] <Jimbo> ArrentLex; this is the 4th day since i got my first look at linux. I dont know how to look as root.  how do I do that?
[05:32] <brett> I have a norton ghost image on my machine... is there any linux programs that will read it?
[05:32] <cong0_natty> look @ me ya know wut ya see, see a bad brotha.
[05:32] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: needless to say, if you have 10GB of files, you're not going to get much use out of that directory; the files in there have lost everything except their content. No structure, no name... thousands of random numbers attached to sizes is all you'll see if you look there.
[05:32] <teledyn_> Jordan_U: but the cool thing is, you can use a live cd.  image 10 or even 5 years ago.
[05:33] <Axidus> Hey everyone!
[05:33] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: I guess "sudo sh" and then "cd /lost+found"
[05:33] <Axidus> I have done a very bad thing
[05:33] <Jimbo> ok ill try that
[05:33] <Jimbo> thanx
[05:33] <Axidus> I have killed windows on my laptop and installed ubuntu
[05:33] <ArrenLex> Axidus: did you kill som... XD!
[05:33] <Jordan_U> teledyn_: Plus I have persistence working and Beryl installed .... but it's horrible I tell you!
[05:33] <aloon> has anyone here managed to author a DVD in ubuntu , with 4 or 5 different movies and menus??? copying a DVD is simple, converting avi's to dvd is easy, but making multi movie DVD's with clickable menus is very difficult... any help?
[05:34] <Axidus> lol
[05:34] <AfterDeath> Axidus: thats a GOOD thing :P
[05:34] <Axidus> yeah
[05:34] <ArrenLex> Axidus: why is this a bad thing?
[05:34] <gnu2it2> ArrenLex thanks
[05:34] <ArrenLex> gnu2it2: You're welcome.
[05:34] <Axidus> I dont have printer support for Dell AIO 962
[05:34] <teledyn_> Jordan_U: why would you run a resource-hogging window manager with limited resources?
[05:34] <eternalswd> strabes, it's good to see another Wheaton face in here
[05:34] <cong0_natty> aloon, you figure it out tell me too
[05:34] <cong0_natty> :))
[05:34] <Some_Person> Ubuntu rules!
[05:34] <Jordan_U> teledyn_: Because I can :)
[05:34] <Axidus> this sucks I seached everywhere for a driver
[05:34] <Axidus> searched!!
[05:35] <aloon> btw ive tried qdvdauthor, mandvd, kde dvd author wizard, varsha etc etc
[05:35] <Some_Person> Too bad my modem driver costs $15 (which I won't pay)
[05:35] <Axidus> but I can't put XP back on  cause I cleared the partitions
[05:35] <cong0_natty> ?
[05:35] <AfterDeath> Some_Person: get dsl!
[05:35] <AfterDeath> :P
[05:35] <EnsignRedshirt> Hello, worl.d
[05:35] <Axidus> and my cd drive is fried and I don't have a windows disk..!!
[05:35] <EnsignRedshirt> oops
[05:35] <Some_Person> dsl isnt allowed in my apartments
[05:35] <teledyn_> in the future all "machines" will just be virtual machines that can be cloned and moved from one hardware box to another.  all the hardare boxes will be just containers.
[05:35] <aloon> I'm going to write a book about the subject when I figure it out
[05:35] <cong0_natty> echo "hello user"
[05:39] <aloon> The easiest way ive found to author a DVD is to make the menu page in the gimp and then the buttons point to different movies, but the instructions are painfully complicated
[05:40] <Axidus> Does anyone know how I can print from Ubuntu with a Dell AIO 962 printer? Please it will let me keep Ubuntu and I really want to keep it on both desktop and laptop, I don't want to put XP on them again just to print I AM CALLING ON THE WHOLE UBUNTU COMMUNITY FOR THIS OUTCRY OF HELP!!!
[05:40] <Axidus> PLEASE HELP!!
[05:40] <Axidus> (now sounding like a Ubuntu craving maniac)
[05:40] <cong0_natty> wowo
[05:41] <Axidus> I have surfed far and wide and many of our fellow UBUNTU brothers are having this issue, I would love to find a solution for all of us!
[05:41] <cong0_natty> whats wrong with freenode!
[05:41] <Axidus> hello?
[05:41] <Axidus> ?
[05:41] <cong0_natty> :zaps freenode back to life

[05:42] <Axidus> what was that?
[05:42] <Axidus> I feel like I just GOT hit by a train!
[05:42] <Axidus> Hey
[05:42] <Axidus> everyone back?
[05:42] <Axidus> *shakes head*
[05:42] <Axidus> NO!!1
[05:42] <Axidus> where are we gona go!
[05:43] <cong0_natty> jebus.
[05:43] <cong0_natty> freenode switching servers probably
[05:43] <cong0_natty> maintainance
[05:43] <Axidus> ah
[05:43] <Axidus> hey
[05:43] <Axidus> did you get my question
[05:43] <cong0_natty> naw
[05:43] <Axidus> I have a Dell AIO 962 printer and I cant get it going in Ubuntu
[05:44] <Axidus> I don't want windows just to print
[05:44] <Axidus> WOW!!
[05:44] <cong0_natty> hmmm sounds like it could be a driver issue Axidus
[05:44] <Axidus> HELLO NURSE!!!
[05:44] <ArrenLex> Augh.
[05:44] <cong0_natty> try dmesg
[05:44] <Some_Person> i hate Conexant
[05:44] <cong0_natty> in your terminal
[05:44] <Axidus> yes it is but there is no support that I know about
[05:44] <cong0_natty> conexant dial up = crap on nix
[05:45] <cong0_natty> Axidus, then i you might be outta luck for a few months
[05:45] <cong0_natty> usualy they are pretty skippy on adding new hardware support to the kernel
[05:45] <Jimbo> Arrent..how would I create a root account?
[05:45] <Axidus> (currently installing Edgy on laptop) 6 minutes to go !! woohoo I cant wait to see this
[05:45] <cong0_natty> have you tryed updating your kernel?
[05:45] <Some_Person> conexant dial up = $15 on nix
[05:45] <Some_Person> i wont pay
[05:45] <Jimbo> Im just fulla questions arent I :)
[05:45] <Axidus> natty I hope so
[05:45] <cong0_natty> axidus try this /exec uname -a right here
[05:45] <Axidus> how?
[05:45] <Some_Person> oh man
[05:45] <Some_Person> the price is $20 now
[05:45] <cong0_natty> Axidus, its not the most eazy thing to do
[05:46] <Axidus> ?
[05:46] <cong0_natty> but the most direct way to fix hardware issues.
[05:46] <Some_Person> i wish there were a free alternative
[05:46] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: you don't really need to on ubuntu, because you can use sudo. It's considered safer for newbies because you have to go through the motions of typing "sudo" before every command, which gives you an extra half-second to think about what you're doing, before you pull a stunt like "rm -rf /" which would delete everything on your hard drive.
[05:46] <cong0_natty> Axidus, what kernel you using?
[05:46] <Some_Person> wait, edgy is released????????
[05:46] <ChocoCid> it's been out since 10/29
[05:46] <strabes> yeah
[05:46] <Axidus> how do I know
[05:46] <ArrenLex> Some_Person: Like a month ago, genius.
[05:46] <cong0_natty> uname -a in a terminal
[05:47] <Axidus> I did what you told me
[05:47] <cong0_natty> or here in irc
[05:47] <ChocoCid> uname -a
[05:47] <cong0_natty> you can use /exec uname -a
[05:47] <Some_Person> i had no idea
[05:47] <ArrenLex> Some_Person: did you miss this?
[05:47] <ArrenLex> (21:38:49) ArrenLex: Some_Person: Uh... that would be... edgy.
[05:47] <Some_Person> i feel like i just got Dapper up and running
[05:47] <Jimbo> Arrent...I got backups of every thing important on a windows machine or on cd
[05:47] <Axidus> Linux Phoenix 2.6.15-27-686 #1 smp preempt
[05:47] <Some_Person> now i have to format and get edgy... :(
[05:47] <Jimbo> For now im basically just using this machine to learn linux'
[05:47] <cong0_natty> ok the same one as me
[05:47] <cong0_natty> yea this kernel is old
[05:47] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: you don't really need to create a root account. When you want to run something as root, put "sudo" in front of it.
[05:47] <cong0_natty> like 3 versions behind now
[05:48] <Jimbo> k
[05:48] <brett> after wine installs a program where does it go?
[05:48] <cong0_natty> 2.6.18 is out
[05:48] <Some_Person> and wait a month for ubuntu to send me the cds
[05:48] <cong0_natty> kernel.org
[05:48] <torpedo|dog> Anybody in here use a Thinkpad?
[05:48] <Axidus> natty so what's an easy terminal way of doing it
[05:48] <cong0_natty> i dont have time to explain how to build a kernel on ubnutu
[05:48] <ArrenLex> brett: into ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/whatever
[05:48] <Some_Person> dangit dangit
[05:48] <cong0_natty> you might wanna look into some terminals
[05:48] <tonyyarusso> torpedo|dog: yes
[05:48] <cong0_natty> erm
[05:48] <cong0_natty> tutorials*
[05:48] <mr-russ> How long is it planned to have between LTS releases?
[05:49] <Axidus> will updating to edgy do it?
[05:49] <torpedo|dog> tonyyarusso: have you ever tried to set up hdaps?
[05:49] <Jimbo> Arrent...k..just use sudo
[05:49] <Some_Person> WTF???? NO MORE FREE SHIPIT????????????
[05:49] <Jimbo> It seems that sudo doesnt work all the time
[05:49] <cong0_natty> Axidus, theres no eazy way of installing a kernel... menuconfig or xconfig helps but its still something alot of newbies screw up
[05:49] <ArrenLex> Jimbo: it's just Arren. ArrenLex.
[05:49] <brett> thanks
[05:49] <tonyyarusso> torpedo|dog: I haven't used it for its intended purpose, but did use the theft protection script once.
[05:49] <torpedo|dog> ah
[05:49] <tonyyarusso> Some_Person: Only LTS releases
[05:49] <eternalswd> Axidus, edgy uses kernel version 2.6.17
[05:49] <bimberi> Some_Person: they're not shipping Edgy.  Dapper is still available
[05:49] <cong0_natty> you might wanna look for tutorials an exact how to with ubuntu dapper 6.06
[05:49] <Axidus> natty I'm only a few months old
[05:49] <Jimbo> ArrenLex...did I do another typo
[05:49] <EnsignRedshirt> Can anyone tell me why putting the flashplayer 9 libflashplayer.so file into /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins does not work in firefox 1.5 in breezy?
[05:49] <torpedo|dog> tonyyarusso: whenever I start anything related to hdaps, I get a "file not found" error.
[05:49] <cong0_natty> you need qt-devel and some other crap
[05:49] <cong0_natty> dialog xdialog
[05:50] <Jimbo> i kin spel...jist caint tipe tu gude
[05:50] <cong0_natty> uhh build-essential
[05:50] <Some_Person> DANGIT, i'm stuck with dapper then
[05:50] <Axidus> eternalswd so edgy is also behind ?
[05:50] <ameyer> isn't breezy no longer supported?
[05:50] <EnsignRedshirt> Jimbo: I thnk u ment "gud"
[05:50] <Jordan_U>  EnsignRedshirt probably a dependency issue
[05:50] <tonyyarusso> torpedo|dog: Huh.  Following the ThinkWiki instructions I assume?
[05:50] <cong0_natty> well im goin to make food
[05:50] <ArrenLex> EnsignRedshirt: does about:config mention anything about Flash?
[05:50] <eternalswd> Axidus, it takes a while for a kernel release to make it to the repository.
[05:50] <tonyyarusso> ameyer: Breezy is still supported
[05:51] <jbinder> hi
[05:51] <jbinder> anyone need help?
[05:51] <Jimbo> no  the correct speling is gude
[05:51] <luminousnerd> !tell luminousnerd about beryl
[05:51] <Jimbo> or good
[05:51] <Axidus> eternalswd so what does a kernel have to do with hardware printer support?
[05:51] <Jimbo> one of the two
[05:51] <Some_Person> dangit dangit
[05:51] <Jimbo> i better go to sleep
[05:51] <torpedo|dog> tonyyarusso: didn't even think about ThinkWiki, but I do have it bookmarked...
[05:51] <Some_Person> ubuntu needs to provide free shipit again
[05:51] <jbinder> Some_Person: yeah
[05:51] <EnsignRedshirt> ArrenLex: checking...
[05:51] <Jimbo> thanx Arrent and all
[05:51] <bimberi> Some_Person: it does, just not edgy
[05:51] <jbinder> Some_Person: ITS NOT FAIR!!
[05:51] <ArrenLex> It's Arren. xD
[05:52] <Jimbo> i mean ArrenLex
[05:52] <jbinder> bimberi: yeah... but we want edgy
[05:52] <Healot> Some_Person: they do, but not with non-LTS releases
[05:52] <Jimbo> sorry
[05:52] <ArrenLex> Some_Person: you begrudge Ubuntu even a lowly CD-R?
[05:52] <Jimbo> good night
[05:52] <Some_Person> i have dialup
[05:52] <ArrenLex> ...
[05:52] <Healot> it's really fair since they are releasing them for free :-
[05:52] <Axidus> (3 minutes until I have EDGY ON MY LAPTOP)
[05:52] <Some_Person> i'm not downloading ubuntu on dialup
[05:52] <cong0_natty> :is also rockin dial up
[05:52] <ArrenLex> What third-world country do YOU live in?
[05:52] <eternalswd> Axidus, as driver support is added or updated, they update with the kernel, probably labeled as kernel modules in synaptic.
[05:52] <Axidus> hey who has edgy?
[05:52] <cong0_natty> canada
[05:52] <cong0_natty> :))
[05:52] <Some_Person> its not fair
[05:52] <ArrenLex> I have edgy.
[05:52] <bimberi> Some_Person, jbinder: Edgy CD's are being distributed to Ubuntu Local Community Teams - perhaps contact them
[05:52] <eternalswd> I have edgy
[05:52] <Axidus> is it all is seems to be?
[05:52] <EnsignRedshirt> ArrenLex: The word "flash" does not appear in about:config
[05:53] <Axidus> is it better?
[05:53] <mr-russ> How long is it planned to have between LTS releases?
[05:53] <Axidus> than dapper
[05:53] <bimberi> a bit
[05:53] <cong0_natty> i have edgy too but im not using it for another 2 months
=== Carry_ is now known as Carry
[05:53] <Some_Person> breezy was shipited
[05:53] <cong0_natty> dapper is still in its prime
[05:53] <ArrenLex> EnsignRedshirt: is there some reason you don't want to put it into ~/.mozilla/plugins, which you know will work?
[05:53] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt have you tried copying it to ~/.mozilla/plugins instead?
[05:53] <EnsignRedshirt> ArrenLex: I think I tried that once, but I'll try again...
[05:53] <Axidus> I wish my printer was supported this sucks I have to put windows on one of our machines
[05:53] <Axidus> DAMMIT!!!
[05:53] <torpedo|dog> tonyyarusso: is the autoparking performed within HDD firmware, or in BIOS, or in the OS?
[05:54] <Some_Person> does edgy have breezy or dapper's installer?
[05:54] <jbinder> Some_Person: no
[05:54] <Some_Person> i have a friend with dsl
[05:54] <Axidus> you guys have no idea how much I'm going to hate to do that
[05:54] <torpedo|dog> oh..it doesn't
[05:54] <tonyyarusso> torpedo|dog: I _think_ OS, but don't really know.
[05:54] <ArrenLex> Axidus: it's not Linux' fault. Make hardware manufacturers release specs, or at least drivers. It's hard to make a brick sing.
[05:54] <Some_Person> no installer? thats impossible
[05:54] <torpedo|dog> tonyyarusso: thinkwiki says OS
[05:54] <tonyyarusso> 'k
[05:54] <mr-russ> Axidus: buy another printer, or a print server.
[05:54] <Axidus> I know ArrenLex I know
[05:54] <Some_Person> does edgy have breezy or dapper's installer?
[05:54] <eternalswd> Axidus, maybe set it up as a network printer and run windows on a virtual machine?
[05:54] <Axidus> it's my girl's printer
[05:54] <ChocoCid> it's more like dapper's
[05:54] <Jordan_U> Some_Person: Dapper's
[05:54] <ChocoCid> not sure if it's the exact same
[05:55] <Some_Person> i hate dapper's
[05:55] <Some_Person> it doesnt ask, it just puts GRUB in the MBR
[05:55] <Axidus> (2 minutes)
[05:55] <Jordan_U> Some_Person: You can still use the breezy/debian stile alternate CD
[05:55] <bimberi> Some_Person: both, Desktop ISO has the GUI installer and Alternate ISO has the text installer
[05:55] <Flannel> Some_Person: It has both,
[05:55] <Some_Person> no shipits for alt. cds
[05:55] <Flannel> Some_Person: correct
[05:55] <bimberi> nope
[05:55] <Flannel> Some_Person: actually, no ShipIt for edgy
[05:56] <jbinder> yeah
[05:56] <jbinder> well there is shipit for money
[05:56] <Axidus> I have come to be adicted to UBUNTU, seeing windows makes me think back on those days where I sat and waited...and waited.......and waited.....and watied
[05:56] <mr-russ> I assume nobody has any idea about the question I asked.
[05:56] <eternalswd> Axidus, 2 minutes until it finishes downloading or installing?  It took my computer about half an hour to actually install.
[05:56] <ArrenLex> Axidus: this is some random thing I found on Google. I have no idea if it'll help you any: http://www.linux.ie/lists/pipermail/ilug/2006-January/085541.html
[05:56] <Some_Person> ubuntu (company, not distro) became supercrap when dapper came out
[05:56] <bimberi> mr-russ: No. I've been looking out for an answer to it too :)
[05:56] <Axidus> eternalswd, installing
[05:56] <ArrenLex> mr-russ: what question is this?
[05:56] <Jordan_U> Axidus: What model printer?
[05:56] <Flannel> mr-russ: It's not a set length.  ~2 years, let me find the link
[05:56] <TSCHAK> can ubuntu do Mt. Rainier formatted DVDRW?????
[05:57] <vini> helo! how to install jre-java in mozilla-firefox?
[05:57] <Some_Person> the distro is good and easy, but has crappy installer as of dapper
[05:57] <ArrenLex> The better question is: can ubuntu do YO'MOMMA????
[05:57] <Jordan_U> !java | vini
[05:57] <Ubotwo> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[05:57] <ArrenLex> ...sorry.
[05:57] <jbinder> vini: i can help
[05:57] <EnsignRedshirt> ArrenLex, eternalswd: Putting libflashplater.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins also does not work.
[05:57] <Axidus> Jardan_U Dell AIO 962
[05:57] <jbinder> vini: do you have the install file?
[05:57] <vini> yes

[05:57] <jbinder> vini: lets move to a PM
[05:57] <bimberi> mr-russ: thanks
[05:58] <luminousnerd> How do you give root a password again?
[05:58] <jbinder> vini: look in the private message
[05:58] <lastnode> luminousnerd, it's not recommended
[05:58] <ArrenLex> lumoniousnerd: sudo passwd root
[05:58] <luminousnerd> Why not lastnode
[05:58] <lastnode> luminousnerd, ubuntu uses sudo for a reason
[05:58] <Axidus> (ladies and gentlemen 1 minute and counting)
[05:58] <luminousnerd> lastnode: what is that reason?
[05:58] <mr-russ> why do people insist on setting a root pasword?
[05:58] <jbinder> vini: are you here? do you still need help?
[05:58] <ArrenLex> lumoniousnerd: security reasons. Typing "sudo" gives you an extra half-second to think before you pull something like "rm -rf /"
[05:58] <lastnode> !sudo
[05:58] <Ubotwo> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:59] <luminousnerd> I'm not THAT high...
[05:59] <lastnode> luminousnerd, have a look at that link
[05:59] <cong0_natty> get rid of sudo by using sudo passwd
[05:59] <vini> yes...i am here
[05:59] <cong0_natty> su = much better
[05:59] <mr-russ> luminousnerd: what do you need root password?
[05:59] <Axidus> (drum roll please! *drumro!!* )
[05:59] <ArrenLex> luminousnerd: I know, but remember, Linux is a newbie-oriented distribution. I guess it also prevents them from running as root.
[05:59] <EnsignRedshirt> mr-russ: History.  Many linux and unix books and reference manuals use root.
[05:59] <vini> what i do?
[05:59] <jbinder> vini: do you know how to look into the PM?
[05:59] <mr-russ> what's wrong with "sudo -s"
[05:59] <jbinder> no
[05:59] <eternalswd> Axidus, try using the driver for the compatible lexmark.  http://downloads.lexmark.com/cgi-perl/downloads.cgi?ccs=229:1:0:463:0:0&searchLang=en&os_group=Redhat&target=
[05:59] <vini> what is "PM"?
[05:59] <Axidus> (Damn the anticipation of EDgy!!!
[05:59] <cong0_natty> -s
[05:59] <jbinder> vini: private message
[05:59] <ArrenLex> vini: apt-get install sun-java5-plugin
[05:59] <luminousnerd> Hehe, well okay not a bad idea for newbies I suppose, but is there any reason why not to for myself (used to Slackware)
[05:59] <jedi__> allo allo.I installed skype on edgy but ppl cant hear me tho i hear them crystal clear - what's with that?
[06:00] <jbinder> vini: are you using irssi?
[06:00] <lastnode> ok, sudo vs root discussion in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[06:00] <ArrenLex> Axidus: don't be too excited... Edgy is very rough around the edges... I've had lots of problems with it.
[06:00] <jbinder> root is for smart people
[06:00] <jbinder> sudo is for noobs
[06:00] <jbinder> case closed
[06:00] <cong0_natty> lol lastnode :))
[06:00] <lastnode> jbinder, enough of that please :-)
[06:00] <Axidus> thanks eternalswd I'll look into it
[06:00] <ArrenLex> Axidus: I had to downgrade like half my packages to dapper for my system to be useable.
[06:00] <jbinder> lastnode: lol
[06:00] <Axidus> Areen: like what?
[06:00] <jbinder> vini: do you speak english?
[06:00] <Axidus> ArrenLex: sorry ...like what
[06:00] <jedi__> allo allo.I installed skype on edgy but ppl cant hear me tho i hear them crystal clear - what's with that?
[06:01] <Jordan_U> jbinder: I swing both ways , sometimes su , sometimes sudo.
[06:01] <jbinder> same
[06:01] <jbinder> sudo for one command
[06:01] <Axidus> ArrenLex: how long ego?
[06:01] <ArrenLex> Axidus: like openoffice.org not compiled with bci libfreetype, so fonts look like crap unless they're antialiased, and I hate blurry fonts.
[06:01] <jbinder> su for a big block of commands
[06:01] <vini> no i dont...but i undestand
[06:01] <ArrenLex> Axidus: like KDE 3.5.5 being absurdly slow for some reason.
[06:01] <Jordan_U> jbinder: There is always sudo -s though
[06:01] <jbinder> yeah
[06:01] <jbinder> vini: ok
[06:01] <Axidus> KDE...
[06:01] <ArrenLex> KDE owns you.
[06:01] <Axidus> ArrenLex: on ubuntu?
[06:01] <jedi__> allo allo.I installed skype on edgy but ppl cant hear me tho i hear them crystal clear - what's with that?
[06:01] <ArrenLex> On kubuntu.
[06:02] <ArrenLex> jedi: your microphone is not set up.
[06:02] <jedi__> alsamixer says it is
[06:02] <Axidus> ArrenLex: I'm on Ubuntu...
[06:02] <bimberi> jedi__: check your mixer settings for a muted microphone
[06:02] <ArrenLex> Axidus: I know. And?
[06:02] <jbinder> vini: what the fuck
[06:02] <ArrenLex> Axidus: it is still a problem with an ubuntu package.
[06:02] <eternalswd> ArrenLex, I haven't had any problems upgrading to edgy.  I haven't had to downgrade anything :)  Actually, I was able to get my ati x300 working with the open source drivers, so I am very happy.
[06:02] <ArrenLex> !language
[06:02] <Ubotwo> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[06:02] <jedi__> bimberi, alsamixer says my volume is up
[06:02] <jbinder> i was helping vini, and he quit
[06:03] <jbinder> OH!!
[06:03] <ArrenLex> eternalswd: yes!! I finally have a working 3D card. That's the only reason I haven't downgraded yet.
[06:03] <jbinder> he speaks spanish
[06:03] <EnsignRedshirt> Has anyone used flashplayer 9 with firefox 1.5 in breezy?
[06:03] <jbinder> thats why he couldnt understand me
[06:03] <jbinder> LOL
[06:03] <ArrenLex> God bless fancy screensavers.
[06:03] <bimberi> jedi__: k
[06:03] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: beta?
[06:03] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: yes.
[06:03] <jbinder> it is simple
[06:03] <Axidus> ArrenLex: yeah well I'm already upset that I can't get my printer to work on this Ubuntu and then I have to put WINDOWS back!! geesh. and now you are killing my hopes on having a smile on my face for edgy...not good bro!
[06:03] <Flannel> luminousnerd: the rootsudo page explains the benefits
[06:03] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: do you have the install file for it now?
[06:03] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: yes.
[06:04] <jbinder> ok
[06:04] <jbinder> what file type is it again?
[06:04] <ArrenLex> Axidus: if you have a standard install, you won't have problems. It's only if you tweak your system that you'll get issues, which IMHO completely defeats the very purpose of Linux.
[06:04] <jbinder> i don't remember
[06:04] <jbinder> i did it too long ago
[06:04] <ArrenLex> Axidus: I'm going back to Debian when I get time to install the OS.
[06:04] <Axidus> IMHO?
[06:04] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: The plugin is libflashplayer.so
[06:04] <ArrenLex> In my humble opinion.
[06:04] <jedi__> is there a skype irc channel?
[06:04] <Axidus> ArrenLex: I would always suggest whatever makes you happy
[06:04] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: ah.. so you already extracted, etc
[06:05] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: Yup.
[06:05] <Jordan_U> Axidus: Get a linux compatable printer next time you need a new cartridge, there is a good chance a new printer with ink will cost less than the refill.
[06:05] <ArrenLex> Axidus: debian makes me happy. :)
[06:05] <Axidus> EVERYONE have you seen BILL GATES SUPPORT UBUNTU?
[06:05] <ChocoCid> ...wtf?

[06:09] <Jordan_U> When I try to start xmoto I get: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[06:09] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: you can ignore that. It's mostly a cosmetic error. The opensource driver is not very complete yet.
[06:10] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: I can't ignore it when xmoto won't start.
[06:10] <ChocoCid> ...oof
[06:10] <ChocoCid> i get that message, but xmoto starts
[06:10] <Wiz> thanks bimberi
[06:10] <bimberi> Wiz: yw :)
[06:10] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: OK, I copied the .so file to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins and /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins.
[06:10] <ArrenLex> Jordan: that shouldn't prevent xmoto from starting.
[06:11] <Jordan_U> ChocoCid: Maybe the message is unrelated to the crash then?
[06:11] <ArrenLex> EnsignRedshirt: sorry, just an aside... can you paste the output of `which firefox`?
[06:11] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: ok
[06:11] <ChocoCid> yeah most likely
[06:11] <ChocoCid> i have to go to sleep so i can't help you, sorry :(
[06:11] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: ...and to ~/.mozilla/plugins
[06:11] <jbinder> yeah
[06:11] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: yes
[06:11] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: now, killall firefox-bin
[06:11] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: 'which firefox' shows '/usr/lib/firefox'
[06:11] <Homer> !fiesty
[06:11] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[06:12] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: what?
[06:12] <Wiz> There is a way to remove the hda icon from the desktop on ubuntu without unmounting the device?
[06:12] <lastnode> Homer, it's fEIsty
[06:12] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: paste the output
[06:12] <Jordan_U> Homer: Ubotwo is sort of an ad-hoc replacement right now.
[06:12] <Vaske_Car> What is the Linux standard for FTP client? Which one to install?
[06:12] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: confirmed that xmoto starts for me despite the error message. Something else is wrong with your system.
[06:12] <Healot> it's "ftp"- > Vaske_Car
[06:13] <Vaske_Car> tx
[06:13] <Axidus> Does anyone here have a Dell AIO 962 printer setup for Ubuntu I can't seem to find a way to do it
[06:13] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder:  oops. That should have been: /usr/bin/firefox
[06:13] <Axidus> I can't find drivers that work for it either
[06:13] <Spawn311> man the annoying flash crashing in firefox under egty edge is annoying
[06:13] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: oh?
[06:13] <ArrenLex> Ensign: you installed from the ubuntu package, or from the mozilla site?
[06:13] <Hmmmm> hi guys, im facing osme problem with the time in edgy. everytime i set that time to the correct one it seems to change on its own
[06:13] <bimberi> Vaske_Car: You can use Nautilus (the Gnome File manager) as a FTP client via Places -> Connect to Server...
[06:13] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: yeah, right
[06:13] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: I missed the second, *fatal* error when I pasted: fatal exception : invalid or missing texture file (Textures/UI/Loading.png)
[06:14] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Those damned sneaky fatal errors. Always killing things and then hiding. =P
[06:14] <Axidus> (restarting my system and uploading ubuntu edgy for the first time)
[06:14] <EnsignRedshirt> ArrenLex: I have firefox installed from Ubuntu (breezy)
[06:14] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: I was wondering how you had xmoto running fine despite being warned of a fatal error ;)
[06:15] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, have you tried removing ~/.mozilla/firefox/pluginreg.dat
[06:15] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: hi
[06:15] <Vaske_Car> Healot, does "FTP" have GUI? If so how to start it?
[06:15] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: ok... did you copy it all, and then do killall firefox-bin?
[06:15] <ArrenLex> Vaske_Car: No. Typically, things in Linux do not have a GUI unless designed that way (read: have a g or k in their name)
[06:15] <eternalswd> Vaske_Car, you might want gftp
[06:15] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: yup.  There were no firefox-bin processes running.
[06:15] <ArrenLex> See?
[06:15] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: ah... k
[06:15] <Jordan_U> EnsignRedshirt: Just a suggestion, don't go on any away missions or use more bleach :)
[06:15] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: now open firefox
[06:15] <Flannel> Vaske_Car: nautilus can be used as FTP, go to Places > Connect to Server
[06:16] <ClayG> anyone here use GPS with their notebok?
[06:16] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: open firefox
[06:16] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: then type about:plugins
[06:16] <Wiz> There is a way to remove the hda icon from the desktop on ubuntu without unmounting the device?
[06:16] <jbinder> in the address bar
[06:16] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: no http://, just type about:plugins, and hit enter
[06:16] <Vaske_Car> ok
[06:16] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: somewhere in that list do you see "Shockwave Flash" in large bold letters?
[06:17] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: There is nothing in there about flash.
[06:17] <jbinder> are you sure?
[06:17] <eternalswd> Wiz, yes but I don't remember how.  Let me see if I can find the setting.
[06:17] <Jordan_U> EnsignRedshirt: Try the .deb installer for flash9
[06:17] <bimberi> !icons
[06:17] <Ubotwo> Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[06:17] <Jordan_U> !flash9
[06:17] <Ubotwo> Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[06:18] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: did you copy it to /usr/lib/firefox, or /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[06:18] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: did you do the plugins part?
[06:18] <bimberi> !tell Wiz about icons
[06:18] <Master_Frag> i need help installing wine. i have tryed to do it useing synaptic.but synaptic freezes. Apt-get does nothing and useing the .DEB files GDebi says that its missing libartsc0
[06:18] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: you might have to chmod 7777 the files
[06:18] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: There is no directory called /usr/lib/firefox
[06:18] <jbinder> yeah i know
[06:18] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: you might have to chmod 7777 the files
[06:18] <jbinder> do you know how to do that?
[06:18] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder. Yup
[06:18] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: clarify "apt-get does nothing"
[06:18] <jbinder> every instance of libflashplayer.so, chmod a+x it, and chmod 7777 it
[06:19] <jbinder> both
[06:19] <jbinder> i forgot which one is required
[06:19] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: I think you mean 777 ?
[06:19] <jbinder> so both will cover it
[06:19] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: 7777 works too
[06:19] <Master_Frag> ok  Apt-get retreves no results
[06:19] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, try mv ~/.mozilla/firefox/pluginreg.dat ~/.mozilla/firefox/pluginreg.old
[06:19] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: 777 is fine in this case
[06:19] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: I'll try that in a sec...
[06:19] <jbinder> eternalswd: i didn't have to do that
[06:19] <jbinder> but it could work
[06:20] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: You need to add the universe repository ( or wines repo, or both )
[06:20] <Master_Frag> tryed
[06:20] <Rossimo> where would the best place be to stick a script i need to run immediately after the daemons start?
[06:20] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: And you did an apt-get update?
[06:20] <Master_Frag> synaptic freezes when i insert the repository
[06:20] <Master_Frag> also tryed that
[06:21] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: Stick it in your sources.list manually.
[06:22] <Master_Frag> and i dont like manually editing lists and the such
[06:22] <Master_Frag> just started useing linux a week ago
[06:22] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: Still no flash luv.  I'll try eternalswd's suggestion.
[06:23] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: It really isn't that hard, if you pastebin your sources.list I can add it for you.
[06:23] <bimberi> Rossimo: /etc/rc.local
[06:23] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: ok
[06:23] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: That didn't work either.
[06:23] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: wtf
[06:23] <jbinder> i had no problem on my system at all
[06:23] <Master_Frag> how do i access it
[06:23] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: "wtf" I agree :)
[06:24] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, did you have flash 7 working at any point?
[06:24] <Rossimo> bimberi: does that run as root?
[06:24] <murali> hi to all
[06:24] <bimberi> Rossimo: yes
[06:24] <Rossimo> bimberi: thanks
[06:24] <jbinder> eternalswd: gtg
[06:24] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:24] <jbinder> EnsignRedshirt: gtg
[06:24] <jbinder> bye
[06:25] <bimberi> Rossimo: yw :)
[06:25] <EnsignRedshirt> jbinder: OK, thanks for trying...
[06:26] <Master_Frag> ok what do i do from here
[06:26] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: You only need to paste a line in at the end of the file, if you are on Edgy just add: deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt edgy main
[06:26] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, does it work in mozilla?
[06:26] <Master_Frag> im on dapper
[06:26] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main
[06:27] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: I haven't tried.  I'm going to back up for a moment and install a flash player from the ubuntu repository, so I know what *does* work.
[06:27] <Master_Frag> what now
[06:28] <noiesmo> hey all looking for an application to track a users movements on system for both keystrokes and websites etc
[06:28] <Geoffrey2> what's a good program for converting .wmv files into another format?
[06:28] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: Now just save the file, reload in synaptic and you'r done :)
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[06:28] <pluma> Is anybody else having problems trying to connect to ICQ or AIM via Kopete?
[06:28] <noiesmo> Geoffrey2, menecoder part of mplayer can do that also transcode
[06:30] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Do you know where the "invalid or missing texture file (Textures/UI/Loading.png)" would actually be?
[06:30] <Geoffrey2> what are the free formats other than Theora?
[06:30] <eternalswd> Geoffrey2, xvid?
[06:30] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: Xvid ( although there are some legal issues )
[06:31] <pluma> Legal issues as in DMCA or real legal issues?
[06:31] <Master_Frag> ok thx thats fixed
[06:32] <Jordan_U> pluma: Legal issues with vague patents, nothing to worry about.
[06:32] <murali> my gaim messenger is not connecting with yahoo? pls tell me how to fix it
[06:32] <pluma> Jordan_U: Ah, the joy of software patents.
[06:32] <Master_Frag> another thing how do i get DivX compatability for totem
[06:32] <pluma> My Kopete messenger is raping ICQ and AIM. How to fix THAT?
[06:33] <eternalswd> murali, is gaim connecting with anything else?
[06:33] <Ecko2056> arg, can anyone help me? im trying to remove the fbgetty package that i installed and i get errors.. the fbgetty command isnt even available anymore..
[06:33] <Ecko2056> dpkg: error processing fbgetty (--remove):
[06:33] <Ecko2056>  subprocess post-removal script returned error exit status 1
[06:33] <charlie5> howdy folks ... is there an applet which lets you plug in an ip address and shows where in the wold it is ?
[06:33] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Strange.  I installed flashplayer-mozilla (which is flash 7), and mozilla-browser. This worked.  But when I try a flash site with firefox, I don't get the "Additional plugins are needed..." message, but the flash application never starts.
[06:34] <pluma> The proprietary protocols seem to be a bit messy anyway. Kopete has a tendency to randomly lose connection to Yahoo. The Jabber connections are a bit flaky as well, tho.
[06:34] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: hmmm... did that make sense?
=== HodgePodge is now known as Nchalada
[06:34] <eternalswd> Master_Frag, are you using totem-gstreamer or totem-xine?
[06:34] <Ecko2056> nevermind, deleted /var/lib/dpkg/info/fbgetty.* and it removed just fine.. sorry
[06:34] <pluma> Oh, and is there a way to install Flash for Firefox on a 64bit Linux? Adobe won't release a compatible plugin.
[06:35] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Do you know where the "invalid or missing texture file (Textures/UI/Loading.png)" would actually be?
[06:35] <Master_Frag> gstreamer
[06:35] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, hmm, could that page need flash 9 but not have detection for it?  Try going to http://www.homestarrunner.com and see if it loads.  That definitely works on flash 7
[06:35] <eternalswd> Master_Frag, you need to install gstreamer codecs
[06:36] <Master_Frag> how
[06:36] <cliffd> can someone tell me why "sudo apt-get install openssh-server" says media change: please insert the disk labeled edgy eft into /cdrom ?
[06:36] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: In firefox, I get a quick flicker of something rectangular, and then a blank black screen.
[06:36] <murali> eternal : yes
[06:37] <murali> except yahoo
[06:37] <eternalswd> Master_Frag from the repository, gstreamer-plugins-base, gstreamer-plugins-good, gstreamer-plugins-bad, gstreamer-plugins-ugly
[06:37] <bimberi> cliffd: because the latest version is still the one on the install CD and it will prefer to get it from there unless you remove the CD from your apt sources.
[06:37] <eternalswd> Master_Frag, you need multiverse and universe enabled.
[06:37] <maxxism> good evening folks
[06:37] <cliffd> bimberi: thanks much!
[06:38] <murali> externalswd: yes it is connectiong with other
[06:38] <bimberi> cliffd: yw :)
[06:38] <eternalswd> murali, not sure what to tell you then
[06:38] <murali> ids
[06:38] <Geoffrey2> noiesmo, menecoder needs to be run from the command line, I presume?
[06:38] <eternalswd> Geoffrey2, yes it is cli
[06:38] <foo> Hm, I'm looking for libauthen-pam-perl. I don't see it in the source.. I have multiverse.. any ideas?
[06:38] <cliffd> also, can I mirror my /boot part after install? not a big deal right?
[06:38] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: That homestarrunnner page works in mozilla-browser, but not in firefox.
[06:39] <gogeta> annoying
[06:39] <murali> not only the gaim. the attym is also not able to connect with yahoo
[06:39] <gogeta> my windows box has one of those lame ass virses

[06:39] <Jordan_U> !fuse
[06:40] <Ubotwo> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[06:40] <gogeta> tryed that
[06:40] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, hrrm do you have any extensions installed that might interfere? adblock, noscript, etc?
[06:40] <Jordan_U> !ntfs
[06:40] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: For what it's worth, checking about:plugins in firefox does show that Shockwave Flash is enabled (version 7.0 r25)
[06:40] <Ubotwo> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[06:40] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Yes, adblock is installed.
[06:40] <SperMite> Is there a way where i can view files videos etc. off my linux box on my windows machine
[06:40] <gogeta> i did the guide
[06:40] <gogeta> tryed with fuse
[06:40] <maxxism> quick question regarding linux sources.   I am running dapper.  I am trying to install Parallels.  it wants the linux sources packages installed.  I swear I have them installed. synaptic says that linux-source is installed.  but parallels cant see them.   any ideas?????
[06:40] <gogeta> read only

[06:41] <jedi__> ok, manages to sus out the sound in skype...now why do i have to re-enter my account each time I start it? I thought it kept the config....
[06:41] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, try disabling adblock and restart firefox
[06:41] <Jordan_U> gogeta: Is there an error when you run the mount command?
[06:41] <gogeta> i need to get wirhg to delete 1 stupid infected file
[06:41] <gogeta> nope
[06:41] <Tomcat_> maxxism: You need "linux-source-<version>", do you have that?
[06:41] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Aha!
[06:41] <Jordan_U> gogeta: Bart PE?
[06:41] <cliffd> anyone know if when you install and mirror the /boot part if it will install grub in each boot device?
[06:42] <maxxism> Tomcat_ it says I have both linux-source  and linux-source-2.6.15
[06:42] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Flash is working again.
[06:42] <jedi__> how come skype dosent keep my account info, i have to re-enter it each time??
[06:42] <Tomcat_> maxxism: Weird. o_O
[06:42] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: ...after I removed adblock.
[06:42] <Tomcat_> maxxism: In that case, Parallels wants the sources in another directory I guess.
[06:42] <maxxism> Tomcat_ I even tried to reinstall them
[06:42] <Jordan_U> EnsignRedshirt: ;)
[06:42] <gogeta> nv
[06:42] <gogeta> i see the problem
[06:42] <effie_jayx> does anyone know how to instal the smoke effect in beryl???
[06:42] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, re-enable adblock and see if there is a preference related to OBJ_TABS
[06:42] <gogeta> its showing as unclean
[06:42] <maxxism> Tomcat_  hmmm.
[06:43] <jedi__> how come skype dosent keep my account info, i have to re-enter it each time??
[06:43] <Jordan_U> effie_jayx: #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl maybe , if you figure it out tell me :)
[06:43] <Tomcat_> maxxism: The package installs into /usr/src/linux
[06:43] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, it should be disabled.
[06:43] <Tomcat_> maxxism: Maybe you need it somewhere else.
[06:43] <effie_jayx> ok
[06:44] <jedi__> how come skype dosent keep my account info, i have to re-enter it each time??
[06:44] <maxxism> Tomcat_ can I simply copy it somewhere else?
[06:44] <Tomcat_> maxxism: Yeah.
[06:44] <effie_jayx> Jordan_U, I will try that

[06:44] <effie_jayx> rpg cool to see some ligth at the end of the tunnel
[06:45] <maxxism> Tomcar_ : i think it created a log.  maybe I can see where it was looking for it there.  thanx

[06:46] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, you can get adblocking through css styles instead if you install the Stylish extension and use the userstyle at http://userstyles.org/style/show/299
[06:46] <rpg> nope my machine is old just the RAM is setup up high at 640MB
[06:46] <Jordan_U> Master_Frag: Try vlc , it'll play anything
[06:46] <effie_jayx> how does one check ram on ubuntu?
[06:46] <effie_jayx> on linux... terminal??
[06:47] <cliffd> effie_jayx: top maybe?
[06:47] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, it should use less memory as well
[06:47] <rpg> mmm... yeah maybe through terminal
[06:47] <Master_Frag> i know about vlc used it on windows fo a wile to play dvds  but it gets to laggy
[06:48] <effie_jayx> incredible...
[06:48] <Jordan_U> effie_jayx: You can add the system monitor applet to your gnome panel, or just run System -> Administration -> System Monitor
[06:48] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: I installed adblock quite a while ago... now it tells me that "Software installation is disabled.  Click Edit Options... to enable it and try again."
[06:48] <effie_jayx> beryl is runnig smoothly on 222 megs
[06:48] <effie_jayx> Jordan_U, thanx bro
[06:48] <eternalswd> effie_jayx what part of ram do you want to check? total amount, current usage?
[06:48] <rpg> bye guys, i was just testing
[06:48] <elknof1_> hi everybody,  does anyone knows how to boot from a usb port on a biostar m6vlq motherboard?

[06:48] <effie_jayx> rpg cheers i meant to say
[06:49] <cliffd> elknof1_: is it in option in the boot sequence list?
[06:49] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Would that mean Edit Preferences?  I can't find "Edit Options..."
[06:49] <Jordan_U> effie_jayx: Kind of makes you wonder what "Aero" uses all that RAM for doesn't it :)
[06:49] <effie_jayx> current usage
[06:49] <elknof1_> cliffd: at least not showed as USB...
[06:49] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, yes most likely
[06:49] <effie_jayx> I am not worried about those who must not be named...
[06:49] <cliffd> elknof1_: what options do you have? is there a "removable media" options?
[06:49] <effie_jayx> ajjajajajaj

[06:52] <Ubotwo> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[06:52] <xSUSHi> bimberi : um .. do i look into a package called "icons" ??
[06:52] <elknof1_> cliffd: floppy, ls120, hdd-0, scsi, cdrom, hdd-1, hdd2, hdd3, zip100, lan and disabled are the options
[06:52] <picochu> bimberi: okay what do i need to install to get that?
[06:52] <bimberi> xSUSHi: no, read the posts from Ubotwo
[06:52] <igcek> hello, when i start computer with xgl (ati, gnome) my keyboard is changed to us... how to fix this?
[06:52] <jedi__> why do i have to sign in to skype each time i use it? i have to re-enert my user/pass each time - how do i save it or avoid this??
[06:52] <xSUSHi> bimberi: NEVERMIND!!   i just read what the bot said!! =]  lawl thanks a lot
[06:52] <cliffd> elknof1_: I would say no booting from usb
[06:52] <Xorlev> Edgy definitely messed up RAID.

[06:53] <glitch-> .
[06:53] <morten> i'm trying to set up hibernation (via suspend2). however, i get a message saying that no suitable suspend methods have been found. i googled for this (using various fragments of the error message), but got absolutely nothing (no joke. one hit, which seems to be part of the default config). have i fucked something up, or is there some step i've missed?
[06:53] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Argh. The button just brings me to a Preferences window, and there is nothing there (that I see) about enabling software installation.
[06:54] <jmg> hi all
[06:54] <Kaiyang> hi people. I currently need help for a current running installation pls follow along and help me out... Sincerely appreciate your help
[06:54] <jmg> i upgraded dapper to edgy
[06:54] <picochu> bimberi:  what about ntfs-3g?
[06:54] <Jordan_U> morten: Are you running Edgy, I have heard it has much better suspend support
[06:54] <jmg> and xorg doesnt start
[06:54] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, so you cannot install any extensions currently?
[06:54] <Kaiyang> I am installing a linux server
[06:54] <morten> Jordan_U: yes i am
[06:54] <bimberi> picochu: sounds interesting
[06:54] <jmg> is this a known issue?
[06:54] <jedi__> why do i have to sign in to skype each time i use it? i have to re-enert my user/pass each time - how do i save it or avoid this??
[06:55] <picochu> bimberi: nobody's using it? no support from edgy either eh?
[06:55] <jmg> Connection refused (errno 111): unable to connect to x server
[06:55] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Maybe I'm just spacing out, but I don't see how to do it.
[06:55] <jmg> log files for xorg are zeroed
[06:55] <bimberi> picochu: i don't know sorry
[06:55] <jmg> do i need to join #ubuntu+1?
[06:55] <Kaiyang> and I am asked to whether should I remove all partitions on this system. "sda Dell VIRTUAL DISK"
[06:55] <morten> jmg: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:55] <picochu> bimberi: it's okay thanks anyway
[06:55] <Kaiyang> may I know is it ok to remove it?
[06:55] <xSUSHi> Hey when I last used Linux like 5 years ago , there was nowhere close to the kind of love and support that the Ubuntu community has , you guys ROCK !!
[06:56] <Arigato> how long does it normally take to compile the kernel?
[06:56] <Kaiyang> I currently have RAID 1 Controller installed on this fresh new server
[06:56] <Kaiyang> I do not know what's the DELL VIRTUAL DISK
[06:56] <xSUSHi> picochu : im using ntfs-3g
[06:56] <Kaiyang> anyone has any idea on Dell's Server system?
[06:56] <glitch-> when i'm browsing some pages with videos and click on them.pops out a message from totem saying that theres no decoderto play that video..any idea guys?
[06:57] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, I'm not sure what to tell you.  I've never had the problem of not being able to install extensions.  you could always hop over to the firefox channel on irc.mozilla.org
[06:57] <cliffd> when I do a find in grub> why does it just tell me file not found all the time?
[06:57] <Jordan_U> !restricted | glitch
[06:57] <xSUSHi> picochu - ubuntuguide.org set me up -- runs great and i can manage my NTFS files and everything
[06:57] <Ubotwo> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[06:57] <xSUSHi> ntfs-3g is new to Edgy
[06:58] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Yeah, it's strange, especially since the extension *was* installed a little while ago :)
[06:58] <Jordan_U> xSUSHi: is ntfs-3g better than fuse?
[06:58] <Kaiyang> anyone?
[06:58] <xSUSHi> i think so
[06:58] <jmg> morten: thx, xserver-xorg was horked and needed to be reinstalled
[06:58] <Jordan_U> xSUSHi: is it safe?
[06:58] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, so you clicked on the xpi link and it brought up and error message?
[06:58] <xSUSHi> i had problems with fuse accepting my group id as access to write....
[06:59] <cliffd> Kaiyang: if you go to support.dell.com and put in your service tag it will tell you the raid controller
[06:59] <elknof1__> cliffd: sorry... i get disconected
[06:59] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: xpi?
[06:59] <xSUSHi> Jordan_u: apparently its safer?   the website said its an alternative for safe writing to ntfs
[06:59] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: OK, xpi.  Yes.
[06:59] <Kaiyang> service-tag? where?
[06:59] <cliffd> elknof1_ I dont think your board supports usb booting.
[06:59] <cliffd> Kaiyang: what model is this?
[06:59] <xSUSHi> jordan: either way my windows partition will never boot again from all the writing i did to the disk...
[07:00] <xSUSHi> but it didnt dammage any non-os related files
[07:00] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, what exactly does the message say that comes up?
[07:00] <Kaiyang> PowerEdge 840
[07:00] <xSUSHi> jordan_u: the best way is to just use ext3 for all partitions --- and use a virtual machine if you need win xp
[07:00] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Software installation is currently disabled. Click Edit Options... to enable it and try again.
[07:01] <cliffd> Kaiyang: look for a rectangle sticker about 2 inches long, it says service tag on it.
[07:02] <Kaiyang> ok checking now
[07:02] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, you will need to use about:config to reset the "xpinstall.enabled" preference to the default "true" value
[07:02] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: There is an "Edit Options..." button to the right of the message.  Clicking on it brings up the "Firefox Preference: Content" window.
[07:02] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, it's a preference carried over from FF 1.0.x that is no longer in the gui
[07:03] <Kaiyang> and after i found it?
[07:03] <jmg> now i need to rebuild nvidia kernel moduel
[07:03] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: OK, I double clicked in xpinstall.enabled and now it says true.
[07:03] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, try installing the extension again
[07:03] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Cool, it's working.  Is Adblock Plus 7.2.2 worthwhile?
[07:04] <xSUSHi> Again , when I last used Linux like 5 years ago , there was nowhere close to the kind of love and support that the Ubuntu community has , you guys ROCK !!
[07:05] <Geoffrey2> is mencoder pretty straightforward, or do I need to pass a bunch of configuration options?
[07:05] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, Adblock Plus is better than Adblock, but I prefer adblocking through userstyles.  Adblock has the benefit of not downloading the content, so is beneficial on slow connections.  Adblocking through userstyles downloads the content but doesn't show and acutally uses less memory
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[07:06] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: I'll give adblock plus a try.
[07:07] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, Adblock Plus shouldn't have the problem with flash or java that normal Adblock does
[07:07] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: It's late, and I have to go. Tomorrow I'll try replacing flash 7 with flash 9 :)  Thanks for all your help!
[07:08] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, you should run "locate libflashplayer.so" and see where it actually is located.  you can then stick flash 9 in the same place
[07:08] <slavik> dapper: networkmanager doesn't see wireless networks and 'iwlist eth1 scan' returns no results ... module for my card is loaded (bcm43xx)
[07:09] <eternalswd> EnsignRedshirt, good luck
[07:09] <EnsignRedshirt> eternalswd: Good idea... I'll try that.  Good night!
[07:09] <slavik> ~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins for flash I believe
[07:09] <finn> what is the recommended fax program to use with a laptop modem?
[07:10] <bum> slavik does it show under ifconfig?
[07:10] <slavik> bum, yes
[07:11] <Geoffrey2> good luck with Flash 9, I've had nothing but grief with it
[07:11] <bimberi> !fffc
[07:11] <Ubotwo> If Firefox is crashing on sites using Flash try adding "export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" to /etc/firefox/firefoxrc (ref: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 )
[07:11] <slavik> Geoffrey2: I find that it works better than 7 ...
[07:11] <Jordan_U> Anyone with xmoto installed, do you have a file: ~/.xmoto/Textures/UI/Loading.png ?
[07:11] <slavik> Jordan_U: did you delete the file?
[07:11] <bum> what model card?
[07:12] <slavik> broadcom 4318
[07:12] <Jordan_U> slavik: No, but xmoto is complaining that it doesn't exist, and it doesn't.
[07:12] <slavik> firmware is installed
[07:12] <slavik> Jordan_U: k, no idea :(
[07:12] <rickyfingers> does anyone here know if it is possible to install flash player on x86_64?
[07:13] <slavik> rickyfingers: not yet I think
[07:13] <Jordan_U> rickyfingers: It is possible, but a hassle
[07:13] <rickyfingers> I don't mid hassle, what do I need to start reading?
[07:13] <Geoffrey2> slavik, just the opposite for me.....Flash 9 kept bringing Firefox to a standstill....
[07:14] <bum> have you looked at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102
[07:14] <Jordan_U> rickyfingers: You need to set up a 32 bit chroot, run the 32 bit version of firefoc from there, and install flash on the 32 bit firefox.
[07:14] <Jordan_U> *firefox

[07:16] <rickyfingers> thanks Jordan. I can dig your explanation
[07:16] <Jordan_U> rickyfingers: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/32bitBrowserOnAmd64
[07:17] <rickyfingers> JU: that's actually a very cool, general solution to the problem. I like it.

[07:23] <bum> ok
[07:23] <pod> +
[07:23] <XhyldazhK> my openoffice is stuck in the kde look and feel how do i switch it to gnome?
[07:23] <slavik> I believe there is a package to make GTKappslook like QT apps, you need to get rid of that
[07:24] <bum> did it stop working after installing something new?
[07:24] <XhyldazhK> ahhhh
[07:24] <slavik> after I reloaded the module manually
[07:25] <Arigato> what is the difference between /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin?
[07:26] <esstone> my iPod is mounting read-only, how do I get it to mount read-write ?
[07:26] <slavik> Arigato: stuff that comes with default install should go into /usr/bin, stuff that you install should be in /usr/local/bin
[07:26] <Jordan_U> esstone: Is it mac formatted or windows formated?
[07:26] <slavik> esstone: in terminal mount -o rw /ipod/dir
[07:26] <slavik> or nvm?
[07:26] <esstone> mac, it used to be windows until i had to restore today on a friend's mac
[07:26] <slavik> Arigato: that is what I have been told
[07:27] <Arigato> that makes sense
[07:27] <Jordan_U> esstone: Writing to HFS+ in linux is less stable than writing to NTFS, I would personally reformat it.
[07:28] <esstone> ok, I'll go try reformatting in Windows.  Thanks!

[07:37] <lastnode> Clin1, you mean you want to run a nameserver?

[07:37] <Clin1> Yes
[07:37] <bum> apache for web

[07:38] <Clin1> Apache and a lot of extentions
[07:38] <bum> dyndns could be useful for you too

[07:39] <tonyyarusso> How do you make ~/.bash_aliases load on login?
[07:40] <Flannel> Clin1: sure, you could start your own DNS, but no one would connect to it (unless they reconfigured their software)
[07:40] <Clin1> Also if im correct it does not matter who hosts it aas long as it makes it to the other servers daatabook as the ip aand name
[07:40] <Clin1> hostname*
[07:40] <Flannel> Clin1: that's correct

[08:07] <Alakazamz0r> liquidboy, http://www.windowmaker.info/documentation.php?show=userguide&chapter=2
[08:08] <kek> Thegino: you can install a firefox tar.gz package from mozilla.com by just unpacking it in your home directory with the GUI and then double-clicking the program file, but what they are trying to say is it's not needed since it's already installed
[08:08] <trelayne> ok thanks all

[08:14] <january> nekostar: but looks much better than the regular setup
[08:14] <nekostar> etc
[08:14] <bum> you can graphically install w/synaptic
[08:14] <kek> Thegino: but what do you want to update? firefox? or an extension?
[08:14] <nekostar> synaptic is teh win
[08:14] <january> nekostar: its thinkpad x40, there should not be any problems
[08:14] <nekostar> ah
[08:14] <nekostar> yup
[08:14] <nekostar> thats an ibm
[08:14] <nekostar> you need that alternate install disk
[08:15] <Alakazamz0r> <nekostar> synaptic is teh win <---negative
[08:15] <tarelerulz> I found site that just works under internet exporer
[08:15] <january> nekostar: which one?
[08:15] <tarelerulz> It has some interactive parts
[08:15] <Thegino> update from browser not add/remove or synaptic pack manager just for this install
[08:15] <tarelerulz> http://www.unforgettablelanguages.com/frames_a6.html
[08:16] <bum> you can't update if you have the latest version already
[08:16] <bum> 2.0 is latest stable firefox
[08:17] <Thegino> no cause the firefox in ubuntu is totem i wanted i new fresh firefox was called totem-firefox
[08:17] <nekostar> january lemme find this link
[08:17] <bum> when downloading tar.gz you can choose to open with Xarchiver
[08:17] <stray77> What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel? 2.6.15-27-686
[08:17] <bum> that might be what you want
[08:18] <nekostar> http://www.leopold.dk/~martin/IBMx40UbuntuInstall.html
[08:18] <nekostar> there
[08:18] <nekostar> look at that
[08:18] <nekostar> that guy has the same lappy as j00 january
[08:18] <nekostar> ^^;;
[08:19] <nekostar> and i just came across that page like 20 min ago looking for something else lol
[08:19] <kek> Thegino: totem has nothing to do with firefox. also i don't actually think you can use the firefox built-in update manager if you are running the firefox ubuntu package. if your problem is that you don't have firefox 2.0 you should upgrade to the latest version of ubuntu which has firefox 2.0
[08:19] <scotchi> salut ^
[08:19] <kek> Thegino: (except you can use it to update extensions)
[08:19] <Thegino> got it kek 6.10
[08:19] <nekostar> kek you can use it for extensions that are not global
[08:19] <kraut> moin
[08:19] <nekostar> extensions that are per user only
[08:19] <kek> nekostar: true
[08:19] <Healot> alo, salut
[08:19] <nekostar> and not for firefox itself iether
[08:19] <nekostar> trust me i fell afoul of that before
[08:19] <nekostar> lol
[08:19] <tarelerulz> I want to say linux is great. I have gotten nfts and fat32 able to  be shared with my windows computer and I can run internet exporer with wine
[08:20] <bum> you might want to download totem-xine-firefox-plugin or totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin
[08:20] <nekostar> salut Healot
[08:20] <nekostar> eh
[08:20] <bum> there is a totem-mozilla package
[08:20] <nekostar> bum mplayer plugin > totem plugin
[08:20] <nekostar> also make su re to compile mplayer yourself
[08:20] <nekostar> :D
[08:20] <kek> Thegino: if you have ubuntu 6.10 you should have firefox 2.0, why do you want to update anything?!
[08:20] <nekostar> excellent documentation on that in the forums
[08:21] <january> thanks, nekostar!
[08:21] <nekostar> np
[08:21] <tarelerulz> any of you play wma or wmv files with totem and not get sound
[08:21] <nekostar> using xubuntu is really a good idea for that thing fyi
[08:21] <nekostar> tarelerulz i play that stuff with mplayer in linux
[08:22] <nekostar> but you should see if you have w32codecs installed
[08:22] <Thegino> brb all

[08:22] <nekostar> kk Thegino

[08:23] <stray77> What is the location of the directory of my C header files that match my running kernel assuming my kernel is 2.6.15-27-686?  I'm trying to install vmware tools and its asking me this question.
[08:23] <kek> tarelerulz: ouch, isn't IE in wine slow?
[08:23] <kek> and buggy
[08:23] <runpain> yup
[08:24] <nekostar> MitchM if it doesnt recognize your card you probably need the floppy to boot the raid bit
[08:24] <nekostar> ^_^
[08:24] <tarelerulz> Well, I use IE for stuff that will not work with fireforx
[08:24] <nekostar> ie+linux=~_~
[08:24] <kek> ok
[08:24] <cafuego> stray77: /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include
[08:24] <bum> Opera also works well for things that don't seem to work qutie right in firefox
[08:24] <runpain> hi neko
[08:24] <bum> quite
[08:24] <stray77> thanks ill try that
[08:24] <cafuego> stray77: It means you need the 'kernel-headers-$(uname -r)' package
[08:24] <tarelerulz> I mean the fact that wine will run IE is great.
[08:24] <MitchM> nekostar, to "boot the raid bit" ?
[08:24] <cafuego> Which you don't have installed, otherwise vmware setup would have found them.

[08:44] <bum> simliar on BSD
=== polx is now known as zroberous
[08:45] <rudivs> is there likely to be a problem in some config file somewhere?
[08:45] <nekostar> well
[08:46] <nekostar> one could as root do chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers
[08:46] <nekostar> that would fix permissions
[08:46] <nekostar> then do how i mentioned it
[08:46] <nekostar> format is:
[08:46] <nekostar> username ALL=(ALL) ALL
[08:46] <nekostar> and save
[08:46] <runpain> ok will try

[08:48] <Thegino> hello all again
[08:48] <bum> I'm out
[08:48] <jedi__> i followed the official nvidia/xgl beryl wiki http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA but i got no session option for beryl, tho i entered it.
[08:48] <bum> oh yeah, thegino http://projects.collabora.co.uk/darcs/farsight/gaim-farsight/plugins/
[08:48] <bum> bye
[08:48] <runpain> man this linux stuff so hard to learn
[08:48] <nekostar> wb Thegino late bum
[08:48] <zroberous> yes it is
[08:48] <nekostar> runpain but its worth it
[08:48] <BHSPitMonkey> I have a problem... I've been trying to install edgy onto my friend's dell PC.  On the LiveCD, it boots up to a certain point (presumably, until when X starts) and then I just get a black screen; Unresponsive. Can't switch TTYs. Can't do ANYTHING.  Now, I installed with the Alternate CD, and it installs fine, but when I boot up the computer... same as with the LiveCD.
[08:48] <runpain> God bless you bum
[08:48] <cr4ftyb0n35> runpain: stick with it. switch from mepis to ubuntu :D
[08:48] <BHSPitMonkey> I had a "black screen" issue in Dapper, but that was because his video card setup is weird. I could switch to TTY1 and fix the xorg.conf. Not so, anymore.
[08:49] <nekostar> yry
[08:49] <runpain> i tried ubuntu it was even harder
[08:49] <nekostar> actually
[08:49] <nekostar> BHSPitMonkey
[08:49] <nekostar> i had the same problem
[08:49] <nekostar> get the alternate cd
[08:49] <nekostar> and install without being connected to internet
[08:49] <jedi__> can anyone say why beryl isint in my session manager even though ive put it there?
[08:49] <cr4ftyb0n35> runpain: why was it harder?
[08:49] <nekostar> then update packages after configging ethernet
[08:50] <BHSPitMonkey> nekostar, I'm afraid we didn't have the same situation at all, then
[08:50] <Thegino> are .rpm files install the same way as .tar files
[08:50] <runpain> when i boot up could not get to the desktop keept puting in pass word and it would hang at logon
[08:50] <BHSPitMonkey> nekostar, A)  I DID install via the Alternate CD, the resulting installation wouldn't boot.   B) Internet didn't exist in this scenario.
[08:50] <kek> Thegino: no, check out the alien package

[08:51] <nekostar> im installing dapper not edgy tho
[08:51] <BHSPitMonkey> nekostar, whenever edgy would get to the X starting step, (on the LiveCD OR on an installed system), I'd get an irrecoverable black screen
[08:52] <tarelerulz> There is fork in Gaim that is working on webcams ,but how to you install it so you don't mess up your other intalled on
[08:52] <kek> Thegino: alien package.rpm; dpkg -i package.deb
[08:52] <BHSPitMonkey> nekostar, I wasn't there long enough before, but that's my next step the next time I'm over there.
[08:52] <runpain> i installed the christian edition it did the same thing
[08:52] <BHSPitMonkey> gonna gut into xorg.conf
[08:52] <nekostar> eh

[08:58] <runpain> they have other stuff with it to
[08:58] <kek> like what?
[08:58] <runpain> guess because founder is one
[08:58] <jkimball4> where are system-wide symbolics links stored in the filesystem?

[08:59] <runpain> Graphics are awsome
[08:59] <runpain> but i am learning
[08:59] <runpain> Mepis
[08:59] <tarelerulz> I don't want to sound dumb ,but how to you run auto installer for linux ? is that really what it is
[09:00] <runpain> it gets hard sometimes
[09:00] <Healot> tarelerulz: depends if your desktop support autorun, e.g. GNOME or KDE do
[09:00] <runpain> i still having trouble installing driver for 2wire wireless pcmcia card
[09:01] <kek> tarelerulz: what are you trying to install?
[09:01] <runpain> 2wire wireless pcmcia card on laptop
[09:01] <tarelerulz> I am trying to install that gaim fork that does web cams in gaim
[09:02] <runpain> using a ethernet card rite now
[09:02] <nataku> hey
[09:02] <nataku> I'm having yet another interesting problem
[09:02] <runpain> but want to go wire less
[09:02] <nataku> I got 6.06 installed, everything works...
[09:02] <nataku> except
[09:02] <nataku> my laptop hangs on shutdown
[09:02] <nataku> and HAL doesn't seem to be running
[09:02] <nataku> I get no battery display or anything
[09:03] <runpain> sorry cant help nataku am a newbie myself
[09:03] <nataku> that's fine :)
[09:03] <nataku> this is the best Ubuntu distro I've gotten yet heh
[09:04] <nataku> tried edgy earlier, to no avail
[09:04] <nataku> tried Xubuntu 6.06, no good
[09:04] <tarelerulz> I love ubuntu  too
[09:04] <nataku> finally, Ubuntu Drake magically works
[09:04] <runpain> ya kn wh u mn
[09:04] <tarelerulz> You mean Xubuntu for the xbox
[09:04] <nataku> no.
[09:04] <nataku> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with the Xfce window manager
[09:04] <Robbster> hi all. How do I install ubuntu iver a network. I've googled and can't find any resources. I just want to boot from a network image, type in the nfs server details and install.
[09:05] <pluma> I just removed the kopete package and manually compiled and installed kopete 12.2 and it still claims to be 11.1 if I check its About info. WT?
[09:05] <tarelerulz> Xfce is cool it loads fast
[09:05] <runpain> gota go folks got to get up at 500am its 2 now here in wonderful EAST TEXAS
[09:06] <pluma> Also, "kopete -v" returns 12.2
[09:06] <runpain> GOD BLESS!!
[09:06] <nataku> ok, I was wrong
[09:06] <nataku> HAL is running
[09:06] <nataku> however
[09:06] <nataku> system still hangs at shutdown
[09:07] <pluma> "God bless"? Heretic.
[09:07] <nekostar> well
[09:07] <nekostar> after many fails
[09:07] <nekostar> i am left with lots of failures on /dev/hdc
[09:07] <nekostar> which seems to eb the cdrom
[09:07] <Healot> KDE is Doom(ed)
[09:07] <nekostar> and i cant get the case open for the friggan life of me
[09:07] <nekostar> damn dell 2400
[09:07] <nekostar> !dell
[09:07] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[09:08] <nekostar> there should be something that says get windows
[09:08] <nekostar> ~_~
[09:08] <sky123> hello..does anyone know what the sparc channel is for ubuntu?
[09:08] <pluma> #sparc?
[09:08] <sky123> thats generic...getting ubuntu on sparc...thats different
[09:08] <tarelerulz> I download the autopack for gaim fork with web cams and when I try to open it says something about gedit not being able to do it
[09:08] <pluma> #ubuntu-sparc or #sparc-ubuntu? ^^
[09:09] <nekostar> does anyone know if there is a low-mem option for installation ?
[09:10] <sky123> neither one of those works
[09:10] <Healot> with alternate-server CD, nekostar
[09:10] <sky123> !sparc
[09:10] <Ubotwo> Have a look here for Docs http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/install/sparc/ KnownIssues and TODO are on the wiki.
[09:10] <nekostar> Healot i have hte alternate install cd
[09:10] <nekostar> does the server option exist ?
[09:10] <nekostar> like it does on the debian install disks?
[09:10] <Healot> yeah the second install
[09:10] <Healot> option*
[09:10] <nekostar> yeah
[09:10] <Healot> it clearly says "install server"
[09:11] <nekostar> im just getting mass errors of /dev/hdc
[09:11] <Healot> with any server application, actually
[09:11] <nekostar> lemme see if i can see that
[09:13] <nekostar> Healot while watching the tty4 screen
[09:13] <nekostar> i see it fail on the cdrom
[09:13] <nekostar> and fail to open it
[09:13] <nekostar> then it mvoes on..............
[09:13] <nekostar> could it be jsut that hardware is incompatable?
[09:13] <Healot> your hardware fault?
[09:13] <Healot> likely
[09:15] <tarelerulz> it says those autoinsatll pacags are shell script . I try sudo ./shell script and it says ./ is not comand after sudo
[09:16] <nekostar> then it starts talking about inability to create symlinks while formatting the partitions....
[09:16] <sky123> After searching on google..it appears this is the channel to ask about sparc install on ubuntu....
[09:16] <cj_> hello
[09:16] <sky123> has anyone dealt with partitioning a netra T1
[09:16] <cj_> can i join your furum
[09:17] <nekostar> cj_ www.ubuntuforums.org
[09:17] <nekostar> and yes everyone can join
[09:17] <melenkurion> morning
[09:17] <nekostar> sky123 oi?
[09:17] <dsb> hola
[09:17] <nekostar> i know nothing about that unfortunately
[09:17] <nekostar> sup dsb
[09:17] <cj_> guys do you know how to open a perl text files?
[09:18] <cj_> thanks
[09:18] <dsb> a few things, I'm learning though!
[09:18] <nekostar> o wait
[09:18] <nekostar> more errors............
[09:18] <dsb> I'm trying to RATD and do google searches as best I can
[09:18] <sky123> specifically either dapper or edgy on the netra t1....its specific to using software raid..as the installer doesnt use the hardware raid??
[09:18] <rudivs> is there some gnome session file that might need to be flushed after an incomplete shutdown process? my gnome login freezes after entering the username and password. I can still open other terminals though.
[09:18] <dagnabit> hi cj - did you want to run a perl script, or edit it?
[09:19] <cj_> i want to edit it..
[09:19] <sky123> use vi
[09:19] <dagnabit> you can open it in your favorite editor.  it's simply a text file.
[09:19] <sky123> it should open up
[09:19] <sky123> or joe, or emacs or whatever
=== Seriii is now known as Serii
[09:19] <Robbster> can I install edgy over NFS?
[09:20] <drdeath> 
[09:20] <cj_> but its list as unknown file!!!
[09:20] <dsb> excuse my ignorance, but is there a ?buntu friendly channel to discuss general topics, such as mysql vs. postgresql?
[09:20] <dagnabit> that's ok.  force it.
[09:21] <wastrel> !offtopic
[09:21] <Ubotwo> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[09:21] <sky123> dsb: that is really an open forum type question...and each will have his/her opinion...ie referential integrity..etc
[09:21] <nataku> ok.
[09:21] <nataku> this is starting to annoy me.
[09:21] <Robbster> will edgy install over NFS?
[09:21] <nataku> my ethernet card was working fine the first 2 times I booted
[09:21] <nataku> and now it's broken
[09:22] <sky123> Robbster: My initial answer would be yes...but Ive only done such an install via PXE..and TFTP
[09:22] <dagnabit> nataku: huh.  its broiken if you boot from a live cd or other os as well?
[09:22] <nataku> no.
[09:22] <nataku> I was running windows XP for the longest time
[09:22] <nataku> and the live CD saw it fine
[09:22] <nataku> and I'm seeing now it seems to be my wireless card
[09:22] <nataku> uh
[09:23] <nataku> on boot
[09:23] <cj_> thanks dagnabit
[09:23] <nataku> I get the repeating error of
[09:23] <nataku> "ipw2100: eth0: Failed to start the card."
[09:23] <nataku> over and over
[09:23] <bagelis_> hi. i have a problem with ubuntu 6.06. The shutdown and restart button disappear from the menu when i click the red button. there is only logout and change user button.
[09:23] <melenkurion> i got a slow mouse here.. and i want more speed within minimal moving of my hand.. from the acceleration my hand hurts :(
[09:24] <nekostar> bagelis_ are you on a secondary user by chance?
[09:24] <mdke> hiya. I need to do a recipe in procmail which filters on something in the Subject: which contains square brackets. Do I need something special to escape the [] ?
[09:24] <nataku> WHAT
[09:24] <bagelis_> no ony 1 user.
[09:24] <nataku> I just rebooted out of spite
[09:24] <nataku> and it worked again
[09:24] <nataku> can anyone tell me what's going on
[09:25] <melenkurion> anyone has a hint to fix that? i'm used to work with high sensivity like in ego-shooters ;)
[09:25] <dsb> sky123: indeed... I was just wondering if there existed some type of 'off-topic' type of channel for ?buntu users to discuss various software packages; their weaknesses vs strengths, various problems with certain hardwares, etc.
[09:26] <sky123> id ask here..take a chance
[09:26] <wastrel> bagelis_:  do you use startx to start the GUI ?  or login from gdm ?
[09:26] <sky123> !off-topic
[09:26] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[09:26] <nataku> melenkurion, one sec, lemme go look
[09:26] <sky123> !offtopic
[09:26] <Ubotwo> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[09:26] <wastrel> i already did that :/
[09:26] <wastrel> nobody listens to me...
[09:27] <sky123> lol
[09:27] <nataku> ok, melenkurion, go to System > Preferences > Mouse
[09:27] <wastrel> anyway offtopic is pretty dead atm
[09:27] <nataku> then the 'Motion' tab
=== doctordeath is now known as Dr123
[09:27] <bagelis_> i login from gdm
[09:27] <nataku> there are all your sensitivity settings
[09:27] <Robbster> sky123: I've downloaded and booted the netboot image, but now I'm stuck :(
[09:27] <wastrel> i used to work for a company that used postgres , supposedly it scales better
[09:27] <wastrel> mysql is way more popular tho, due to the apache integration thing that i know nothing about
=== Dr123 is now known as doctor1
[09:27] <sky123> wastrel: sunny youd mention that..as this place has become quite  off topic recently...imho
[09:27] <dsb> I'm new to ubuntu. I'm giving it a go converting from gentoo
[09:27] <sky123> ;)
[09:27] <mdke> come on, must be a procmail user here
[09:28] <nataku> dsb, should have an easy time then heh
[09:28] <nataku> gentoo was where I learned linux
[09:28] <melenkurion> not really, if I choose a high sensivity and no acceleration, the mouse won't become faster
[09:28] <wastrel> mdke:  \[
[09:28] <dsb> well, one would think so
[09:28] <melenkurion> already tried this nataku
[09:28] <nataku> melenkurion, right, so turn up the acceleration
[09:28] <Robbster> sky123: is the TFTP installation easy?
[09:28] <sky123> Robbster: Id check the /etc/exports file on the NFS server to see if it allows i guess in this case..any host in your subnet to connect..
[09:28] <mdke> wastrel: thanks.
[09:28] <nataku> the Gnome mouse sensitivity is a function of both sliders
[09:28] <nataku> instead of a single slider
[09:29] <melenkurion> i have problems with my hands, nataku .. so i can't move them quickly
[09:29] <dsb> I did however, find out some more details about the packaging system by using aptitude
[09:29] <nataku> ok
[09:29] <Robbster> that's not the prob. how do I tell the installer to a) use NFS and b) where the server is :)
[09:29] <melenkurion> with minimal movement i want maximum mouse motion
[09:29] <nataku> if you turn up the acceleration, it will make the mouse pointer jump much more quickly
[09:29] <melenkurion> acceleration won't work if i move my hand slowly ;)
[09:29] <nataku> crud, good point
[09:29] <nataku> hmmmm
[09:29] <dsb> I've never really used debian though
[09:29] <sky123> RObbster: a little involved..with TFTP as you need to tell the dhcpserver how to interface with tftp and then either use PXE to look for the kernel image that will then boot the system up. Some hints are in the wikis and edubuntu uses tftp for LTSP project..so check those out.
[09:30] <dsb> so this dpkg and dpkg-deb thing is new to me
[09:30] <nataku> melenkurion, I seem to be stumped
[09:30] <mdke> wastrel: can I do: /([blah] |[blah] ) ?
[09:30] <Robbster> sky123: any chance of telling the ubuntu installer to use NFS and point it to the NFS server? I can boot an image from CDROM.
[09:30] <wastrel> mdke:  dunno, never tried :] 
[09:30] <Robbster>  - just can't install off it :(
[09:31] <mdke> wastrel: ok! we'll see
[09:31] <mdke> wastrel: it seems to makes sense?
[09:31] <melenkurion> never happens alot, nataku ? ;)
[09:31] <wastrel> mdke:  never seen that syntax before
[09:31] <nataku> heh, happens a LOT
[09:31] <mdke> wastrel: or maybe it should be (/[blah] |/[blah] )
[09:31] <jadacyrus> What PORT does remote desktop run on?
[09:31] <sky123> Robbster: does the netboot have a install from NFS option? IF so then you CAN do that...and youll need point to the boot image on the nfs server with a path...that has been exported in /etc/exports on the NFS server.
[09:32] <nataku> melenkurion, I recommend you google around a little for some sort of enhanced mouse drivers for linux
[09:32] <nataku> I unfortunately know relatively nothing about this, heh
[09:32] <mdke> wastrel: the (|) bit makes it an alternative, I believe
[09:32] <melenkurion> i wonder, why this feat isnt supported yet.. especially for graphical designers that's really important
[09:33] <Robbster> sky123: I've booted the netboot image and I can't see any references to NFS. I've scoured the google, but not come up with any hits. I've been able to install other linux distros over nfs (mandriva) so I figure it's gotta be possible
[09:33] <sky123> Robbster: Id play around with both...get the NFS working...then play with dhcp/tftp/pxe...its well worth the effort.
[09:33] <nataku> yeah, that's a good point melenkurion
[09:33] <wastrel> i should have gone to sleep 4 hours ago
[09:33] <wastrel> bye now
[09:34] <mchonis> hey all, anyone know how to get surround sound working on a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live 24 Bit External USB soundcard?  It took some doing just to get stereo sound out of it, but If I could get surround I'd be ohsohappy
[09:34] <dsb> I want to get NFS working also, but I'm stuck on mysql
[09:34] <Robbster> nfs is working. dhcp is up. Just need some glue to get them all working to get the install up. :(
[09:34] <sky123> Robbster: that IS odd....I have some GOOD experience with Centos nfs AND tftp/pxe with kickstart..works like a charm...i cant imagine ubuntu wouldnt be ablt to do the same..
[09:34] <Robbster> kickstart?
[09:35] <dsb> I had nfs working with redhat, gentoo, and mac osx, but I'm not about to start something new, until I get one problem resolved, and I'm still unsure if I have a corrupt packaging system
[09:36] <dv5237> damn i was playing a movie and sudenly the sound stops can someone help me? (its not the movie for sure)
[09:36] <sky123> Robbster: centos, redhat...yeah..its a file that is scripted to partition, install rpms, and do post config of any/all systems in a network..simply throw it on a tftp/dhcp server with your cdson it, and wham after 7 mins complete system build.. Im looking like you...for the equivalent here...
[09:38] <jadacyrus> what do you need to fileshare between two linux computers?
[09:38] <sky123> Robbster: you are definitely thinking along the right lines...the network install is key
[09:38] <xSUSHi> dsb: yea i had to use samba
[09:38] <xSUSHi> smbfs
[09:38] <sky123> lemme scour the net to see if i see something that'll get the job done.
[09:38] <xSUSHi> jadacyrus: ubuntuguide.org
[09:38] <jadacyrus> ty
[09:39] <dsb> jadacyrus: ssh, scp, ftp

[09:42] <dv5237> damn i was playing a movie and sudenly the sound stops can someone help me? (its not the movie for sure)
[09:42] <mchonis> well.. it worked great with windows.. better than stereo laptop sound anyway
[09:42] <sky123> jediMaster: might wanna try to ctrl-alt-bkspc then if you made a copy of the xorg.conf file to something like xorg.conf.old then you can replace it, reboot and try again...to see if you get it restored.. to what it was..
[09:43] <SperMite> Ok i just did the dumbest thing Ever,, (rm -rf /etc/samb) Now after i tried to reinstall it I get ( http://pastebin.com/825563)   Can some PLEASE help me
[09:43] <jediMaster> sky123, i cant do anything it hangs booting into x after the login
[09:43] <dsb> ACPI: Unable to locate RSDP
[09:43] <dsb> how do I fix that?
[09:44] <dnite> SperMite, you might need to purge the samba package w/ dpkg --purge .. it removes all the configuration files and stuff.. so when you reinstall it should recreate them..
[09:44] <jediMaster> dv5237 do cds n other sytems beeps work?
[09:44] <yakumo> hello im trying to install a tar.gz install, the installation guide tells me to use ../configure && make, and  error mssg appear  configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH... anyone know what i should do???
[09:44] <sky123> jediMaster: before you log in...id try the ctrl-alt-bkspc to get to shell... then replace the xorg.conf.old file to xorg.conf...you DID make a copy to old of the original file right??
[09:45] <BeanBag> is there a way to make normal ubuntu dapper into xubuntu?

[09:46] <BeanBag> Healot: Is there a how to somewhere that will walk me through it?
[09:46] <dnite> SperMite, ah.. well then.. i'm not sure. i had a problem when i removed configuration files and i just have to re apt-get install it, run dpkg --purge packagename and then reinstall it again and it worked ok.. not sure what else to offer ya bud..

[09:47] <SperMite> dnite . well thanks anyways
[09:47] <dnite> good luck
[09:47] <sky123> jediMaster: thats the first step...then get the damn thing restored...re-trace your steps trhough the how to for beryl and see if it is missing something..
[09:48] <Healot> removing GNOME files >> the hard part, because removing ubuntu-desktop doesn't remove them
[09:48] <jediMaster> sky123, ay capt'n :)
[09:48] <MeisterZopf> why remove gnome? why not just install debian?
[09:48] <sky123> jediMaster: when i did an upgrade on my dapper...it broke a lot of shi** ...but when i did a fresh install of edgy...wham fixed.
[09:48] <mchonis> um.. thanks anyway i guess
[09:48] <mchonis> gnite
[09:49] <sky123> jediMaster: once you get it working...youll like beryl..its pretty pimp
[09:49] <sky123> they should have named it pimpmyX
[09:49] <BeanBag> Healot: How do i remove it then?
[09:49] <jadacyrus> Okay.. Im trying to use sshfs.. I loaded the fuse module and added myself to the fuse group. Also /dev/fuse exists. However I'm getting operation not permitted when trying to use /dev/fuse ...any ideas?
[09:50] <Healot> BeanBag: manually, usually remove libgtk2.0 :0
[09:50] <jediMaster> sky123, uncanny. I had a working xgl on dapper, but the upgrade was messy, so fresh installed edgy, automatix2 put on the nvid driver .8xxxx .
[09:51] <jediMaster> sky123, my card is FX5200
[09:51] <Robbster> sky123: seems like the way to go. now I just need to figure out what the network controller is :)
[09:51] <Robbster> sky123: Thanks I'll let you know how it goes.
[09:51] <sky123> cool

[09:57] <nataku> ok
[09:57] <nataku> this is beyond weird
[09:57] <jadacyrus> Okay.. Im trying to use sshfs.. I loaded the fuse module and added myself to the fuse group (Logged out and back in). Also /dev/fuse exists. However I'm getting operation not permitted when trying to use /dev/fuse ...any ideas?
[09:57] <dromer> nataku: it is ?
[09:58] <nataku> either Ubuntu loads my hardware drivers fine and hangs on reboot, or it can't load the drivers and it hangs on shutdown
[10:02] <christianp> hi all
[10:03] <sky123> judacyrus: try sudo modprobe fuse?

[10:03] <tameritoke> Hi people. I have a problem configuring my xserver on kubuntu
[10:03] <christianp> but i obtain this error: checking for C compiler default output file name...
[10:03] <christianp> configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[10:03] <christianp> what's the matter?
[10:03] <tameritoke> How can I do it by hand?
[10:04] <tameritoke> from the console...
[10:05] <christianp> tameritoke, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:05] <nataku> does anyone know why my 6.06 installation would hang at shutdown?
[10:05] <nataku> I added 'acpi=force' and that seemed to fix it for about 2 reboots, but now it's hanging again
[10:06] <bosaton> Hi
[10:08] <sky123> judacyrus: did that work??
[10:09] <Caplain> do i need anything to run m ati tv card?

[10:12] <sky123> hokatichenci: you can further look at it a file called list if you do a redirect dpkg --list > list

[10:50] <smoenux> my TwinView is not the same since Edgy. when I maximize Apps, it maximizes over both monitors. on Dapper, it only maximized on the window's monitor. Does anyone know how I can fix this ?
[10:53] <Laosboyme> what is twinview?
[10:53] <Laosboyme> lol
[10:54] <smoenux> lol
[10:54] <smoenux> it's two monitors

[10:55] <LinuxHelp> How do I decrease the priority of an entire repository using /etc/apt/preferences ? I know how to change an individual package, just not an entire repository
[10:55] <Laosboyme> Could somebody tell me how  to download msfonts
[10:55] <LinuxHelp> Laosboyme, try msttcorefonts ?
[10:55] <nuts> hey can ne1 explain me which package i need... if i get a gcc error message like : pan.c:7:19: error: stdio.h: No such file or directory
[10:55] <Flannel> nuts: do you have build-essential installed?
[10:55] <nuts> dunno
[10:55] <nuts> lol
[10:55] <sky123> cryftyb0n35: it is messy to get it going (no doubt if its the first time)...but...after you have it dialed in...there is no turning back..youll want to do ALL your installs this way.
[10:56] <LinuxHelp> Laosboyme, please keep your questions in the main #ubuntu channel
[10:56] <nuts> Flannel: whats the package called?
[10:56] <sky123> nuts: might want to try build-essential packages...
[10:56] <Flannel> nuts: build-essential
[10:57] <Laosboyme> okay
[10:57] <sky123> nuts: sounds like you have kernel-headers missing perhaps?
[10:57] <LinuxHelp> Laosboyme, apt-get install msttcorefonts ?
[10:57] <nuts> sky123: which apt-get install would that be?
[10:59] <sky123> nuts: apt-get install build-essential
[10:59] <sky123> !build-essential
[10:59] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[11:00] <nuts> sky123: thank you very much
[11:00] <sky123> nuts: that means that in /etc/apt/sources.list you'll potentially need to enable the commented out repositories
[11:00] <sky123> np
[11:00] <nuts> yup its working.. im downloading :))

[11:00] <nuts> sky123: woooooooooorx =)
[11:01] <ameyer> PecisDarbs: I'm assuming it would work
[11:01] <Laosboyme> is it really needed
[11:01] <sky123> nuts: thats what im talkin about! SWeeet!
[11:01] <cpk1> is there a way to change the color depth without changing xorg.conf/restarting x?
[11:01] <LinuxHelp> Laosboyme, yes
[11:01] <PecisDarbs> ameyer: I get some strange error, but I am not sure, that is not about lacking of hard disk space. Nautilus CD Burner creates temporary image before writing, right?
[11:02] <ameyer> PecisDarbs: I'm pretty sure it does
[11:02] <Laosboyme> Why?
[11:02] <PecisDarbs> damn
[11:02] <LinuxHelp> Laosboyme, weird licensing restrictions

[11:08] <LinuxHelp> saddam21, hi, how to annoyingly ask the same question twice in one minute?
[11:08] <Joe_CoT> libdvdcss isn't in any of the official repos. you need to get it third party ^ like the seveas repos
[11:08] <cpk1> hrmm i think i went over this before with myself, because I have libdvdcss2 but its not in any of my repos anymore
[11:09] <saddam21> exscuse me
[11:09] <henri_> rickyfingers: turns out i already had it
[11:09] <henri_> just had to compile against /usr/lib32
[11:09] <henri_> instead of /usr/lib
[11:09] <henri_> silly me
[11:10] <dromer> defrysk: it's in there .. but no candidate for install :/

[11:39] <tuskernini> ubinsp, should i search the forems?

[11:40] <ubinsp> then with a little reflexion you will be able to reinstall grub

[11:40] <ubinsp> in a konsole
[11:40] <mtyhome> nobody in here?
[11:40] <tuskernini> ubinsp, will try

[11:41] <GNeu> anyone know how to get Ubuntu (Edgy) to tell me what it's doing when booting?
[11:41] <tuskernini> ubinsp, thanx
[11:41] <mtyhome> well, do you know why my sata 300gb reiserfs disks take so long to mount?
[11:41] <cr4ftyb0n35> GNeu: Use the alternate CD and you recover the older installer...so that's probably the best way
[11:41] <TrolLlock> ok i think ive mounted it now
[11:42] <mtyhome> how can i avoid to wait forerver at boot time while still mounting the disks>
[11:42] <mtyhome> ?
[11:42] <cr4ftyb0n35> mtyhome: Anything in the logs?
[11:42] <GNeu> cr4ftyb0n35, everything is working fine, I just want the checklist to be going through on boot

[11:42] <miquijo> BRASIL
[11:43] <GNeu> cr4ftyb0n35, well rather than (or as well as) the Ubuntu Splash loader
[11:43] <ubinsp> tuskernini: in the console write grub then something like setup (hd0,0) it depends on yr HD type

[11:44] <LinuxHelp> TrolLlock, that sucks, try "sudo ls /mnt/windrive/" to see if its working, and then ask someone else in the channel how to change permissions
[11:45] <visik7> mvo
[11:45] <TrolLlock> ok well its working alright
[11:45] <ubinsp> TrolLlock: what is yr pb?
[11:45] <TrolLlock> pb?
[11:45] <cafuego> TrolLlock: You need to set the permissions at mount time, you can't chown/chmod on a Windows fielsystem, as those don't support unix style file mermissions.
[11:45] <ubinsp> no problem?
[11:45] <nuked_omen> i hate people who speak in short forms and think they know better english
[11:45] <arcade> None who knows how to switch away from UTF8 -> ISO-8859-1 ?  On 6.06
[11:45] <casano> I grabbed this configure-trackpoint tarball.. is there package tools in ubuntu6.10 to automate the installation, or do I configure make install normally from shell ?
[11:46] <pzn> I need someone to explain me how to do somethings in launchpad.net bugs, I'm new to it. can I contact anyone in private?
[11:46] <cafuego> TrolLlock: The easiest way is to add 'uid=XXX,umask=002' in the mount ioptions field in your fstab file. XXX should be your numeric user id.
[11:46] <JeffBell> I have a new monitor that is capable of higher resolutions than the precious LCD.  How can I get Ubuntu to detect it?
[11:46] <nuked_omen> cafuego, how can you find the user's numeric id?
[11:46] <cafuego> nuked_omen: Same for you, mount it as a specifc user/group, correct umask, give permissions to that group
[11:46] <cafuego> nuked_omen: `id`
[11:46] <octan> nuked_omen make sure the mount point "dir" has user premissions,, also mount it with uid and gid
[11:47] <TrolLlock> *doesnt understand nothing*
[11:47] <cafuego> octan: the mount point permissions are irrelevant.
[11:47] <nuked_omen> alright.. i'll try
[11:47] <cafuego> TrolLlock: How did you mount it?
[11:47] <TrolLlock> with sudo ? dunnop (first time using linux)
[11:47] <octan> cafuego, not entirly corrent.. if the dir has root root , you cant edit/delete files in ther
[11:48] <octan> as user
[11:48] <mcella> can someone help me...
[11:48] <cafuego> octan: after moutning, the mounted dirs perms are used, not the mount point perms.
[11:48] <cr4ftyb0n35> whatsup mcella?
[11:48] <mcella> in edgy, I'm getting all notifications bubbles on the bottom panel...
[11:48] <cafuego> octan: those perma/ownership are set by params to `mount'.
[11:48] <mcella> very annoying :-D
[11:48] <cr4ftyb0n35> mcella: Afraid I've never seen or heard that problem
[11:49] <mcella> cr4ftyb0n35: never mind
[11:49] <octan> cafuego, well. i use to change thouse premission.. but he need to look in to uid and gid
[11:49] <cafuego> octan: yup
[11:49] <mcella> that's strange since my friend (on edgy also) is getting them in the right position :-(

[11:49] <JeffBell> Can Ubuntu detect a new monitor, when you connect it?  Mine seems to think the old monitor is connected.
[11:50] <cr4ftyb0n35> mcella: driver issues?(highly unlikely)
[11:50] <TrolLlock> cafuego: the linuxhelp guy said i should mount it with sudo mount /mnt/windrive
[11:50] <mcella> cr4ftyb0n35: no, I think it's something related to a nasty bug in libnotify or notication-daemon... :-/
[11:51] <cr4ftyb0n35> mcella: hmm...
[11:51] <TrolLlock> cafuego: and that was what i did
[11:51] <cafuego> TrolLlock: That emans you should have a line in the /etc/fstab file that mentions it.
[11:51] <TrolLlock> yes
[11:52] <cafuego> TrolLlock: ok. Now on that line there is an entry in the <options> column
[11:52] <TrolLlock> it says ro on that line
[11:52] <cafuego> Ok. What is the first number you get when you type 'id' ?
[11:52] <TrolLlock> id?
[11:53] <bidha2k> do you know which pacakge i can get base64 tools..
[11:53] <cafuego> id
[11:53] <palski> GNeu, sorry, I meant quiet option
[11:53] <TrolLlock> first one is 1000
[11:53] <TrolLlock> uid=1000
[11:54] <cafuego> ok. Your user id is 1000.  What you need to do then is make sure the winpartition is mounted as YOUR user id. You cna do that by changing 'ro' ro 'ro,uid=1000' in the options column.
[11:54] <azcazandco> Hi folks, I need some advice regarding my computer configuration & installing new drives
[11:54] <JeffBell> My desktop resolution is too low.   I bought a bigger monitor, but Ubuntu won't change my resolution.
[11:55] <cafuego> JeffBell: You'll need to reconfigure X and tell it about the new screen. 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[11:56] <TrolLlock> ok should it say ro,uid=1000 or 'ro' ro 'ro,uid=1000'
[11:56] <cafuego> ro,uid=1000

I select packages gaim and gaim-data and them click on packages and then click on lock version, but it has no effect. can somebody give me a tip on how it can be done from the command line?
[12:09] <Williamts99> ivan, it is something like sudo apt-get hold gaim
[12:09] <DarkMageZ> azcazandco, i've done it before. disable the other drives in the bios and then install windows on the drive you want. then reenable and add windows drive to grub :
[12:09] <octan> azcazandco you can do that,, but that will screw up your lilo or grub,, meaning you need a rescue cd for linux to reinstall just grub or lilo
[12:09] <Williamts99> Trolllock, I send you a private message
[12:09] <ivan> ok, thanks. will try.. didn't see anything in the man page for apt-get about it...
[12:09] <azcazandco> so I could use an edgy eft live cd?
[12:10] <octan> yes
[12:10] <ALLISSON> funck your
[12:10] <octan> azcazandco, that would work just fine

[12:13] <azcazandco> have had these drives sitting about for a while, I know I have done something to my install of dapper / upgraded to edgy so I want a clean system to work from
[12:13] <azcazandco> these drives give me a chance to sort everything out
[12:14] <JeffBell> cafuego, I ran through all that dialog about the xserver-xorg ...now I have to reboot for the changes?
[12:14] <azcazandco> octan: will you be about for a while?  I am going to dl all I need then install these drives
[12:14] <livingdaylight> Can someone tell me why signiture is not adding to thunderbird?
[12:15] <octan> azcazandco, yes i'll be here a while
[12:15] <azcazandco> cool...  I may need to pick your brains via a live cd when I break stuff lol
[12:15] <benner> i installed jashaka 2.0 on my toshibanotebook with ati grafic. i'm using fglrx-driver with working gl-support. but i keep getting a weired komment everytime i try to start it: "Segmentation fault". does anybody know what that means and how i can solve it?
[12:15] <ivan> <Williamts99>, it looks like i found a way to do it, it is done with apt_preferences or with a config file /etc/apt/preferences. It is done by 'pining' the version
[12:15] <ivan> i think =)
[12:16] <octan> azcazandco, lol :P you wount break much with supergrub :) its a pretty strait forward tool to use, :)
=== matti_ is now known as matti
[12:17] <azcazandco> cool
[12:17] <azcazandco> octan: how much better than the dapper 64bit is edgy?  is there better support for stuff now?
[12:18] <azcazandco> want to know if I am better just going for 32bit
[12:18] <octan> azcazandco, dapper is more stable,,
[12:18] <octan> me got amd64 too
[12:18] <azcazandco> what os do you run?
[12:18] <octan> 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic
[12:18] <octan> dapper
[12:19] <bXi> isnt dapper at 2.6.15-27 ?
[12:19] <azcazandco> so should I grab the dapper 64bit installer then?
[12:19] <octan> o.0
[12:19] <benner> anyone here using jashaka and had a similar problem?
[12:19] <azcazandco> as opposed to the edgy 64bit
[12:20] <octan> azcazandco.. i bet you run into some problems ther..
[12:20] <octan> just my opinion
[12:20] <JeffBell> It worked!  THANK YOU CAFUEGO!!
[12:20] <azcazandco> with what? 64bit in general?
[12:20] <octan> edgy 64
[12:21] <cafuego> JeffBell: :-)
[12:21] <cafuego> JeffBell: incidentally, just logging out, hitting ctrl-alt-backspace and logging in would be fine too (that restarts X)
[12:21] <azcazandco> okay so dapper 64 is easy enough now?  I know when I first looked at it people were saying it was harder to get stuff running on it
[12:22] <octan> azcazandco, there is still issues with flash in 64 bit.. since its beeing a 32 bit app, ,and you need some 32lib to get it to work in 64 bit. that about it,
[12:22] <Williamts99> ivan, glad you got it figured out
[12:22] <azcazandco> cool
[12:22] <azcazandco> gonna dl it now
[12:23] <ivan> yup.. just checked it out.. works like a charm via the config file.. strange why synaptic didn't want to work with it.. oh well, i'm happy that it works
[12:24] <MattJ> Does anyone have any experience with /writing/ to NTFS partitions in Ubuntu?
[12:25] <Williamts99> I am surprised that lock version didn't work, which version are you using?
[12:25] <ivan> edgy
[12:26] <ivan> well, i'm not afraid of bugs, still got it working
[12:26] <ivan> MattJ, have a look at this: http://www.arsgeek.com/?p=675
[12:27] <ivan> I didn't try it myself, but I bookmarked it just in case i need it (I don't have ntfs partitions)
[12:27] <MattJ> Thanks :)
[12:27] <Yoric> Hi everyone.
[12:28] <Yoric> Do I have to do anything special to get the spam filters to work in Evolution ?
[12:28] <Yoric> At the moment, they seem to filter exactly nil.
[12:29] <napg> can anyone help me with a network issue?
[12:29] <Yoric> You can ask.
[12:29] <octan> explain it first
[12:30] <dade`> referring to git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bcollins/ubuntu-2.6.git ubuntu-2.6 : is the -devel git repository the current feisty kernel ?
[12:30] <napg> I have 3 computers, 2 have win xp/ubuntu and the  other one has winxp only
[12:30] <ajmitch> dade`: yes
[12:31] <napg> one of the dual boot's will be the server for my network at home, more exactly the one i'm currently in
[12:31] <Williamts99> ivan, true, at least you got it to work
[12:31] <tx22> Hey guys, any news about a DVD version of ubuntu?
[12:32] <napg> i would like to know some directions on how to configure it
[12:32] <livingdaylight> Does anybody, anybody at all use Thunderbird?
[12:32] <tx22> i use thunderbird
[12:32] <ivan> livingdaylight, me too
[12:32] <pianoboy3333> livingdaylight: I use evolutiojn
[12:32] <Yoric> tx22: what for ?
[12:32] <livingdaylight> tx22, i can't save my signature
[12:32] <pianoboy3333> *Evolution
[12:32] <octan> napg iptables | route  :P
[12:32] <benjamin>  i used to use it.
[12:32] <tx22> i use thunderbird for rss and email
[12:32] <ivan> napg, cofigure it for what?
[12:32] <livingdaylight> ivan, can you save a signature in preference/account
[12:32] <tx22> livingdaylight:  hmm, I've never used a signature..
[12:33] <octan> napg, do you have a router?
=== Qwerty is now known as lee-nucks
[12:33] <napg> my computer will be the network server so that the other computers have internet and to share some folders between them
[12:33] <ivan> to set a signature, click on Edit -> Account Settings
[12:33] <napg> yes
[12:33] <octan> alright.
[12:34] <guadalinex> HOLA
[12:34] <ivan> then click on the the checkbox attach this signature and choose a file with the signature, thats it
[12:34] <tx22> is there a DVD version of ubuntu with lots more stuff on it?
[12:34] <napg> in win xp everything goes well, when xp server and ubuntu client
[12:34] <guadalinex> HAY ALGUIEN?
[12:34] <bimberi> tx22: yes
[12:34] <napg> but i can't get an unbuntu server for xp/ubuntu clients
[12:34] <guadalinex> ????????????????
[12:34] <ivan> <tx22>, yup, i already download a kubuntu dvd and a ubuntu dvd
[12:35] <tx22> bimberi:  Oh yeah
[12:35] <ivan> look in the torrents
[12:35] <octan> napg, thats easy to setup.. whats you knowlage about networking?
[12:35] <guadalinex> DO ESTA?
[12:35] <tx22> ivan: what extra stuff does it have on the DVD?.. can I see a comparison from the dvd ?
[12:35] <guadalinex> TORRENTS?
[12:35] <tx22> ops *cd
[12:35] <bimberi> tx22: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/release/
[12:35] <tx22> guadalinex:  http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/ torrents
[12:35] <livingdaylight> ivan, do you know where signature are for home account?
[12:36] <Williamts99> guadalinex, please press your caps lock key
[12:36] <OmniD> Does GIMP seriously not have a line tool
[12:36] <OmniD> I cannot find it
[12:36] <OmniD> Although this should be a very basic function
[12:36] <benjamin> guadalinex no capslock por favor.
[12:36] <ivan> <tx22> there is a lot of stuff, i don't know where to check the exact change log, but i used apache from there, mysql, php and some other stuff
[12:36] <Yoric> OmniD: no, no line tool iirc.
[12:36] <OmniD> Why?
[12:36] <tx22> ivan:  ok thanks
[12:36] <napg> i'm have average knowledge, in xp nothing is a problem, in linux i'm still kinda new
[12:36] <ivan> <livingdaylight>, what do you mean by the signature for the home account?
[12:36] <Yoric> Cause lines are not that common in pictures.
[12:36] <OmniD> That's a very very basic function. That's terrible.
[12:37] <octan> napg, ;(
[12:37] <Yoric> OmniD: http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Straight_Line/
[12:37] <napg> but i already know lots of stuff in ubuntu so go ahead
[12:37] <livingdaylight> ivan, opposed to newsgroup or any other account. my pop3 account from where i send email
[12:38] <OmniD> Using a feature called the shift key
[12:38] <mtyhome> hi again
[12:38] <Yoric> OmniD: and, more seriously, because you can draw a line with any tool, iirc.
[12:38] <octan> napg, on the server,, make a virual eth0:1
[12:38] <OmniD> What is this "shift key"
[12:38] <Yoric> OmniD: you're kidding, right ?
[12:38] <mtyhome> if i want to create n files numbered with only one command, how can i use the []  to numerate the files?
[12:38] <OmniD> no, not really
[12:38] <OmniD> I mean
[12:38] <OmniD> Yes yes really
[12:38] <OmniD> I am kidding
[12:39] <ivan> <livingdaylight>, in the account settings, just select the account that you want to add the signature to
[12:39] <OmniD> to the maximum
[12:39] <Yoric> OmniD: pfeww
[12:39] <Yoric> Has anyone succeeded in getting Evolution to filter out spam ?
[12:39] <livingdaylight> ivan, yes, i do that but there is not box for signature
[12:40] <Williamts99> Yoric, yes do a google search on spamassasin and evolution, you will get very nice results :-)
[12:40] <mtyhome> hey!
[12:41] <azcazandco> octan: any suggestions on master slave config for these ide drives?  I am not much of a hardware man
[12:41] <Williamts99> yoric, also you could Edit->Preferences->Mail Preferences->Junk->Check incoming mail for junk and remote test will help, but it is a bit slower.
[12:41] <livingdaylight> Yoric, also i heard bogofilter
[12:41] <Yoric> Williamts99: yes, I'm just under the impression that these google occurrences refer to old versions of Evolution.
[12:41] <rausb0> mtyhome: you can't use []  to do that
[12:42] <napg> create the virtual server with sudo ifconfig eth0:1 <ip> up ?
[12:42] <lee-nucks> how do I disable ipv6 ?
[12:42] <mtyhome> rausb0, do i have to use a for or a while?
[12:42] <rausb0> mtyhome: shell patterns with []  only match on existing files
[12:42] <Yoric> Williamts99: Although I do use Check incoming mail for Junk, there is no X-Spam or X-Bogosity or anything else in the mail headers.
[12:42] <bimberi> !ipv6 | lee-nucks
[12:42] <ubotu> lee-nucks: To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[12:42] <ivan> livingdaylight strange, paste a screenshot to the pastebin, maybe I will be able to help you out
[12:42] <rausb0> mtyhome: you could use something like: touch file{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
[12:42] <livingdaylight> Yoric, http://johnleach.co.uk/words/archives/2005/09/15/180/
[12:43] <rausb0> mtyhome: the comma separated lists in {} will be expanded
[12:43] <rausb0> mtyhome: this will get you file00 .. file99
[12:43] <Williamts99> yoric, gmail takes care of 99% of the spam that I receive, so it hasn't been much of a problem for me.
[12:43] <mtyhome> rausb0, thx
[12:44] <mtyhome> rausb0, can i use []  with ls? or only with grep
[12:44] <rausb0> mtyhome: you can use []  with both ls and grep
[12:44] <Yoric> livingdaylight: thanks, I'll take a look
[12:44] <dade`> you can use a bash manual
[12:44] <rausb0> mtyhome: but ls only does shell patterns (actually the shell does, not ls) and grep does regexp
[12:45] <livingdaylight> Yoric, tell me if it is the busniness
[12:45] <mtyhome> rausb0, so ls [a-z]  should list all files from a to z?
[12:45] <dooglus> mtyhome: to make 43 files, I do this:   i=0; while ((i < 43)); do touch file$(printf %02d $i); ((i++)); done
[12:45] <dooglus> mtyhome: []  is for matching existing filenames in bash, not for generating new filenames
[12:45] <ReFuS4L>  a febbraio 2007 v?
[12:46] <rausb0> mtyhome: no. ls [a-z]  will list you only the files with exactly one lowercase letter
[12:46] <dooglus> rausb0: that depends on your locale I think.
[12:46] <mtyhome> rausb0, ok i figured it out, what i said before could be done with ls [a-z] *
[12:47] <mtyhome> rausb0, but only listing lowercase beginning file and dirs
[12:47] <dooglus> rausb0: look: $ touch a B c D e; ls [a-z] 
[12:47] <dooglus> a  B  c  D  e
[12:47] <rausb0> dooglus: argh. i hate locales.
[12:47] <lee-nucks> thanks bimberi
[12:47] <dooglus> rausb0: 'B' is between 'a' and 'z' here...
[12:47] <mtyhome> dooglus, thx
[12:48] <bimberi> lee-nucks: np :)

[12:49] <incorrect> im trying to get dhcpd to push updates into bind, dhcpd user is part of the bind group and the rndc.key is set to 640,  however when dhcpd starts up it can't read the rndc.key file
[12:49] <azcazandco> octan: not sure I follow
[12:49] <azcazandco> ash yes I do
[12:49] <azcazandco> ah I do even
[12:49] <azcazandco> which is which...  on the cable I mean
[12:50] <octan> depends on which cable type you got
[12:50] <azcazandco> okay
[12:50] <azcazandco> off for a look
[12:50] <azcazandco> 64 bit looks a bit scary btw
[12:50] <octan> some cables say which is which
[12:50] <azcazandco> dunno if I am making the right move
[12:51] <matoledo> ola!
[12:51] <octan> azcazandco, 64 it faster :) i got alot of performance improvment with 64
[12:51] <matoledo> alguien contesta?

[12:54] <Arafangion> Where can I find a 680MB Ubuntu ISO?
[12:54] <Arcad3> what shall i use to add/remove users in proftp/mysql/... More easy?
[12:54] <Arafangion> I suspect that the cd's I have do not support overburning to nearly 700MB.
[12:55] <Arcad3> something like a cPanel
[12:56] <azcazandco> Arafangion: I am actually trying to burn 699mb onto a 700 just now so will tell you how i get on...  it gave a warning
[12:56] <Arafangion> azcazandco: I suspect that the result is highly dependant on the quality of your media.
[12:56] <cpk1> Arafangion: there should be a way to add/remove packages from the iso
[12:56] <Arafangion> cpk1: "Should" isn't good enough :)
[12:57] <Arafangion> cpk1: There "should" be an iso that works for _standard_ cd's.
[12:57] <cpk1> well i am almost positive but i forget what its called so i say "Should" =P
[12:57] <Arafangion> Heh :)
[12:58] <Fuzzy76> Anyone able to give me some pointers on dual-head with ati proprietary drivers? I've got it running (sort of). But my secondary display has a larger desktop than resolution, so I need to scroll it around. I also have a broken pointer on my secondary display and OpenGL support disappeared. :-/ I've read all guides and troubleshooting tips, to no avail. :(
[12:58] <dromer> running dapper
[12:58] <Arafangion> cpk1: I suspect that it involves mounting the image using loopback, copying it, chrooting into it, apt-get remove blah blah blah, delete any applicable .deb's, whatever, then remastering the iso, then burning that - too much work!
[12:58] <cpk1> dromer: what are you compiling?
[12:58] <dromer> gchempaint
[12:59] <dromer> chemsuite I gave up :/
[01:00] <cpk1> Arafangion: there is this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/APTonCD?highlight=%28cd%29%7C%28apt%29 but i dont think thats what you want
[01:00] <azcazandco> Arafangion: succeeded
[01:00] <Arafangion> Fuzzy76: I _had_ it working perfectly, then I installed kubuntu-desktop - never got it working properly :(
[01:00] <azcazandco> maxell cdr
[01:00] <Arafangion> azcazandco: I see you don't use 100 cd's for $20.
[01:00] <Fuzzy76> :'(
[01:00] <Arafangion> azcazandco: These are 'RiDATA' cd's.
[01:00] <azcazandco> nope I got 50 for about 12
[01:01] <Arafangion> cpk1: Are my suspicions correct - lots of work?
[01:01] <Fuzzy76> I wonder if trying the open-sourced driver might be worth a shot. I can live without OpenGL if I get dual-head to work like it should....
[01:01] <Yoric> livingdaylight: ok, applied the filters (I think) -- I just don't quite feel it.
[01:01] <Arafangion> azcazandco: Anyway, basically, your media allows overburning - mine don't.
[01:01] <dromer> cpk1: any idea ?
[01:01] <Arafangion> azcazandco: Personally, ubuntu should provide _regular_ and _extended_ versions.
[01:02] <cpk1> Arafangion: that link i gave you is all nice and gui'fied but i dont know if it is implemented yet =P
[01:02] <cpk1> dromer: is this during make?
[01:02] <Arafangion> cpk1: So, it _is_ too much work :)
[01:02] <dromer> during configure
[01:02] <cpk1> skip configure
[01:02] <azcazandco> true
[01:02] <dromer> ok
[01:02] <cpk1> do make from the base directory

[01:08] <netstar> somehow trying to install compiz beryl and all these other things the Xorg binary has been removed and xserver-xorg thinks it's installed, how can I fix this, I didn't go randomly deleting files
[01:10] <rolando> hola
[01:10] <rolando> is it possible to set a different language for a different account in my pc?
[01:11] <rolando> under system-languages it sets a global language so things like FF or amule are in the same language in different accounts
[01:11] <ailean> roland, do you want different apps in different languages?
[01:11] <ailean> rolando, even
[01:12] <rolando> yes in different accounts
[01:12] <roland> ailean: no thanks, ask rolando
[01:12] <roland> :))
[01:12] <ailean> rolando, or just different language settings for each account
[01:12] <ailean> roland, got it :)
[01:12] <ailean> sorry
[01:12] <roland> np
[01:12] <rolando> firefox wont change language unless i change the "global" language
[01:12] <ailean> oh
[01:12] <ailean> the user preferences should be under your home directory...
[01:13] <rolando> ailean: system-languages
[01:13] <superkirbyartist> Every time I restart ubuntu it changes the keyboard to a language I don't like and I have to go to the terminal to change it.  How do I fix that?
[01:13] <rolando> to change that you need a sudo password, and then i go to the other account and its been changed
[01:14] <superkirbyartist> So if I type "sudo setxkb..."
[01:14] <superkirbyartist> The change will be system-wide?
[01:14] <superkirbyartist> I typed "sudo setxkbmap ca -variant fr".
[01:14] <ailean> rolando, select the languages you want to be supported
[01:15] <ailean> rolando, then on the login screen, you can select which language to use for each user
[01:15] <sc0tt_> :P
[01:15] <jedi__> Just installedberyl, but now i cant move windows & the close n minimise squares r gone? How do i get around this?
[01:15] <superkirbyartist> Okay people, I can't change my language.
[01:15] <ailean> jedi__, go to #ubuntu-xgl
[01:15] <superkirbyartist> Beryl looks ugly on me to.
[01:16] <jedi__> ailean, ok then
[01:16] <jedi__> y:P
[01:16] <ailean> superkirbyartist, System, Admin, Language support
[01:16] <incorrect> other than echo 1 into ip4_forward, what do i need to do to enable routing?
=== yota_ is now known as yotaff
[01:17] <superkirbyartist> More like: "DON'TDownload Gaim: http://gaim.sourceforge.net"
[01:18] <ailean> what do you mean superkirbyartist
[01:18] <rolando> ailean: that is easier said than done, i selected and installed then languages i want to be supported, but then dont know where to chose what language for what user
[01:19] <ailean> rolando, you choose it when they are logging in, i believe
[01:19] <superkirbyartist> Because everyone banned me and usually they unban me in one day but it's the third day they didn't.  Also, Kopete is better, has more features, and is more stable than Gaym.
[01:19] <rolando> ailean: ok, but i think nie, ill keep looking through the menus, but im starting to think that it not possible
[01:19] <ailean> superkirbyartist, that is someone's work, don't slag it off
[01:20] <seshomaru123> hi can anyone tell me where TTF fonts are stored?
[01:20] <ailean> rolando, yes, it is
[01:20] <superkirbyartist> They say "oh we're working on video" and never do it.
[01:20] <ailean> rolando, i've done it
[01:20] <ailean> rolando, just as you can select whether you want Gnome or KDE when logging in, you can select language
[01:20] <mypapit> superkirbyartist??
[01:20] <mypapit> superkirbyartist: kopete? is it like gaim?

[01:30] <toogreen> can anyone help?
[01:31] <cpk1> how can i increase how many lines my tty keeps?
[01:32] <webben> bayzider, 1) you can't there is no flash 8 for Linux
[01:32] <webben> bayzider, but...
[01:32] <webben> bayzider, 2) there is a flash 7.x and there is a flash 9 beta
[01:32] <webben> (I recommend the later)
[01:33] <bayzider> webben: then how do I get flash 9 beta?
[01:33] <ubinsp> but there is a bug in flash9 + mozilla on 6.10
[01:33] <ubinsp> or firefox
[01:33] <webben> ubinsp, a bug? seems to largely work for me.
[01:33] <ubinsp> you lust had 2 code line
[01:34] <bayzider> umm none of this helping me =\ how do I install it?
[01:34] <webben> ubinsp, /possibly/ makes a difference I mainly use the official Mozilla binary but I doubt it
[01:34] <bayzider> /get it
[01:34] <webben> ubinsp, is it a bad bug
[01:34] <ubinsp> for me, firefox and mozilla start, worked 0,1s and closed
[01:34] <webben> bayzider, patience
[01:35] <webben> bayzider, http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2006/10/beta_is_live.html
[01:35] <yutaro> #Arequipa
[01:35] <webben> bayzider, you'll need to extract it, put the library (ends in .so) somewhere, and then link it to your firefox plugins directory
[01:35] <ubinsp> Who has a dell inspiron 9400/E1705, with a nvidia 7900GS graphic card on 6.10? When I want to increase or decrease the light of my laptop screen, the session starts again, so I can't change it. Who can help me? that functioned well on my old inspiron 9300 on 6.06.
[01:35] <njan> ubinsp, please stop continually asking that.
[01:35] <bayzider> webben: so I download it from here http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/ ?
[01:36] <webben> e.g. ln -s /path/to/<flash9plugin>.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
[01:36] <webben> bayzider, yep
[01:36] <Keyseir> ubotu, please tell ubinsp about forums
[01:36] <bayzider> Once I have it downloaded what do I do ?
[01:36] <webben> bayzider, unpack the archive
[01:36] <vindrake> 8888559885
[01:36] <bayzider> ok one sec
[01:36] <webben> pull out the .so file and put it somewhere sensible
[01:37] <webben> bayzider, then do the linking command I just gave you an example of
[01:37] <bayzider> ln -s /path/to/<flash9plugin>.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
[01:37] <bayzider> just but that in the terminal and press enter?
[01:38] <webben> bayzider: well obviously you need to adjust it to the actual path and filename of your flashplugin
[01:38] <webben> bayzider, and you'll need to do that as sudo
[01:39] <ubinsp> forums, forums, forums...
[01:39] <bayzider> sudo ln -s /path/to/Desktop/u.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/    (I renamed the foler as u* (with out the star) )
[01:41] <bayzider> Webben it didnt work
[01:41] <webben> bayzider, er what's "the foler"
[01:41] <bayzider> folder*
[01:42] <webben> bayzider, so you didn't extract the so from the archive?
[01:42] <webben> did my instructions include renaming anything?
[01:42] <bayzider> ummm no I just do that cause it cuts down on typing
[01:43] <webben> bayzider, I wouldn't do that with browser plugins
[01:43] <webben> bayzider, in any case, please redownload the archive and tell me where you've put it and what it's called
[01:44] <bayzider> its Desktop/flash-player-plugin-9.0.21.55
[01:45] <cpk1> how can i change how many lines tty shows?

[01:45] <webben> bayzider, okay and what's the so file inside?
[01:45] <bayzider> webben , libflashplayer.so
[01:46] <cpk1> gyop: that only shows the history for that particular terminal though =)
[01:46] <webben> bayzider, sudo rm /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/u.so (or whatever you called it)
[01:46] <javiolo> networking
[01:47] <javiolo> agh
[01:47] <webben> bayzider, then bayzider, sudo ln -s ~/Desktop/flash-player-plugin-9.0.21.55/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
[01:47] <bayzider> sudo rm /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so  ?
[01:47] <webben> bayzider, whatever you linked it as
[01:47] <bayzider> ok ok
[01:47] <webben> bayzider, then close /all/ instances of firefox and mozilla
[01:48] <gyop> cpk1:  it gives my entry..

[02:32] <JuJuBee> warkruid : remote desktop allowed me (yesterday) to take control of a linux box from a linux box as long as someone was logged into it.
[02:32] <MAXIMUS24> so guys  common just give me a step to step help on how to instal gparted on ubunto
[02:32] <MAXIMUS24> just one time
[02:32] <MAXIMUS24> i promise
[02:32] <p0ok> MAXIMUS24, it was given to you
[02:32] <p0ok> by nothlit, you did not do it, just scroll up and do it
[02:33] <SimiGodBeOs> has any one use ?knoppix live Os before i need some help
[02:33] <allz> warkruid what<?
[02:33] <allz> please someone help me :S i am trying to update or install my nvidia card .what linux-restricted-modules should i install :S
[02:33] <nothlit> MAXIMUS24, we did. again. Click the top left applications button, then click accessories, then terminal, after that, type sudo aptitude install gparted  then type your password in and hit enter
[02:34] <nothlit> SimiGodBeOs, what do you need help on, also, this is an ubuntu help channel, you should try ##linux
[02:34] <SimiGodBeOs> ok sorry,
[02:34] <azcazandco> octan: you still about?
[02:34] <octan> im here
[02:35] <azcazandco> doesnt look like the drive has been picked up, any suggestions?
[02:35] <azcazandco> I only put in one to start with
[02:35] <JuJuBee> warkruid : I have a classroom with all linux boxes.  I wish to be able to remotely control a computer (to installs and the like) as well as share my screen out if possible.
[02:35] <msnider> Can someone let me know why I should switch from Windows to Ubuntu, having issues with maiing the jump
[02:35] <msnider> just want some opinions besides the "its free" arugment
[02:35] <ameyer> it's more secure?
[02:35] <azcazandco> msnider: it is fun, I made the jump a few mths ago and love it
[02:35] <octan> azcazandco, make sure the jumpers on the disk is correct
[02:36] <p0ok> msnider:  see usenet, comp.os.linux.advocacy
[02:36] <p0ok> :)
[02:36] <MAXIMUS24> OK NOTHLID NOW WE ARE GETTIN SOMEWHERE
[02:36] <azcazandco> it says no jumper for master
[02:36] <nothlit> JuJuBee, are you using edubuntu?
[02:36] <JuJuBee> msnider : I made the jump about 8 months ago and no longer use windows.
[02:36] <nothlit> MAXIMUS24, MAXIMUS I ALREADY TOLD YOU ALL THIS ( and please don't use caps)
[02:36] <JuJuBee> nothilt : no kubuntu
[02:36] <octan> azcazandco, ok, did you try both plugs on the cable?
[02:36] <azcazandco> octan: it is the only one on IDE 1 on my motherboard
[02:36] <msnider> hmmm may have to look into it, only thing holding me back is newsleecher( newsreader) and world of warcraft really
[02:36] <azcazandco> nope
[02:37] <azcazandco> just one of them
[02:37] <MAXIMUS24> yeah u did but i thought that sudo is another program i need to get installed
[02:37] <MAXIMUS24> :(
[02:37] <SimiGodBeOs> i never jumped i was push to linux..
[02:37] <azcazandco> I *think* the cable is in the right way on the mboard
[02:37] <JuJuBee> msnider : wow available for linix I think...
[02:37] <msnider> through wine yes
[02:37] <zypherone> A few guides for the fglrx driver install are not specifying that sudo is needed for the ati-driver-installer script..but it's complaining about not being able to write to /usr/X11R6/bin, am I doing something wrong?
[02:37] <nothlit> JuJuBee, kde has a remote desktop server built in, don't really know how it works, or you can use X11vncserver
[02:37] <octan> azcazandco, the cable has 3 plugs.. 1 on the mobo. 2 for disks.. try set it on the other plug for he disks.. also check your bios settings
[02:38] <azcazandco> okay brb
[02:38] <azcazandco> will try the other plug
[02:38] <MAXIMUS24> Setting up ntfsprogs (1.12.1-1) ...
[02:38] <MAXIMUS24> ipac@ipac-desktop:~$ gparted
[02:38] <MAXIMUS24> ipac@ipac-desktop:~$
[02:38] <MAXIMUS24> this is what i got
[02:38] <nothlit> zypherone, any driver installation requires root permissions.
[02:38] <MAXIMUS24> and it sais somethiong like  this Root privileges are required for running GParted
[02:38] <MAXIMUS24> Since GParted can be a weapon of mass destruction only root may run it.
[02:39] <warkruid> JuJuBee: upgrading via vnc is not very practical, but it should be possible to slave the other linux boxes displays to the main terminal
[02:39] <p0ok> sudo gparted
[02:39] <nothlit> MAXIMUS24, <like i said> go to system -> administration -> gparted
[02:39] <JuJuBee> I am using vncserver and it allows me to login to a remote computer fine.  But now I cannot view the screen of a logged in user.  Before I installed vncserver on the student computer, I just used remote desktop and that allowed me to view the screen of whoever was logged in and control it.
[02:39] <SimiGodBeOs> do any one know were you updaate files, line xp update, i able to downloal them all ,, then i can use apt to update my whole os ,, for i can't use wireless or dialup, in unbuntu 6.10
[02:39] <MAXIMUS24> geez i am stupid
[02:39] <Arcad3> i have a 953 port open ....can someone tell me for what iti is?
[02:39] <MAXIMUS24> windows got me stupid
[02:40] <zypherone> nothlit: It's just that these guides explicitly don't specify it (while they certainly do for other commands)
[02:40] <warkruid> JuJuBee: Before = windows?
[02:40] <nothlit> JuJuBee, like i said, use kde's remote desktop or install x11vncserver. the regular vncserver doesn't access the native desktop
[02:40] <SimiGodBeOs> files, to download . on tar
[02:40] <JuJuBee> no, before I installed vncserver on the student computers
[02:40] <warkruid> JuJuBee: Oh sry misunderstood
[02:40] <nothlit> JuJuBee, a REGULAR vncserver does not allow you to see the native desktop.
[02:41] <MAXIMUS24> nothlid now how to i make the other 2 partitions visible in computer?
[02:41] <JuJuBee> nothlit : will that allow me to login if nobody is logged into the box?
[02:41] <nothlit> JuJuBee, which is why gnome and kde have their own or you have to use a regular one
[02:41] <JuJuBee> so I use kde and some students also use kde but others prefer gnome.  What do i do?
[02:42] <fulldisclosure> Hi.
[02:42] <warkruid> JuJuBee: install ssh demon on box? then you can log in on it?
[02:42] <nothlit> JuJuBee, you'll have to tie it in to kdm, or look into kde's default, I don't have kde installed on this particular computer so i can't help you
[02:42] <nothlit> JuJuBee, install gnome, sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[02:42] <nothlit> JuJuBee, they can always choose which one from sessions
[02:42] <fulldisclosure> Is here someone using a macbook under Linux?
[02:42] <JuJuBee> I have it installed, but I prefer kde to gnome.
[02:42] <CarinArr> can i put an alias for an ip address to save me from remembering it all the time?
[02:43] <|ubinsp|> hello again
[02:43] <warkruid> JuJuBee: but from ssh you are only logged in under a shell, not a desktop
[02:43] <nothlit> JuJuBee, also, you may one to install Gnome Menu Extended and K Menu Gnome, (look in gnome/kde - look/apps), it keeps the gnome and kde menus seperate
[02:43] <Crankymonky> CarinArr, dns servers--dyndns.org
[02:43] <nothlit> may want to *
[02:43] <fulldisclosure> Is here someone using a macbook under Linux? Query me please.
[02:43] <minimec> progek: we fergot something ;)
[02:43] <warkruid> JuJubee: but ssh will allow you to do upgrades remotely
[02:43] <progek> minimec: That worked great, thanks. The environment worked. I also set up javac for compiling :)
[02:44] <nothlit> warkruid, he wants to be able to see his student's screens i think, and also wants to let them see his
[02:44] <progek> I just needed to log out/in
[02:44] <JuJuBee> Correct...
[02:44] <progek> like you said
[02:44] <CarinArr> Crankymonky, well it's a static ip, i can bind a dns to it, but i more meant just add an alias so whenever i'm using a terminal i can use an alias instead of the ip address
[02:44] <warkruid> nothlit: I understand, but he also asked about upgrades.
[02:44] <MAXIMUS24> how to i make  all partitions visible in my computer ?with  Gparted
[02:44] <minimec> progek Ok. np
[02:45] <Crankymonky> CarinArr, you mean on the machine it's on?  I'm not sure how to do that><
[02:45] <Crankymonky> Also not entirely sure what that'd be good for or what you want to do:P
[02:45] <progek> minimec: one question, I have java 5 selected on my java alternatives and I just downloaded limewire. However, each time I try running it I get-> runLime.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[02:45] <progek> that does not seem like a java error
[02:45] <CarinArr> well what i mean is, when i'm at work, it's handy to just ssh/scp whatever to my home machine to get stuff from it, but i can never remember the ip address
[02:45] <JuJuBee> CarinArr : put the alias in .bashrc file (there are some examples there) I do it on my box for the same reason...
[02:45] <sally2> anyone know how to solve this?
[02:45] <sally2> Failed to start Volume Control: Failed to execute child process "gnome-volume-control" (No such file or directory)
[02:46] <warkruid> progek: shell error, running under incorrect shell?
[02:46] <JuJuBee> CarinArr : alias someName="ssh user@ip.address.here"
[02:46] <progek> I used dapper before edgy and never had this problem, I was using fedora core 6 for a while then tried edgy
[02:46] <progek> hmm
[02:46] <warkruid> progek: sry shell _scipt_ error
[02:46] <fulldisclosure> Is here someone using a macbook under Linux? Query me please.
[02:46] <JuJuBee> CarinArr: then at shell just type someName and it will ssh to the ip add
[02:46] <progek> warkruid: I don't know, if I run it from the menu nothing happens. Do you know how I can fix this?
[02:47] <warkruid> progek: dunno, don't have the script. paste it to ubuntupaste.nl ??
[02:47] <CarinArr> jujubee, yeah i've done that already, but i connect ot it using a lot of different ways, so it would be nice if you could just sort of alias only the ip address
[02:47] <CarinArr> i was sure there was an easy way to do it
[02:47] <CarinArr> but i can't for the life of me remember how
[02:48] <webben> CarinArr, /etc/hosts
[02:48] <JuJuBee> so create multiple alias'  like ftpServerName, sshServerName ... each with its own protocol
[02:48] <CarinArr> ta webben
[02:48] <webben> CarinArr, man hosts for details
[02:48] <CarinArr> webben, that was what i was looking for, thanks
[02:49] <progek> warkuid: Where would I find the script? I went to limewires site and downloaded the rpm. I then used alien to convert it into a deb and depackaged that. I also tried reinstalling the deb by right clicking the package but I get the same error. I can always use gnutella but kind of like limewire :(
[02:49] <minimec> progek: Hmmm... Did you check that line44 in runLime.sh?
[02:49] <tbf> uh.... uh... uh.... what can i do for blocking this stupid "single close button" part of this tabconsistency spec? (https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/tab-consistency)
[02:49] <tbf> or isn't it possible as mark is backing it?
[02:50] <warkruid> progek: try "sh ./<packagename>
[02:50] <minimec> progek: This doesn't seem to be a java problem. there seems to be a missing '}' on that line 44 ...
[02:50] <warkruid> progek: sry ..  sh ./<packagename> in a shell
[02:50] <webben> tbf, why is it so problematic?
[02:51] <progek> sh ./limewire-free_4.12.6-1_i386.deb
[02:51] <progek> ./limewire-free_4.12.6-1_i386.deb: 1: Syntax error: newline unexpected
[02:51] <progek> hmm
[02:51] <matti> progek: You want to execute a deb file?
[02:51] <mooey> tbf, discussion should probably have been raised during UDS
[02:51] <progek> that is all I have, well that and the rpm I converted
[02:52] <mooey> progek, dpkg -i limewire-free-[tab] .deb
[02:52] <warkruid> progek: sry. didn't realize it was a .deb package..
[02:52] <tbf> webben: 'cause it detatches the action from the object, cause it forces me to use the mouse for long distances and more importantly cause i've use that interface regulary caused me to close too much tabs accidently in firefox 1.5 and visual studio 2003
[02:52] <progek> mooey: thanks, I originally did that to install it but has an error trying to start limewire
[02:53] <mooey> progek, ah sorry. didn't see the original question.
[02:53] <tbf> mooey: since when are flights for free and since when do you expect even users to attend such meetings?
[02:53] <philipsmith> I'm running Gnome and want to load KDE, also. I tried: "sudo apt-get kubuntu-desktop" and it didn't work. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!
[02:53] <fulldisclosure> Conoceis una buena base de datos de diccionario ingles / espa y un buen frontend para este?
[02:53] <progek> maybe I should look for an older version
[02:53] <mooey> tbf, you can join the discussion remotely and for free =)
[02:53] <cpk1> philipsmith: you missed "install"
[02:53] <philipsmith> cpkl: Many thanks!
[02:53] <tbf> mooey: how?
[02:54] <ameyer> IRC (I assume)?
[02:54] <mooey> tbf, there are voice communications, gobby, mailing lists etc.
[02:54] <minimec> progek: I rarly had success with alien ;) Maybe you have to compile it manually and do a 'checkinstall' to have a *.deb file in the end.
[02:55] <webben> tbf: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TabConsistency says commentary is needing from accessibility community
[02:55] <webben> this moving the mouse problem probably falls under that head
[02:55] <progek> minimec: thanks, but I think I will just use gnutella for now. Any way to remove limewire? I tried aptitude remove limewire but it is not found. If i go to add/remove programs it does not show under internet either.
[02:56] <webben> tbf, looks like you could just add a comment at the end there
[02:56] <mooey> tbf, i'm in agreement though. i think its not a helpful change to make.
[02:56] <webben> tbf, I recommend being as detailed as possible though; and if possible suggest alternate solutions
[02:57] <minimec> progek: You did sudo aptitude remove limewire-free ? Your file is called limewire-free****.de
[02:57] <iratik> I downloaded the ubuntu edgy ISO, when I attempt to install ubuntu, it loads a graphical user interface and boots to a live version of the kernel. Is there a way to install the text mode way, i mean not by booting on the live kernel first ? (The live kernel simply runs too slow, and this is on a dual core amd 64 1.5ghz)?
[02:57] <mooey> ubuntu should at least follow GTK, and if firefox behaves differently, thats a firefox bug
[02:57] <progek> minimec: thanks :)
[02:57] <minimec> progek: ;)
[02:58] <webben> tbf: Note that according to Mark, they keep getting reports of accidental closures with a close button on each tab.
[02:58] <Oni-Dracula> what's up with the wolfenstein installer stalling after asking for pw
[02:58] <webben> tbf: It may be /fewer/ people have closure problems with a single close tab button.
[02:58] <Oni-Dracula> nvm have to sudo sh
[02:59] <tbf> webben: well, guess someone should make a usuablity study on that issue then
[02:59] <MAXIMUS24> hey guys i tried installing the nvidia driver  but it sais ''Error:Dependency is not satisiable:  nvidia kernel-1.0.7184
[02:59] <webben> tbf: Note the reference to some Google study at the end
[02:59] <webben> tbf: you might try and find that
[02:59] <bintut> is there a howto somewhere for X Font Server on Ubuntu Dapper LTS?
[03:00] <tbf> webben: well, but as i also meet _few_ people having problems with the single button behaviour, it might be, that there a just two kinds of people
[03:00] <Tockers> Hey, folk. I request assistance! D:
[03:00] <iratik> What i'm asking is there a way to install ubuntu edgy via text mode (like the old style), I don't want it to install using the live boot-up. Help?
[03:00] <tbf> people who get along better with single button and people how get along better with tab button
[03:00] <webben> tbf: Well, yeah, but I assume Mark is referring to a differing quantity of user feedback. Perhaps you should argue it needs to be user configurable one way or the other.
[03:01] <webben> tbf: the key idea is to have a consistent interface
[03:01] <tbf> without trying to insult someone i have the _feeling_ those two groups can be split along their capability to organize/abstract things
[03:01] <mooey> tbf, i think that the spec mentions that it should be configurable upstream, and that ubuntu should default to having a button on each tab
[03:01] <fulldisclosure> Is here someone using a macbook under Linux? Query me please.
[03:01] <mooey> but that it would be configurable, i guess
=== AfterDeath_ is now known as AfterDeath
[03:01] <webben> mooey, no the spec says Ubuntu should default to having one button for all the tabs AFAICT
[03:02] <webben> tbf: or maybe just how good their mouse control is?
[03:02] <webben> tbf: or what they're used to
[03:02] <mooey> webben, yep. but the idea is to implement it upstream and be configurable. so with a gconf key, you could swap it to your desired behaviour
[03:02] <webben> tbf: lots of possible reasons
[03:03] <iratik> I need to install ubuntu without using a graphical user interface for the install, can anyone point me in the general direction to go to find out where to learn how to do this ?
[03:04] <meng> <iratik> get the alternate disc
[03:04] <iratik> meng: url?
[03:04] <meng> i don't know which to give you
[03:04] <meng> i don't live in the US
[03:04] <meng> for me, Korean mirrors are good
[03:06] <meng> but alternate images are availible alongside the regular CDs
[03:06] <iratik> alright
[03:06] <Dink> Anyone testing feisty ???
[03:07] <meng> is that even out?
[03:07] <Dink> for testing yes
[03:07] <dade`> i'm using feisty
[03:07] <mooey> dade`, how is it?
[03:07] <dade`> works
[03:07] <mooey> lol
[03:07] <Dink> did you update today ? I noticed it was asking to remove kubuntu-desktop
[03:07] <meng> powershell seems less dangerous than feisty for me
[03:08] <dade`> there is compiz, desktop-effect, a new gnome-bluetooth and gnome-power-manager
[03:08] <dade`> it's cool
[03:08] <dade`> the .19 kernel
[03:08] <mooey> dade`, compiz is enabled by default?
[03:08] <dade`> mooey don' know but it is if you install desktop-effects
[03:08] <mooey> cool
[03:09] <minimec> dade`: That gnome-bluetooth thing  sounds interesting... Did you have a closer look at that?
[03:10] <dade`> there is an gnome-panel applet providing some basic settings fro bluetooth
[03:10] <dade`> for
[03:10] <allz> please someone help me :S i am trying to update or install my nvidia card .what linux-restricted-modules should i install :S

[03:12] <gimmulf> Hi, just ran an update all and installed edgy, when i rebooted X doesnt start.. seems like it cant find the nvidia modules
[03:13] <allz> hello how to check if my nvidia card is installd ?
[03:13] <allz> what command in konsole allowes me to check
[03:13] <noiano> hello
[03:15] <tbf> mooey: left my objections
[03:15] <mooey> tbf, cool :)
[03:16] <minimec> allz: what exactly do you want to do? Do you want to check *D mode or what?
[03:16] <tbf> mooey: hopefully seb128 and mark read them, before making single button the default
[03:16] <tbf> s/default/only option/
[03:17] <incorrect> is there anyway to could show my squid access log to network users via a web interface?
[03:17] <mooey> tbf, it wont ever be the only option. it might be good to voice your concerns on the accessibility mailing list, too
[03:17] <darkox> hello

[03:22] <dcordes> my ubuntu just removed 30 gig of my music. i had an empty folder which i wanted to remove: /media/Externe Festplatte, which i wanted to get rid of. so i did sudo rm -r /media/Externe\ Festplatte  ... the folder did not disappear and i was wondring why it took so long. then i've seen all my music albums were gone. what did i do wrong and is there a way to get those albums back?
[03:22] <axisys> !qemu
[03:22] <ubotu> qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
[03:23] <dcordes> dcordes: oh sorry for repeating. i'm pretty angry at the moment :-( can't concentrate
[03:23] <mooey> darkox, see http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_mount_Windows_partitions_.28NTFS.29_on_boot-up.2C_and_allow_all_users_to_read_only for some information on mounting your windows drive
[03:23] <dcordes> i kept this collection of music for years.. now it's all gone
[03:24] <mooey> dcordes, this isn't alot of use to you now, but its always wise to use 'rmdir' to remove a folder as it wont delete it if it isn't empty :(
[03:24] <darkox> i'll check that out, but i have another question
[03:24] <darkox> i switched to ubuntu after i saw this video
[03:24] <darkox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZtcxHUSDQ
[03:24] <darkox> how can i get ubuntu to do that??
[03:24] <[maTa] > how to configure haldeamon: when i put usb modem to mount it like modem, not like usb device (/dev/sda1 )
[03:24] <mooey> dcordes, if /media/Externe\ Festplatte was mounted then an rf -r would remove all the items inside that mount
[03:25] <julip> hi all
[03:25] <dcordes> mooey: i think i will allways to this from now.. but tell me is there any chance to get this back? and how could it happen? i pointed to a different folder
[03:25] <javiolo> I installed ssh any idea why is not a .ssh folder on my home folder ?
[03:25] <dcordes> mooey: the folder was empty and there was nothing behind it. no mounting
[03:25] <Rob125> darkox: that's a combination of beryl, kiba-dock, and g-desklets
[03:25] <dcordes> mooey: but the point is that it removed files on /media/archiv1!!
[03:25] <mooey> darkox, theres some good guides on the form for installing those applications
[03:26] <Rob125> darkox: you can start by getting beryl.
[03:26] <dcordes> that's where my albums is at

[03:26] <FaithX> dcordes: if you are running ext3 its not easy
[03:26] <quiet> is there a way to fsck an ntfs hard drive from inside ubuntu?
[03:26] <dcordes> archiv1 was ntfs!
[03:26] <navaladi> is anyone faced similar problem?
[03:27] <dcordes> FaithX, mooey: i did not even have any write rights on this drive /media/archiv1 since it was ntfs
[03:27] <dcordes> i just can't believe this
[03:27] <ndlovu> hi all. after logging into gnome, my session freezes just after entering my password. All I'm left with is a brown desktop and a mouse pointer. I can run a failsafe terminal, it seems, but not much else. any ideas how to fix it?
[03:27] <julip> am about to follow some instructions to install ifolders what does this mean: This is an  Assumptions the author is making "You have a Mono build chain on the machine to build the software" link to instructions http://www.ifolder.com/index.php/HowTo:Building_iFolder_Enterprise_Server_on_Dapper
[03:27] <warkruid> quiet: not that i know of
[03:27] <mooey> dcordes, perhaps its just unmounted, not wiped?
[03:27] <axisys> the qemu link sent by ubotu is not compatible w/ edgy
[03:27] <_joey> just how good ubuntu?
[03:27] <dcordes> mooey: it is still mounted
[03:27] <axisys> is there a qemu how to for edgy somewhere
[03:27] <dcordes> mooey: and there are 400 albums left of 600
[03:27] <mooey> _joey, its fabulous
[03:27] <minimec> darkox: Well ... You have two solutions. you can run 'xgl' with the newer ATI Cards and the Nvidia Cards, or you can use 'aiglx' with older ATI's and some few Nvidia's (there seems to be a new patch). Then you have to load some software to have the 3D effects. There is a #ubuntu-xgl channel. ;)
[03:27] <_joey> mooey sure?
[03:27] <dcordes> mooey: very strange isn't it?!
[03:27] <FaithX> dcordes: then don't wory you can get your data back in windows
[03:27] <mooey> dcordes, perhaps they are unrelated. i dont know how stable ntfs support under linux is. maybe its corruption?
[03:27] <bintut> anyone?
[03:28] <[maTa] > how to configure haldeamon: when i put usb modem to mount it like modem, not like usb device (/dev/sda1 )
[03:28] <dcordes> FaithX: really?? how
[03:28] <FaithX> you just need to ge a decent tool to do it
[03:28] <dcordes> FaithX: what kind of tool?
[03:28] <julip> i have just installed 6.06 server LAMP install do i have Mono build chain on the machine
[03:28] <minimec> darkox:  If you are new to Linux and Ubuntu... it might be a little bit difficult ;)
[03:28] <dcordes> first i will remount it
[03:28] <FaithX> dcordes: undeleter
[03:29] <_joey> can I install ubuntu on my Pentium III ?
[03:29] <ndlovu> is there some way to reset my gnome profile so that it loads properly?
[03:29] <dcordes> i allways thought about moving all my media files to an ext3 partition.... now i have the result for not doint it :/
[03:29] <julip> joey yes
[03:29] <mooey> _joey, for sure, that will be no problem
[03:29] <mooey> ndlovu, when logging in, choose 'gnome default' as your session
[03:29] <_joey> okay
[03:29] <julip> anyone know anything about mono
[03:29] <julip> i have just installed 6.06 server LAMP install do i have Mono build chain on the machine
[03:30] <ndlovu> mooey, I've tried that and it still does exactly the same thing
[03:30] <mooey> dcordes, i feel your pain :( i've toasted gigs of music before its not fun
[03:30] <dcordes> mooey: i remounted but the files won't appear again
[03:30] <dcordes> 30
[03:30] <dcordes> :((
[03:30] <mooey> :'(
[03:30] <dcordes> such a damn pita
[03:30] <_joey> I have shitloads on my hard disk too
[03:30] <minimec> _joey: Yes you can, but you need at least 256m RAM, if you don't want to die (or fell asleep) in front of your computer
[03:30] <mooey> ndlovu, what happens when you login with the default session?
[03:30] <_joey> minimec of course I don't
[03:31] <_joey> :)
[03:31] <javiolo> I installed ssh, any idea why isnt a .ssh folder ?
[03:31] <dcordes> well i will boot an xp and see if the files are there
[03:31] <bintut> i just installed ubuntu server dapper and when i apt-get install over the internet, i got this ==>  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32110/
[03:31] <julip> joey are you using it as a server or desktop
[03:31] <_joey> minimec I've heard linux can be installed on small devices such as Linksys wireless routers etc
[03:31] <mooey> bintut, do you have any third party repositories?
[03:31] <ndlovu> after entering my password, it just gives me a brown desktop with mouse pointer (which I can move). I can also switch to other terminals with Ctl+Alt+Function keys. That's pretty much it.
[03:31] <mooey> _joey, linux runs on pretty much anything :)
[03:32] <minimec> _joey: I have a Debian etch machine here with xorg, that I use as server. No problem ...
[03:32] <_joey> julip as a server
[03:32] <julip> joey look for openwrt
[03:32] <julip> openwrt for linksys
[03:32] <mooey> dcordes, good luck :x
[03:32] <julip> ubuntu server will not install a gui
[03:32] <dcordes> mooey: you know a file undeleter for xp?
[03:32] <julip> no X
[03:32] <dcordes> ntfs
[03:32] <julip> will make your P3 go faster
[03:32] <_joey> that's good, I don't like the X
[03:32] <mooey> dcordes, i dont i'm afraid. i've never used windows ;o
[03:33] <darkox> i tried sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak and i am getting cp: cannot stat `/ext/fstab': no such file or directory
[03:33] <julip> download 6.06 server edition
[03:33] <mooey> darkox, its /etc , not /ext :)
[03:33] <casano> how do I get scroll whell running for ubuntu6.10 and an ibm thinkpad x23 ?
[03:33] <minimec> _joey: Yes. These are firmwares, from the linksys community. I have the same thing with an asus router. There I can load and install a different firmeware too.
[03:33] <_joey> julip can I get the minimal install cd disk image, install the base and add the package I need later?
[03:34] <bintut> mooey: check out my /etc/apt/sources.list at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32111/
[03:34] <julip> yup thats the server install
[03:34] <_joey> minimec I have sveasoft running on mine.
[03:34] <kotschleuder> _joey: sveasoft is evil
[03:34] <_joey> it comes with a nifty web interface
[03:34] <ndlovu> maybe it's time to try out xfce or some other light window manager...
[03:34] <_joey> Yes, I know. I still like it.
[03:35] <lancelan> anyone know Phil Wyett ???
[03:35] <MenZa> ndlovu: Xfce is nice for smaller systems, like my P3j
[03:35] <MenZa> P3*
[03:35] <mooey> ndlovu, anything revealing in ~/.xsession-errors ?
[03:35] <MenZa> lancelan: ...who?
[03:35] <julip> but if its a server Y install X at all
[03:35] <ndlovu> mooey: ooh, that sounds like the sort of place I want to look
[03:36] <lancelan> MenZa, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/philwyett
[03:36] <darkox> i tired ect and didn't work
[03:36] <MenZa> lancelan: I'd try #ubuntu-uk
[03:36] <lancelan> thanks
[03:36] <MenZa> !seen Philwyett
[03:36] <ubotu> I haven't seen philwyett recently
[03:36] <MenZa> He hasn't been on recently, apparently.
[03:36] <darkox> can someone walk me thru thus step by step, over pm
[03:37] <ndlovu> mooey, there doesn't seem to be anything there ringing alarm bells
[03:37] <lancelan> MenZa, I know that much :)
[03:37] <MenZa> lancelan: :D
[03:37] <_joey> does ubuntu support wifi?
[03:38] <allz> hi! what ubuntu do i have .ubuntu edgy (6.10) OR ubuntu breezy (5.10) or ubuntu dapper?
[03:38] <allz> can someone help me .what command in konsole to check what ubuntu i am using
[03:38] <LjL> allz, lsb_release -a
[03:38] <ndlovu> how simple is it to switch between window managers? Can I switch between gnome and xfce at the same time?
[03:39] <allz> ljl codename is dapper .so i am using ubuntu dapper?
[03:39] <LjL> ndlovu, click on Options on your login screen, if you're using GDM
[03:39] <minimec> ndlovu: Try to create a new user on the console and login with a gnome session. <ctrl><alt><f1>login ... then sudo adduser gnometest ...  then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart && exit
[03:39] <LjL> allz, no, if it says the codename is dapper, it means you're using feisty
[03:39] <LjL> ... yes you are
[03:39] <julip> i have just installed 6.06 server LAMP install do i have Mono build chain on the machine HELP Please
[03:39] <julip> am about to follow some instructions to install ifolders what does this mean: This is an  Assumptions the author is making "You have a Mono build chain on the machine to build the software" link to instructions http://www.ifolder.com/index.php/HowTo:Building_iFolder_Enterprise_Server_on_Dapper
[03:40] <darkox> i tired ect and didn't work
[03:40] <darkox> can someone walk me thru thus step by step, over pm
[03:40] <ndlovu> minimec, thanks, I'll try that.
[03:40] <mooey> allz, lsb_release will tell you
[03:40] <allz> ljl what should i pick then ? please check the site for me -> http://www.winehq.com/site/download-deb
[03:40] <azcazandco> hi everyone, I have just installed a new ide drive and want to install dapper 64bit on it, I currently run edgy on a sata drive, what is the best way to install and then get all of my mail etc accross to my new install?  Ideally, I would like to create a home partition on my new drive and use that instead of the usual /home/userdir setup
[03:40] <LjL> allz, pick what corresponds to your distribution.
[03:40] <minimec> ndlovu: If this works you can rename your /home directory and login with a clean gnome session.
[03:40] <mooey> allz, lsb_release -a
[03:40] <_joey> LjL groovy, nice command to print out the release
[03:40] <mooey> even
[03:40] <allz> Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS that is what i am on
[03:40] <allz> so i am using ubuntu dapper
[03:41] <LjL> allz, yeees
[03:41] <allz> why did you sayid no?
[03:41] <LjL> if it says dapper, it's probably dapper, you know
[03:41] <allz> then ljl :S
[03:41] <ndlovu> minimec, would I then copy everything back again to the "new" home directory afterwards?
[03:41] <allz> [14:39]  <LjL> allz, no, if it says the codename is dapper, it means you're using feisty
[03:41] <allz> i sayid i am using ubuntu dapper then ? .then you sayid this
[03:42] <mooey> ndlovu, copying settings files is likely to cause the same problem again. do you get the splash screen come up?
[03:42] <mooey> LjL, sarcasm dosen't translate well on the internet
[03:42] <ndlovu> mooey, the gdm comes up, but not the splash screen showing what's loading up
[03:43] <minimec> ndlovu: Well you can copy your files and some of your .conf directories like .mozilla or so. But not the .gnome .gnome2 directories ;)
[03:43] <ndlovu> mooey, if copying settings files causes the same problem, could I not just find the right file to delete and "get rid of the problem"
[03:44] <mooey> ndlovu, in theory, yep :)
[03:44] <minimec> ndlovu: Normally ... yes.
[03:44] <ndlovu> minimec, what about just deleting the .gnome and .gnome2 directories from my profile?
[03:44] <LjL> mooey, frustration does though
[03:44] <ndlovu> minimec, or my home directory at least...
[03:44] <minimec> ndlovu: these are not the only possibilities for your problem ;)
[03:45] <mooey> LjL, if you are frusrated with users then its better for your blood pressure to not speak with them :p
[03:45] <minimec> ndlovu: I would rather rename your /home/yourname directory to /home/yourname-old ... then create a new directory /home/yourname ;)
[03:45] <ndlovu> minimec, true. call me lazy, but the idea of copying across all the .config directories is not driving me wild ;)
[03:46] <mooey> ndlovu, does /usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop have exec=/usr/bin/gnome-session ?
[03:46] <edgy__> Hi, I am new to this aiglx stuff and I followed the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/AIGLXOnEdgy but now don't know how to see the effects, any hint?
[03:46] <brynk_> x-ien
[03:46] <azcazandco> any suggestions folks?  can I just go on with the install then copy files across at a later date?  I am guessing it'll just add an option in grub?
[03:47] <allz> ljl is there a way to take some files from windows ,cause i am duel booted ,?
[03:47] <ndlovu> mooey, yup
[03:47] <zach634> allz!
[03:47] <minimec> ndlovu: Do what you want. My experience shows, that to start with a clean home directory is sometimes a quiet good idea...
[03:47] <LjL> !windowsdrives | alz
[03:47] <ubotu> alz: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:47] <LjL> allz even
[03:48] <zach634> Allz: do you forgive me? :(
[03:48] <ndlovu> minimec, thanks for the suggestions; I'll probably end up going for the clean start
[03:48] <minimec> ndlovu: np
[03:49] <zach634> LjL: cant you use "sudo mount -t NTFS -o loop /dev/hda /<mount point>"
[03:49] <CarlFK> I booted edgy live on a box with an old monitor...
[03:49] <allz> zach634 yeah i forgive you .if you help me step by step how to copy one file from windows to linux
[03:49] <allz> :)
[03:49] <CarlFK>  but the monitor can't display 1024x7 so it is all flickery
[03:49] <mooey> ndlovu, if you login using the failsafe terminal session and run 'gnome-session' in the terminal, does that throw up any ideas?
=== VHockey86_ is now known as VHockey86
[03:50] <CarlFK> all I really want to do is apt-get install openssh-server
[03:50] <bintut> anyone?
[03:50] <CarlFK> anyone know the key strokes to open a terminal /bash shell?
[03:51] <bintut> i just installed ubuntu server dapper and when i apt-get install over the internet, i got this ==>  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32110/
[03:51] <ndlovu> mooey, I'll give it a go. I'll have to exit xchat though (cos it's running from failsafe terminal), so will let you know in a few minutes
[03:51] <mooey> okies
[03:51] <minimec> CarlFK: <ALT><f2>gnome-terminal<return>
[03:51] <LjL> CarlFK, alt+f2 will give you a "run" windows. don't know the keys for getting a shell - it's F4 under KDE
[03:51] <ndlovu> mooey, thanks for the troubleshooting suggestions, btw, I appreciate it!
[03:52] <minimec> CarlFK: <CTRL><ALT><f1> for the console
[03:52] <CarlFK> LjL: thanks
[03:52] <CarlFK> minimec: oh yeah!  thanks 2x
[03:52] <mooey> bintut, if you are worried about the autenticity of the package you could always download it manually and install it with dpkg
[03:53] <CarlFK> bintut: it means you added a repository that doesn't have some security thingy
[03:53] <Discerer> so... I've forgotten the pass to my mysql database, but when reinstalling or removing completely then installing, it doesn't remove my databases. anyone know where to find the database files?
[03:53] <mooey> CarlFK, he pasted his sources.list and it was pretty clean. not to mention that iptraf package is in main. its wierd.
[03:54] <mooey> Discerer, /var/lib/mysql maybe?
[03:54] <mooey> Discerer, there are processes to reset the mysql root password
[03:54] <Discerer> ok cool mooey
[03:54] <CarlFK> mooey: bintut - maybe needs a aptget update ?(i just guessing)
[03:55] <Discerer> thought you had to reinstall it and remove the tables
[03:55] <cyberfall> question oh stable is java based ftp servers
[03:55] <cyberfall> oh=how
[03:55] <allz> guys how to run spec files ?
[03:55] <allz> like msttcorefonts-2.0-1.spec
[03:55] <mooey> Discerer, you can but thats quite a brutal approach to a simply fixed problem :-) check the mysql docs they document how to reset the password
[03:55] <bintut> CarlFK: ok. thanks..
[03:55] <Discerer> yeah thanks a lot :)
[03:55] <mooey> allz, a .spec file is used for generating an RPM package and cant be run directly
[03:55] <Discerer> it's a freshly installed db so I barely mind removing the stuff but still :p might be good to know
[03:56] <allz> how do i run it mooey then?
[03:56] <allz> :z
[03:56] <darkox> i tried sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak and i am getting cp: cannot stat `/ect/fstab': no such file or directory
[03:57] <mooey> allz, if you need the MS fonts you can: aptitude install msttcorefonts
[03:57] <mooey> allz, you cant 'run' a spec file as it is just text
[03:57] <allz> ok :s
[03:57] <allz> hey does ubuntu ahve msttcorefonts?
[03:57] <Qwerty> the apt-get msttcorefonts from freecontrib (I think) are borken
[03:57] <mooey> darkox, retype the command carefully - its /etc/ not /ect/
[03:57] <screechingcat> allz: yep
[03:57] <screechingcat> allz: install them from the repos
[03:58] <mooey> allz, they are in multiverse so you will need to enable that first
[03:58] <mooey> !multiverse
[03:58] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:58] <mooey> !easysource
[03:58] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[03:58] <mooey> hm.
[03:58] <allz> mooey okei .how to enable it
[03:59] <mooey> allz, see above
[03:59] <IA-Outdoors> any laptop users here have an issue when booting the system goes to sleep because laptop lid is closed *despite* being docked with an external monitor?
[03:59] <mooey> there are links to the wiki with instructions
[03:59] <allz> mooey thanks i will use my brain once
[03:59] <allz> :)
[03:59] <IA-Outdoors> after it sleeps it comes back up OK but it's f'n annoying
[03:59] <Discerer> eh wth... getting "permission denied" when trying to kill a process (using sudo)
[03:59] <screechingcat> any edgy users tried the new xorg update ?
[03:59] <LjL> screechingcat: i haven't got any xorg update
[04:00] <screechingcat> i generally tend to be wary of these things
[04:00] <screechingcat> LjL: check now
[04:00] <LjL> screechingcat: i just checked
[04:00] <CarlFK> I booted edgy live - installed openssh-server (thanks guys) and now am trying to ssh in.  user ubuntu, right?  what is the pw?
[04:00] <screechingcat> LjL: apt-get update and upgrade and see
[04:00] <Maggotin> Hiho
[04:00] <LjL> perhaps it hasn't reached my mirrors yet if it's very new
[04:00] <LjL> i know how it's done screechingcat
[04:01] <mooey> screechingcat, the changelog looks fairly safe. only dependancies updated, no new code
[04:01] <screechingcat> LjL: yes i know that you know. otherwsie i would've typed the whole command
[04:01] <Maggotin> How do I make mplayer bigger, I mean, when I'm playing a .divx and put fullscreen on, it just gets it fullscreen, but the movie is still on that size
[04:01] <LjL> ok i'll try changing mirrors and see
[04:01] <screechingcat> mooey: cool then. i can upgrade it
[04:01] <CarlFK> Maggotin: try (z)oom
[04:01] <ndlovu> mooey, minimec, both gnome-session and logging in as a different user gave the same problem :(. Maybe reinstalling gnome is the way to go?
[04:01] <mooey> LjL, you might have it already, it was updated on the 1st
[04:02] <LjL> oh - well then yeah, i definitely have it
[04:02] <mooey> :)
[04:02] <LjL> it was an update from security iirc, i normally install those ;)
[04:02] <mooey> ndlovu, it certainly dosen't sound healthy. reinstalling gnome cant hurt :o
[04:02] <screechingcat> mooey: LjL i guess it reached me late coz my update-notifier stopped working
=== casper__ is now known as Vspirit
[04:02] <mooey> heh
[04:03] <mooey> i disabled that, drives me mad :P
[04:03] <screechingcat> i have to maunually check once in a while
[04:03] <minimec> ndlovu: This is strange ...
[04:03] <allz> mooey okey i dont seee nothing multiverse stuff for ubuntu 6.06 lts :S i just see for ubuntu 5.10 backports ??
[04:03] <allz> can you help me
[04:03] <LjL> screechingcat, i recall it did give me problems, but that was really because my APT was broken to start with
[04:03] <ndlovu> mooey, would 'sudo apt-get install -reinstall gnome' do the trick, or is it something like 'ubuntu-desktop' that I need to reinstall?
[04:03] <progek> Hello all, ok I ran into something strange. After installing limewire I would get the following error Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}"), now I tried getting frost wire and I get the same error trying to start it.. hmm :(
[04:03] <ndlovu> minimec, I agree!
[04:03] <screechingcat> LjL: but my apt is fine. the update manager works too. its just the panel notif that isnt working
[04:04] <LjL> screechingcat, i was talking about the xorg update
[04:04] <joeyk> java may be prob for frost/limewire
[04:04] <joeyk> i ran into sim probs
[04:04] <screechingcat> LjL: ohhh
[04:04] <progek> joeyk: I think java is ok, I grabbed suns jre/jdk and even set up tomcat with no problems.
[04:04] <screechingcat> progek: i had the same problem. still havent fixed it
[04:04] <minimec> ndlovu: Try to install a light wm ... sudo apt-get install fluxbox and then try to login with the fluxbox session.
[04:05] <mooey> ndlovu, i'm not sure what package to recommend reinstalling tbh :\
[04:05] <progek> screechingcat: yeah, weird
[04:05] <joeyk> hmm, not sure then.. thats a kinda general error msg. :)
[04:05] <progek> I did not have this in dapper or fedora but oh well. Any alternatives you recommend?
[04:05] <dous> sysklogd only retains files for a week by default and I want to change it to retain more.. how do I do that correctly and safely? thanks...
[04:05] <progek> or anyone recommends?
[04:06] <screechingcat> progek: gtkgnutella or apollon
[04:06] <progek> nice, thanks
[04:06] <ndlovu> minimec, I've been wanting to try xfce for a while, so installing that...
[04:06] <mooey> i've got to shoot, i hope you get it sorted ndlovu :-)
[04:07] <ndlovu> mooey, thanks for your help!
[04:07] <minimec> ndlovu: Xfce uses gtk too and maybe won't work either... Fluxbox will not take you a lot of space ;)
[04:07] <darko3d> where can i get emerald from
[04:08] <screechingcat> darko3d: !emerald
[04:08] <ndlovu> minimec: I see :\. It's already downloading, so I'll let it finish first
[04:08] <screechingcat> !emerald
[04:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about emerald - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:08] <LjL> dous, i guess /etc/logrotate.conf
[04:08] <minimec> ndlovu: ok
[04:08] <screechingcat> darko3d: check on the beryl website
[04:09] <dous> LjL: but sysklogd is a special case, it uses some other script to rotate logs..
[04:09] <Maggotin> how do I make Mplayer default video player?
[04:09] <minimec> ndlovu: I am taking a short break . Will be back in 20 minutes ...
[04:09] <dous> LjL: well, specifically, I want to retain more mail logs but since it's part of syslog that's where I started looking
[04:10] <ndlovu> minimec, np, I appreciate the suggestions
[04:10] <darko3d> i downloaded when of the themes over there and it didn't work
[04:10] <LjL> dous: then try /etc/cron.weekly/sysklogd
[04:10] <screechingcat> darko3d: which guide did you follow to get beryl working ?
[04:11] <darko3d> none
[04:11] <screechingcat> darko3d: did u get beryl running ?
[04:11] <dous> LjL: but then after reading some stuff, that would involve a lot of other logs too.. :( there's actually a daily rotation script too..
[04:11] <darko3d> no
[04:12] <darko3d> where can i downloaded from, or is it embeded with ubuntu
[04:12] <screechingcat> darko3d: !beryl
[04:12] <LjL> dous: well, then just make *another* cron script that backs up the logs you want incrementally to somewhere else ;P
[04:12] <LjL> hey, at least that's as safe as it gets
[04:13] <darko3d> no i didn't run it, i don't know how
[04:13] <Maggotin> how do I make Mplayer default video player?
[04:13] <astro> Hello I am a new user of Ubuntu 6.10
[04:13] <javiolo> where are the config files of ssh ?
[04:13] <zach634> sup astro
[04:13] <astro> But I cant set the resolution for my laptop
[04:13] <dous> LjL: I wish it were that easy... :(
=== thunder is now known as Thunder2002
[04:14] <astro> I tried 915resolution
[04:14] <dous> LjL: the cron scripts use a perl script to determine which files to rotate by parsing syslog.conf :-/
[04:14] <Rob125> astro: system - preferences - screen resolution.
[04:14] <macgyver187> astro: u probably need a program called 855resolution
[04:14] <LjL> javiolo: "dpkg -L openssh-client" or "dpkg -L openssh-server" depending which one you want
[04:14] <astro> I tried 855resolution
[04:14] <astro> but doesnt word
[04:14] <hondaman> is there someway I can make my wireless automatically reconnect when it disconnects?
[04:14] <macgyver187> hm...sorry then
[04:14] <docmur> Good Day All
[04:15] <astro> can i give someone remote access to help me out?
[04:15] <javiolo> LjL wasnt a file on .ssh ?
[04:15] <LjL> javiolo: maybe the local user's configuration is
[04:15] <javiolo> LjL no, thats strange
[04:15] <LjL> javiolo: what i told you points to the system-global configuration
[04:15] <maxb> I've filed a bug in launchpad, but got no response. What's the best way to (gently) prod someone for attention?
[04:15] <LjL> javiolo: i have ~/.ssh/known_hosts
[04:16] <javiolo> LjL I dont thats weird
[04:16] <javiolo> just make a  new installation of 6.10
[04:16] <LjL> javiolo: well, do you have any known host? ;P
[04:16] <darko3d> hello anyhelp, how do i run emerald and beryl, where can i get them from,and how can i mount ntfs drives
[04:16] <docmur> I was here yesturday and I still have a problem with getting windows to install, no matter what I do, I cleared 95GB for windows to install and when I go to install it, it formats , copies the files and checks the drive all with good results, then when I reboot I get NTLDR missing
[04:16] <javiolo> LjL yes I had to create .shh and authorized-keys
[04:16] <javiolo> LjL but there is not config file
[04:17] <boggle> Maggotin: in Nautilus?
[04:17] <boggle> Maggotin: right click on movie file, select properties, open with
[04:17] <TheGateKeeper> darko3d: repo for ntfs-3g --> deb http://flomertens.keo.in/ubuntu/ dapper main
[04:17] <boggle> do that for all file types
[04:17] <LjL> dous, i know i'm talking hacks but, you could try setting up dnotify and have it append the logs that were just rotated to some backup location when it detects a change
[04:18] <CarlFK> edgy live cd - does it include on the CD the Gnome Network Manager for WPA authentication ?
[04:18] <TheGateKeeper> darko3d: and there is an edgy one too

[04:20] <boggle> docmur: afaik only the chainloader +1 entry needs to be below the windows stanza, then it should work
[04:21] <boggle> but after a fresh windows install, grub will be gone
[04:21] <docmur> okay but will that fix NTLDR Missing ???
[04:21] <boggle> docmur: no idea
[04:21] <docmur> okay so I just do
[04:21] <docmur> title windows
[04:21] <docmur> chainloader +1
[04:22] <lanfeust21> hi does someone have an idea to activate zeroconf on ubuntu edgy

[04:25] <boggle> darko3d: edgy is version 6.10, drapper 6.04
[04:26] <redgun> someone with irda and smsc-ircc2 driver?
[04:26] <quiet> drapper doesn't exist...  and Dapper is 6.06
[04:26] <pip__> so this thing with flash not working with 64bit ubuntu totally sucks
[04:26] <quiet> hoary is 5.04

[04:29] <compengi> quiet, thanks
[04:29] <roscar> hey all, anybody in the mood to help me with my Sound problems?
[04:30] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, what is the problem?
[04:30] <roscar> sound worked, booted up in the moring, no more sound.
[04:30] <macgyver187> nothing...:) resembles WinXP too much...cant stand it
[04:30] <roscar> Works in windows so I'm baffled.
[04:30] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, do you know what soundcard you have?
[04:31] <kotschleuder> am i right in assuming beryl+fluxbox won't work?
[04:31] <darko3d> ii have dapper 6.06
[04:31] <roscar> the device manager indicates it's the "nForce2 AC97 Audio Controller (MCP)"
[04:31] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, ah
[04:32] <roscar> I'm running a pretty fresh install of edgy.
[04:32] <quiet> compengi, http://www.t1shopper.com/tools/calculate/
[04:32] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, open a terminal and run "alsamixer" shat does it wsay next to card and chip?
[04:33] <ircdevil> will ubunto detect and install wireless adapter with WPA support automagically?
[04:33] <roscar> Realtek ALC650F is the chip and NVidia nForce2 is the card.
[04:33] <roscar> thanks for the help by the by.
[04:34] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, no worries
[04:34] <PlanarPlatypus> under master does it have a green box with a white 00 in it?
[04:34] <javiolo_> whats the best way to uninstall apps and all of his dependences ?
[04:36] <roscar> The only thing I did since watching a show last night and booting the computer in the morning is install a printer driver.
[04:36] <roscar> the Brother 1430 driver.
[04:37] <roscar> I've since removed it and the card doesn't work.
[04:37] <gbutler69_> Anyone know anything about Webcams on Edgy?
[04:37] <raghu206> i cannot install adobe reader for my i386 machine:can any one help

[04:38] <quiet> raghu206, why not? what happens?  `aptitude install acroread`
=== lastnode__ is now known as lastnode
[04:40] <raghu206> quiet, Package acroread is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[04:40] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, the only thing I can think of is that somehow the settings god confused and it either didn't load the driver or muted the card
[04:40] <raghu206> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[04:40] <raghu206> is only available from another source
[04:40] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, was tere any sound on boot at all?
[04:40] <quiet> raghu206, you have universe/multiverse repos enabled?
[04:40] <wolfgang> hello

[04:47] <starkruzr> Hi guys.  Upgrading to Edgy appears to have trashed my dependencies.  I can't fix them with apt-get -f install.  Can someone give me a hand sorting this out?  Here is a paste of the results when I attempt to fix, and my sources.list file: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32122/
[04:47] <zach634> damnit pip with the "imba"s again
[04:47] <pip> zach634: whast wrong with imba?
[04:47] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, if you run alsemixer again and check to see if the master or pcm is muted
[04:47] <Jimbo> anyone use this newsreader?   http://sourceforge.net/projects/sabnzbd/
[04:48] <roscar> what would it look like if it was muted?
[04:48] <LjL> starkruzr: i don't know, but you have universe and multiverse enabled in the "edgy" repository, but not in the "edgy-updates" and "edgy-security" repositories, which doesn't sound good at all
[04:48] <roscar> pcm is turned off. Is that the same as muteing?
[04:48] <Jimbo> how do I install a program that is in .tar.gz form?
[04:49] <Jimbo> new to linux here
[04:49] <LjL> starkruzr: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine#head-e1a24b1b2037f68b5a95f54388582b58ea4c9bd0
[04:49] <Rodietze> why doesn't UBuntu 6.06 have gcc, make etc..?
[04:49] <LjL> Jimbo, tar.gz is just a compression format
[04:49] <zach634> jimbo: tar -xvf <stuff>.tar.gz
[04:49] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Rodietze about compile
[04:49] <LjL> Jimbo: then it depends on the program
[04:49] <systest> Rodietze: it does, they're just not installed by default
[04:49] <zach634> rodietze: "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
[04:49] <Jimbo> LjL...its a newsreader that supports nzb files
[04:50] <eric_> tar xf file.tar.gz
[04:50] <Rodietze> systest: zach634  thanks
[04:50] <Jimbo> zach  will that install it?
[04:50] <zach634> Jimbo: after you extract it with tar -xvf, cd to the folder and do ./configure   then make    then make install
[04:50] <LjL> Jimbo, i meant it depends on the *specific* contents of the archive. it's like a .ZIP archive you can get on Windows -- there isn't a standard procedure for installing whatever is contained in it
[04:50] <starkruzr> LjL: Fixing that doesn't appear to have helped anything, but thanks for the heads-up anyway
[04:50] <eric_> did someone say windows?
[04:50] <zach634> "tar -xvf newsreader.tar.gz" "cd newsreader" "./configure" "make" "make install"
[04:51] <LjL> starkruzr: have you run a "sudo apt-get update" after fixing that?
[04:51] <Discerer> can i ask phpmyadmin/mysql-related questions here?
[04:51] <systest> zach634: not to nit pick but I think Jimbo will need "tar -z ..."
[04:51] <starkruzr> Yes.
[04:51] <starkruzr> And then a sudo apt-get -f install.
[04:51] <starkruzr> Precisely the same result.
[04:51] <Rodietze> uhmm, but there is no "build-essentials" package in the CD :\ is it availble just through remote repositories?
[04:51] <starkruzr> If it wasn't able to find something because I bollocksed up the repos, it would have at least said "found a reference to it, but couldn't find the package."  Or whatever error that is.
[04:51] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, the box underneath the bar would have two Ms in it
[04:52] <zach634> rodietze: "build-essential"
[04:52] <zach634> singular
[04:52] <Jimbo> zach...so first run ./configure, then  what?
[04:52] <zach634> jimbo: run ./configure
[04:52] <Jimbo> make install isnt a command is it...dontyou have to precede it with something/?
[04:52] <Rodietze> zach634:  even so, that's not there in the CD drapper 6.06
[04:52] <zach634> jimbo: then if you have build-essential, do "make", then "make install"
[04:52] <roscar> ok, PCM is muted but Master is not.
[04:52] <roscar> how do I demute PCM?

[04:53] <Jimbo> make install >path to app>?
[04:53] <zach634> no, just make install
[04:53] <Jimbo> k ..how does it know what to install with just "make install"
[04:53] <zach634> i think...  someone correct me if I am wrong
[04:54] <Rodietze> zach634: build-essential isn't there cause the search for it returns empty
[04:54] <zach634> that's what make does
[04:54] <LjL> Jimbo: "make" is a command. "install" is a parameter for the command. you might consider checkinstall as well
[04:54] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Jimbo about checkinstall
[04:54] <Jimbo> Zach...im confused...how will it know which app to install with "make install"?
[04:55] <zach634> if you're in the folder with the sources
[04:55] <zach634> then it will
[04:55] <LjL> Jimbo: it will just run the "Makefile" file that it finds in the current directory
[04:55] <zach634> that's what ./configure does
[04:55] <zach634> and make

[04:55] <Jimbo> damn gain crashed again
[04:56] <LjL> Jimbo: it will just run the "Makefile" file that it finds in the current directory, which of course means that you must be in the right directory
[04:56] <Jimbo> I missed any response in the last 2 minuts cus gaim crashed again
[04:56] <LjL> Jimbo: "make" is a command. "install" is a parameter for the command. you might consider checkinstall as well
[04:56] <wheels3572> Can anyone tell me if there was functionality removed in Gaim 2.0.0Beta3.1
[04:56] <Jimbo> ok so first cd to the directory that contains the files, then do make install?
[04:57] <zach634> Jimbo: ./configure first
[04:57] <zach634> then make
[04:57] <zach634> then make install
[04:57] <Jimbo> ok ill try it bb
[04:57] <Tup4c> okei all ya .How do i remove hda1 just delete it ? .cause i cant with my .it says you dont have permission to do this .and i do then chmod 500 hda1 but steel not working .
[04:57] <starkruzr> Okay.  When you're make-ing a program, and C code tries to #include <something.h>, where does it go looking for something.h?
[04:57] <Tup4c> what could be wrong :x
[04:57] <LjL> Tup4c: what do you mean "remove hda1"? destroy the partition?
[04:57] <Tup4c> yeah
[04:58] <Tup4c> destroy it :S
[04:58] <Tup4c> cause i cant go in it
[04:58] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, select pcm and press "m"
[04:58] <LjL> starkruzr: /usr/include
[04:58] <zach634> he's trying to read files off hda1, his windows partition
[04:58] <LjL> and since he can't, he wants to destroy the partition?
[04:58] <LjL> sounds logical
[04:58] <Tup4c> ljl it just says i dont have permission to go in to the partition
[04:58] <Tarandus> I can't boot my B&W G3 to any linux installer
[04:58] <LjL> Tup4c: either go into it as root, or mount it with user permissions
[04:58] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Tup4c about windowsdrives
[04:58] <roscar> bomber!
[04:58] <scythe> then run your browser as root, you will have permissions then
[04:58] <starkruzr> LjL: I need it to not look in /usr/include.
[04:59] <Tarandus> It just goes to the black screen and complains that it can't read any yaboot.conf
[04:59] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, ?
[04:59] <roscar> what is the PCM
[04:59] <starkruzr> LjL: Instead I need it to look in ~/include
[04:59] <Chousuke> starkruzr: use -I
[04:59] <roscar> sorry, by bomber I mean "IT LIVES!"
[04:59] <Tup4c> ljl .all i need is just one command .that can DISTROY this hell :(
[04:59] <roscar> the PCM, whatever that is, being muted was the problem.
[04:59] <starkruzr> Chousuke: What?
[04:59] <starkruzr> -I with what?
[04:59] <Chousuke> starkruzr: it looks in directories specified by the -I switch too.
[04:59] <zach634> Tup4c: lol, i told you that yesterday... dont do it again
[05:00] <Chousuke> -I ~/include
[05:00] <scythe> tupac, you tried parted?
[05:00] <starkruzr> Is there an environment variable for this?
[05:00] <LjL> Tup4c, that makes no sense. i'm not giving you a command that deletes a hard drive partition just because you can't read from it.
[05:00] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, not 100% sure what it is, I just know it needs to be not muted for sound to work properly
[05:00] <Chousuke> starkruzr: dunno. man gcc :P
[05:00] <starkruzr> Because this is with TCL's pimake program, not regular make.
[05:00] <PlanarPlatypus> roscar, I /think/ it has to do with converting the digital signal to analog for the speakers
[05:00] <roscar> good enough for me, Thanks again with your help.
[05:00] <roscar> I'm sure I'll be back at some point.
[05:01] <boggle> how to add the special keys of a HP multimedia keyboard? I can choose it in System->Preferences->Keyboard and the Search button does work
[05:01] <LjL> Tup4c: what do you think you'll obtain by wiping your Windows partition?
[05:02] <mcquaid> hello, i got a nvidia 6200, and it works fine but i can't adjust video brightness,contrast etc
[05:03] <Jimbo> zach, can i use checkinstall instead?
[05:03] <zach634> mcquaid: arent those monitor functions?
[05:03] <zach634> Jimbo: i dont know about checkinstall
[05:03] <scythe> zach they can be done with some video  cards as well
[05:03] <mcquaid> i tried disabling composite but didn't help.  I read that geforce 6/7's dont support hardware overlay is that true?
[05:03] <starkruzr> How do I get apt to download a package into the current directory, regardless of whether or not it's already installed?  -d doesn't work because it's already installed.
[05:04] <mcquaid> zach634, yes a monitor has those, but video cards have them for the desktop/open gl and xv (hardware overlay for video) which can all be tweaked independently
[05:04] <Jimbo> zach..i was looking at this link    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall
[05:04] <zach634> starkuzr: man apt-get   I know there's a way
[05:04] <scythe> if its already installed, the .deb is already on your hd.. just look for it and dont worry about downloading it
[05:04] <starkruzr> apt-get's manpage is dazzlingly unhelpful :p
[05:05] <Jimbo> bbl
[05:05] <soundray> How do I access the top menu bar in emacs when running in textmode? (Probably obvious, but not to me...)
[05:05] <scythe> star... most man pages are that way :)
[05:05] <mcquaid> but i just read somewhere that newer geforce's got rid of hardware overlay which is kind of crap
[05:05] <starkruzr> scythe: Where would it put them on my HD?
[05:05] <starkruzr> It also seems somehow wrong that it keeps the .deb for every program installed.
[05:05] <scythe> gimme a minute and Ill have the dir
[05:06] <soundray> starkruzr: make a cronjob that runs 'apt-get clean' or 'apt-get autoclean' as root
[05:07] <soundray> starkruzr: are you looking for a cached .deb? /var/cache/apt/archives/
[05:07] <scythe> star.. /var/cache/apt/archives
[05:07] <scythe> thans soudray
[05:07] <scythe> beat me to it :)
[05:07] <eric_> my edgy is running fine
[05:07] <zach634> soundray strikes again!
[05:09] <soundray> How do I use the top menu bar in textmode emacs please?
[05:09] <eric_> apt-cache search emacs
[05:09] <boggle> to answer my own question, keytouch is the program to chose
[05:09] <eric_> woah, read my mind
[05:09] <bintut> any X Font Server implementors here?
[05:09] <Vspirit> question, ubuntu6.10, wlan pc-card linksys wpc54g v3.1, how do I install it?, I have tried using ndiswrapper, but is stopped at : sudo modprobe ndiswrapper  which is complaining about  FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper
[05:10] <bintut> i want to setup an X Font Server but there are 2 similar packages in the repository
[05:10] <bintut> XFS and XFSTT..  do i need both or just one of them?  what do you suggest?
[05:10] <aTypical> Hello all.  I'm looking for anyone using an HP Pavilion DV9000 series laptop with 6.10.  I wanted to see what, if any, challenges I can expect installing and configuring the devices.
[05:11] <incorrect> is nagios 2.5 packaged?
[05:11] <eric_> atypical, you'll probably have to install video card drivers
[05:12] <dream> Any one here use ubutu server
[05:12] <eric_> i use ubuntu server
[05:12] <aTypical> eric_, I think I'd be ok with that.  Although, I'm surprised that it's their not available somewhere.
[05:12] <eric_> they are, just not by default
[05:12] <PlanarPlatypus> dream, yes
[05:13] <dream> planar the server ver is gui ?
[05:13] <eric_> drean, no
[05:13] <dream> can i do ubutu desktop on server is ok can work
[05:13] <soundray> dream: sure
[05:13] <PlanarPlatypus> dream, yes it will work
[05:14] <eric_> maybe you'd be better off putting server on the desktop install
[05:14] <PlanarPlatypus> dream, my home computer was installed that way
[05:14] <dream> planar sory i dont understand you
[05:14] <dream> can you exply
[05:15] <eric_> i got samba working with my windows virtual machine, that was pretty neat
[05:15] <PlanarPlatypus> dream, I assume you mean "can I just install ubuntu-desktop" on a ubuntu server computer.  Yes you can, I have done so on my home computer
[05:16] <eric_> dream, i have done this as well.  i have also installed ubuntu server toold on a desktop install
[05:16] <dream> ok
[05:16] <dream> eric, i am setup new server at my shop for data only storage
[05:16] <dream> know
[05:16] <dream> my server hard ware raid 1
[05:16] <dream> is that ok
[05:17] <NineTeen67Comet> hi all .. my mother would like single click icons to open applications .. Is this an easy do in Gnome? (Or Xfce as I've installed both for her) ..
[05:17] <eric_> dream, raid is no problem
[05:17] <Kris> Hi - I'm a complete Ubuntu newbie. Can someone explain to me what an ESSID is and why Ubuntu needs it to connect to my wireless network?
[05:17] <dream> ok
[05:17] <dream> sory i am asking this but i am new  here two in linux
[05:17] <dream> can i do folder to trasfer data from windows xp or windows 2003 to linux and from linux to windows
[05:17] <eric_> dream, have you already set up your ubuntu server?
[05:18] <soundray> Kris: it's an identifier that distinguishes your wireless network from others around you.
[05:18] <dream> no no
[05:18] <eric_> dream, check out samba
[05:18] <dream> i am dawnload right know
[05:18] <Kris> Cool soundray... do you know how I'd go about finding what mine is?
[05:18] <soundray> Kris: to find out what it is, check your router config.
[05:18] <dream> saba is in ubutu
[05:18] <Kris> Thanks soundray =)
[05:18] <eric_> dream, when you partition your drives you'll have to set up the RAID there as well.
[05:18] <NineTeen67Comet> eric_: is someone ever going to build an app like Samba just less evil?
[05:18] <soundray> Kris: you could also scan available ESSIDs if you knew your wireless  interface name.
[05:19] <soundray> Kris: do you?
[05:19] <dream> eric what sens sory
[05:19] <dream> i have 2 hard drivs mirring
[05:19] <eric_> Nine, i wish!
[05:19] <Kris> I'm not sure what a wireless interface name is soundray
[05:19] <eric_> dream, iu do as well
[05:19] <Kris> What is an example of an ESSID? I don't ever remember setting one up
[05:19] <soundray> Kris: what kind of wireless network device are you using?
[05:19] <AlanHaggai> any way to remote invite a friend of mine so that he can see my desktop?
[05:20] <Kris> It's a BT Voyager wireless router
[05:20] <AlanHaggai> he is using windows and I am using Ubuntu
[05:20] <soundray> Kris: routers have their manufacturer name quite often: NETGEAR, Belkin, linksys
[05:20] <dream> kris ubutu have 1 disk
[05:20] <dream> cd
[05:20] <eric_> dream, partition one drive like normal, with the swap and / mount points, then set uyp the second disk as a raid partition
[05:21] <soundray> Kris: I'm asking not about your router, but the network device in or on your computer.
[05:21] <NineTeen67Comet> AlanHaggai: You can use VNC and just give him the address of your box, and a password .. there is a lot of info on vnc on google ..
[05:21] <macgyver187> what is OEM installation mode in Ubuntu?
[05:21] <dream> eric i cant becouse my server is only 2 hard drive mirrion 1
[05:21] <NineTeen67Comet> gotta run all ..
[05:21] <AlanHaggai> thanks NineTeen67Comet :)
[05:21] <eric_> Alan, try tight VNC
[05:21] <Kris> Ah, you mean the device which picks up the signal, soundray? Let me go check that...
[05:21] <eric_> (tight vnc on the windows machine)
[05:22] <Williamts99> alanhaggai, http://www.ultravnc.com
[05:22] <eric_> dream, you'll see what i am talking about when you are in the partitioner
[05:22] <AlanHaggai> thanks Williamts99 :)
[05:22] <dream> ok
[05:22] <Williamts99> alanhaggai, NP
[05:22] <dream> eric ubutu only 1 cd right i need to dawnload
[05:22] <AlanHaggai> :)
[05:22] <Kris> It's just some USB adapter soundray
[05:23] <Kris> (is that the answer you were looking for??)
[05:23] <eric_> dream, yep one CD!
[05:23] <Jimbo> whats the url for pastbin again
[05:23] <Jimbo> this isnt working
[05:23] <soundray> Kris: that gets us one step further. Do you know how to open a terminal?
[05:23] <soundray> !pastebin
[05:23] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:24] <maxb> I've filed a bug in launchpad, but got no response. What's the best way to (gently) prod someone for attention?
[05:24] <scythe> maxb.. a sledgehammer??
[05:24] <eric_> maxb, ball bat
[05:24] <zach634> maxb: from behind
[05:24] <Deft> maxb: provide more information? too subtle?
[05:24] <Kris> Yep I've done that soundray (sorry for the delay, the machine with Ubuntu is in the other room!)
[05:24] <eric_> i meant baseball bat
[05:25] <dream> eric do you have server with riad
[05:25] <eric_> dream, yes
[05:25] <scythe> eric.. what.. no cricket bats?
[05:25] <dream> you have 2 hard diks in your server
[05:25] <eric_> scythe, cricket?!?  cool!
[05:25] <maxb> Nah, there's plenty of information there. Just needs the maintainer to acknowledge and determine what to do.
[05:25] <soundray> Kris: okay, in that case, I'll give you a series of instructions to take away with you:
[05:25] <eric_> dream, yes
[05:25] <zach634> eric has two hard diks in his server?
[05:25] <dream> you have 2 hard diks in your server eric
[05:26] <eric_> dream, they are mirrored.
[05:26] <lmosher> This is so strange. About half the times I start my laptop it has no sound. Any ideas why? Anything I can do to get it going again?
[05:26] <dream> ok
[05:26] <zach634> you mirrored your two diks?
[05:26] <dream> yes
[05:26] <eric_> i did zach
[05:26] <zach634> do any of you get the joke here?
[05:26] <eric_> yes
[05:26] <eric_> i am LOL
[05:26] <zach634> thank god
[05:27] <zach634> "two hard diks"
[05:27] <zach634> that's bash worthy
[05:27] <lmosher> only kinda
[05:27] <soundray> Kris: first, unplug the USB stick. Then run 'ifconfig -a' in the terminal. You will see probably several "stanzas" of information. Doesn't matter what's in there. Just plug the device, wait 5 seconds, then run the command again.
[05:27] <Williamts99> zach, we get it, it's just not that funny :-)
[05:27] <gilnim> hi
[05:28] <eric_> damn i need more coffee
[05:28] <soundray> Kris: the name of the stanza that you see now that wasn't there before is your interface device name.
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[05:28] <zach634> downgrade your humor level to v.SouthPark and it will be hilarious
[05:28] <gilnim> what's the command for a terminal
[05:28] <eric_> soundray, you are a trooper!
[05:28] <Deft> gilnim: what terminal?
[05:28] <Kris> Cool thanks soundray, I'm just going to do that now
[05:28] <lmosher> is there any way to re-start my sound system? When I go into sound preferences the tests fail.
[05:28] <soundray> Kris: it could be, for example, rausb0. If it's that, scan your network with the command: 'sudo iwlist rausb0 scanning' (will ask for your user password)
[05:28] <eric_> if you can pass a command, you are probably in the terminal
[05:29] <minimec> lmosher: Hmmm ... Well I don't know why do you have your problem... but as a dirty trick make a script that reloads ALSA when you start your gnome-session.
[05:29] <gilnim> no - the problem is: i use xfce but the menu doesn't work any more
[05:29] <Jimbo> Im trying to install a newsreader. Could someone that knows this stuff look at this pastebin and possibly tell me what Im doing wrong?  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32130/
[05:29] <soundray> eric_: is that a good or a bad thing? ...
[05:30] <gilnim> i have no clue how i can get it to work again
[05:30] <lmosher> minimec, How do I reload alsa?
[05:30] <eric_> soundray, a good thing.  ;)
[05:30] <soundray> eric_: okay, thank you then ;)
[05:30] <Williamts99> jimbo, what does the readme say
[05:30] <zach634> Jimbo: that's the package, not the source code
[05:30] <Arcad3> does Ubuntu has something similar to Cpanel?
[05:31] <zach634> ./configure is for source code, usually in the form of a .tar.gz file
=== leonel_ is now known as leonel
[05:31] <lmosher> How do I reload ALSA?
[05:31] <minimec> lmosher: Try that: in a terminal: sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
[05:31] <lmosher> minimec, thanks
[05:31] <Jimbo> zach...its the folder produced when i extracted the .tat.gz?
[05:31] <gilnim> when i click on "Menu" in xfce nothing happens! Same if i press the right button
[05:32] <Jimbo> i mean tar.gz
[05:32] <Arcad3> where can i find a software that can manage my FTP mysql users?
[05:32] <Jimbo> where would the source code reside?
[05:32] <zach634> JimboL really?  hmm...  see if you can find a version of it in source code version
[05:32] <lmosher> minimec, hmm that's not working :(
[05:32] <LjL> Jimbo, usually in a directory called like the .tar.gz file (except for the extension)
[05:32] <minimec> @all I thaught that alsa was started with alsa, not with alsa-utils. Is that an edgy thing?
[05:33] <Jimbo> looking in folder
[05:33] <soundray> Jimbo: it's a python program. Try 'chmod 755 sabnzbd ; ./sabnzbd'
[05:33] <Williamts99> Jimbo, what is this program called?
[05:33] <SpeedyG> hey, I wanna reinstall grub on my system (windows install removed it) the hdd is a sata-disk (sda) how can I install it ?

[05:34] <soundray> minimec: 'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart'
[05:34] <Jimbo> zach where did you look?
[05:34] <minimec> soundray: thx. So I did right.
[05:34] <zach634> Jimbo: sourceforge
[05:34] <lmosher> soundray, Unfortunately, that's not giving me sound. Restarting seems to work.. but that doesn't tell me the underlying problem
[05:34] <Jimbo> thats where i got it
[05:34] <soundray> gilnim: have some patience. Xfce experts are a bit scarce. You may have to ask again later.
[05:34] <lmosher> I can't even figure out -why- I don't have sound.
[05:34] <minimec> lmosher: Your problem could be hardware (driver) related.
[05:35] <eric_> gilnim, can you atill access things with the keyboard, is it a mouse thing?  or is the mouse fine?
[05:35] <lmosher> minimec, then why does it work fine after a reboot?
[05:35] <thartman> if I run updatedb (the file system updater for locate), when I have mounted nfs drives, will this cause problems?
[05:35] <Tup4c> allz@Allz:~$ sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts the out put -> E: Package msttcorefonts has no installation candidate

[05:35] <Deft> gilnim: I don't use xfce, so the best I can suggest is to think about switching to a new account with fresh settings

[05:35] <dooglus> minimec: tried #xfce or #xubuntu?
[05:36] <eric_> gilnim, ah just checking
[05:36] <minimec> lmosher: Could be that the driver takes his time to load ...

[05:36] <soundray> lmosher: if you're really lucky, you may find someone by the nickname of crimsun, an alsa expert.
[05:36] <gilnim> Deft: you meen i should create a new account?
[05:37] <Jimbo> k
[05:37] <dream> can i creat a folder for data  on this linux os

[05:37] <msnider> Hey all I am wanting to install ubuntu but thinking about keeping windows for a while. Anyone know if its possible to put ubuntu on a USB stick? I have found this but its per the older version
[05:37] <msnider> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick?highlight=%28stick%29%7C%28usb%29
[05:37] <eric_> dream, ah... yeah.
[05:37] <minimec> lmosher: so whwn you do a 'cold' start, you have no sound, but after a restart it works?
[05:37] <LjL> msnider, it should be possible, but i never tried. couldn't you consider a dual boot as well?
[05:37] <lmosher> minimec, No... it works fine from cold start about 80% of the time...
[05:38] <lmosher> minimec, and sometimes after a reboot it stops working...
[05:38] <msnider> LjL: have thought about the dual boot yes
[05:38] <eric_> i use windows in a virtual machine and share files between it and the host with samba
[05:38] <Deft> gilnim: if that doesn't work, it must be an installation thing, so either reinstall some packages, or... something

[05:39] <minimec> lmosher: try to stop that daemon again ... Do sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils stop then sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils start
[05:39] <eric_> alan, both.
[05:40] <AlanHaggai> thanks eric_
[05:40] <LjL> soundray, msnider: if it were me i'd just try firing up the CD with a USB drive plugged in, and see if it's recognized by the installer. if it is, install. if it doesn't boot, follor the boot from USB howto
[05:40] <AlanHaggai> eric_ : I installed vnc4server
[05:40] <AlanHaggai> eric_ : How to proceed?
[05:40] <Tup4c> tell tup4c about paste
[05:40] <eric_> alan, i use tight VNC with windows.
[05:40] <lmosher> minimec, no luck. I'm going to restart gdm see if that re-initializes it...
[05:40] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Tup4c about pastebin
[05:40] <dream> eric i need to pres any f6 to istall terd party driver for raid
[05:40] <AlanHaggai> ok eric. no problem.
[05:40] <Tup4c> thanks
[05:40] <Tup4c> :P
[05:41] <LjL> Tup4c, you can ask things to the bot in a private query with it
[05:41] <msnider> LjL: how big of a drive would I need though? I have a 1gigger to play with or a 20gigger
[05:41] <minimec> lmosher: I don't think so, but try
[05:41] <davi1> has anyone got ubuntu to authenticate with windows ad
[05:41] <eric_> dream, really?
[05:41] <msnider> was thinking about getting World of warcraft running but then I can't use ventrilo lol
[05:41] <LjL> msnider: i'd say at least 3 gigs. but then you could install the server version perhaps
[05:41] <msnider> okay thanks
[05:41] <eric_> davil, have fun!
[05:41] <msnider> may just run the dual boot option
[05:41] <anrodri> yi
[05:42] <davi1> I am starting to figure that out
[05:42] <Tup4c> here you go -> ljl http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32133/
[05:42] <lmosher> minimec, no luck :/
[05:42] <eric_> alan, in ubuntu i've only ever used the VNC client that comes installed with kubuntu.  i haven't done it in a while though
[05:42] <CarlFK> I am trying to get dbd4 to run, but it just exits. - anyone have a clue?  http://www.fabforce.net/downloads.php
[05:42] <eric_> it works fine with tight vnc though
[05:42] <minimec> lmosher: So if we reloaded the driver of your soundcard?
[05:42] <LjL> Tup4c, that is a Breezy that was upgraded to Dapper later, isn't it?
[05:43] <dream> eric i need to pres any f6 to istall terd party driver for raid
[05:43] <msnider> anyone running world of warcraft in wine successfully without any issues ?
[05:43] <lmosher> minimec, No idea. xmms will attempt to play, but no sound. Restarting alsa does not help
[05:43] <soundray> LjL: do you happen to know anything about booting .iso images stored on HD?
[05:43] <eric_> dream, are you asking me?  LOL @ terd party
[05:43] <Tup4c> yes ljl
[05:43] <wiking_> i have install ubuntu & make partitions. when i try open this partitions here are errors error: device /dev/hda4 is not removable             error: could not execute pmount what to do to mount these partitions?
[05:43] <scythe> msnrider... I would suggest dual booting for that... wine is still unpredictable
[05:44] <msnider> okies scythe appreciate it
[05:44] <EchoBinary> anyone know if there is a URL for which nVidia drivers go for which card?
[05:44] <Luakagon> An embedded video in firefox doesn't play visual or sound please help
[05:44] <dooglus> msnider: http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/15/1652222
[05:44] <minimec> lmosher: Ok. Are you ready for hardware and driver stuff?
[05:44] <lmosher> minimec, I found a thread online w/ someone w my exact laptop card and my exact problem.. let me follow that and I'll let you know :)
[05:44] <minimec> lmosher: ok good
[05:44] <scythe> echo, the drivers are unified... one driver for all cards
[05:44] <msnider> dooglus: noticed that yesterday also hehe
[05:44] <EchoBinary> ?
[05:45] <minimec> lmosher: what laptop do you have?
[05:45] <EchoBinary> scythe: ive been reading about beta drivers and legacy drivers
[05:45] <eric_> soundray, LOL
[05:45] <LjL> Tup4c: try changing it like this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32134/
[05:45] <LjL> Tup4c: and then issue a "sudo apt-get update"
[05:45] <EchoBinary> my goal is to use glx
[05:45] <scythe> ahh
[05:45] <minimec> lmosher: My mom needs a new one ;)
[05:46] <zach634> well im out
[05:46] <zach634> later all
[05:46] <EchoBinary> ciao
[05:46] <msnider> hopefully a dv6040us can handle the ubuntu without to much customization as I am linux n00bie hehe
[05:46] <Kris> hehe
[05:47] <Jimbo> what was that command to install the python program again?
[05:47] <Kris> I just did what you said soundray
[05:47] <Jimbo> chmod 755 something or other
[05:47] <soundray> Kris: and you discovered about seven wireless networks in your vicinity?
[05:47] <Kris> First off, it told me the name of the interface device name
[05:47] <Discerer> with renice I can set the process prio, but how high is it by default?
[05:47] <Kris> so i tried scanning it
[05:47] <Kris> and it told me this: "Failed to read scan data: resource temporarily unavailable"
[05:48] <EchoBinary> anyone know if there is a URL for which nVidia drivers go for which card?
[05:48] <soundray> Kris: did you just try again? Use arrow up to retrieve a line you've entered before.
[05:48] <scythe> echo, you might want to check out the nvidia site
[05:48] <EchoBinary> hmm
[05:48] <EchoBinary> good call ill check
[05:49] <Kris> I tried it a few times, it spent ages scanning each time but came back with the error.
[05:49] <oel> list
[05:49] <Kris> I'll just go try it again (shouldn't be so long this time :p)
[05:49] <lmosher> minimec, My laptop is a gateway 685-E brb
[05:51] <Kris> Still the same, soundray. Will restarting with the USB device plugged in help? Or is that only something which would help in windows?
[05:51] <matgates> hi, is there a package in edgy for the system call manpages?  I don't seem to have them installed, and I can't work ouot what packahe provides them.
[05:52] <CharlieSu> ls
[05:52] <lmosher> minimec, Hrm I've no idea why it does that. I restarted the machine and it's working fine (just like the past few days). That thread I followed was actually for a dif. card :(
[05:52] <azcazandco> anyone else experienced *huge* disk formatting times using ubuntu install disks?
[05:52] <SpeedyG> soundray: somehow I cant get it to work, when I try to install it to /dev/sda, it starts about "Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device
[05:52] <lmosher> minimec, Anyway, what would you suggest next time this happens?
[05:53] <dooglus> matgates: manpages-dev
[05:53] <CharlieSu> azcazandco: not really..  details?
[05:53] <EchoBinary> heres my next question: i completely fubared my kernal and drivers for nvidia - is there a way to "roll-back" to a default set as from a fresh install?
[05:53] <azcazandco> I installed a new 250gb ide drive today to install a fresh copy of dapper 64bit but it just seems to be taking forever to format
[05:53] <soundray> Kris: well, of course you need the network device in order to be able to scan the network... sorry, I thought that would be obvious.
[05:53] <Seveas> kmaynard, please don't try to add bogus 'factoids' to the bot
=== casper_ is now known as Vspirit
[05:53] <eric_> echo, for graphical interface: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -fgnome -phigh xserver-xorg
[05:54] <kmaynard> ok
[05:54] <matgates> dooglus: dooglus thanks.  I installed it and yes it does have them.  weirdly I couldn't find waitpid before...  I must be losing it.  cheers.
[05:54] <eric_> or just sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:54] <kmaynard> sorry
[05:54] <Kris> I wasn't clear soundray - it is plugged in while I'm scanning it. But it wasn't plugged in when I started ubuntu.
[05:54] <sowdog> Hello folks. I need a little help getting my dual core system to work. I've installed kernel generic but now the nvidia drivers dont load
[05:54] <dooglus> matgates: apt-file is good for finding files; also http://packages.ubuntu.com/
[05:54] <azcazandco> CharlieSu: it has sort of hung but not....  is on a black screen but I can still hear the disk doing something and I can still move the mouse about etc
[05:54] <soundray> Kris: oh, okay
[05:55] <pip> how do i get out of the praphical ubuntu to just look at a terminal? gonan install some graphical drivers
[05:55] <soundray> Kris: what is your device name btw?
[05:55] <Kris> wlan0
[05:55] <Tup4c> ljl
[05:55] <Tup4c> allz@Allz:~$ sudo apt-get update
[05:55] <Tup4c> E: Malformed line 15 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (absolute dist)
[05:55] <CharlieSu> azcazandco: how big is the drive?  how did you partition it?  and what filesystem are you using/
[05:55] <minimec> lmosher: I would try to unload and load the driver now ;)
[05:55] <SpeedyG> soundray: oh nvm, got it to work allready
[05:55] <eric_> pip, ctrl-alt-f1
[05:55] <matgates> dooglus: thanks for the hint, shall investigate
[05:55] <SpeedyG> thanks
[05:55] <Kris> I tried scanning some of the other devices it found to see what happened, and none of them are scannable, apparently.
[05:55] <soundray> Kris: yes, iwlist works on WLAN devices only
[05:56] <Kris> except mine :(
[05:56] <soundray> Kris: booting with the device plugged in will not make a difference.
[05:56] <azcazandco> it is 250gb ext3 primary 30gb | 97gb Primary ext3 | 100gb gb primary ext3
[05:56] <soundray> Kris: don't worry, that was just to work out your ESSID.
[05:56] <azcazandco> I know I also need a swap there
[05:56] <PaSurf> any recommendations on PDF creators for linux (aside from the one in OpenOffice?)
[05:57] <necrite> hi all
[05:57] <eric_> PsSurf, just choose to print as file
[05:57] <PaSurf> eric_ that will create a pdf?
[05:57] <soundray> Kris: did you get any installation guide with your BT router?
[05:57] <eric_> ya
[05:57] <Vspirit> can anyone help me getting my wiresless nic working under ubuntu6.10 ?
[05:57] <dooglus> eric_: are you talking about OpenOffice?
[05:58] <minimec> lmosher:  It looks like you have a SigmaTel 9250 Sound Chip in your computer. Try to find the driver with 'lsmod', unload it and load it again
[05:58] <swami1984> can anybody help me detect wireless networks (and connet onto one) on ubuntu 6.10
[05:58] <eric_> PaSurf, .pdf is a postscript document file
[05:58] <ayaa>  wich package to install to get "mount -t cramfs ..." working ?
[05:58] <Kris> soundray: Ah I never thought to check with BT's documentation. (oops) I'll check the website to see if they have a linux guide.
[05:58] <soundray> eric_, PaSurf: not quite, but if you manage to "print" a .ps file, you can convert that to PDF with ps2pdf
[05:58] <swami1984> kinda like the feature windows has
[05:58] <necrite> how can i add more locales to my system
[05:58] <necrite> with debian i run dpkg-reconvifure locales  but i dont know in ubuntu
[05:58] <soundray> Kris: I'm sure they don't
[05:58] <Kris> Oh okay, I won't bother then. What do you recommend?
[05:58] <soundray> Kris: I meant a printed quickstart guide or something like that
[05:58] <eric_> soundray, thatnks
[05:58] <CharlieSu> azcazandco: well just hard reboot your comp.. since it is empty right now it wont matter.. try again
[05:59] <azcazandco> CharlieSu: any suggestions?
[05:59] <azcazandco> okay thanks
[05:59] <CharlieSu> azcazandco: do an hdparm -Tt /dev/hda
[05:59] <CharlieSu> azcazandco: tell me what it says
[05:59] <PaSurf> I was using in windows something called PDF creator which you would just send your documents to the printer then convert to PDF
[05:59] <necrite> back .. anyone?
[06:00] <Tup4c> allz@Allz:~$ sudo apt-get update and the output is E: Malformed line 15 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (absolute dist) please check my source list -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32134/
[06:00] <Ludakris> Aight, I'm attempting to transfer/arrange files on my mp3 player. I do this via a bash shell CLI :), however it takes a long time for me to wait between each group of files I copy. Is there a way, to copy files to, arrange, manage the filesystem and everything. Then after I'm done, give a cmd and actually write the changes?
[06:00] <soundray> !cups-pdf | PaSurf

[06:00] <PaSurf> !cups-pdf
[06:00] <soundray> PaSurf: haven't tried that, but it looks promising
[06:00] <eric_> w00t
[06:00] <azcazandco> CharlieSu: okay
[06:00] <necrite> how can i add more locales to my system
[06:00] <necrite> with debian i run dpkg-reconvifure locales  but i dont know in ubuntu
[06:01] <defrysk> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[06:01] <dooglus> Tup4c: s/is archive/is.archive/
[06:01] <root___> how do i exit or enter my xserver after ive pressed ctrl+alt+f1?
[06:01] <soundray> Kris: you could try 'btvoyager'. I've seen that ESSID before on my cruises
[06:01] <Discerer> so... any ideas on how to enable remote control from a windows computer to my defty computer?
[06:01] <dooglus> root___: alt-f7
[06:01] <root___> to exit or enter?
[06:01] <Tup4c> dooglus ?
[06:01] <defrysk> to enter
[06:01] <eric_> root, startx
[06:01] <Tup4c> what is the problem
[06:01] <Discerer> no wait, dapper sorry
[06:01] <dooglus> Tup4c: replace 'is archive' with 'is.archive'
[06:02] <root___> eric_: i have it started, im listening to music atm but im in terminal only
[06:02] <PaSurf> I just installed Ubuntu edgy eft and everything seems to work ok, but system is slow at times.  One, where would I find the system hardware info (processor speed, memory) and second how to performance tune (if possible)
[06:02] <eric_> root, i got it now
[06:02] <soundray> Discerer: share your desktop with vino-preferences, view it with vncviewer on Windows
[06:02] <root___> and i wanna install some drivers, but how do i exit xserver when im in terminal mode?
[06:02] <defrysk> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[06:02] <Ludakris> Tup4c, I got thugs life
[06:02] <LjL> Tup4c, sorry, try this one http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32136/
[06:02] <Ludakris> Pac's life**
[06:03] <root___> LjL:  help me :)
[06:03] <minimec> root___: Why don't you just restart the login-manager gdm? sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[06:03] <Discerer> ok thanks soundray ill look it up
[06:03] <root___> what happens then?
[06:03] <soundray> PaSurf: did you receive my cups-pdf suggestion?
[06:03] <LjL> root___: the X server stops.
[06:03] <defrysk> hmmmm what would restart do ??
[06:03] <Ludakris> Anyone answer my question? It seems a rather widespread need.
[06:03] <root___> minimec: i did this to install praphical drivers?
[06:03] <LjL> root___, by the way, you should never do IRC as root
[06:03] <root___> i know
[06:04] <PaSurf> soundray: no
[06:04] <Tup4c> yeah tupac is the mother+**** G for life .halla back .i love all his songs .wow he was one of the best that fights for the right of black people
[06:04] <PaSurf> can I request in the channel?
[06:04] <Tup4c> but lets not talk about it here
[06:04] <Tup4c> :)
[06:04] <pip> now im in graphical, but how did i shut down it from terminal mode?
[06:05] <dooglus> pip "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" will close down XX
[06:05] <pip> ok thanks
[06:05] <soundray> Ludakris: sounds like you should just manage a 'sync-with-mp3player' directory in your home dir, and use rsync to copy changes to the player.
[06:05] <minimec> root___: By the way: With <alt><f7> you always return to your x-server
[06:05] <root___> ok thanks :)
[06:05] <Random_Transit> hey, can edgy run on x86-based macs??
[06:06] <soundray> PaSurf: I suggested you install cups-pdf to solve your PDF creation problem.
[06:06] <Kris> soundray: That didn't work. I'm gonna have to check the essid from the router config. I'll need to find the username/password for that, so I'll be back in half an hour or so. Incase you're not still here then, thanks for your help! You've been great. Thanks.
[06:06] <ailean> anyone know the chan to discuss sunbird?
[06:06] <soundray> Kris: pleasure
[06:07] <PaSurf> I am looking to get the file right now.  Went to the site and am reading on it.  (acutally I am gonna get via aptitude)
[06:07] <CarlFK> I need kylix to compile something. anyone have a clue what I can do?
[06:07] <root___> the nvidia installer sayd i need to have  libc header files?
[06:07] <defrysk> root___, there are repos for the nvidia-driver
[06:08] <defrysk> no installer needed
[06:08] <root___> so what should i do?
[06:08] <minimec> root___: Install the -dev packages of libc ... I guess. I may be wrong.
[06:08] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell root___ about nvidia
[06:08] <root___> wait 1 min, ill get into gnome again
[06:08] <root___> ljl i dont know how to look at private messages through irssi sry :P
[06:08] <soundray> PaSurf: on your edgy installation being slow, run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and look for errors or repeated messages. Use 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' to read about your CPU(s)
[06:08] <LjL> root___, just follow the documentation. it boils down to installing nvidia-glx and then enabling it
[06:08] <PaSurf> soundary:  just waiting to install, but system is super slow.  Not sure if ssh session are causing or what...
[06:09] <LjL> root___, i'll give you the URL again when you're from Gnome
[06:09] <Juan> i have amsn0.95 and i want to install 0.96 rc1.1. should i uninstall 0.95?
[06:09] <darko3d> i downloaded http://flomertens.keo.in/ubuntu/dists/dapper/main/binary-i386/ntfs-3g_0.20061031-BETA-1_i386.deb to try and mount drives into ubuntu but i'm getting dependency is not stisfiable
[06:09] <CharlieSu> root___: press ALT+Number(1,2,3,4)
[06:09] <root___> LjL:  thanks
[06:09] <root___> CharlieSu: that i know but i cant see any private message, i just get to other terminals
[06:09] <soundray> PaSurf: use 'cat /proc/meminfo' to check your memory. Also, try "gnome-system-monitor"
[06:10] <PaSurf> soundray
[06:10] <PaSurf> :will do
[06:10] <Juan> i have amsn0.95 and i want to install 0.96 rc1.1. should i uninstall 0.95 first?
[06:10] <CharlieSu> root___: lol, ok..
[06:10] <root___> maybe thats what to do :P
[06:10] <root___> haha but ill learn hopefully :)
[06:11] <soundray> darko3d: if you need NTFS read/write, your first stop should be fuse

[06:11] <minimec> root___: The private /msg should apear in a seperate window. You can change them with <esc>1-9 in irssi
[06:11] <Tup4c> ljl then what?
[06:11] <Tup4c> i have done it
[06:11] <dooglus> I think ntfs-3g works better than ntfsfuse
[06:11] <ailean> anyone know the chan to discuss sunbird?
[06:11] <dooglus> !ntfs-3g
[06:11] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[06:12] <Tup4c> ljl i have done the apt-get update .then what to do?
[06:12] <swilliamson> could someone be kind enough to tell me the apt-get command to upgrade my dapper server install to the 686 kernel (or point me in the right direction)
[06:12] <root___> ill reboot, when i do startx i cant get into my user but a new

[06:12] <lmosher> minimec, Sorry I got distracted. The module appears to be snd_hda_intel
[06:12] <Tup4c> LjL i have updated the nvidia card
[06:12] <LjL> Tup4c: now just install the msttcorefonts package
[06:12] <t35t0r> does anyone have a working kernel config for Dell Dimension E521 (i.e. such that the mouse does not freeze) ?
[06:12] <Juan> i have amsn0.95 and i want to install 0.96 rc1.1. should i uninstall 0.95 first?
[06:12] <LjL> Tup4c: yes that was sent by mistake
[06:13] <soundray> swilliamson: 'sudo apt-get install linux-686'. You won't see a performance improvement, though.
[06:13] <lmosher> minimec, and "aplay -l results" lists it as Intel [HDA Intel]  HDA Generic...
[06:13] <PaSurf> soundray:  looks like the bitchx prog I just installed is having a great time with my CPU.
[06:13] <minimec> lmosher: ok... sudo rmmod snd_hda_intel then insmod snd_hda_intel
[06:13] <darko3d> can anyone post a step by step walkthrough on how to mount ntfs drives
[06:13] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell darko3d about windowsdrives
[06:13] <swilliamson> soundray: not even for a server install?
[06:13] <Tup4c> LjL maybe ???? restart X ? after the update .cause it is not workin .
[06:13] <Tup4c> i have the same problem
[06:13] <lmosher> minimec, heh it's in use :)
[06:13] <lmosher> one sec
[06:14] <LjL> Tup4c: no
[06:14] <phlasphy> hey al
[06:14] <phlasphy> what is the command to edit xorg
[06:14] <lmosher> minimec, hrm turned off radio... still in use..
[06:14] <minimec> lmosher: stop the alsa-utils daemon
[06:14] <LjL> Tup4c: same problem as in "Package not found"?

[07:10] <Juxt> hi
[07:10] <Guard] [an> "ubuntu has changed to dash for /bin/sh, scrachbox assumes it's bash. dash doesn't support all the stuff bash does." was the explanation given by scratchbox devs, when i asked why the deb package did not install properly on kubuntu edgy --> THX, HOW SMART :(((
[07:11] <Juxt> can someone tell me if there's a LIDS package for ubuntu?
[07:11] <yoyoG> i need to know the command that will install a .tar files?? that are programs
[07:11] <Juxt> i saw 1 reference to it online
[07:11] <dream> hi
[07:11] <Williamts99> jmx, if you need help installing anything else, just let us know
[07:12] <dream> i dawn load wowo is fatastik this os
[07:12] <roryy> Guard] [an: you can make /bin/sh point to bash instead.  The install script should, however, use #!/bin/bash and not #!/bin/sh for its she-bang
[07:13] <Williamts99> jmx, also as minimec pointed out, there is a beta version of Flash out, which does clear up some issues with Flash videos being out of sync, though remember it is in beta.

[07:16] <cdubya> yoyoG, when someone says man tar or another command after the word man, it means that when you enter that in a terminal it will give you the manual page on what you're trying to use. The man pages are helpful to help you understand how to use it.
[07:17] <Williamts99> !man
[07:17] <ubotu> The "man" command brings up the Linux manual pages for the command you're interested in. Try "man intro" at the command line, or see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands

[07:26] <jamincollins> anyone know of a way to change the MAC address assigned to a bridge interface and/or a means of executing a specific script/command when an ethernet cable is connected or removed?
[07:26] <Williamts99> nette, have you looked to see if it was supported?
[07:26] <nette> Williamts99, i didn't actually find that scanner with the C3100 number, but i found photosmart.
[07:26] <jamincollins> yemu: USB drives should be automounted and display on the desktop
[07:26] <cdubya> yemu, uh, I use gnome and they show up on the desktop
[07:26] <nette> Williamts99, it works staright away in fedora.. now i'm on ubuntu
[07:26] <jamincollins> yemu: then right clicking should provide an Eject option
[07:27] <Williamts99> yemu, you can right click and choose eject

[07:28] <jamincollins> err make that lower /left/ by default

[07:28] <jamincollins> yemu: the "show desktop" button isn't new to windows users
[07:28] <yemu> and i want her to easily switch to linux
[07:28] <yemu> ok, you're right
[07:29] <minimec> yemu: you can unmount them doing 'nautilus computer:'
[07:29] <Williamts99> nette, which version of ubuntu are you using?
[07:29] <yemu> but they're also used to applet with usb drives
[07:29] <nette> Williamts99, 6.10 edgy
[07:30] <Williamts99> yemu, the lovely thing about Gnome is that you don't need on with it.
[07:30] <jamincollins> some idea, just different place... and for many windows users they are used to just yanking the drive

[07:31] <Gorlith> i have a ATI Radeon 9700, does anyone know whats the highest success guide for setting it up? : /
[07:31] <mcquaid> whats a good util/cmd to compare two text files and output any differences?

[07:31] <yemu> jamincollins: a little
[07:31] <drwahl> hey... i am having problems with rythmbox... i was wondering if any could lend some assistance...
[07:31] <mcquaid> jamincollins, i just tried diff and it showed no output, do I have to manually pipe it to a file?

[07:32] <mcquaid> ya thats what i did
[07:32] <mcquaid> hmm
[07:32] <jamincollins> then according to diff the files are the same
[07:32] <jamincollins> there is also cmp
[07:32] <jamincollins> cmp file1 file2
[07:32] <jamincollins> but it will only tell you if the files are different, not the specific difference

[07:34] <_azrael> Ah.
[07:34] <bunnythebunny> jamincollins, well, that is an alternative but...i don't know, i guess that would be sort of evading the problem.
[07:34] <Fuzzy76> _azrael: Not right now, the machine's at my job. :p I couldn't get on IRC from it. Hence my question here. :-/
[07:34] <Juan> Has Ubuntu inside the TeteX distribution?
[07:34] <mcquaid> ok diff worked that time, but I guess i need a more intelligent diff, because if one line is different it reports all the following lines as different even though they appear in both files
[07:35] <jake_-> hi guys, can anyone pls point me to right direction for getting my wlan interface to show up in networking
[07:35] <jamincollins> mcquaid: diff -au file1 file2 # should give context
[07:35] <Fuzzy76> _azrael: But the xorg.conf is generated with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. But it didn't autodetect my card, I had to choose "ati" manually

[07:36] <_azrael> Fuzzy76: Obviously you'd use ATI instead, but your section should use somthing like that.
[07:36] <jamincollins> seems the bridge interface defaults to the highest MAC of all interfaces within it
[07:37] <_azrael> Fuzzy76: Oh, and you do know the ati driver is called "fglrx", right?
[07:37] <Fuzzy76> _azrael: I think it did. I'll take a look at it tomorrow.
[07:37] <rooti1> hi, tell me, when putting something to /opt, in my case azureus, where do i have to create the starter file to get it into my application menu ? :D
[07:37] <jamincollins> that is with eth0 and eth1 having ...:89 and ...:8A respectively, the bridge will have ...:8A
[07:37] <bunnythebunny> Thanks wiliamts99
[07:37] <WonderWal> uhh i have a wireless network card, and a normal ethernet card. how do i distinguish between the two in my interfaces file?
[07:37] <FredSambo> the proprietary ati driver is called fglrx
[07:37] <_azrael> Fuzzy76: _not_ "ati" in the driver slot?
[07:38] <jamincollins> which presents a problem when eth0 (...:89) is  a wireless interface
[07:38] <Fuzzy76> _azrael: Yes. Fglrx did work on the machine earlier. But I wanted to revert in order to get xinerama to work, since the built in pseudo-xinerama in fglrx forced same resolution on both displays.

[07:46] <kitche> nick`: sure you can just intall unrar
[07:46] <Williamts99> nick`, yes, then sudo apt-get install unrar
[07:46] <lupo> che cosa con patate

[07:48] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell lupo about it
[07:49] <minimec> theD3viL: Have a look at the preferences of your tv-software. maybe you have to change the video output.

[07:49] <d0uglas> i know my hd is broking but is there a way out
[07:49] <theD3viL> minimec, oh, you think Composite and svideo?
[07:49] <jamincollins> well, that didn't work
[07:50] <Williamts99> nick` it's not winrar it's unrar
[07:50] <minimec> theD3viL: no. somwthing like x11 or glx.
[07:50] <ross> lupooo
[07:50] <nick`> Williamts99: Look at line 85
[07:50] <theD3viL> minimec, hm..where to change that? And what is it ?
[07:51] <kitche> nick` have you done sudo apt-get update?
[07:51] <FredSambo> nick try: sudo unrar -el file.rar
[07:51] <minimec> theD3viL: Go to the preferences of your tv software and look for something like video-outpu or so.
[07:51] <martyyyr> what do I need to make an xsession start up script  visible to the login manager?
[07:51] <jamincollins> so, let's look at the other end... anyone know how to trigger a script when the ethernet cable is removed or connected?
[07:52] <Williamts99> nick`, enter sudo apt-get install unrar into a terminal
[07:52] <nick`> kitche: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32160/
[07:52] <minimec> jamincollins: have a look at /etc/network/interfaces. This is the old debian way ;)
[07:52] <nick`> Williamts: Look at the first paste

=== freebsd_fan is now known as [a] freebsd_fan
[07:53] <kitche> nick`: ok I see the part with the update most likely it can't find the package list in those repos
[07:53] <martyyyr> my xsession lasted less than 10 seconds, because it couldn't find the startup file that I want for xgl... but the file exists...
[07:53] <minimec> jamincollins: so I cannot help you ;)
[07:53] <nick`> kitche: so what do i do
[07:54] <FredSambo> nick`, i didn't have to install unrar, it was already on my install by default.
[07:54] <kitche> nick`: edit your source.list so you are using good repos
[07:54] <nick`> FredSambo: Me too, but, its not letting me extract rars
[07:55] <kitche> FredSamb: if you look he's using hoary
[07:55] <B_166-ER-X> i need help,i cannot find anything on this... I installed beryl, on a Edgy. All works fine, but my Gdesklets behave weirdly, i CANT but them down the 1/3 ofthe screen, it just wont.... i dont understand why, anyidea?
[07:55] <nick`> kitche: how
[07:55] <FredSambo> hoary!  wow
[07:55] <FredSambo> sorry
[07:55] <Williamts99> nick`, you should clean up your sources.list
[07:55] <nick`> Williamts99: how
[07:55] <Williamts99> there is an online generator at ubuntu.nl I think, hold on, I will get you a link
[07:55] <nick`> ok
[07:55] <kitche> nick`: http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
[07:56] <kitche> Williamts99 got it already :)
[07:56] <martyyyr> yay for the dutch :)
[07:56] <Williamts99> that was quick kitche
[07:56] <martyyyr> my xsession lasted less than 10 seconds, because it couldn't find the startup file that I want for xgl... but the file DOES exist.  any sugestions?
[07:56] <nick`> kitche: And what am I doing with this?
[07:56] <kitche> Williamts99: I was on that page before you said anything
[07:57] <Williamts99> lol
[07:57] <orangefly> does anyone know a way to backup full data files from windows to the server....???....i need files updated hourly....
[07:57] <kitche> nick`: you have to redo your source.list that page will help you make one then you must put source.list in /etc/apt/
[07:57] <Williamts99> nick`, also have you thought about upgrading to a more up to date Ubuntu?  Like Dapper or Edgy?
[07:58] <Williamts99> nick`, the command to edit your sources.list would be sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:58] <roryy> orangefly: windows has a task scheduler; Control Panel -> Schedule Tasks (I think).  You'll need to make a share available on the (Ubuntu?) server using Samba
[07:58] <lunaphyte_> why does /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload sometimes take an eternity to run?
[07:58] <nick`> Ugh this is making no sense to me lol
[07:58] <Abst> Is there a program to rrecord a video of my screen?
[07:59] <Running_aim> hello..who can tell me the difference between beryl and xgl
[07:59] <Williamts99> nick', on that webpage, select your ubuntu version, and enter your country code
[07:59] <dade`> beryl is a window manager
[07:59] <nick`> US i assume
[07:59] <nick`> lol
[07:59] <dade`> xgl is the X server
[07:59] <orangefly> i have a share.....windows backup doesn't copy full files accessable by others....
[07:59] <dade`> with gl acceleration
[07:59] <minimec> Running_aim: xgl is an x-server. Beryl is a software that needs xgl or aiglx
[08:00] <kitche> Running_aim: xgl is an overlay of X server ,and also if you have nvidia you don';t need xgl or aiglx
[08:00] <Williamts99> nick`, then pretty much check the boxes and choose give me sources.list
[08:00] <minimec> Running_aim: ... that means... aiglx is an x-server module too ...
[08:00] <martyyyr> any experts on xsessions?
[08:00] <nick`> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32161/ is what I got Williamts99
=== casper__ is now known as Vspirit
[08:01] <kitche> Running_aim: aiglx is Xorg's version of XGL pretty much
[08:01] <dade`> you are all confunsing this poor lame
[08:01] <Williamts99> nick`, you will then copy that to your sources.list file on your computer, using the command I gave you earlier, it will bring up your sources.list file, just have to replace it with the newly generated list
[08:02] <Running_aim> i am using an ati radeon card..do i need to install both beryl and xgl or can i use beryl without xgl?
[08:02] <Williamts99> nick`, looks like you didn't check the boxes :-)
[08:02] <FredSambo> it is amazing how something as simple as unrar can be so easy for some and so difficult for others.
[08:02] <FredSambo> i love linux
[08:02] <dade`> Running_aim: can you be more specific about the radeon card you use, and what distro ?
[08:02] <minimec> Running_aim: It depends of the card you have. Newer cards need xgl... older ones may work with aiglx.
[08:02] <kitche> Running_aim: you need xgl or aiglx
[08:03] <nick`> Williamts99: I did too! =p
[08:03] <Running_aim> because i installed both beryl and xgl but when i go to login i get an error message saying that i have been in for 10sec and that it has to quit
[08:03] <Williamts99> nick`, do you know how to send a PM?
[08:03] <minimec> Running_aim: Tell us the card you have in your computer.
[08:03] <Running_aim> it is ati radeon 345 and i tried it on xubuntu

[08:08] <martyyyr> xsession experts?
[08:08] <Running_aim> minimec: i cannot now cause i am in windows
[08:08] <sinthetek> i went to upgrade from dapper to edgy, and started apt-get update/upgrade before i read the note on using aptitude rather than apt-get
[08:08] <FredSambo> wow, i just noticed the paste url
[08:08] <FredSambo> lol
[08:08] <LjL> elsebasbe: hm, try "sudo chown elias /home/elias/.Xauthority"
[08:08] <variant> sinthetek: it wont kill you
[08:09] <Williamts99> nick`, yes
[08:09] <sinthetek> so i cancelled the apt-get dist-upgrade, which originally listed like 1000 packages
[08:09] <Running_aim> but i have tha ati radeon igp 345m
[08:09] <sinthetek> and tried it with aptitude
[08:09] <martyyyr> my session lasts less than 10 seconds because the xsession says the file that it needs doesn't exist..but it does, any suggestions?
[08:09] <minimec> Running_aim: Oups ... You should find this information in the hardware settings in the Control Center
[08:10] <we2by> any good c+= editor like kedit but for gnome?
[08:10] <Running_aim> minimec: that is where i found it
[08:10] <elsebasbe> LjL: that did the trick!
[08:10] <we2by> c++
[08:10] <sinthetek> with apt-get it hadn't actually started installing anything yet, it was just getting them, so i figured no package list updates or anything had occurred, but at the start of aptitude upgrade, it only listed like 200 packages instead of 1000+
[08:10] <elsebasbe> LjL: you wanna tell me what the problem was?
[08:10] <roryy> !coding | we2by
[08:10] <ubotu> we2by: Programming editors/suites: Terminal-based: vi/vim, emacs - KDE: Kate, KDevelop, Quanta+, Umbrello - GNOME: gvim, gedit, anjuta, eclipse, pida
[08:10] <LjL> elsebasbe: that your .Xauthority file wasn't owned by your user, apparently
[08:10] <FredSambo> we2by, you can use kedit in gnome!
[08:11] <elsebasbe> LjL: oh, that's odd :s
[08:11] <sinthetek> so is my cancellation of apt-get going to break/interfere with the aptitude dist-upgrade?
[08:11] <elsebasbe> LjL: well, thanks!
[08:11] <LjL> elsebasbe: a bit. perhaps you did something as root that you shouldn't have
[08:11] <martyyyr> elsebasbe, LjL   was that an xsession issue?
[08:11] <sinthetek> like i said, apt-get hadn't actually started installing, it was only downloading the packages
[08:11] <LjL> martyyyr: ?
[08:11] <elsebasbe> LjL: yeah, perhaps. can't remember anything though
[08:12] <sinthetek> it looks like it is
[08:12] <martyyyr> LjL, the issue you were discussing with elsebasbe:  was it an xsession issue?
[08:12] <Running_aim> minimec: i have the compaq presario 2560ea

[08:13] <Wipster> hey I'm reletivly new to Ubuntu and feel like doing a fresh install and sorting out my partitions, what are the recomended partitions/sizes for linux both security and speed wize?
[08:13] <Juftus> Hello! There's this bug in Edgy's Xorg related to multiple Matrox graphics cards. Is there any info out there as to when it will be fixed?
[08:13] <LjL> Wipster: little to do with security and speed
[08:14] <Williamts99> Juftus, there was an update today was it fixed?
[08:14] <FredSambo> does everyone agree that there should be a swap partition on each disk (if you have multiple)?
[08:15] <LjL> FredSambo: if the disks are equally fast, i think it's a good idea
[08:15] <treitter> is there any way to make usplash stay up until X is completely loaded?
[08:15] <LjL> if one is much faster than the other, i doubt it is
[08:15] <Wipster> LjL: ok thought keeping the system files on an different partition heled a bit, is there a recomended setup tho? (I do already have swaps over 2 disks)
[08:15] <LjL> treitter: it does
[08:15] <Juftus> Williamts, oh, you're right about the update. I don't know as I'm asking this on behalf of a friend of mine. Have to ask him.
[08:15] <martyyyr> no one who has an idea? :(
[08:15] <treitter> (right now I'm getting a handful of different screens that get flicked through between usplash finishing and GDM (which I've got auto-logging in))
[08:16] <LjL> Wipster: i have / and a separate /home partition.
[08:16] <Running_aim> minimec: found anything
[08:16] <LjL> treitter: so, you mean until *GDM* has finished loading, not X... well, no.
[08:16] <treitter> LjL: this is on Dapper (I don't have the option of upgrading in this case)
[08:16] <Wipster> just /home and / no /etc /var /boot etc?
[08:16] <treitter> LjL: yeah, I suppose
[08:16] <FredSambo> LjL, Wipster: i have separate / and home partitions as well
[08:17] <FredSambo> Wipster, those will be set up in the root.
[08:17] <treitter> LjL: do you know if usplash_down gets called at all?
[08:17] <jshriver> anyone know how to fix the Nforce3 bug w/ USB mice?
[08:17] <jshriver> or manually set an IRQ?
[08:17] <LjL> dunno treitter

[08:17] <swilliamson> anyone here familiar with vsftp on ubuntu?  I am wanting to restrict directory access to users and not allow them to browse the entire directory structure
[08:17] <treitter> LjL: cool, thanks
[08:17] <LjL> but treitter, when X starts up, it just takes over the screen
[08:17] <jshriver> my mouse seems to keep having IRQ conflicts, it keeps stopping and I have to unplug/replug it
[08:17] <treitter> LjL: that's true
[08:17] <zarephath> CupOfSquirrels, : Try eth0 then
[08:17] <treitter> so I guess I've got to try to handle this on the gdm/X end of things
[08:18] <minimec> Running_aim: Hmmm .... If it works, it probably works with the ati fglrx driver. I don't see, that your card is working with aiglx. Is this a 3D card?
[08:18] <CupOfSquirrels> zarephath: Nope. The card is pci btw.
[08:18] <CupOfSquirrels> "No such device"
[08:18] <Wipster> FredSambo, LjL: recomended size of /?
[08:18] <treitter> LjL: although there is a really short gap where tty8 gets exposed before GDM takes over, though
[08:18] <treitter> LjL: but that may also be X's fault
[08:18] <FredSambo> Wipster: the rest

[08:19] <we2by> any one knows what command to start Eclipse?
[08:19] <FredSambo> Wipster, how big is the drive?
[08:19] <LjL> treitter, i remember there is an option to make X start in the background. i don't remember which option it is, though, and i do remember that i didn't get it to work. if you somehow do, you could then perhaps use "chvt" to switch to X after GDM is finished
[08:20] <kitche> we2by: eclipse
[08:20] <FredSambo> Wipster, I susally set up a 1-2GB swap, 10GB / and the rest is home

[08:21] <treitter> LjL: so just to double-check - usplash doesn't really exit early - it waits until X is started? But if X starts in the background, I don't think that would help, would it?

[08:22] <jpgeerets> hi folks
[08:22] <Dromede> hello
[08:22] <jpgeerets> i have an usb problem
[08:23] <davin> Hi, I have a Compaq Wireless USB Mouse, but it doesnt work with the new Edgy CD (live session), I popped in a old Dapper CD and it worked flawlessly, why? (have been using Dapper on other machine for months)
[08:23] <Dromede> any hamachi users here?
[08:23] <jpgeerets> someone perhaps can help?
[08:23] <azcazandc1> does anyone have experience getting a radeon 9600pro running under dapper 64bit?
[08:23] <we2by> any one knows what command to start Eclipse?
[08:23] <meisam_> sorry i have a problem...i have installed real player 10
[08:23] <jshriver> we2by: eclipse
[08:23] <meisam_> there is icon in my desktop, that it does not remove
[08:23] <we2by> jshriver: it is not
[08:23] <jshriver> or ./eclipse if in the directory
[08:23] <meisam_> it is related to the real player
[08:23] <zarephath> CupOfSquirrels, : Google for it...also you can issue dmesg to see if it is listed there....just type that in a terminal window...you might reboot although it shouldnt be necessary
[08:24] <we2by> jshriver: you don't know the application I'm talking about
[08:24] <jshriver> hrm I just tar -zxvf Eclipse-whatever.tar.gz into ~/Eclipse then ~/Eclipse/eclipse &
[08:24] <jshriver> eclipse the IDE for JAva, etc?
[08:24] <jpgeerets> my usb-drive mounts
[08:24] <jpgeerets> but still is empty says the screen
[08:24] <FredSambo> everyone in this channel is really nice
[08:24] <FredSambo> cheers
[08:24] <jpgeerets> but i know there is 150Gb data on....
[08:24] <jpgeerets> but i cant see
[08:25] <jpgeerets> any idea's?
[08:25] <davin> jpgeerets: tried fdisk -l?
[08:25] <kitche> we2by: you have to change to whee you put eclipse then run ./eclipse
[08:25] <davin> Hi, I have a Compaq Wireless USB Mouse, but it doesnt work with the new Edgy CD (live session), I popped in a old Dapper CD and it worked flawlessly, why? (have been using Dapper on other machine for months)
[08:25] <meisam_> sorry guys, i have installed real player 10 but the address of destination was in desktop, now i wanna unstall it, because there is an icon related to real player theta does not remove, what should i do?
[08:25] <zarephath> jpgeerets, : What filesystem?
[08:25] <kitche> we2by: since you installed it in ~/Eclipse it's probably not in your path
[08:25] <we2by> kitche: the install went through apt-get
[08:25] <jpgeerets> filesystem is ext3
[08:25] <we2by> it should be
[08:26] <jpgeerets> when use fdisk -l i get a disk
[08:26] <kitche> we2by: ok then it's should be eclipse since that's how it's started unless you didn't get some of the packages
[08:26] <jpgeerets> 3 partitions
[08:26] <jpgeerets> thats right....
[08:26] <meisam_> no body knows the problem i have?
[08:26] <nuked_omen> how can i figure out my ip address so i can access my computer from the internet
[08:26] <Dromede> any hamachi users here?
[08:26] <zarephath> meisam_: Just use synaptic and search for realplayer..tell it you want to uninstall all of it
[08:26] <minimec> Running_aim: Well there is an ati fglrx driver for your card, a new one. Thar probably means, that your card is working with xgl.
[08:26] <CowzRule> How do I unload a plug-in in X-Chat?
[08:26] <FredSambo> nuked_omen: ifconfig
[08:26] <we2by> !java
[08:26] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:26] <treitter> LjL: ah - the thing that actually triggers usplash ending is the gdm init script. Looks like I've got a strong lead on my issue now. Thanks again!
[08:26] <davin> None of my mice work in Edgy but they worked flawlessly in Dapper?
[08:27] <jshriver> Anyone know how to manually setup the IRQ for a USB mouse?
[08:27] <Running_aim> minimec: so what should i do?
[08:27] <FredSambo> i am in love with ubotu
[08:27] <bitchslapper> my equations are too long, how do I split them up?  I mean I can do a \par and $$ on each line, but that's not so clean.

[08:27] <jpgeerets> FredSambo: i prefer a women if you dont mind
=== G-net|Gilnim is now known as gilnim
[08:28] <misreckoning> hello everybody! my notebook is curious to know - is it finally possible to run fglrx with hardware acceleration on x1100 and x200 graphics cards?
[08:28] <FredSambo> no no, uBOTu
[08:28] <minimec> Running_aim: Fallow the ubuntu wiki for xgl. You can find the link in the #ubuntu-xgl channel
[08:28] <meisam_> <zarephath> there was no real player there, i searched
[08:28] <davin> Why doesnt my usb mouse work in Edgy while it worked like a chamr in Dapper?
[08:28] <davin> charm*
[08:28] <nick`> why does sudo apt-get install p7zip-full not work?  its not finding it
[08:28] <roryy> bitchslapper: you can try using and eqnarray, or eqnarray* environment; also check out the 'amsmath' package; it has lots of ways of splitting equations
[08:28] <jshriver> having the same problem
[08:28] <Running_aim> ok..thanx
[08:28] <jshriver> mouse wont work, or sporadic
[08:29] <bitchslapper> roryy .. alright .. thanks

[08:30] <zarephath> jshriver, : Yeah 64bit version
[08:30] <jshriver> meisam think you basically just rm ~/realplayer
[08:30] <ladydoor> meisam_: sudo aptitude remove realplayer?
[08:30] <jshriver> can you do a apt/dpkg upgrade to AMD64 distro? or would I have to redo the entire machine?
[08:30] <gilnim> hey guys
[08:30] <minimec> Running_aim: install the fglrx driver with synaptic.
[08:30] <azcazandco> anyone know why dapper drake 64bit freezes?
[08:30] <davin> So can anyone help me getting my usb mouse to work (I tried 8.) none of em work in Edgy but perfect in Dapper?
[08:31] <azcazandco> I have had to restart 3 times 5 mins
[08:31] <unimatrix9> can the usplash of egdy be used in dapper?
[08:31] <FredSambo> ubotu tell us about fglrx
[08:31] <gilnim> since updates today i get following failure: Xlib:  "extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"."
[08:31] <minimec> Running_aim: Then you have to modify your xorg.conf
[08:31] <tokenbad> I can't seem to get the nvidia drivers to work...I have done the wiki...but everytime restart it gives me this gdm error something....anyone help?
[08:31] <kitche> jshriver: well multilib is a bit hard so you would have to redo the whole machine if you want a full AMD64 machine
[08:31] <davin> tokenbad: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, choose the nvidia driver and accept the rest default
[08:31] <minimec> !ati | Running_aim
[08:31] <ubotu> Running_aim: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:31] <jshriver> rm, well it runs well now.. not worth the time but will remember for next time
[08:31] <jshriver> still wish I could get the mouse working
[08:31] <davin> why doesnt my mouse work?
[08:31] <davin> it did on dapper...
[08:32] <FredSambo> i get it now
[08:32] <gilnim> davin: what driver are you using?
[08:32] <meisam_> ladydoor i did that, but still the directory in desktop is still there and there is lock photo on the icon,  im not allowed to remove ittt
[08:32] <micktm> Anybody knows how to use Crossover?
[08:32] <kitche> davin: jshriuver it's probably how the kernel is set up or the driver that you are using in edgy
[08:32] <Running_aim> minimec: thanx
[08:32] <Dromede> has anyone tried running a game under wine or cedega and playing it in multiplayer over hamachi?

[08:32] <davin> gilnum, kitche: dunno, its the live session
[08:33] <azcazandco> CharlieSu: thanks for the help earlier btw... I got things running after I restarted the process
[08:33] <TheGino> hey all whats the best programs from add/remove applications for a NoOb and a beginner like me
[08:33] <kitche> meisam_: you have to use sudo to remove it probably since it's owned by root
[08:33] <gilnim> My Logitech MX510 doesn't work, too
[08:33] <ladydoor> meisam_: is it owned by root? you can find out with ls -l /path/to/dir/the/realplayer/dir/is/in
[08:33] <davin> im trying to install edgy but my mouse doesnt work
[08:33] <azcazandco> gilnim: I had fun trying to get mine working
[08:33] <davin> during the live session
[08:33] <meisam_> kitche i used sudo :(
[08:33] <zarephath> tell TheGino about synaptic
[08:33] <unimatrix9> meisam_ start console , type sudo nautilus , now browse to the file
[08:33] <davin> whats up with all the mouse problems in edgy o_O
[08:33] <gilnim> azcazandco: mine shot down my X server
[08:33] <gilnim> :)
[08:34] <jshriver> well have a good day everyone
[08:34] <truk77> does anybody here have experience installing ubuntu onto an AMD based laptop with the xpress 1150 motherboard? (Turion)
[08:34] <gilnim> davin: they suck
[08:34] <azcazandco> gilnim: not so good
[08:34] <kitche> meisam_: you sudo is more for consoel apps teh gui apps use gksu or gksudo
[08:34] <minimec> FredSambo: ???
[08:34] <azcazandco> I had a tutorial ages ago about getting it running and I think i did the same....  took down X
[08:34] <TheGino> LOL i know about it also that too which programs?? for noob
[08:34] <davin> Cant I install Dapper and 'upgrade' to Edgy using the net?
[08:34] <FredSambo> minimec: i just figured out ubotu
[08:34] <gilnim> azcazandco: no, eventually not
[08:35] <Running_aim> minimec: the ati card for which the link refers to is different to mine
[08:35] <unimatrix9> meisam_ its  in home your name desktop
[08:35] <unimatrix9> i think...:)

[08:35] <ReySon> Hello everyone,
[08:35] <ReySon> can Someone help me?
[08:35] <Keyseir> Does anyone know if it's possible to change to a regular text cursor in Kate instead of this text cursor thingie that selects a character and doesn't allow things like creating spaces inbetween two adjacent already entered characters?
[08:35] <ReySon> I got critical problem!
[08:35] <unimatrix9> can the usplash of egdy be used in dapper?
[08:35] <gilnim> !updates
[08:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about updates - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:35] <kitche> !ask
[08:35] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:35] <TheGino> Aegis virus scanner any good
[08:35] <minimec> Running_aim: I see. I am not sure again, if your card is working with xgl or aiglx. I am sorry ;)
[08:35] <alecjw> does fluxbox have a notification area where i can put a battery level monitor?
[08:35] <gilnim> ReySon: Just ask!
[08:35] <ReySon> I got critical problem!! Probably my disk has been removed when I installed ubuntu!:'((
[08:35] <Running_aim> minimec: how can i check?
[08:36] <kitche> ReySon: what do you mean exactly?
[08:36] <minimec> FredSambo: Nice gadget, isn't it?
[08:36] <ReySon> When I installed Ubuntu, it dont load. So I changed OS to Windows, and it dont detecting my D: partition!
[08:36] <ladydoor> alecjw: you could put a wmwidget into the slit
[08:36] <ciaron> anyone know why i get "could not open default font 'fixed'" when trying to run vncserver
[08:36] <kitche> REySon: and what's on D:?
[08:36] <ReySon> I want my D: partition back?
[08:36] <FredSambo> minimec: completely awesome!
[08:36] <davin> ReySon: what did you do?
[08:36] <ladydoor> alecjw: they're little boxes that contain things like, say, battery moniters--there are a ton of them in the repos.
[08:36] <ReySon> 50gb of disk space and 20gb of school projects?
[08:36] <Dromede> has anyone used hamachi for lan multiplayer?
[08:36] <kitche> ciaron: it's not installed
[08:36] <minimec> Running_aim: Surf around and look for some informaiton about that card. That's all I can say.
[08:36] <gilnim> ReySon: Do you have some kind of live cd to watch if it's still there?
[08:36] <ciaron> kitche: what package is it?
[08:36] <Running_aim> ok thanx
[08:36] <davin> Dromede: yes I do, pretty neat
[08:36] <FredSambo> ReySon: calm down, it will be OK
[08:36] <kitche> ReySon: I mean what filesystem?
[08:37] <alecjw> ladydoor: do you know of any battery minitos for fluxbox?
[08:37] <gilnim> Dromede: I did

[08:37] <ReySon> FredSambo, it wont be ok, cause ppls on Ubuntu-pl said my disk can be thought away
[08:37] <Genrl_Zod> i mean cheaper than cheap
[08:37] <unimatrix9> ReySon, open console and type mount, see if its mounted
[08:37] <gilnim> Dromede: worked well
[08:37] <FredSambo> !bruva
[08:37] <truk77> Genrl_Zod what's that got to do with Ubuntu?
[08:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bruva - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:37] <Dromede> davin: which game did you try?
[08:37] <ReySon> Windows says, that D: partition is unknown ....
[08:37] <ReySon> for it
[08:37] <Genrl_Zod> ubuntu mp3
[08:37] <Dromede> did you play the game over wine or cedega?
[08:37] <Genrl_Zod> haha.
[08:37] <kitche> zarephath: it's probably private one of my domains is setup that way so no one can see the information fro that domain
[08:37] <ladydoor> alecjw: not specifically...search for packages starting with wm and you can put those in fluxbox's Slit.
[08:38] <FredSambo> ReySon, did you back up like a good boy?
[08:38] <ReySon> How?
[08:38] <ladydoor> alecjw: *many of them, i mean
[08:38] <ReySon> I mean
[08:38] <ReySon> no
[08:38] <ReySon> I dont :/
[08:38] <mzanfardino> I'm new to linux and want to know how I can determine what I have installed on my system.  Can someone help?
[08:38] <gilnim> ReySon: Maybe Linux changed the partition table
[08:38] <FredSambo> then it is your fault
[08:38] <FredSambo> bad sysadmin
[08:38] <Dromede> im trying to play half life over cedega with hamachi for multiplayer
[08:38] <ReySon> So how to change it back... ?
[08:38] <azcazandco> ] man 64 bit dapper sucks ass
[08:38] <Dromede> but i cant get  to work
[08:38] <gilnim> Dromede: yes
[08:38] <azcazandco> it just crashes every few mins
[08:38] <ReySon> If I dont get this disk back, i dont get promotion to next class!
[08:38] <FredSambo> !backup | ReySon
[08:38] <ubotu> ReySon: There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi
[08:38] <unimatrix9> ReySon, whats the problem, you installed and want to get the partition back in windows or what?
[08:39] <azcazandco> anyone got any suggestions?
[08:39] <davin> ReySon: Relax, we will help you.
[08:39] <gilnim> mzanfardino: Synaptic
[08:39] <almir> anyone know anything about linux+pocketPC
[08:39] <alecjw> ladydoor: thanks. i've found somethiung good :)
[08:39] <gilnim> !synaptic
[08:39] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[08:39] <ladydoor> alecjw: cool.
[08:39] <Williamts99> azcazandco, maybe use the 32bit version :-)
[08:39] <mzanfardino> so then aptitude would be the text-version?
[08:39] <kitche> ciaron: fixed isn't even used anymore but I would just check if you have all the fonts installed
[08:39] <davin> ReySon: Boot to the Ubuntu Live CD and type 'fdisk -l' in the terminal, then go to www.pastecode.com, paste it, and give me the link
[08:39] <ReySon> Erm. Once again. I installed Ubuntu, and choosed a partition. Ubuntu is not loading correctly, cause its stopping on loading. So I went to Windows, and It says, that D: partition is unkown for him...............
[08:39] <ebfe> could someone try to create multiple ssh sessions on ebfe.dyndns.org ?
[08:39] <zarephath> ReySon, : First lesson never install to same hard disk if you aren't absolutely sure what you are doing..you haven't told anyone what you did so we can't offer advice
[08:40] <ciaron> kitche: as far as i can tell yeah, what package are the fixed fonts in?
[08:40] <FredSambo> ReySon: you didn't lose anything... yet
[08:40] <unimatrix9> ReySon, ubuntu uses an different filesystem that windows cannot read
[08:40] <mzanfardino> one more question: how can I display a list of logicals?
[08:40] <Williamts99> !ext3
[08:40] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[08:40] <ReySon> So how I can retrieve my disk?
[08:40] <ReySon> To be seeable for windows?
[08:40] <FredSambo> ReySon, boot to it
[08:40] <davin> ReySon: boot the live cd and copy your files on a external hard disk or the like
[08:41] <FredSambo> windows will never see it
[08:41] <gilnim> Do you have suggestions for this problem?: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[08:41] <davin> ReySon: then you can copy it back to a ntfs partition that windows can read
[08:41] <ciaron> kitche: ah no worries, fixed. was vnc looking for fontpaths in the wrong order
[08:41] <Sarkie> hi guys, basically ubuntu doesnt support my soundcard chip, and i dont care, so how do i kill it, and make it not load it? cheers

[08:41] <ReySon> one moment

[08:41] <ReySon> Yes
[08:42] <ReySon> because Ubuntu dont load :/
[08:42] <unimatrix9> ReySon has installed ubuntu and wants the partition back....and is in windows..
[08:42] <azcazandco> Williamts99: can i downgrade?
[08:42] <davin> ReySon: does the live cd boot?
[08:42] <Dromede> gilnim: about the hamachi thing, did you play the game over wine or cedega?
[08:42] <unimatrix9> is that correct?
[08:42] <gilnim> ReySon: It works pretty good. - this driver
[08:42] <azcazandco> or do i have to re-install
[08:42] <ReySon> Yes
[08:42] <ReySon> I mean
[08:42] <ReySon> no
[08:42] <ReySon> I downloaded

[08:42] <ReySon> Ubuntu
[08:42] <ReySon> from page
[08:42] <ReySon> LiveCD dont boot
[08:42] <gilnim> Dromede: Wine I think
[08:42] <napg> thats not true, i used "explore2fs" on windows and got some files i needed from my ubuntu partition

[08:43] <ReySon> davin, I mean, I INSTALLED Ubuntu, but it dont LOAD
[08:43] <azcazandco> do you think my 64bit install was corrupt?
[08:43] <unimatrix9> ReySon be clear about what you need / wanto do...
[08:43] <davin> ReySon: no problem you can use the live cd to retrieve your files on the harddisk
[08:43] <gilnim> Olli1: use: "/connect [server ip] "
[08:43] <ReySon> Ubuntu LiveCD?
[08:44] <FredSambo> ReySon, you need to boot to that partition
[08:44] <davin> ReySon: Install CD = Live CD
[08:44] <ReySon> o
[08:44] <Dromede> gilnim: lol. of course. i can connect to my friends hamachi network, i can see all the people on the network and they can see me.
[08:44] <ReySon> oh*
[08:44] <Olli1> thank you thank you gilnim :)
[08:44] <davin> FredSambo: cant he copy his files off using live session?
[08:44] <TheGino> how can i install a taz.gz file which is a program
[08:44] <FredSambo> davin: he 'could'
[08:44] <davin> ReySon: hold on ill tell you what you can do to get back here in on the live cd
[08:44] <Dromede> gilnim:but it just wont find the server. im using cedega 5.2
[08:44] <FredSambo> davin: but could he?
[08:44] <gilnim> Dromede: then maybe cedega is stupid
[08:45] <davin> ReySon: boot to the live cd, in the live session open a terminal, type 'sudo irssi -c irc.freenode.net -n ReySon' then when it is connected type '/join #ubuntu'
[08:45] <Dromede> gilnim:which version of wine did you use?
[08:45] <gilnim> Dromede: do you really pay money for using cedega?
[08:45] <dabaR> !compile |theGino

[08:45] <ebfe> could someone try to create multiple ssh sessions on ebfe.dyndns.org ?
[08:45] <Dromede> gilnim: yea
[08:45] <gilnim> Dromede: I think the newest
[08:45] <FredSambo> davin, i thin ReySon was just having trouble booting into his ubuntu partition
[08:45] <Dromede> gilnim:
[08:45] <azcazandco> does anyone have any suggestions about why my default install of dapper 64 wont work?
[08:45] <Dromede> gilnim:its a good program
[08:46] <WonderWal> how can i see if my network card is bound to eth0?
[08:46] <davin> FredSambo: No, he has important school files on a ext3 partition that his windows cant read, so im telling him to copy them off using the live cd
[08:46] <ALi_> Hello, how can i install form a text boot on my ubuntu live cd?
[08:46] <dabaR> ebfe: you could
[08:46] <unimatrix9> and he wants his partition reclaimed in windows...
[08:46] <gilnim> Dromede: hmm - i wouldn't pay money for it though
[08:46] <holler> does anybody know what the default user is for php on a ubuntu box?
[08:46] <ebfe> dabaR: its a firewall/routing thing
[08:46] <FredSambo> i am confused
[08:46] <FredSambo> lol
[08:46] <gilnim> me 2
[08:46] <Olli1> it says no such command gilnim
[08:46] <davin> FredSambo: He has school files on a partition, ext 3, his ubuntu screwed up and Windows cant read ext3
[08:46] <FredSambo> !windows

[08:46] <TheGino> just type compile in the terminal dabaR
[08:46] <TheGino> ??
[08:47] <davin> ReySon: still here?
[08:47] <gilnim> Dromede: no - sorry
[08:47] <Dromede> gilnim: there's absolutely NO info on this subject on the whole internet... i cant believe it.
[08:47] <unimatrix9> better be sure ta ask what he really wants
[08:47] <ALi_> Hello, how can i install form a text boot on my ubuntu live cd?
[08:47] <gilnim> Olli1: what program do you use?
[08:47] <ReySon> Yes
[08:47] <ReySon> Im here
[08:47] <davin> ReySon: let me explain
[08:47] <Olli1> i am using gaim
[08:47] <ReySon> davin, what to use? Original LiveCD or this one, .iso I recorded?
[08:47] <gilnim> Dromede: did you try wine?
[08:47] <Olli1> this is my first Linux run...about 15 minutes now heheh
[08:47] <davin> ReySon: Dapper CD?
[08:48] <tazz> i have a p4 processor and i am upgrading my kernel from 386 to 686 will there be any unwanted side effects?
[08:48] <ReySon> Yes
[08:48] <ReySon> alternate install CD
[08:48] <netG> I'm searching for an alternative to Beagle
[08:48] <davin> ReySon: No use the normal one
[08:48] <bimberi> tazz: should be fine
[08:48] <ReySon> I downloaded from page or original LiveCD?
[08:48] <ReySon> Ok
[08:48] <jerp> ali, download an alternative cd
[08:48] <netG> Does it exists?
[08:48] <davin> ReySon: let me explain your current situation
[08:48] <gilnim> Olli1: go to accounts and create one that connects there
[08:48] <napg> ReySon: check the message i sent u
[08:48] <tazz> ah thanks bimberi, but is it recomended?
[08:48] <ALi_> is there no way i can install the live cd at all?
[08:48] <Dromede> gilnim: yea, the latest one. the thing is my crappy GPU is having some issues with ubuntu 6.10 so i cant play it in opengl mode.
[08:48] <unimatrix9> can the usplash of egdy be used in dapper?
[08:48] <ReySon> davin, can
[08:48] <ReySon> i cant see private messages
[08:48] <Dromede> gilnim: i get like 0.5 fps
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> tazz, running dapper or edgy? all edgu users should use the generic kernel
[08:48] <oddballin> hi anybody... is there any way i can stretch my display beyond what xubuntu have to offer?
[08:48] <Olli1> ok thank you gilnim
[08:49] <Dromede> gilnim: and software mode wont work on wine
[08:49] <dabaR> oddballin: resoulution?
[08:49] <Dromede> gilnim: but it works on cedega
[08:49] <davin> ReySon: Your school files are on a 'Ext3' partition, Windows can only read 'VFAT/NTFS' not 'Ext3'. What you're going to do is use the Live CD to copy the files off your harddisk to a safe location, such as an external harddisk or pendrive.
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, edit your xorg.conf
[08:49] <dfgas> how do i get glxgears to post fps?
[08:49] <tazz> nolimitsoya, i dit-upgraded to edgy. (i know i shouldnt have, but i have no complaints:-P)
[08:49] <davin> ReySon: then you can move them back to Windows or look into installing Ubuntu
[08:49] <bimberi> tazz: not forcefully.  I've not bothered.  Apparently the performance gains aren't that great
[08:49] <gilnim> Dromede: at least you don't get hit by anybody with .5 frames
[08:49] <tazz> dist-upgraded*
[08:49] <dabaR> dfgas: man glxgears... I think there s \\is --show-fps
[08:49] <Dromede> gilnim: har har har har
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> tazz, then you should be using the generic kerlen.
[08:49] <lupine_58> dfgas: glxgears -iacknowledgethatthistoolisnotabenchmark
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> *kernel
[08:50] <tazz> ah ok then thanks :-)
[08:50] <gilnim> Dromede:  my cs works well with the actual wine
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, use ext2ifs to read ext3 from windows
[08:50] <Dromede> gilnim: i have a riva tnt2 vanta crap. and i cant get it to work in 4x mode on ubuntu. gnome just hangs on login
[08:50] <davin> ReySon: or you could use Ext2fs to read them in Windows
[08:50] <ALi_> is there no way i can install the live cd at all?
[08:50] <napg> ReySon: or explore2fs
[08:50] <ReySon> I installed this driver, and what now?
[08:50] <gilnim> Dromede: don't ask me about it -.-
[08:51] <davin> So whats up with this mouse stuff in edgy>?
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> ALi_, click the install icon on the desktop
[08:51] <oddballin> nolimitsoya, how would i do that? in termainl?  what is the path?
[08:51] <gilnim> Dromede: had a riva tnt 2 pro once
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, in a terminal: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:51] <bimberi> ALi_: if the livecd doesn't boot to the gui desktop successfully then you'll need to get the altnerate unfortunately
[08:51] <ALi_> but that doesnt seem to work, i can get to the desktop after 10 minutes of the cd wirling
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, just add the resolution you want, using the old ones as a guide
[08:52] <ALi_> but i then click install, lots of processor and hardrive activity but nothing
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> ALi_, do a md5 hash of the cd, and if it checks out, get the alternate install. if it doesnt, burn a new disc
[08:52] <ReySon> davin! I got now ORIGINAL, LiveCD in CD-ROM
[08:52] <ReySon> What to do now?
[08:52] <oddballin> nolimitsoya, got it... so i just change the mode numbers... from "1280 x 800" to something else.. but im not sure about depth?
[08:52] <ReySon> Too many ppls talking, i cant see directly your msgs
[08:52] <FredSambo> that is the question
[08:53] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, as i said, you want the ext2ifs for windows.
[08:53] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, boot windows and download it
[08:53] <ReySon> I installed it
[08:53] <ReySon> Im on Windows
[08:53] <parejaBilbao> quit
[08:53] <[Utah] tristanbob> if you use wireless on (edgy) Ubuntu, does the drop-down menu display the available wireless networks?
[08:53] <napg> ReySon: just use explore2fs on windows to access your files on the linux partition
[08:53] <holler> does anybody know what the default user is for php on a ubuntu box?
[08:53] <FredSambo> !troll
[08:53] <[Utah] tristanbob> this worked in dapper, then broke ni edgy upgrade
[08:53] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, then you dont need the ubuntu disc. just go into the control center, and click the ext2ifs icon
[08:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about troll - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:53] <unimatrix9> ReySon , got an usb flash drive, plug it in and copy files to it, could be an other option
[08:54] <ReySon> I dont have nothing that I can copy files....
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> unimatrix9, not a very practical one, though
[08:54] <Centaur5> I put my wpa key in Edgy's keyring manager but every time I turn on my computer it still asks for me to type it in.  What am I doing wrong?
[08:54] <napg> can someone tell ReySon to use some small software to access the linux partition...
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, just go into the control center, and click the icon as i said. then pick a label for the partition you want access to. its then avalable through the explorer
[08:55] <nolimitsoya> napg, done, since way back
[08:55] <napg> nolimitsoya, indeed lol
[08:55] <oddballin> nolimitsoya, you there?  i got it.. but what do i do with "depth" part?
[08:55] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, just leave it
[08:56] <[Utah] tristanbob> if you use wireless in Edgy, does the drop down menu of available wireless networks work for you?  this use to work for me in dapper, now that I have upgraded to edgy, it doesn't show any networks
[08:56] <bluefox83> how do i get firefox to stop using the mozilla-totem plugin and use the mozilla-mplayer plugin?
[08:56] <ReySon> I got Explore2fs, and what do to now with it?
[08:56] <unimatrix9> can the usplash of egdy be copied to dapper?
[08:56] <napg> davin: just tell him to do as nolimitsoya said or with explore2fs
[08:56] <ReySon> There is folders tree...
[08:56] <napg> finally
[08:56] <davin> ReySon: my apologies
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, you shouldnt use explore2fs. i told you to get ext2ifs
[08:56] <kikokos> hi
[08:56] <napg> extract the archive to your hard drive
[08:56] <ebfe> could someone try to create multiple ssh sessions on ebfe.dyndns.org ?
[08:56] <napg> and run it
[08:56] <ReySon> I got ext2ifs too
[08:56] <derlandi> hey @all
[08:56] <macgyver187> Help:
[08:56] <bluefox83> [Utah] tristanbob, upgrading has caused ooddles of problems for people..you probably wouldn't have so many problems if you just straight up installed from scratch
[08:56] <davin> Why doesnt my mouse work in edgy.
[08:56] <napg> u should see the linus partitions through it
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, then install it, and follow the instructions i gave you?!
[08:57] <kikokos> I have a q, I`ve just installed opendb, but when I try run it from terminal it do nothing...how I can check which commend run this program?
[08:57] <davin> ReySon: make sure you reboot after you set up everything in Ext2fs
[08:57] <ReySon> ohhhh
[08:57] <ReySon> ok
[08:57] <ReySon> brb
[08:57] <[Utah] tristanbob> bluefox83: I have not istalled any non-standard repos
[08:57] <derlandi> can please someone tell me how jump in the german ubuntu server?
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, hows it going?
[08:57] <ReySon> restarting computer
[08:57] <davin> ReySoon: good luck
[08:57] <dabaR> kikokos: dpkg -L opendb
[08:57] <oddballin> nolimitsoya, done writing out.  do i need to restart?
[08:57] <kikokos> dabaR gracias
[08:57] <napg> explore2fs is so much easier =/
[08:57] <macgyver187> I've been trying to install LinPhone and cant get past this configure message: "Could not find libreadline..." but its there
[08:57] <nolimitsoya> davin, please reffer to it as ext2ifs, since thats its name. confusions is not good thing
[08:57] <bluefox83> [Utah] tristanbob, doesn't matter..it's causing issues for everyone that upgrades..just do a fresh install
[08:58] <nolimitsoya> napg, but not as practical, once everything is set up
[08:58] <ladydoor> macgyver187: you probably need to install libreadline-dev
[08:58] <davin> nolimitsoya: ah okay I thought it was ext2fs, not ext2ifs
[08:58] <macgyver187> ok...will try
[08:58] <gilnim> following problem after xorg updates today: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"
[08:58] <dabaR> kikokos: that is not the answer exactly to your question, but will show all files that were installed.
[08:58] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, you just need to restart x
[08:58] <Dromede> gilnim:it wont work on wine either. it cant detect the server
[08:58] <FredSambo> davin, did you check your xorg.conf file?
[08:58] <ladydoor> macgyver187: usually if there're complaints of missing libraries, it's the dev stuff that's missing
[08:58] <nolimitsoya> oddballin, ctrl+alt+backspace
[08:58] <davin> FredSambo: why?
[08:58] <nolimitsoya> davin, ifs stands for Installable File System
[08:58] <dabaR> kikokos: try sudo invoke-rc.d opendb restart too.
[08:59] <macgyver187> ok...I assumed all Dev is for programmers...:)
[08:59] <FredSambo> davin: isn't that where your mouse settings are?
[08:59] <davin> FredSambo: my mouse isnt working on the live cd, I want to install Edgy.
[08:59] <neobonzi> how do I automatically have a command execute on startup?
[08:59] <FredSambo> davin, oh
[08:59] <nolimitsoya> davin, use the alternate install cd, or struggle with the tab, space and enter keys
[09:00] <bluefox83> davin, in a terminal do: sudo psmouse
[09:00] <bimberi> neobonzi: add it to /etc/rc.local (will run as root)
[09:00] <mparrish> I want to install grub version 0.97-11ubuntu14 on my edgy system, but when I do "apt-get install grub=0.97-11ubuntu14" it says it cant find it.  How do I do what I want?
[09:00] <neobonzi> bimberi, thank you
[09:00] <bimberi> neobonzi: yw
[09:00] <davin> bluefox83: whats psmouse?
[09:00] <Legion> I'm buying a brand new comp, and I want to put Ubuntu on it. Should I just get the Desktop CD?
[09:01] <davin> Legion: if you use it as a Desktop PC, yes.
[09:01] <kzm_> Legion, don't see why not.
[09:01] <bluefox83> davehat, actually i forgot part of the command  do: sudo modprobe psmouse
[09:01] <bimberi> mparrish: try downloading the deb and installing using 'sudo dpkg -i file.deb'
[09:01] <bluefox83> er
[09:01] <bluefox83> davin,
[09:01] <Legion> can I be fairly confident that drivers and such will work without too much intervention?
[09:01] <kikokos> dabar
[09:01] <mparrish> bimberi: I trid that, but it has a libc dependency.
[09:01] <kikokos> when i tried first command it show me where i have files
[09:01] <davin> gonna boot to edgy now brb (ill try irssi)
[09:01] <bluefox83> davin, sudo modprobe psmouse
[09:02] <davin> hold on im on dapper live now, gonna boot to edgy, brb.
[09:02] <bluefox83> davehat, will load the ps2 mouse driver
[09:02] <kikokos> dabar but second show sudo invoke-rc.d opendb
[09:02] <kikokos> invoke-rc.d: syntax error: missing required parameter
[09:02] <davin> its usb though
[09:02] <bluefox83> oh
[09:02] <dabaR> kikokos: add restart at the end
[09:02] <kikokos> dabar ok
[09:02] <bluefox83> dunno what to tell you..try unplugging it and plugging it back in
[09:02] <bimberi> mparrish: ah, so you'll need to compile from source
[09:03] <davin> ill try to tinker xorg.conf brb then
[09:03] <ReySon> ekhm ekhm
[09:03] <kikokos> dabar sudo invoke-rc.d opendb restart too
[09:03] <kikokos> invoke-rc.d: unknown initscript, /etc/init.d/opendb not found.
[09:03] <nolimitsoya> davin, use the alternate install cd, or struggle with the tab, space and enter keys. you shouldnt need the mouse.
[09:03] <kikokos> dabar so reinstall?
[09:03] <dabaR> kikokos: then it is not ran as a daemon, or server.
[09:03] <ReySon> When I go to "Computer Management" -> "Disk management" it says, that 40gb and 26gb has status: UNKNOWN and uknown file systems
[09:03] <ReySon> and look at it
[09:03] <oddballin> nolimitsoya, lol.. it work... thanks, and bythe way, its my first time using linux so im learning.. slowly...  :)

[09:06] <FantasticFoo> can anyone help me get X setup on Edgy? i had it working perfectly with 3d acceleration and everything on dapper. :( and now, after upgrading to edgy, i get a "module mismatch" and "fglrx module isn't available" and "module abi major version doesn't match the server's version"
[09:06] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, winkey+e
[09:06] <ReySon> In "My Computer" there is no D: disk ... just C:....
[09:06] <ReySon> D: just dissapeared when I changed files system....
[09:06] <dabaR> kikokos: what do you mean remember what is on the CD? If it is for example a "Sting" cd, then a program such as amarok, or rhythmbox will know the tracks as soon as you put in the cd, cause it can access an online database.
[09:06] <liestas> hi
[09:06] <piggyg1> hi
[09:06] <nolimitsoya> FantasticFoo, have you installed the right nonfree modules package?

[09:12] <shadeofgrey> is there a way to enable tiger to manage ext3 formatted drives?
[09:12] <ReySon> nolimitsoya: I mean, I can't access to D: partition through explorer...
[09:12] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, just awnser the questions clearly: can you, or can you not, se the partition under a new letter in the explorer?
[09:12] <dabaR> shadeofgrey: You can mount ext3 in tiger, yes.
[09:12] <ReySon> I CAN'T
[09:12] <dabaR> shadeofgrey: there is a mount command in mac os x
[09:12] <dabaR> shadeofgrey: as well as a man command.
[09:12] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, then have you gone back to the ext2ifs control panel and checked the settings? are you , in fact, using ext3, and was the program you downloaded ext2ifs?
[09:13] <nolimitsoya> !ext2ifs
[09:13] <dabaR> shadeofgrey: I am not sure of the exact syntax.
[09:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ext2ifs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:13] <kikokos> anybody know good program which can scan dvd and remembered what I have on this disc?
[09:13] <mnepton> AFAIK OSX does not access ext*
[09:13] <ReySon> nolimitsoya: Yes. I put a copy of debugg log. Want to see it again?
[09:13] <allz> Ubuntu, please tell allz about paste!
[09:13] <dabaR> mnepton: I used to mount it.
[09:13] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, www.fs-driver.org ?
[09:13] <dabaR> mnepton: IIRC;)
[09:13] <ReySon> Yes
[09:13] <mnepton> there was a plugin for ext* for Panther, but it does not work in Tiger
[09:13] <ReySon> I dowloaded it
[09:13] <shadeofgrey> everything i have been trold by the people in #macosx claim that ext3 partitions cant be mounted
[09:13] <ReySon> and reboot computer
[09:13] <dabaR> shadeofgrey: just man mount.
[09:14] <dabaR> shadeofgrey: and find out for yourself.
[09:14] <allz>  Ubotu, please tell allz about paste
[09:14] <mnepton> dabaR: we're not interest in your sexual orientation >:)
[09:14] <ReySon> and in "Computer managing" -> "Disk managing" it shows, that 40gb and 26gb is not recognized... Status: UNKNOWN

[09:15] <dabaR> niktaris: yes
[09:16] <BrunchyMeatballs> can anybody field a question as to why my windows partition, which was always autodetected when I opened places > computer, has disappeared since installing edgy?
[09:16] <ReySon> I configured ext2ifs driver, and no, my files systems are: Ext2 and ReiserFS
[09:16] <niktaris> dabaR, how ?
[09:16] <LLcoolM> hi
[09:16] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, they look like reiserfs to me... did you mount the right one? have you rebooted?
[09:16] <ReySon> Yes, I rebooted
[09:16] <niktaris> dabaR, any app for this? or... ?
[09:16] <LLcoolM> i have a problem with ubuntu installer. it seems it cannot install ubuntu on hdb if there is not yet a partition on it
[09:16] <dabaR> niktaris: well, it just worked here.

[09:17] <ubotu> You're Welcome!
[09:17] <MenZaLap> Where's the article on info on how to write to ntfs?

[09:19] <MenZaLap> Cheers LjL
[09:19] <allz> LjL here you go -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32178/
[09:19] <micktm> I can't use cedega!!! someone could help me?
[09:19] <ReySon> nolimitsoya: What in this case... ?
[09:19] <allz> #cedega
[09:19] <nolimitsoya> MenZaLap, ntfs-3g is nice, but take every effort to aviod ntfs. use ext2/3, and ext2ifs, or fat32 instead
[09:20] <LjL> allz, had you tried installing vlc from a .deb file earlier?
[09:20] <MenZaLap> nolimitsoya: er, it's for my external hdd
[09:20] <allz> nope
[09:20] <MenZaLap> Fat32 is nogo, too small
[09:20] <allz> ljl ! i was gonna
[09:20] <MenZaLap> And I need Windows to be able to read it too
[09:20] <oddballin> how do i compile the .rpm? i just downloaded gaim 2.0beta5
[09:20] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, what what? highlight every line you type, or ill miss it. if everything is correctly configured, itll work. redo what your did, and sort out what you did wrong. install, reboot, mount, try another reboot
[09:20] <MenZaLap> !rpm
[09:20] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[09:21] <LjL> allz: what's the output of "apt-cache policy vlc" and of "apt-cache policy wxvlc" and of "apt-cache policy libdc1394-13"
[09:21] <ashzilla> Can someone recommend a program I can use to connect to a Windows VPN.
[09:21] <motoplux> oddballin install alien and the alien .rpm
[09:21] <javiolo> oddballin get a .deb
[09:21] <nolimitsoya> MenZaLap, ext2ifs allows windows to read ext2 (or ext3, but without journal)
[09:21] <ReySon> nolimitsoya : It dont work....
[09:21] <Maurox> compile rpm ????? i think that is on redhat channel :S
[09:21] <nolimitsoya> MenZaLap, and write to, of course...
[09:21] <oddballin> Hmm, how do I install gaim then?
[09:21] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, then you probably did something wrong
[09:21] <MenZaLap> nolimitsoya: oh really
[09:22] <Maurox> ubuntu ??? sudo apt-get install gaim
[09:22] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, with out a clue as to what, i cant help you
[09:22] <eobanb_> ashzilla, PPTP?

[09:22] <nolimitsoya> ReySon, are you using some strange lvm configuration, perhaps?
[09:22] <twopeak> How should I upgrade to firefox 2? the synaptic only offers me the previous version...
[09:23] <MenZaLap> !info mozilla-firefox
[09:23] <ubotu> mozilla-firefox: Transition package for firefox rename. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0+0dfsg-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 54 kB, installed size 112 kB
[09:23] <nolimitsoya> MenZaLap, id say ext2ifs and extfs of some sort is the best chice for sharing drives with windows...
[09:23] <LjL> twopeak: you don't. you can upgrade to Edgy if for some reason you need firefox 2
[09:23] <sohail> howcome i cant connect to archives.ubuntu.com

[09:24] <haxality_> I'm trying to figure out how to enable gnome-netstatus-applet
[09:24] <nolimitsoya> adilson, hw raid arrays should just work, transparently
[09:24] <Skyrail> what can play .mov files right out of the tin? or how can I get a plugin for a program so taht it can paly them easily?
[09:24] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, sudo apt-get install mplayer
[09:24] <eobanb_> Skyrail, the .mov container itself can be played in most players.  i assume you're referring to some particular codec
[09:24] <eobanb_> !restricted
[09:25] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[09:25] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, or realplayer, from the non free repo
[09:25] <oddballin> for GAIM, which file should i download...  	gaim-2.0.0beta5.tar.bz2    or  	gaim-2.0.0beta5.tar.gz   ?
[09:25] <MenZaLap> either.
[09:25] <adilson> kernel 2.6.17 in this case debian etch rc4
[09:25] <nolimitsoya> Skyrail, canonical mailtains a repo with commersial software, outside of ubuntu
[09:25] <LjL> allz: gee, it really seems like i cannot read a sources.list - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32183/
[09:25] <MenZaLap> I personally prefer gzip, but meh
[09:25] <adilson> ubuntu it only for workstation here
[09:25] <eobanb_> oddballin, neither; ubuntu comes with gaim
[09:25] <ladydoor> oddballin: they're pretty much going to be identical. they're just different archive formats
[09:25] <adilson> and debian it only for server here
[09:25] <LjL> allz: (though i do wonder how you got it into that messy state :P)
[09:26] <MenZaLap> notice the 'beta', eobanb_.
[09:26] <Skyrail> nolimitsoya: ok, I'll try mplayer first, if most players play .mov files why can't I play this one?
[09:26] <pirx> hi! where do i change the "look and feel" of the default window manager? (i want to enable the "mouse wheel" on my laptop to scroll in windows)
[09:26] <oddballin> eobanb, yea, but i want to use gaim beta 5...
[09:26] <MenZaLap> pirx: mine does that by standard.
[09:26] <eobanb_> oh, i see.
[09:26] <nolimitsoya> adilson, shouldnt you be in the debain channel then?
[09:26] <ladydoor> oddballin: first, you're going to want to uninstall or divert ubuntu's gaim, though
[09:26] <mobal> hello everybody!
[09:26] <mobal> need some xgl help

[09:26] <mobal> :)
[09:27] <mobal> thanks
[09:27] <LjL> allz: that what i pasted it and use it as your sources.list
[09:27] <LjL> allz: (that is, basically, add the line " deb http://is.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main restricted " at the beginning of it)
[09:27] <nolimitsoya> adilson, then you are not making sense. you where talking about debian etch rc4 just now. what the prolem you have anyway?
[09:27] <LjL> allz: that what = take what

[09:28] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: sorry i missed what you said
[09:28] <ladydoor> pirx: are you using ubuntu, kubuntu, or xubuntu?
[09:28] <pirx> MenZaLap: fujitsu siemens amilo pro 2000 or somthing like that:)
[09:28] <LjL> allz: yeah, it's precisely what i said, except that i typoed and said "that" instead of "take"...
[09:28] <MenZaLap> pirx: not familiar with it, sorry
[09:28] <Skyrail> simple and stupid (but easy) question, is there any way to run games that require DirectX to run on Linux, yes I know Linux isn't the gamers platform...but light relief every once in a while...:D
[09:28] <nolimitsoya> FantasticFoo, and ive forgot what i said. what where you asking?

[09:29] <pirx> ladydoor: ubuntu. i hope, uname doesnt give that info:/
[09:29] <Skyrail> LjL: thanks
[09:29] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: i was asking about how to get X working again, because fglrx wasn't working after an edgy upgrade
[09:29] <alecjw> will the rt2500 drivers work on an rt2500 USB device?
[09:29] <oddballin> ladydoor, i just  uninstall gaim now... what do i need to do to install with the source code?
[09:29] <Williamts99> !ubotu
[09:29] <MenZaLap> oddballin: compile it
[09:29] <tat> alecjw: I think theres another driver for the USB-device, afaik its included in Ubuntu. Try to plug it in.
[09:30] <MenZaLap> !compile
[09:30] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[09:30] <pirx> ubuntu 6.06 it seems
[09:30] <nolimitsoya> adilson, if you want support about your debian server, you should be in the debian support channel (no i still dont get it, and i am paying attention :) )
[09:30] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: you were saying something about not having the right kernel version or something
[09:30] <adilson> i have here enlightenment 17.... but beryl-manger do not work.... what is the problem?
[09:30] <alecjw> tat: you mean ubuntu base system or ubuntu desktop?
[09:30] <ladydoor> pirx: open up your package manager and do a search for ubuntu-desktop, and see which is installed
[09:30] <tat> alecjw: base system
[09:30] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell adilson about beryl
[09:30] <adilson> ok

[09:30] <alecjw> ok. thanks tat
[09:30] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: ok

[09:32] <ladydoor> pirx: ok, so you're looking for info on Metacity if you want the window manager in particular. however, if you're dealing with the mouse, i'd look for any info about your particular brand of mouse on linux
[09:32] <nolimitsoya> FantasticFoo, one step at a time

[09:37] <LjL> allz: if you see the nvidia logo when X starts, it is installed
[09:38] <ladydoor> oddballin: well, i don't know anything about gnome per s, but anyway, what you should do is move it somewhere out-of-the-way. i, for example, have a ~/src dir
[09:38] <allz> ljl yes i see it
[09:38] <allz> hehe i am on steam and it says
[09:38] <allz> video card not decteded

[09:38] <davin> allz: cedega?
[09:38] <allz> no
[09:38] <allz> wine
[09:38] <LjL> well that's a problem with steam i guess.
[09:38] <davin> allz: does steam stop loading after 26% updating?
[09:38] <allz> no
[09:39] <allz> steam is just fine

[09:40] <dope> so anyone got any ideas on my wireless problem?
[09:40] <kzm_> Anybody know the scripts on intitramfs well?
[09:40] <neobonzi> How would i go about mounting my windows partition so it shows up in my "computer" like an external or USB drive?
[09:41] <dope> wireless used to work, i installed some ubuntu updates or something and now wireless can see access points but won't connect to any of them
[09:41] <sampo_v2> is there a system available to create different ubuntu installation CD's ?

[09:43] <adilson> what about ps2 emulator on ubuntu?
[09:43] <Legion> Does somebody have a newbies guide to linux?
[09:43] <ladydoor> oddballin: oh! well, real people are way more important than anything online
[09:43] <dope> is there a way to uninstall the bcm43xx-fwcutter program?
[09:43] <fyrestrtr> Legion: step 1. Praise the greatness of moi step 2. format Windows
[09:43] <dope> does it need to be uninstalled
[09:44] <davin> Legion: First, make sure you're sure you actually want to use Linux
[09:44] <draeath> im running ubuntu on a laptop. /boot is on /dev/hda2, / is on /dev/sda1 (external HD) - if i loose power, the system stays up but the root filesystem goes down. Besides putting the journal for sda1 on hda somewhere, what else can I do to get the system to handle it? ideally the system would pause disk writes/reads untill the FS came back, and then would scan the FS for consistancy before resuming. is that possible?
[09:44] <davin> Legion: what do you want to use your computer for?
[09:45] <davin> hold on gotta reboot
[09:45] <any> Hi
[09:45] <Q_Continuum> Question: Just installed 6.10 on laptop (emachines M6805) tried changing resolution to 1280x800 (native) and had corrupted video.
[09:46] <Q_Continuum> Have to mouse over a button or option in order for the correct text/image to display.
[09:46] <Legion> I study computer science, so I find it rather important that I learn to work Linux. My university is very fond of linux, and I'm tired of finding alternatives for everything
[09:46] <LeeJunFan> crap, I really wish ATI would get on the ball with Linux drivers. Just updated mine and now I can't resume from suspend to ram.
[09:47] <ladydoor> Legion: wow, where do you go to school?
[09:47] <mcsmurf> hi, I have Ubutu 6.06 installed and was running a security update earlier
[09:47] <Legion> University of Copenhagen
[09:47] <needinfo> Hello
[09:47] <mcsmurf> there it warned me about a missing signature for the cpio package so I cancelled it...
[09:47] <mcsmurf> why is the signature missing, just an error or...?
[09:47] <draeath> anyone have any idea? or would this be better for the forums and/or ##linux?
[09:48] <needinfo> How do I get to command line when gui freezes?
[09:48] <allz> needinfo just ask your question .we are steel breathing :)
[09:48] <Legion> I'm very comfortable with Windows, but it's kinda on the expensive side of things
[09:48] <Falstius> needinfo: sometimes you can use ctrl+alt+f1
[09:48] <Legion> and when I need a C compiler I fucking have to SSH to my school and use theirs
[09:48] <Falstius> to get back to the gui, use alt+f7
[09:48] <needinfo> Tried that. Went no where.
[09:49] <Legion> and that stuff burns like abortion!
[09:49] <LjL> !language | Legion
[09:49] <ubotu> Legion: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:49] <ciaron> whats a good v. lightweight window manager?
[09:49] <Falstius> needinfo: if that doesn't work than it is a lower level crash and you probably need to reboot the machine.
[09:49] <njan> legion, you can install gcc in winows.
[09:49] <any> why are the modules of volatile/ replaced at each boot ?

[09:49] <ubotu> ciaron: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with XFCE, for more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org  To install from Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[09:50] <alecjw> i have a wireless network set up, how do i make it connect?
[09:50] <mcsmurf> Cygwin GCC? I would rather avoid it, it's not very good and not very fast ;)
[09:50] <draeath> legeon, investigate 'cygwin'
[09:50] <draeath> then find one compiled with mingw32 :)
[09:50] <needinfo> I am new to linux. This is a new install. Had it working with command line in Edgy.
[09:50] <Falstius> mcsmurf: you can use msys instead of cygwin.  It is a lightweight branch.
[09:50] <mcsmurf> yeah, that one is a bit better
[09:50] <mcsmurf> Falstius, normally i use M$ Visual Studio Free Edition 8-)
[09:50] <needinfo> Then I did apt-get desktop. I have not been able to reboot since.
[09:51] <Legion> all in all, I'm tired of throwing money at MS, and learning new stuff was never a bad thing
[09:51] <fivre> mingw?
[09:51] <draeath> yes
[09:51] <fivre> whatever it is that comes with Dev-Cpp?
[09:51] <Gecko> Is there any way I can capture what files a program (tries to) access?
[09:51] <needinfo> It freezes with the Ubuntu logo.
[09:51] <mcsmurf> Gecko, yes....
[09:51] <mcsmurf> if I could only remember the name
[09:51] <mcsmurf> strace?
[09:51] <needinfo> I have rebooted many, many times.
[09:51] <Gecko> mcsmurf: please tell me! :)
[09:52] <mcsmurf> yeah, I think that's it
[09:52] <draeath> fivre: dev-cpp comes with gcc compiled with mingw
[09:52] <alecjw> i have a wireless network set up, how do i make it connect?
[09:52] <strabes> alecjw: use network-manager-gnome
[09:52] <Falstius> needinfo: you can reboot into the command line by playing with grub ... select your normal boot, press 'e' for edit, go to the kernel line, press 'e' again and add 'single' to the end of the line.  Hit enter a few times and you're booting into the command line.
[09:52] <strabes> alecjw: you haev to install it
[09:52] <Falstius> needinfo: you might just be able to use the recovery boot option too .. I've never actually tried.
[09:53] <jvolkman> needinfo, boot in single-user mode
[09:53] <allz> ljl is it ok to get rid of glx ?
[09:53] <alecjw> strabes: i'm using a pentium with 32mb ram. network-manager-gnome somehow seems illogical
[09:53] <strabes> alecjw: wifi seems illogical
[09:53] <LjL> glx? no
[09:53] <anika> Anyone have adeb for gaim beta5?
[09:53] <Falstius> Gecko: you can use strace or lsof (which lists open files)
[09:53] <allz> ljl vitamin the channel operetor wine says .that get rid of glx then you will play cs fine

[09:54] <allz> how to remove glx ?
[09:54] <allz> then ljl
[09:54] <skenliv> is kopete better then gaim?
[09:55] <thevenin> skenliv: that iall your own preference
[09:55] <anika> skenliv: depends on what youlike
[09:55] <allz> ljl is kdm better then glx?
[09:55] <clearzen> I'm having trouble getting widescreen resolution on my laptop. Can anyone help me?
[09:55] <anika> I like functionality so gaim is better :)
[09:55] <strabes> alecjw: i dunno. if you don't want to use a panel based one then you would haev to configure it with network-admin
[09:56] <eigenlambda> skenliv: no
[09:56] <WonderWal> how do i load a module at startup? i know the name of  the module
[09:56] <alecjw> strabes: is that another graphical thing? is there any way of connecting in the commandline?
[09:56] <sampo_v2> is there a system like jigdo available which could be used to build custom ubuntu DVDs, and perhaps select which packages are installed on the iso filesystem?
[09:56] <eigenlambda> skenliv: unless, you really really really want everything to be kde
[09:56] <godfather> hi guys
[09:56] <godfather> i wish to know
[09:56] <eigenlambda> skenliv: otherwise, use gaim, it's what everybody else uses.  firefox, too.
[09:56] <allz> someone is KDM better then GLX?
[09:56] <anika> allz: What?
[09:56] <tgelter> I'm trying to encode an avi to mpeg4 compatible with ipod, anyone have experience with that?
[09:56] <godfather> ho t upgrade my dapper drake to edgy eft version
[09:57] <eigenlambda> in fact, unless you rly rly like kde, just use gnome, it's what everybody else uses

[09:58] <allz> :x
[09:58] <anika> allz: I don'
[09:58] <anika> t know thatthere isa difference
[09:58] <jorgp> anyone know where to get the edgy artwork before it was canned and put back to dappers?
[09:58] <alecjw> mr_daniel: a kde program which is like amarok, but for midi files rather than audio files
[09:58] <allz> anika . is it ok to remove glx ?
[09:58] <ashzilla> what's the pptp client?
[09:59] <alecjw> strabes: so do you know what command i need?
[09:59] <anika> allz: Sure I guess
[09:59] <jorgp> allz, kdm is kde, gdm is gnome
[09:59] <dope> :|
[09:59] <mr_daniel> kmid can play midi, thats fine, but just a workaround

[09:59] <dope> maybe you?
[09:59] <mr_daniel> ...are able to play midi-files
[09:59] <alecjw> mr_daniel: i don't think that theres any way of playiong midi's in amarok
[09:59] <eigenlambda> use firefox instead of konqueror, i meant
[09:59] <eigenlambda> by the way, konqueror sucks
[09:59] <strabes> alecjw: you're probably going to need to do sudo ifconfig eth1 up and sudo dhclient eth1
[09:59] <dope> wireless yay nay?
[09:59] <mr_daniel> alecjw: I hope your're not right :)
[10:00] <ashzilla> Can someone please recommend a client for pptp

[10:01] <CarlFK> strabes: I hear there is a .deb in debian expermential repos - and my plan was to apt-get source gaim, then build the binary deb myself -
[10:01] <strabes> CarlFK: which one should i download then? I know how to convert rpms to deb
[10:01] <strabes> CarlFK: bah
[10:01] <mr_daniel> and here is a module explaned, which seems to be able to allow ALL programs to play midi-files http://alsa.opensrc.org/virmidi

[10:11] <UKMatt> does anyone know why my dig camera won't connect to Ubuntu?  It did before Edgy went on, maybe I'm missing a package?
[10:11] <LjL> yohan: i'd try something like  "grep -A 20 -B 20 blahblah /dev/hda1 >recovered", where "blahblah" is a word or expression (case sensitive!) that you know is contained in the file, and /dev/hda1 is your HD partition (change it if needed), the two 10's are the number of lines before and after the "blahblah" that you want to recover (change at will), and the contents should be recovered into a file named "recovered"

[10:13] <froshie> yohan: before grepping for the text
[10:13] <LjL> yohan: also, you should do that from a live cd possibly, to avoid overwriting it
[10:13] <yohan> froshie: might not work else?
[10:13] <Skyrail> I have BitTornado running but its not as fast as I wish as its behind a firewall on the router, problem is that I don't know how to change it so that it can download the torrents pretty quickly...
[10:13] <LjL> yohan: no, it simply might trash the file completely.
[10:13] <LjL> actually, anything you do now might trash it
[10:13] <fyrestrtr> open the ports from the firewall?
[10:13] <LjL> so just reboot and use a live cd
[10:13] <yohan> k
[10:13] <froshie> LjL: correct
[10:14] <yohan> not so important tho....shit no program to add redundency with rm?
[10:14] <Skyrail> fyrestrtr: I don't know which ports I need to open
[10:14] <LjL> yohan: not with ext3 that i know of.
[10:14] <yohan> so instead of dissapearing it'll go to .Trash
[10:14] <yohan> :/
[10:14] <LjL> yohan: having   alias rm="rm -i" is a good idea imho
[10:14] <LjL> yohan: you can make an alias or script for that too if you like
[10:15] <fyrestrtr> Skyrail: find out what ports it is using, generally its udp 6881-6889
[10:15] <Skyrail> ok, I'll see if I can open those ports up
[10:15] <yohan> hehe yeh
[10:15] <yohan> thnx
[10:15] <dope> where can i find the broadcom bcm 4306 driver?
[10:16] <froshie> dope: you mean the original for the linux or the window's one?
[10:16] <dope> i think i need the one for linux
[10:16] <dope> as my wireless in linux doesn't work
[10:16] <dope> but the windows wireless works
[10:17] <dope> i used bcm43xx-fwcutter the first time around and it worked
[10:17] <froshie> dope: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Broadcom43xx
[10:17] <nick`> How do I execute a perl script
[10:17] <fyrestrtr> nick`: perl foo.pl
[10:17] <dope> i was able to get online through wireless but i installed some ubuntu updates and i can see networks but not connect to them
[10:17] <FlyingSquirrel32> If I have a daemon that I start like this: sudo /usr/sbin/mydaemon & then how do I add an init script and be sure that it returns so the rest of the things in init also run?
[10:17] <dope> any ideas?
[10:17] <ashzilla> Hi. I'm looking for someone to help me configure a VPN connection correctly using PPTP... Can anyone help me?
[10:18] <froshie> dope: check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Broadcom43xx
[10:18] <dope> yea i'm there lookin
[10:19] <drwahl> any one here able to help out with some sound issues?
[10:19] <dope> just after installing some ubuntu update i can't connect but i can still see wireless access points
[10:19] <froshie> dope: have you tried ndiswrapper?
[10:19] <strabes> dope: sudo dhclient eth1
[10:19] <dope> that's what i'm doing now
[10:19] <dnite> if i'm compiling things from source and creating my own .deb, are there any directory differences than the defaults that ubuntu usually uses?
[10:19] <nick`> Arent lines that begin with # in perl comments?
[10:19] <froshie> dope: i couldn't get my 4311 working with the linux driver, ndiswrapper just works fine
[10:19] <dope> i found a tar.gz for ndiswrapper
[10:20] <dope> just type pkg_add ndsiwrapper.tar.gz right
[10:20] <dope> ?
[10:20] <bluefox83> is there a way to remove the mozilla-totem plugin without losing ubuntu-desktop ?
[10:20] <dope> cause the only way i can get online right now is using windows
[10:20] <dope> i cause use apt-get install etc
[10:20] <dope> can't use*
[10:20] <fyrestrtr> bluefox83: ubuntu-desktop is a virtual package, don't worry about losing it.
[10:20] <froshie> dope: what version of ndiswrapper have you downloaded?
[10:20] <alecjw> dope: download the DEBs
[10:21] <dope> where do i get the debs
[10:21] <dream> please some can help me i had windows 2003 on my serv er box i need to format this windows install on hard disk ubuntu
[10:21] <froshie> dope: because the ndiswrapper-src package in ubuntu is currently outdated
[10:21] <bluefox83> fyrestrtr, sooo...if ubuntu-desktop goes i wont lose my desktop ?
[10:21] <dope> yea i d/led it
[10:21] <dope> the ndiswrapper.tar.gz
[10:21] <dope> 1.28 is what it says
[10:21] <fyrestrtr> bluefox83: no :)
[10:21] <dope> sound good?
[10:21] <fivre_> Upgrading to Edgy broke my system. What do I do now?
[10:21] <froshie> dope: what kernel are you using?
[10:21] <dope> ubuntu?
[10:21] <dope> i think
[10:22] <dope> ubuntu edgy 6.10
[10:22] <froshie> dope: paste output of "uname -a" command here
[10:22] <dope> i'm not in linux right now
[10:22] <fyrestrtr> dream: don't understand your question. You want to format the disk from ubuntu?
[10:22] <froshie> dope: aah...
[10:22] <dope> cause it can't get online :P
[10:22] <alecjw> froshie: isn't it uname -r?
[10:22] <ashzilla> Hi. Assuming I wanted to add a source to the bottom of my sources.list using cat
[10:22] <froshie> alecjw: correct
[10:22] <ashzilla> what would be the systax
[10:22] <ashzilla> syntax*
[10:22] <froshie> alecjw: uname -a just prints it all ;-)
[10:22] <fivre_> he probably has 2.6.17-10
=== ubuntu4alexej is now known as AV1611
[10:22] <dope> ok so i got this ndiswrapper 1.28.tar.gz
[10:23] <dope> is that gonna be ok?
[10:23] <froshie> dope: yes...
[10:23] <ashzilla> cat "text" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:23] <fivre_> that's what comes with 6.10
[10:23] <dope> do i need to delete any of the bcm-fwcutter stuff?
[10:23] <froshie> dope: then you need the linux kernel headers for your kernel
[10:23] <AV1611> #desktopbsd
[10:23] <dope> oh man
[10:23] <froshie> dope: it's a bit tricky
[10:23] <dope> so where do i get that
[10:24] <froshie> dope: and unfortunately you're not in ubuntu now :-(
[10:24] <AV1611> oops, sorry
[10:24] <dope> :/
[10:24] <dope> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=201902
[10:24] <dope> i'm tryin to use this thread
[10:24] <ashzilla> Can someone please explain how to cat text onto the last line of a file?
[10:24] <ashzilla> cat "text to put on" >> filename?
[10:24] <LjL> ashzilla: no
=== chris_ is now known as tuskernini
[10:24] <ashzilla> LjL: please share :)
[10:24] <LjL> ashzilla: echo "text to put on" >> filename
[10:24] <dope> where can i find the correct driver?
[10:25] <ashzilla> LjL: thanks.
[10:25] <LjL> ashzilla: cat reads from standard input, not from the command line
[10:25] <ashzilla> LjL: I don't know the difference, but I appriciate your inititive.
[10:25] <ashzilla> LjL: how can I copy and paste in the cli?
[10:25] <dnite> is there a package for the 'GLib 2.0 development headers' ?? I'm trying to compile something that says I need to have these installed..
[10:26] <froshie> dope: i'm using the one from http://www.station-drivers.com/page/broadcom.htm
[10:26] <LjL> ashzilla, echo expects a parameter.  "echo foobar" prints "foobar" on the screen, because you passed it as a parameter
[10:26] <dope> you havea 4306?
[10:26] <froshie> dope: it's the broadcom windows driver
[10:26] <froshie> dope: no, 4311
[10:26] <dope> oh
[10:26] <LjL> ashzilla: cat, instead, reads from standard input -- i.e. you type "cat", press Enter, and it sits there waiting for you to type things, and prints them
[10:26] <dope> it doesn't matter does it?
[10:26] <LjL> ashzilla, depends on what terminal you're using. inside X most terminal respect the select-to-copy and middle-click-to-paste convention
[10:27] <froshie> dope: the driver's for all 43xx chipses, so it shouldn't matter
[10:27] <dope> froshie: these are all exes
[10:27] <ashzilla> LjL: Ahhhhh, thank you for clearing that up. That's a good concept to understand.
[10:27] <froshie> dope: yes, selfextracting archives
[10:27] <LjL> ashzilla: but that ends up in the middle-click clipboard, which is separate from the clipboard that ctrl+c and ctrl+v use. so if you want to copy to/from a terminal to/from another program, you need to do the same thing in the other program
[10:27] <froshie> dope: do you have a winrar or something on windows?
[10:27] <dope> yes
[10:27] <nick`> mm, how do i compile .c files
[10:27] <froshie> dope: or you maybe don't need to
[10:28] <froshie> dope: just run the exe
[10:28] <froshie> dope: it will extract the drivers
[10:28] <froshie> dope: and copy the bcmwl5.sys and bcmwl5.inf files from it
[10:28] <dope> an i use the ones i'm using right now with windows?
[10:28] <dope> can*
[10:28] <madman215> can i install ubuntu from a hard driv install of the knoppix-dbian on anothr partition or vn this on without a cd or floppy?
[10:28] <Zim> hey, do you know how to get the nicklist at the side of the chat window on X-Chat Gnome ?
[10:28] <nick`> how do you compile a c script in ubuntu? lol
[10:29] <ashzilla> gcc!
[10:29] <ashzilla> woot.

[10:31] <dope> ok well we'll see what happens
[10:31] <Fred_Sambo> anyone use vmware here?
[10:31] <froshie> Fred_Sambo: me does
[10:31] <Fred_Sambo> do you run a windows VM?
[10:31] <nolimitsoya> Fred_Sambo, yes you should
[10:31] <froshie> Fred_Sambo: yes
[10:32] <nolimitsoya> *yes you should use avg, or other av
[10:32] <Fred_Sambo> nolimitsoya: ok!
[10:32] <nick`> nod32 ftw
[10:32] <bhudda> gosh finaly!
[10:32] <bhudda> So sparratic...
[10:32] <bhudda> sporadic
[10:32] <Fred_Sambo> i should update windows then as well, just as i would with a real machine?
[10:33] <froshie> Fred_Sambo: better yes
[10:33] <nolimitsoya> Fred_Sambo, a vm is just like a regular machine, with all the problems they experience, and more. its _very_ dangerous to share drives and not have av and afullt up to date system
[10:33] <tevfikt> when i open beryl, my window title is disappear. do you think why?
[10:33] <nolimitsoya> *fully
[10:33] <Fred_Sambo> thanks!
[10:33] <Fred_Sambo> nolimitsoya, froshir, thanks!
[10:33] <axloo> hi all
[10:33] <bhudda> 'lo
[10:33] <axloo> does anybody know how to configure proxy on skype?
[10:34] <gbutler69_> Anyone know of a program for Ubuntu Edgy which will allow one, from a Shell Script, Perl Script, and/or Python Script, to show on-screen the view from an attached V4L/V4L2 WebCam and capture a snapshot for further processing on command?
[10:34] <Clin1> Can some onme help me with a shutdown problem? I want to make my computer ONLY shutdown from the shutdown option in ubuntu
[10:34] <gbutler69_> Something scriptable and/or controllable is preferred.
[10:34] <nolimitsoya> axloo, perhaps the skype faq?
[10:34] <gbutler69_> Programmitically Controllable that is.
[10:34] <axloo> thanks nolimitsoya but :( it aint working :(
[10:35] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, what do you mean?
[10:35] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, what else does it do, besides shuting down?
[10:35] <Clin1> I want to make it to where the power button on the tower act only to staart not shut down
[10:35] <nolimitsoya> axloo, probably some other (non ubuntu related) problem then.
[10:35] <Clin1> restart hibernate,
[10:35] <Fred_Sambo> vmware is the coolest thing ever!
[10:36] <Fred_Sambo> !vmware
[10:36] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository. Instructions to install VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[10:36] <froshie> Fred_Sambo: agree :)
[10:36] <JuJuBee> Anybody use DVD Decrypter?
[10:36] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, ah... you could set it to suspend in bios, and then disable the suspend option in ubuntu
[10:36] <axloo> maybe, i had configured it before but i really cant remember how, and now it isnt working because i reisntalled ubuntu
[10:37] <Xang> Fred_Sambo : We use VMware's full suite including VMotion,etc. We haven't built a bare metal server since 2004:)
[10:37] <Clin1> Hu..... i thought it was ubuntu that controled shutdown
[10:37] <nolimitsoya> axloo, try the skype support channel
[10:37] <JuJuBee> I am trying to copy a DVD adn keep coming up  with sector read errors.  If I ignore these (since I cannot get past them) can I still burn the resulting files?
[10:37] <martyyyr> does anyone know of a good all-round IDE for someone who codes in PHP/Java/C++/CSS/XML/and some more ?
[10:37] <axloo> can you tell me that channel and how can i enter it?
[10:37] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, it can, but you usualy have an option in bios to switch between shutdown and suspend. ubuntu can override that option, but doesnt have to
[10:37] <Fred_Sambo> Xang: i'm headed in the same direction
[10:38] <nolimitsoya> JuJuBee, you will still have lost data
[10:38] <Clin1> I dont want to restart wo how would i do it her
[10:38] <froshie> JuJuBee: maybe the DVD is scratched/corrupted?
[10:38] <Clin1> here*
[10:38] <Gh0sty> new edgy is great!
[10:38] <JuJuBee> I understand that.
[10:38] <Xang> Fred_Sambo: Excellent:)
[10:38] <Gh0sty> my prob with wifi solved and everything working!
[10:38] <nolimitsoya> JuJuBee, in other words, the dvd would still be corrupt. perhaps you should get one of those dvd repair kits?
[10:38] <tindust> hi all, I read that ubuntu has a text-mode installer CD, but where can I find it?
[10:38] <JuJuBee> But so far, each time I have tried to burn the disc, it has failed.
[10:38] <axloo> XGL IS GREAT :) I LOVE THE RAIN EFFECT :)
[10:38] <Gh0sty> my compliments to every developer!
[10:38] <martyyyr> axloo.. how did you get the rain effect?
[10:38] <rubengonc> hello there...could someone tell me where can i find the default config file used to build the ubuntu kernel? i know there is a 2.6.19 linux-kernel available...i would prefer that one ;)
[10:39] <JuJuBee> nolimitsoya : please explain what do you mean dvdrepair kid Physical or Software?
[10:39] <froshie> rubengonc: try looking at /boot
[10:39] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, i dont think you can do anything about that. expet from pulling the leads tothe buttons, that is...
[10:39] <axloo> do you have the XGL installed on gnome?
[10:39] <Gh0sty> probably /boot/ rubengonc ?
[10:39] <rubengonc> froshie: i am not using ubuntu
[10:39] <martyyyr> axloo, yes
[10:39] <froshie> rubengonc: aha
[10:39] <axloo> then start beryl
[10:39] <fdoving> rubengonc: /boot/config-*
[10:39] <Clin1> well if i do that then it will never staart
[10:39] <nolimitsoya> JuJuBee, physical. some very fine abrasive pads that sand down the scratches
[10:39] <martyyyr> axloo: running beryl already
[10:39] <JuJuBee> I never heard of one.
[10:39] <rubengonc> not using ubuntu...what i want is the default config file used to build ubuntu kernels
[10:40] <axloo> now go to water effect
[10:40] <fdoving> rubengonc: if you're not using ubuntu, get the source from packages.ubuntu.com
[10:40] <axloo> do you see it?
[10:40] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, true, but these are computers. they are supposed to be able to shut down and restart, even when software malfunktions :)
[10:40] <rubengonc> ok..let me check
[10:40] <grndslm> BERYL!!!!  I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
[10:40] <axloo> iit is on the left handside
[10:40] <JuJuBee> I cant understand why the files (even with missing info) wouldn't burn.
[10:40] <martyyyr> axloo: yeah
[10:40] <froshie> rubengonc: i think it's a bit different with every ubuntu kernel
[10:40] <axloo> and then go to keyboard
[10:40] <axloo> do you see it?
[10:40] <nolimitsoya> JuJuBee, they would, but they would be broken and not readable, causing all sorts of problems during playback
[10:41] <fdoving> rubengonc: #ubuntu-kernel maybe.
[10:41] <martyyyr> axloo: found it, thanks :)
[10:41] <martyyyr> axloo: you were right... it's awesome :)
[10:41] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: you still around?
[10:41] <Clin1> I cant pul the prongs because the power cord goes throught it
[10:41] <Clin1> it goes throught the button
[10:41] <axloo> and now make a shortcut key for the toggle rain
[10:41] <jryer> Can someone help me get PHP installed and working? I have tried re-installing via Synaptic many times with no luck. Whenever I try to open a PHP page, the browser tries to open it as a file. Why? It was working until I tried installing Drupal. Help!
[10:41] <axloo> :)
[10:41] <nolimitsoya> FantasticFoo, yes
[10:41] <derek_> can anyone tell me why I can't run exe with wine until i rename the file?
[10:41] <martyyyr> axloo: have you figured out how to grab the cube with your mouse? cause...I haven't :)
[10:41] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, ah, an at machine? :) then you are out of luck
[10:41] <axloo> yes i have
[10:41] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: i'm using a -generic kernel, and when i try the apt-get command it says that it's already to the newest version, but X still doesn't work. :(
[10:42] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, get an atx machine in stead :)
[10:42] <froshie> jryer: do you have your PHP module loaded in apache configuration file?
[10:42] <rubengonc> so...i download the source and then?...i already did that and cant find the config file:P
[10:42] <axloo> wait a minute and i will tell you exactly how, ok?
[10:42] <nolimitsoya> FantasticFoo, then xorg.conf hacking is your next step
[10:42] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: oh
[10:42] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: hm
[10:42] <martyyyr> axloo: alright
[10:42] <grndslm> is the left ALT button intentionally not supposed to act the same as the right ALT on the keyboard??
[10:42] <FantasticFoo> nolimitsoya: yeah. and i've already tried reinstalling the fglrx drivers.
[10:42] <Clin1> i think i do have an atx but its a verry bulky crd and it looks like bower except for the power (once i take another look) is only tword the distributor
[10:43] <nolimitsoya> grndslm, yes. altgr and alt are not the same keys
[10:43] <rubengonc> froshie:  so...i download the source and then?...i already did that and cant find the config file
[10:43] <froshie> rubengonc: what kernel version do you want?
[10:43] <nolimitsoya> FantasticFoo, sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf <-check if anything strikes you as odd
[10:43] <froshie> rubengonc: i can't paste you 2.6.15 (dapper drake)
[10:44] <froshie> rubengonc: i can :-)
[10:44] <rubengonc> froshie: linux-source-2.6.19_2.6.19-6.7
[10:44] <nolimitsoya> Clin1, youre not comming through to me :)
[10:44] <rubengonc> froshie: too old:P
[10:44] <axloo> martyyyr go to rotate cube
[10:44] <axloo> do you see it?
[10:44] <froshie> rubengonc: hmm... 2.6.19? i think the latest edgy is using just 2.6.17 :-)
[10:44] <martyyyr> axloo: yes
[10:44] <axloo> martyyyr now click on mouse this time
[10:44] <froshie> rubengonc: with every version the config differs
[10:44] <rubengonc> froshie: feisty
[10:44] <martyyyr> axloo: yes
[10:45] <froshie> rubengonc: aah :-)
[10:45] <tindust> hi all, where can I find the text-mode installer cd for edgy please?
[10:45] <nick`> what do i apt-get to get dev packages for c
[10:45] <axloo> and there is on the top place your shortcut keys for the rotating the cube with the mouse
[10:45] <froshie> rubengonc: haven't tried :)
[10:45] <nolimitsoya> rubengonc, then you should be in #ubuntu+1
[10:45] <Terminus> tindust: it's the alternative cd.
[10:45] <martyyyr> axloo: omg..it's "initiate"!.. lol, I looked all over for that! thank you, you're my hero :)
[10:45] <rubengonc> froshie: neither I:P I just want the ubuntu kernel config file!
[10:45] <rubengonc> lol
[10:45] <nolimitsoya> rubengonc, again, then you should be in #ubuntu+1
[10:45] <derek_> I need help with WINE!!!
[10:46] <nick`> what do i apt-get to get the dev packages for c? =p
[10:46] <axloo> martyyyr :) i am glad to help somebody discover the beautiful XGL

[10:46] <martyyyr> heh
[10:46] <nolimitsoya> derek_, then go to the wine support channel
[10:46] <derek_> where is that?
[10:46] <tindust> Terminus > do you mean 6.06 LTS?
[10:46] <Clin1> It is a computer that the power is controled by the motherboard the leaads go to the board one i press the power button it will go into sutdown by ubuntu i do not want it to do that i wanat it to only be able to be shutdown when i hit the shut down button.
[10:46] <axloo> but i cant get my skype working :(
[10:46] <JuJuBee> derek_ : #winehq
[10:46] <derek_> derek_ == noobie

[10:50] <Atmospherian> when i try to install the hotplug package, it says that it has to remove all of these vitals packages

=== compengi is now known as fbi
[10:53] <nolimitsoya> Atmospherian, ubuntu should do hotplug out of the box. whats not working for you?

[10:54] <rysiek|pl> suppose we have a directory Dir, owned by root:somegroup, and a user smbdy, with main group users, but also being in the somegrp group. now, the user smbdy creates a file in dir - he obvioulsy can do that. but the file is then owned by smbdy:users, so other users from the somegrp group cannot access it. I *know* there is a way to make the files created in a dir be owned by dir's_owner:dir's_owner_group. the question is - how?
[10:54] <Atmospherian> nolimitsoya: i am trying to install the firmware for my ipw2200 and the directions indicate copying the fw files to /usr/liib/hotplug/firmware which does not exist

[10:55] <nolimitsoya> Atmospherian, firmware is different from drivers, are you aware of what you are doing? if so, try it from a live environment

[10:56] <Gargoyle> My fellow uker's could not help with this but I have a very bizzare saslauthd problem!
[10:56] <nolimitsoya> Atmospherian, if you have done it before there should be no need now, or is it a new firmware version?

[10:57] <kud0s> hex2> run the live cd and see
[10:58] <Gargoyle> If I run the las command in the pastebin, saslauthd works ok. However, when run via init.d it does not. I have done some tweaking with the script to output debug info and it seems that its starting with just the "pam" auth_mech, not "pam rimap" like in the config file
[10:58] <Gargoyle> any ideas?
[10:58] <nolimitsoya> Atmospherian, as i said, firmware is quite different from drivers, and upgrading them is dangerous and strongly adviced against if you dont have a very good reason. its more like a physical modification, and it is more or less permanent. completely independent of your computer.
[10:58] <hEx2> <kud0s>:thnx
[10:58] <rysiek|pl> Terminus: setting the group's sticky-bit in dir solved it for the group, that's enough for me. thanks a lot.
[10:58] <nolimitsoya> Atmospherian, short story: you dont need to do it, so stop before you damage anything, rendering it unusable for all future
[10:58] <kzm_> I managed to boot with nfsroot!  Woohoo!
[10:58] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: ok. i think the proper way is with the setuid/setgid bits though. =)
[10:59] <froshie> jryer: isn't there something in you apache's log file?
[10:59] <Atmospherian> nolimitsoya: ok
[10:59] <froshie> jryer: in /var/log/apache2
[10:59] <kzm_> (had to copy manually the 2.6.17 modules onto an initrd from LTSP to get it to work)
[10:59] <nolimitsoya> Atmospherian, thats why i asked you if you understood what you where doing ;)
[10:59] <Atmospherian> nolimitosya: i had done it before in other distros and it worked fine
[11:00] <BlackHawk> aloaha
[11:00] <Gargoyle> OK, I edited the /etc/defaults/saslauthd file and changed MECHANISMS to just contain rimap and it worked.

[11:03] <cntb> hi  Iwant to temporarily insert greek keyboard in KDE and switch it throu ALT SHIFT how can I do that ?
[11:03] <livingdaylight> In Adobe Reader when i select something and right click i have an option to copy to clippboard. Where is this clippboard, please, anyone?
[11:03] <froshie> jryer: hmm nothing unusual :-(
[11:03] <Gargoyle> Is there a specific dev chan?
[11:03] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: oh... chmod g+s is setgid. =)
[11:03] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: do test it under some different os (ehh, well, windoze for example)
[11:03] <livingdaylight> does Ubuntu come with a default clippboard like Kubuntu?
[11:04] <ElVirolo> although i am running the ubuntu edgy livecd, i'd like to install kubuntu ... is it possible to have a minimal installation and then apt-get kubuntu ?
[11:04] <rysiek|pl> Terminus: =]  ...and chmod u+s is setuid (which, curiously enough, doesn't do anything for me)
[11:04] <cntb> livingdaylight, clipboard is kinda invisible as in windows
[11:04] <livingdaylight> cntb, so, where do i find it?
[11:04] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: i googled it and apparently, linux only uses setgid and sticky. setuid is ignored.
[11:05] <kud0s> livingdaylight> think of it as your short term memory accessable by crtl+v
[11:05] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: yeah, I'm afraid I'll eventually have to do that. Unfortunately, I don't have easy access to other hardware.
[11:05] <rysiek|pl> aye, got the same on my google right now :)
[11:05] <rysiek|pl> Terminus ^^
[11:05] <fuffal0> is there a way to make a central update server that can push updates onto other ubuntu machines
[11:05] <cntb> livingdaylight,  kud0s answered you
[11:05] <Clin1> Room, i am running apache 2 aand i keep getting a file downloaad message every time i go to my site. the file is index.phtml
[11:05] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: well, it's nothing big, just reboot to windoze (if you have it installed, that is) and test it. and run away as soon as you cane ;)
[11:05] <livingdaylight> kud0s, huh? cntr +v pastes though
[11:06] <Terminus> fuffal0: you could mirror the repos... it's still more of a pull than a push though. =)
[11:06] <rysiek|pl> *can
[11:06] <kud0s> yes, it pastes from the clipboard
[11:06] <jryer> froshie: thanks for trying to help... I'll go back to Windows for now
[11:06] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: :D no-go. I burned all the bridges (erased the hard drive :) )
[11:06] <kud0s> the clipboard generally by default only holds 1 piece of information at a time
[11:07] <Clin1> It should not be doing this
[11:07] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: believe it or not, I have a nice ol' live winxp buried somewhere in my cd stack...
[11:07] <livingdaylight> kud0s, i see so clippboard always remains invisible and crtl+v pastes it anywhere i put it
[11:07] <rysiek|pl> Terminus: and any idea is there a way of satting a dir up so that all files/dirs created within are created with a specified umask?
[11:07] <kud0s> exactly
[11:07] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: is that a bootable XP CD?
[11:07] <rysiek|pl> *setting, damn, what's with my english today
[11:08] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: yup
[11:08] <cntb> livingdaylight,  perfect understanding
[11:08] <kud0s> its ctrl+v or right click -> paste
[11:08] <livingdaylight> kud0s, why call it clippboard even? it more like a simple copy and paste then... i still need an application in which i can paste it
[11:08] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: didn't know those existed!
[11:08] <kud0s> its called a clipboard in most OS's i dont know why, it just it
[11:08] <cntb> paste what livingdaylight ?
[11:08] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: is there a way I can get by it?
[11:08] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: no idea. how about crontab chmod for that dir?
[11:08] <kud0s> *is
[11:09] <Clin1> CAN any one help me with an apache problem
[11:09] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: neither did I, google for it - or better do a torrent- or ed2k-search for it (8-in-1 WinXP cd or something like that ;) )
[11:09] <Clin1> i am running apache 2 aand i keep getting a file downloaad message every time i go to my site. the file is index.phtml
[11:09] <cntb> clipboard 'cause it is handy like a clipboard
[11:09] <livingdaylight> cntb, but that is not quite what a clippboard is. Coz the clippboard saves it and allows me to select something else without losing my original what i copied. Wheres withthis as soon as i select something else the original will be gone unless i've first pasted it somewhere, like a clippboard!
[11:09] <froshie> Clin1: try to rename it to index.html
[11:10] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: i know the default umask is set in /etc/login.defs, but for a specific dir, i don't know...
[11:10] <rysiek|pl> Terminus: that would be too easy, now wouldn't it? :) the thing is, I am setting a cvs repo and need the perms working AOK in the instant the file is created
[11:10] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: I'll try that right away.
[11:10] <Clin1> but its a php fie it wont work otherwise
[11:10] <froshie> Clin1: and do you have PHP installed?
[11:10] <Clin1> yes php5
[11:10] <froshie> Clin1: and what about renaming it to index.php ?
[11:11] <cntb> I see yo ur point livingdaylight . there is such thing in windows and linux as well
[11:11] <cfedde> where can I find info about making an ubuntu bootable flash drive?
[11:11] <Clin1> thats what it says right now but its still not sisplaying
[11:11] <cntb> try smthing like Klip
[11:11] <Clin1>  WORD FOR WORD >>>>>  index.php
[11:11] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: isn't there a way for cvs to set the perms for you instead?
[11:11] <rysiek|pl> Terminus: d'oh. haven't thought of that!
[11:12] <cntb> yes livingdaylight  klipper it is
[11:12] <livingdaylight> cntb, that was my point about kubuntu which comes with a 'visible' clippboard wherein things get saved
=== nnk is now known as xen
[11:12] <livingdaylight> cntb, exactly.... but in gnome here i've installed basket now instead
[11:12] <cntb> tis a notepad yellow amd white with a "k" in the middle
[11:13] <cntb> Ah gnome
[11:13] <Terminus> rysiek|pl: it should have settings for the owner too. then you wouldn't have to mess with setgid. =)
[11:13] <livingdaylight> cntb, yes, it is, so why doesn't ubuntu provide one by default? Kubuntu does
[11:13] <Clin1> firefox call it phtm
[11:13] <Clin1> phtml
[11:13] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: "Windows XP All 9 in 1 SP2" ?
[11:14] <cntb> kde is somewhat a lil friendlier
[11:14] <tuskernini> sebest, what a cool dvd
[11:14] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: whoa! even better! I only have 8-in-1! just check if it has the Live mode
[11:14] <dnite> hm.. i just compiled gaim 2.0.0 beta5 myself, but ubuntu thinks it's older than the beta3 package they have and wants to 'upgrade' .. how do i stop this?
[11:15] <cntb> then again livingdaylight  add kde (kubuntu ) there ! sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[11:15] <sebwin> rysiek|pl: it doesn't say on the package! 9.9
[11:15] <cntb> or livingdaylight  sudo apt-get install kubuntu
[11:15] <rysiek|pl> sebwin: gimme a sec
[11:16] <livingdaylight> cntb, LOL, mwuahahahaha.....heeeheeeeeheeeeeee..... you a fanny guy!
[11:16] <cntb> yes

[11:17] <cntb> yes but I started  this PC in UBUNTU i.e. gnome
[11:17] <xen> Alright, so I downloaded all the codecs according to UbuntuGuide.org, and yet when I play music, I get horrible artifacts.  I know its not the songs, because I got them in several formats from several places, and played them in several players, and they work fine in Windows (which is also how I know its not the hardware).  Any idea how to fix this?

[11:22] <cabbage> Hey guys. Quick question concerning a second hdd...
[11:23] <cabbage> I'd like to set it up as a general storage device (mp3s, pictures, etc)
[11:23] <bruenig> cabbage, ok...
[11:23] <cabbage> What type of file system should I use for this general storage purpose under ubuntu
[11:23] <livingdaylight> cntb, you would love gnome in no time - you would actually start getting productive instead of configuring your fonts all day, lol
[11:23] <bruenig> cabbage, ext3
[11:23] <bimberi> cabbage: ext3 (unless sharing with windows)
[11:23] <cabbage> ok. How about this: my friends and I network every once ina  while. Will he be able to access this drive if the need arises?
[11:24] <cabbage> he uses windows
[11:24] <cntb> livingdaylight, you are right  about the fonts ty
[11:24] <bimberi> cabbage: in that case you can share the drive using samba and he can access it
[11:24] <rysiek|pl> cabbage: through samba for example
[11:24] <bimberi> cabbage: so ext3 is fine for that
[11:24] <gustavo> any body knows how to make Word Completion of STL in KDevelop c++ ??

[11:26] <Phuzion> Alright, so upgrading to edgy is just change breezy to edgy in sources.list, apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade, right?
[11:26] <rysiek|pl> Fred_Sambo: the best thing is how it got started. a guy needed to link win and lin and mac boxen... so, he did "the most obvious thing to do" - reverse-engineered the smb protocol =]

[11:56] <ailean> RASMAN, well i use sunbird on windows, so it's prob better to keep it the same, but i can't find it on synaptic
[11:56] <agent> indref: you did... but that doesnt mean there arent mean people out there :D

[11:56] <rysiek|pl> gtg, cu all
[11:56] <jerp> Richardo, Sempron is how old?
[11:56] <indref> agent, Well then, you seem nice enough. What do you propose.
[11:56] <nuts> bruenig: nah wallpapers for example
[11:56] <Ricardo_Colombia> 3500+
[11:56] <agent> indref: you dont have to worry about virus, etc. if you just install official stuff (no such thing in windows)
[11:56] <jerp> new in 98?
[11:56] <azap> can someone please tell me why my fonts in firefox on edgy look like they are not anti-aliased at all/?! thanks
[11:57] <indref> agent, Well, that is assuring =:)
[11:57] <agent> indref: let me search a little.... i also believe there is an ebook reader converter but i dont remember the name
[11:57] <jerp> richardo, shouldn be any problem then
[11:57] <kud0s> Richardo> if all else fails use wine it plays almost everything
[11:57] <bruenig> nuts, oh, well not sure as I said I am not an image viewer myself
[11:57] <jerp> shouldnt
[11:57] <indref> agent, But I still have about fifty *.lit files I'd like to read.
[11:57] <indref> agent, Ok, I'll wait.
[11:57] <nuts> bruenig: just a basic application
[11:57] <Ricardo_Colombia> I have downloaded Wine
[11:57] <Ricardo_Colombia> How do I install it?
[11:57] <agent> indref: well... you see, that binary is not readable so i cant go over the source code... this isnt normal in linux land :)
[11:58] <bruenig> !info gqview
[11:58] <ubotu> gqview: A simple image viewer using GTK+. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0.1-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 707 kB, installed size 2312 kB
[11:58] <indref> agent, I have no idea what that means, but I'll take your word for it.
[11:58] <jerp> theres probably a readme file packaged with Wine
[11:58] <ailean> RASMAN, or anyone else, is mozilla-calendar the same as sunbird?
[11:58] <RASMAN> ailean, sunbird is not available as a package.  Probably because it is pre-beta.
[11:58] <ailean> oh right
[11:58] <bemixto> agent: system isn't filled normally anymore, there are no prefs inside system...
[11:58] <bemixto> bruening: no success
[11:59] <ailean> RASMAN, well i want something decent that can read an ics file - what would you recommend?
[11:59] <jerp> something like a ./configure && make or something
[11:59] <bimberi> !wine | Ricardo_Colombia
[11:59] <ubotu> Ricardo_Colombia: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[11:59] <globe> is it possible to get true window transparency in gnome?  ie...see another window through my term window.
[11:59] <agent> bemixto: there must be some settings/file you can change to reset your menu to default - i don't know  this setting but ask around
[12:00] <ailean> globe, yes, research beryl
[12:00] <bemixto> i guess i need to know who the menu is generated. but digging in update-menus or install-menu didn't help until now
[12:00] <ailean> !beryl | globe
[12:00] <ubotu> globe: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:00] <Parachutes> Hey, can I force aptitude to download a package, instead of getting it from CD (ncurses-term)?
[12:00] <bimberi> globe: with a compositing window manager like beryl or compiz
[12:00] <globe> thanks!
[12:00] <jerp> it might just be me, but Im glad they didnt call it Whine
[12:00] <gouchi> which option to boot in safe graphicaly because I can see the bootlo
[12:00] <bemixto> agent: i guess there is. but i didn't find it yet
