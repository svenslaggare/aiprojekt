[12:01] <lupine_85> dpkg -i doesn't work any more, then?
[12:01] <clemyeats> cause Gentoo's for extraterrestrial intelligent creatures right ?
[12:01] <Akuma_> is it possible to reinstall gnome?
[12:01] <Herbert> Hey.. Could someone help me to get my 5.1 speakers working under ubuntu please? :)
[12:01] <graft> lupine_85: say what? dpkg -i doesn't work?
[12:01] <tubo^bph> clemyeats, pretty much
[12:01] <LucianSolaris> yo
[12:01] <levander> I was told that apitutde can tell you what packages were installed as dependencies for a given package you installed awhile back.  Anyone know how to do this?
[12:01] <lupine_85> [22:55]  <EdLin> stefan``: yes, but if you download individual debs you won't be able to install it. You need to run aptitude, apt-get, or synaptic.
[12:01] <coopster> clemyeats: only for those aliens that have the spare time to compile from source, of course
[12:02] <graft> ah...
[12:02] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, why?
[12:02] <grego22> coopster,  lol
[12:02] <PriceChild> Akuma_, as in reset all preferences?
[12:02] <revolutionstudio> anyone can explain why none of my p2p apps are working?
[12:02] <PriceChild> Akuma_, or have you been root and changed things you shouldn't have?
[12:03] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: i think i installed a .deb that messed it up. it doesnt boot anymore
[12:03] <bimberi> ryanakca: /etc/X11/Xsession
[12:03] <grego22> revolutionstudio,  have u any firewall running ?
[12:03] <tubo^bph> Akuma - what deb
[12:03] <Herbert> could someone help me with my 5.1 system? :/
[12:03] <Akuma_> PriceChild: probably thats why happened as in installed somthing..
[12:03] <clemyeats> coopster: yes, something like slower install, faster execution... some kind of space-time distortion of some sort :)
[12:03] <PriceChild> Akuma_, what did you install?
[12:03] <coopster> ok, f it.  what do you guys think my odds are:  i'm going to go buy a western digital harddrive that is the same/similar series to one i own that has failed, and swap the electronics
[12:03] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: well, the new version of svn. somebody walked me through building it
[12:04] <LucianSolaris> anyone: I have an HP Pavilion with a WXGA screen that has a dead backlight.  I am dependent on an external monitor.  My problem is when X launches, it displays at the monitor 1's ratio (the WXGA panel) and not monitor 2's (the external monitor).  How do I a) disable X from using monitor 1 (panel) and use just monitor 2 or b) get X to display at a 4:3 ratio?
[12:04] <graft> coopster: 3720 to 1, i'd say
[12:04] <Akuma_> i was the guinea pig. thats what i got in return =)
[12:04] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, and what makes you think that killed gnome?
[12:04] <coopster> graft: ok, and how about the odds on "that will make the problem worse, probably irreparibly" ?
[12:04] <VirtualInsanity> I installed the ATI driver and the problem still exists -.-
[12:04] <Akuma_> i've been on irc for about 6 hours now trying to figure out what to do
[12:04] <LucianSolaris> Akuma, maybe we can help each other
[12:04] <graft> coopster: what problem, here? drive failed?
[12:04] <LucianSolaris> know anything about configging x?
[12:05] <Herbert> I'm trying to get my 5.1 speaker system working, but I can only listen to music in stereo..
[12:05] <coopster> clemyeats: well, as the alien approaches the speed of light, installation and execution time bend towards each other.
[12:05] <graft> coopster: i mean, all drives fail inevitably... just be wise in your choice of drive
[12:05] <coopster> clemyeats:  i think that's where quantum computing came from
[12:05] <ryanakca> bimberi: thanks
[12:05] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: well, i get the login prompt, then nothing.
[12:05] <LucianSolaris> ALL: I have an HP Pavilion with a WXGA screen that has a dead backlight.  I am dependent on an external monitor.  My problem is when X launches, it displays at the monitor 1's ratio (the WXGA panel) and not monitor 2's (the external monitor).  How do I a) disable X from using monitor 1 (panel) and use just monitor 2 or b) get X to display at a 4:3 ratio?
[12:05] <coopster> graft:  failed drive, used to work, now it doesn't get picked up by the bios in two seperate computers
[12:05] <clemyeats> coopster: I heard Ubuntu sent Mark Shuttleworth into space to experiment on that.
[12:05] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, and the logs say?
[12:05] <Akuma_> LucianSolaris: i don't, sorry
[12:06] <mikep> hi, i've just installed ubuntu edgy after having gentoo on for a while, and i'm looking to install some IDEs like kdevelop, anjuta, eclipse. but i can't find them in the apt cache... any tips?
[12:06] <graft> coopster: sounds nasty, but... unless your bios is fuct, new drive should work fine, eh?
[12:06] <revolutionstudio> no no firewalls
[12:06] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, also, detail "nothing"
[12:06] <statical> Again NVIDIA: installing restricted-modules didn't help
[12:06] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: well, from what i've been hearing there's no gnome log, so that doesn't help. doesnt give me any material to google
[12:06] <VirtualInsanity> do i need to change things in the config files after running the ati .run file?
[12:06] <statical> How to install the 9629 kernel modules?
[12:06] <LucianSolaris> ALL: is there a command i can use to config xorg.conf?
[12:06] <graft> LucianSolaris: vi
[12:06] <coopster> graft: a new drive doesnt contain the 80 hours of software developing labor that i, in my infinite wisdom, chose not to back-up whatsoever
[12:06] <quiksilver> hi...ok so when i install flash player any site that firefox opens with flash on the site, it just crashes with no errors. ---any ideas?
[12:06] <LucianSolaris> like xf86config?
[12:06] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: nothing, well, not quite: i get a colored background and the mouse cursor. and then it sits there
[12:06] <kitche> statical: did you grab the unofficial package?
[12:06] <graft> LucianSolaris: there's a kde app to do it... umm
[12:06] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, what gfxcard, what colors?
[12:07] <clemyeats> coopster: hopefully when he comes back to Earth we'll get a Linux for Human Beings that will go faster than the speed of light (I know I know... but they're working on that too).
[12:07] <statical> from where?
[12:07] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, and what driver
[12:07] <LucianSolaris> graft: 'cept i can't get x back up (killed the config file under system settings)
[12:07] <kitche> !nvidia9|staticla
[12:07] <ubotu> staticla: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using this repository: deb http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ubuntu edgy stable
[12:07] <bimberi> ryanakca: np :)
[12:07] <LucianSolaris> graft: i know debian had XF86conf[ig]  or something
[12:07] <ryanakca> bimberi: is the a ~/.Xsession ?
[12:07] <quiksilver> hi...ok so when i install flash player any site that firefox opens with flash on the site, it just crashes with no errors. ---any ideas?
[12:07] <graft> LucianSolaris: oh... dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg no good?
[12:07] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: the color is a blueish gray. and i think its the one i had set as the default background color. the graphics card is ........ let me try and remember...
[12:08] <LucianSolaris> oh, lemmie see
[12:08] <mikep> hello, how can i install some IDEs on ubuntu edgy?
[12:08] <kitche> quiksilver: open up a terminal and type in firefox and when firefox crashes it will output an error
[12:08] <clemyeats> quiksilver: set your color depth to 24
[12:08] <graft> mikep: IDE?
[12:08] <coopster> clemyeats: of course, that's assuming that there's not an extraterrestrial newspaper right now proclaiming that the humans have graciously donated to the "Shuttleworth for Centaurian Beings" foundation
[12:08] <mikep> graft: integrated development environment
[12:08] <quiksilver> does it have to stay at 24?
[12:08] <kitche> mikep: there is tons in the repos eclipse is just one
[12:08] <bruenig> !info anjuta

[12:08] <bruenig> anjuta is supposed to be good
[12:08] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: sis760
[12:09] <McMuffin> something floppy drive related:
[12:09] <bimberi> ryanakca: not sure of the exact name sorry, I know that you can create/edit a ~/.gnomerc (for gnome).
[12:09] <McMuffin> i started making a rescue disk, disk one of one completed, but now the floppy drive is making a ticking noise and it won't accept another floppy
[12:09] <mikep> kitche: well `apt-cache search eclipse' doesn't bring up much, searching on kdevelop gives less
[12:09] <noelferreira> how can i give permissions to a file for all users?
[12:09] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, i sthere an error in /var/log/Xorg.0.log?

[12:09] <clemyeats> coopster: indeed. But as a famous Alien proverb says: -0439349834Fasdms02191!! (which approximately translates as "Sure thing :)")
[12:10] <bruenig> mikep, eclipse is in universe. Have you enabled universe?
[12:10] <kitche> McMuffin: it's reading the floppy still probably and it's probably still mounted
[12:10] <coopster> heh
[12:10] <ryanakca> bimberi: yep, ~/.xsession , no, I'm using KDE :)
[12:10] <tubo^bph> mikep: just download and unpack eclipse
[12:10] <McMuffin> the floppy is out
[12:10] <tubo^bph> mikep: but install JDK first
[12:10] <coopster> ok, ok.   i don't suppose this drive can get much worse than "f'ing broke", so i'll give the transplant a shot. brb
[12:10] <clemyeats> quiksilver: either set your color depth to 24 or get the beta 2 of flash version 9.
[12:10] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: there are a few EE lines, yes
[12:10] <McMuffin> and if i put one in the frequency of the ticking sound will increase dramatically
[12:10] <mikep> bruenig: how do i enable universe? i've just installed ubuntu and have no idea
[12:10] <tubo^bph> Akuma_ wat do they say
[12:10] <quiksilver> where's the beta 2 version?
[12:11] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: "xf86OpenSerial: Cannot open device /dev/wacom"
[12:11] <graft> wtf? floppy drive? do they still have those?
[12:11] <bimberi> ryanakca: Cool.  I just checked in /etc/X11/Xsession and it includes calls to $HOME/.xsession and/or $HOME/.Xsession if present :)
[12:11] <bruenig> quiksilver, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279990
[12:11] <quiksilver> thanks :-D
[12:11] <clemyeats> quiksilver: some "labs" website from adobe... you'll find it on google.
[12:11] <VirtualInsanity> I installed the ATI driver and the problem still exists -.-
[12:11] <bruenig> mikep, copy and paste the following, sudo sed 's/# deb/deb/g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:11] <McMuffin> yay it stopped
[12:11] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: 6 times. and then there's a "Error opening /dev/wacom : Invalid argument"
[12:11] <bruenig> mikep, after which you will need to sudo apt-get update, and then sudo apt-get install eclipse obviously

[12:12] <statical> NVIDIA: I have 5.10 breezy. Is there any unoff 9269 drvs for that?
[12:12] <mikep> cheers :)
[12:12] <lupine_85> statical: no :/
[12:12] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: found another one above those that says : "AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable"
[12:12] <lupine_85> not for 6.06 AFAIK either
[12:12] <lupine_85> erm, sorry. Yeah, for 6.06!
[12:12] <lml> I am trying to install the IVTV drivers following this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Install_IVTV_Dapper and get errors during the "compile".
[12:13] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: and "error opening security policy file /usr/lib/xserver/SecurityPolicy"
[12:13] <noelferreira> lupine_85: which repositories should i use for beryl with edgy amd64?
[12:13] <statical> NVIDIA: Can some1 explain how it worked once and then started complaining?
[12:13] <WizCraker> how do I apply this patch ? https://patches.ubuntu.com/n/net-snmp/net-snmp_5.2.3-4ubuntu1.patch
[12:13] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, more :-)
[12:13] <lml> They was installed on my machine and working but then the kernel was upgraded and now I cannot recompile them.
[12:13] <lupine_85> the same as beryl i386
[12:14] <bulio|> does Ubuntu support NTFS read/write?
[12:14] <lupine_85> deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ edgy main
[12:14] <gnomefreak> bulio|: no
[12:14] <bulio|> I have an NTFS drive that I store all my data/media on
[12:14] <lupine_85> not yet
[12:14] <lupine_85> there's always
[12:14] <lupine_85> !ntfs-3g
[12:14] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[12:14] <lupine_85> if you're feeling brave
[12:14] <sedra> read only
[12:14] <lml> bulio: yes, edgy eft has experimental support.
[12:14] <bulio|> maybe it would be smarter just to delete the partition, and put FAT32 on it?
[12:14] <lml> See the unofficial ubuntu guide.
[12:15] <lupine_85> bulio|: maybe :)
[12:15] <mc44> WizCraker: er, that patch is the diff between ubuntu and debians version
[12:15] <lupine_85> you can also get windows to read ext2 partitions...
[12:15] <_goofy_> is there a way to test the stability od a hard drive
[12:15] <WizCraker> mc44: oh.
[12:15] <jrib> bulio|: why not go with ext3?
=== lynucs|presentat is now known as lynucs
[12:15] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: "Could not init font path element /var/blahblahvblah/TrueType, removing from list!" x4
[12:15] <bulio|> yeah, I think I'll go the Fat32 route
[12:15] <TheGateKeeper> bulio|, repo for ntfs-3g --> deb http://flomertens.keo.in/ubuntu/ dapper main
[12:15] <bulio|> jrib: windows 2000 can support FAT32?
[12:15] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, more, in the last third
[12:15] <lml> bulio: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy#How_to_mount_Windows_partitions_.28NTFS.29_on_boot-up.2C_and_allow_users_read_and_write_access
[12:15] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: last line is : "SetGrabKeysState - disabled"
[12:15] <cyphase> if my home directory is on it's own drive, is it safe to install a new version of ubuntu and just stat using it?
[12:16] <sedra> you can download commercial ntfs driver
[12:16] <quiksilver> what is a "deb"
[12:16] <cyphase> usually I start fresh, then bring stuff in slowly
[12:16] <McMuffin> another qquick question: what's the best filesystem for a windows pagefile? Just microsoftish NTFS?
[12:16] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: right before that last one i have: "ProcXCloseDevice to close or not ?"
[12:16] <jrib> !ext | bulio|: yes
[12:16] <cyphase> and i never bing in .gconf
[12:16] <sedra> connectix
[12:16] <LucianSolaris> graft: I need to be able to either a) disable the LCD panel on my laptop and use only the external monitor or b) get X to display in a non-widescreen ratio on my monitors

[12:16] <noelferreira> how can i give permissions to a file for all users?
[12:16] <jrib> !ext3 | bulio|: yes
[12:16] <ubotu> bulio|: yes: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[12:16] <bulio|> I haven't used ubuntu since 5.1
[12:16] <kitche> !deb|quiksilver
[12:16] <ubotu> quiksilver: deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)

[12:17] <kitche> LucianSolaris: does you laptop not have a function key to turn off your LCD and output though the vga port?
[12:17] <bruenig> cyphase, it is safe to install a new version of ubuntu. Just make sure you go to manually edit partition table and then make sure to not click format where the /home drive is.
[12:17] <bimberi> noelferreira: chmod o+rwx file
[12:18] <lml> Anyone tried to recompile the IVTV drivers after the latest kernel upgrade? I get errors.
[12:18] <noelferreira> what means 755 MystaMax?
[12:18] <quiksilver> i dont need to add a so called "deb" to my sources as a repository do i?
[12:18] <cyphase> bruenig: no, that's not what i meant.. i'm talking about configuration files/folders, like .evolution and .gconf, being readable by new versions
[12:18] <quiksilver> for the beta 2 flash?
[12:18] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: the (EE) xf86OpenSerial: line also has "No such file or directory" refering to /dev/wacom
[12:18] <bulio|> should 533mhz cpu and 380MB ram be ok on edgy eft?
[12:18] <kitche> quiksilver: if you add a repo you need deb in front of it
[12:18] <tubo^bph> All: i have a ipw3945 based wireless on my SMP Core2Duo Dell D820, and the WLAN connection rops out every other hour. Ayn idea how that can be fixed? Not working for Edgy and even the latest Feisty repo drivers
[12:19] <tubo^bph> rops = drops
[12:19] <jrib> quiksilver: flash9 beta is in dapper and edgy backports
[12:19] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: i dont know what else is an error
[12:19] <quiksilver> right, but a deb---isnt a repository...
[12:19] <quiksilver> right?
[12:19] <LucianSolaris> kitche: yes, but it only works in bash, not X
[12:19] <jrib> quiksilver: well no usually people use "deb" to refer to a single debian package
[12:19] <LucianSolaris> X forces use of both screens
[12:19] <cabello14> cabello14
[12:19] <bruenig> cyphase, yes they will be. The newer versions of those programs pretty much have to make sure there old configuration directories work as their users would reasonable be pretty pissed if they upgraded to a new version only to lose all their settings
[12:19] <kitche> LucianSolaris: ah I would look up on how to do it  but I have to go in a second got a English Final soon
[12:20] <bimberi> quiksilver: a file.deb is not a repository, however the sources.list file containes lines beginning with "deb" (and "deb-src")
[12:20] <graft> um, wtf was that?
[12:20] <cabello14> hola alguien entiende espaol aqui

[12:23] <cyphase> h0ndaracer2: you have to install BIND. it isn't installed by default
[12:23] <Flannel> prxq: mini.iso just downloads all the packages from the repositories, instead of being on the CD, just download them like usual.
[12:23] <cyphase> h0ndaracer2: did you install it?

[12:24] <cabello14> ok..
[12:24] <graft> um, i'm not sure i understand this DCC issue, here...
[12:24] <prxq> Flannel: ok... but that's not what I mean. i need to smuggle a few additional modules on it for the network to work. Any ideas how?
[12:24] <totall_6_7> Thank you ops for being on top of things :D:D
[12:24] <warlock> Does anyone know how to recompile a 5.10 breezy 2.6 kernel? I want to change the HZ to boost the fps on my game servers.
[12:25] <Seveas> !kernel | warlock
[12:25] <ubotu> warlock: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[12:25] <m4rk> I looked at the hardware list but it's not there
[12:25] <FlyingSquirrel32> some keeps trying to give me a file transfer. Is there a way to turn those off? (I'm using GAIM)
[12:25] <Flannel> prxq: grab the alternate CD, you can modify that.  I don't know if it's possible to modify the mini.iso, you could try it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization
[12:25] <LucianSolaris> ALL: HELP! I need help figuring out how to get X to quit using the wide ratio my lcd panel reports and start using the standard ratio my external monitor should be reporting...
[12:25] <m4rk> It's an AOpen box, Intel 915G ICH6 chipset
[12:26] <Seveas> FlyingSquirrel32, no, those are abusers trying to exploit a known bug in some routers. Freenode will ban those users
[12:26] <graft> LucianSolaris: dual-head system?
=== eigenlambda_ is now known as eigenlambda
[12:26] <Flannel> prxq: I imagineyou can modify the mini.iso in a similar fashion (only without needing to worry about the packages, as they'll be downloaded automatically)
[12:26] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: what gave me "SESSION_MANAGER=local/turion:/tmp/.ICE-unix/5445", and on tty7 i get the same thing, except with 2 funny squares on the top left
[12:26] <LucianSolaris> graft: laptop with wide WXGA panel (dead backlight inverter) and an external monitor through a kvm)
[12:26] <eigenlambda> so I downloaded this movie in a rar archive
[12:26] <warlock> Seveas, I'm just scared of messing something up - I don't know jack about kernel stuff, was mainly looking for someone who knew how to do this and change the HZ of the kernel to 1000
[12:26] <eigenlambda> and now i can't unpack it, even with the non-free unrar
[12:26] <FlyingSquirrel32> Seveas: Thanks. Still wouldn't it be a reasonable option to be able to disable transfers on certain accounts?
[12:27] <LucianSolaris> graft: don't ask me about the Fn key for the screen, only works in bash (pre-X) but not inX
[12:27] <Seveas> FlyingSquirrel32, probably, but I don't know how to do that in gaim :)
[12:27] <bruenig> FlyingSquirrel32, If anyone would know, #gaim would
[12:27] <tubo^bph> Akuma_, ouch. hmmm
[12:27] <FlyingSquirrel32> Seveas: thanks. I'll ask them. Thanks for always being here!
[12:28] <graft> LucianSolaris: hrm... yeah i can't figure out how to get my vga-out working...
[12:28] <tovella> warlock: sounds like you best bet would be a processor upgrade.
[12:28] <rogue780> I installed phpmyadmin and tried to go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin but it says 404 Not found. can someone help me please?
[12:28] <LucianSolaris> can you refer me to an X expert so I can get this taken care of?
[12:28] <LucianSolaris> is there an X.org room?
[12:28] <Seveas> rogue780, please look at /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin/
[12:29] <rogue780> Seveas, thanks

[12:29] <prxq> Flannel: thanks for the link. My problem is a little worse, as the cd refuses to boot on this machine. Im actually booting the initrd from within an existing partition.
[12:29] <lavid> So, how do I go about reclassifying a bug on launchpad?
[12:29] <kitche> sorry about that gnomefreak should have just posted the guys name
[12:29] <Seveas> lavid, you don't :)
[12:29] <TehBigToe> night guys
[12:29] <Akuma_> tubo^bph: so i take it a full uninstall/install of gnone isnt possible, eh? i guess there isnt a single, convenient .deb for gnome is there
[12:29] <lavid> Seveas: good to know
[12:29] <ctkroeke1> Does anyone know of software for hospitals? i.e. archiving patients data, their ailment, name, etc. and that also has a search?
[12:29] <gnomefreak> kitche: its being taken care of and i didnt do anything to you
[12:29] <Seveas> lkusmir, hint: id -u username_here
[12:29] <Seveas> ;(
[12:30] <MystaMax> lkusmir, thanks, typing id at the CLI worked fine for me
[12:30] <warlock> tovella, um whys that?
[12:30] <Seveas> (or id -g for group)
[12:30] <Flannel> prxq: Have you checked the install page for other methods?
[12:30] <gnomefreak> Seveas: ty for the +d i was getting there you just faster
[12:30] <lavid> Seveas: how can I go about getting it changed, if not by me?
[12:30] <Seveas> gnomefreak, /cs lart nickname :)
[12:30] <Seveas> lavid, which bug?
[12:30] <mc44> lavid: what about it do you want changed?

[12:30] <lavid> Seveas: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/75298
[12:30] <lavid> it's not related to the kernel, it's simply a 64bit vs 32bit packages issue
[12:31] <tovella> warlock: if you want your game to run faster, and YOU'RE scared to customize your kernel, a processor upgrade might be the best solution.
[12:31] <gnomefreak> lavid: thats kernel related
[12:31] <LucianSolaris> graft: can you help me if i were to say yes to dual-head?
[12:31] <tovella> warlock: just a consideration.
[12:31] <gnomefreak> differences between 32 and 64 bit is kernel
[12:31] <graft> LucianSolaris: nah... never done that, sorry mate
[12:31] <ctkroeke1> Yeah, but I'm thinking of some existing proyect that is specifacally designed for hospital archiving
[12:31] <Seveas> lavid, 'doesn't work on my hardware' doesn't mean 'this is high priority'. Developers determine priority according to theit aailable time
[12:32] <warlock> tovella, - umm... Processor aint the problem, it's the HZ locking the game server fps to <500
=== Defend is now known as defend
[12:32] <lavid> gnomefreak: well, then WINE not being in the repos for a 64bit system should also be a kernel bug?
[12:32] <lupine_85> ctkroeke1: unlikely  to exist - it's not the sort of thing that tends to get released as open source. www.sourceforge.net will index it if it exists, though
[12:32] <exei> hey, i have an integrated video, what drivers should i use? vesa didn't work
[12:32] <gnomefreak> lavid: no thats a WIne issue not ubuntu
[12:32] <mc44> lavid: I already explained why wine isnt like that, and it is obviously know to the distro team
[12:32] <tovella> warlock: sorry, i interpreted HZ as hertz.

[12:45] <McMuffin> thought so, but is there any (noticable) difference in performance in 64 bit mode or will it just make most apps incompatible
[12:45] <gnomefreak> McMuffin: 64bit has very little nonfree apps for it including flash and codecs

[12:45] <McMuffin> ok
[12:45] <arrenlex> McMuffin: For a desktop machine, you will not notice a difference.
[12:45] <lupine_85> major numbercrunching is generally faster
[12:45] <McMuffin> i'll do the 32 bit then ^_^
[12:45] <lupine_85> if you have >4GB RAM, you want 64 bit, also
[12:46] <McMuffin> thanks, gnomefreak and arrenlex
[12:46] <jturek> hi everybody
[12:46] <DigitalNinja> arrenlex: nice story. Maybe you could add something in there about a penguin or something
[12:46] <gnomefreak> McMuffin: who compiles everything and since adobe never made a flash for 64 you cant compile it
[12:46] <jturek> by any chance does anybody know of an online casino that works with Ubuntu?
[12:46] <McMuffin> k
[12:46] <McMuffin> what's thediffernce in .jigo .list and .template
[12:46] <DigitalNinja> jturek: Do they use flash?
[12:46] <gnomefreak> winodws really never had 64 bit support so not alot of companies made 64bit apps
[12:47] <McMuffin> .jigdo**
[12:47] <aztek> hi guys newbie here....got some queries...is there any possibility that i can run windows patches under a linux box. thanks.
[12:47] <Stormx2> aztek: What are you patching?
[12:47] <tubo^bph> hehe
[12:47] <gnomefreak> McMuffin: you want bittorrent or ISO
[12:47] <lavid> aztek: you'll have to elaborate
[12:47] <jturek> DigitalNinja: most are exe and windows based...  trying to find a flash or java based one
[12:47] <McMuffin> don't really care
[12:47] <McMuffin> ah i see now
[12:47] <tkroo> iltomee, isoinfo?
[12:47] <lupine_85> jturek: wine moneyslurper.exe ?
[12:47] <McMuffin> the .jigdo are for other p2p apps i think?
[12:47] <aztek> windows hotfixes
[12:47] <DigitalNinja> aztek: You can't patch Linux with Windows patches
[12:47] <McMuffin> i'll just dl the iso :p
[12:47] <arrenlex> DigitalNinja: The Mark Shuttleworth came down from the heavens at high speed, sledding on a penguin, and he said "Lo! There shall be a Fawn, and it shall be Feisty". And the people cheered him, and it was so.
[12:48] <arrenlex> aztek: ...why would you want to?
[12:48] <lavid> aztek: Linux doesn't need them
[12:48] <Stormx2> aztek: I thought windows hotfixes fixed security holes in WINDOWS?
[12:48] <dabaR> exit
[12:48] <aztek> right guys its for windows
[12:48] <twissy> Windows is one big security hole
[12:48] <Stormx2> agreed

[12:48] <avalon_> Can someone tell me where Kubuntu hunts it's input modules at? I've got a driver I need to put in that folder
[12:48] <lavid> hahah
[12:49] <gnomefreak> its offtopic in here and its getting way to far into it
[12:49] <aztek> have no choice with this guys its the companies choice to have windows.
[12:49] <McMuffin> wooo, 2 hour 30 min remaining for 6.06 (damn me for dling 6.10 first :P)
[12:49] <Stormx2> aztek: Wait, what?
[12:49] <DigitalNinja> arrenlex: I think the first story was better. I'm not sure people will like Mark sledding on a penguin.
[12:49] <arrenlex> McMuffin: Why are you downloading 6.06
[12:49] <Stormx2> aztek: I don't understand what your question is.
[12:49] <arrenlex> DigitalNinja: Well you asked for a penguin.
[12:49] <mc44> aztek: why would you want to patch windows whislt on linux?
[12:50] <DigitalNinja> aztek: What are you trying to patch
[12:50] <McMuffin> cos the site said 6.10 is eevviillll for beginning linux people
[12:50] <Stormx2> aztek: Take a moment to think through what you're asking and ask it in a very clear way. We don't mind reading more than a sentence.
[12:50] <arrenlex> McMuffin: ...what site, and why?
[12:50] <mc44> McMuffin: "the site"!?
[12:50] <iltomee> can a bin file be mounted without converting it to iso?
[12:50] <McMuffin> the ubuntu main site, because edge eft "was meant for technical innovatoin" or something like that
[12:51] <syte> default.cfg error when running doom 3 demo on linux
[12:51] <gnomefreak> McMuffin: no ubuntu site says anything like that. and since it was only a 4 month release not all things could be worked out of it
[12:51] <Stormx2> iltomee: Don't you just run .bins?
[12:51] <gnomefreak> Stormx2: yes
[12:51] <iltomee> what is .bins?
[12:51] <gnomefreak> Stormx2: sh file.bin
[12:51] <twissy> bin = image file in this case
[12:51] <lavid> iltomee: yes mount it as type iso9960 as a loopback device
[12:51] <lupine_85> Stormx2: gnomefreak: an alternative format to iso
[12:51] <lupine_85> a raw image of a CD
[12:51] <McMuffin> Note: New users who choose to use edgy as their Operating system are urged to used caution,and advised to know and understand how to fix your own issues. You have been warned..
[12:51] <gnomefreak> lupine_85: what is?
[12:51] <lupine_85> .bin
[12:51] <syte> can someone please help me with getting doom3 running. i keep getting a default.cfg error
[12:51] <arrenlex> McMuffin: Considering how much I doubt that ubuntu.com was like "Linux for the people! But don't download the new version, it's not for the people" I think yu misunderstood something.
[12:51] <Stormx2> What? a .bin isn't that o.o
[12:51] <mc44> McMuffin: where does it say that?
[12:51] <Stormx2> !doom

[12:51] <gnomefreak> lupine_85: since when?
[12:52] <lupine_85> mounting it as iso won't work
[12:52] <mzuverink> Is anyone using an iPod Brand Ipod dock sucsesssfully in Edgy, mine will not register the ipod when I place it in the dock
[12:52] <lupine_85> since foreveer
[12:52] <aztek> i would prefer if my windows worstations can download patches from a linux box where the linux box gets the downloadable patches from microsoft....just like a WSUS but intead of having win2003 i wud prefer a linux box if its possible.

[12:52] <ubotu> bchunk: CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2.0-1 (edgy), package size 12 kB, installed size 68 kB
[12:52] <gnomefreak> lupine_85: bin used to stand for binary
[12:52] <iltomee> lavid: can that be done w/ bin file too? not only iso?
[12:52] <lupine_85> still does
[12:52] <McMuffin> ah ok :p
[12:52] <psinan> has anyone tried to 6.10 on a thinkpad T43?
[12:52] <McMuffin> i'll just install 6.10 right now
[12:52] <lupine_85> .bin is a "pure" image of a CD - every bit
=== maccam94 is now known as maccam94-food
[12:52] <rance> could someone help me understand why a custom dhclient.conf file is not being used by a sytem on startup any more?
[12:52] <gnomefreak> and that would mean that all the bin files are ISOs in you fs?
[12:52] <McMuffin> if repartitioning will work, that is :p
[12:52] <Stormx2> lupine_85: yeah. I've run bins like this: $ ./file.bin
[12:52] <mzuverink> psinan, yes, it works wonderfully
[12:52] <psinan> has anyone tried to install 6.10 on a thinkpad T43?
[12:52] <lupine_85> yeah, that works with *executable* files
[12:52] <mc44> McMuffin: that is written by one person and is not official documentation
[12:52] <psinan> excellent
[12:52] <psinan> thanks mzuberink
[12:52] <mzuverink> Ipod dock users out there?
[12:52] <arrenlex> lupine_85: It is a bin\cue image?
[12:53] <lavid> iltomee: I remember having issues with one of the two I think I used a module "cdemu" or something. But that was on gentoo
[12:53] <lupine_85> CD images generally aren't executable
[12:53] <psinan> any driver issues?
[12:53] <McMuffin> but... but.... it's a sticky! (ok ok i get it)
[12:53] <psinan> do the thinkpad buttons work?
[12:53] <mzuverink> yes
[12:53] <mc44> McMuffin: and its refering to upgrades rather than fresh installs, but anyway
[12:53] <arrenlex> lupine_85: There exist utilities to convert bincues into isos, I believe. Or you could burn it.
[12:53] <Stormx2> lupine_85: I've come across a lot of .bin's which aren't CD Images. Stop trolling.
[12:53] <mzuverink> you just have to use keypad to remap them
[12:53] <McMuffin> k :p
[12:53] <lupine_85> [23:50]  <iltomee> can a bin file be mounted without converting it to iso?
[12:53] <lupine_85> seriously
[12:53] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: I have an iPod with the usb cable. It showed up on the desktop but I never got it to sync music. I installed rocbox and it works
[12:54] <lupine_85> I am not a troll, and I resent the implication
[12:54] <Stormx2> lupine_85: Lets take this #outside
[12:54] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: rockbox
[12:54] <lupine_85> or explication, if you prefer
[12:54] <arrenlex> lupine_85: Oh, were you answering a question? Sorry. And that person is gone.
[12:54] <Stormx2> lupine_85: ;-)
[12:54] <McMuffin> bye bye (on my first step to get rid of Windows)
[12:54] <lupine_85> yeah :(
[12:54] <McMuffin> wish me luck on this great journey
[12:54] <psinan> mzuverink: do you have a thinkpad?
[12:54] <lavid> McMuffin: best o luck!
[12:54] <lupine_85> Storm2X: this is a support channel, so ou should at least read the question...
[12:54] <McMuffin> w00!
[12:54] <lupine_85> you*
[12:55] <pantera> cya
[12:55] <mzuverink> DigitalNinja, I have no problems with the orig firmware, and I use rockbox too, but I bout a dock and through the dock it does not recognize the ipod anymore
[12:55] <Stormx2> lupine_85: Support channel or not, you shouldn't be preaching false information. a .bin is not always a CD image.
[12:55] <lupine_85> ...
[12:55] <mzuverink> psinan, yeah, on it now, same model
[12:55] <lupine_85> in the context of the question, it was a CD image
[12:55] <mc44> Stormx2: er, no need to be confrontational
[12:55] <mzuverink> running edgy
[12:55] <psinan> cool
[12:55] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: I don't think roxkbox will work with the dock
[12:55] <lupine_85> I'm done with this silly argument, anyway
[12:55] <tubo^bph> (not to sound offending, i would really like to know) is there an advanced support / talk channel as well?
[12:55] <eakr> what it the command pro shuting down pc in linux? I need it for desktop icon
[12:56] <psinan> mzuverink:  I just built the cd today.  When i get home going to install.  Thanks alot
[12:56] <lupine_85> tubo^bph: nah, here are ubuntu's best and brightest minds :p
[12:56] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: the orig firmware should though. Might be a Linux thing
[12:56] <Kesman> eakr: shutdown -h now ?
[12:56] <tubo^bph> lupine_85, i am sure
[12:56] <mzuverink> DigitalNinja, i am trying to get it to recognize it through the org firmware from apple
[12:56] <lupine_85> unless you buy commercial support from canonical, anyway
[12:56] <eakr> thx
[12:56] <mc44> lupine_85: then you get mneptok :)
[12:56] <lupine_85> woot :)
[12:56] <tubo^bph> lupine_85, honestly, 95% of the stuff asked here can be resolved by a google search or a forum visit
[12:56] <mzuverink> no luck
[12:56] <lupine_85> tubo^bph: yeah, I know
[12:57] <eakr> not working kesman
[12:57] <tubo^bph> lupine_85, all a bit crazy
[12:57] <lupine_85> luckily, most people do that - otherwise here would be completely overwhelmed
[12:57] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: Is the dock USB?
[12:57] <Kesman> ekv: then dunno
[12:57] <eakr> ok
[12:57] <Kesman> eakr: sry, then dunno
[12:57] <Kesman> typoed the nick..
[12:57] <eakr> np
[12:58] <tubo^bph> but that kinda leaves people that hack their own drivers and kernel modules a bit in the cold. maybe i should have a look at dev channels
[12:58] <eakr> j ubuntu-cz
[12:58] <mc44> tubo^bph: -devel is not for advanced support, its for development of ubuntu
[12:58] <mzuverink> DigitalNinja, yeah, usb
[12:58] <jw_606> Hello :)
[12:58] <tubo^bph> mc44, good to know thanks
[12:58] <lupine_85> tubo^bph: nah, people can ask about that here too ;)
[12:59] <lupine_85> then just /ignore all the daft responders :p
[12:59] <mzuverink> DigitalNinja, im taking it back
[12:59] <jw_606> I fubar'd my ati-radeon driver installation and am now talking thru a recovery console, can I get some help please?
[12:59] <mzuverink> DigitalNinja, I am sick of I pod, gonna build my own player from NEXT
[12:59] <lupine_85> but yeah, a #ubuntu-hackers would be a good idea
[12:59] <lupine_85> not likely to ever become an "official" channel though
[01:00] <mc44> lupine_85: except everyone would think they should get ghelp there
[01:00] <lupine_85> ah, but...
[01:00] <lupine_85> !rtfm
[01:00] <ubotu> Words like noob, jfgi, stfu or rtfm are not welcome in this channel. Period.
[01:00] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: You could check /proc/bus/usb/devices to see if it's connected
[01:00] <lupine_85> wouldn't apply in #ubuntu-hackers :)
[01:00] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: what's NEXT?
[01:00] <tubo^bph> lupine_85, i think if its not resovlable by a *proper* internet research, it could be a topic in there.
[01:00] <Kesman> jw_606: reinstall the ati drivers from apt and then reconfigure your xorg.conf
[01:01] <lufis> Has anyone else had trouble with DVD menus on Ubuntu?
[01:01] <mzuverink> DigitalNinja, its a website that has kits that you can buy and assemble your own stuff
[01:01] <jw_606> Kesman, I've got'n as far as apt-get install xserver-xorg-driver-radeon but how would I configure my xorg.conf?
[01:01] <lupine_85> tubo^bph: you have to consider that not everyone knows where - or indeed how - to find answers on the internet. So even if the answer is bleeding obvious ;), it's still a valid question IMO
[01:01] <DigitalNinja> mzuverink: What's the web address
[01:01] <Kesman> jw_606: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:01] <jw_606> Kesman, is the xorg.conf where I have to comment out the DRI option?
[01:01] <Kesman> yeah
[01:01] <mc44> tubo^bph: we dont take that attitude in general. also this is offtopic :)
[01:02] <tubo^bph> lupine_85, mc44 ok, apologies then
[01:02] <jw_606> Kesman, thank you I'll go try that :) I'm a Linux NFG :D
[01:02] <mc44> tubo^bph: no worries

[01:07] <kohr_> says its not running

Please point me to a site if there's one. Thanks in advance.
[01:10] <avalon_> How do I view the Ubuntu file browser GUI as root? Like sudo Konqueror in Kubuntu?
[01:10] <kohr_> stormx2 now it says it couldn't open log notice file for tor
[01:10] <Stormx2> aztek: Thats a tricky one. Why not just get the patches directly from the windows boxes?
[01:10] <r3m> Is there another way than cdrom and usbkey to install ubuntu
[01:10] <quiksilver> tubo^bph: this is what i added //ziox/E  /media/Ziox  smbfs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0
[01:10] <Stormx2> avalon_: Yeah.
[01:10] <mc44> avalon_: sudo nautilus
[01:11] <aztek> right stormx.....but if its posible in linux i wud have prefered it...but if not i guess ill settle with win2003. thanks guys.
[01:11] <kohr_> Stormx2, still doesn't work
[01:11] <Stormx2> aztek: Well...
[01:11] <kohr_> cant find log file

[01:11] <Stormx2> aztek: But it would be a very complex process.

[01:46] <Stormx2> Bleh. Audacious needs an ubuntu maintainer.
[01:46] <nothlit> <ubotu> Package audacious does not exist in any distro I know
[01:46] <Stormx2> nothlit: audacious-media-player.org
[01:46] <faeryNatsuki> david_: i installed it, but i didn't found a way to use it, it something like a server, notr a desktop app, am i wrong?
[01:47] <faeryNatsuki> thanks Stormx2

[01:47] <Trixsey> I've mad an .sh script to execute some stuff.. can I execute commands using exec?
[01:47] <Trixsey> like
[01:47] <Trixsey> exec beryl-manager
[01:47] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Huh?
[01:47] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Commands are run like this: command
[01:47] <Stormx2> xD

[01:48] <varsendaggr> hey    my memory usage sais that 33%   Of  my memory    (   i ahve 384MB   is in use by cache   who is cache and how do i tell him that i want my memory back!!!!
[01:48] <AggAway> hello, *.  I'm a recent (today) convert to debian/ubuntu and I'm having some trouble with getting my network config right.  I followed the instructions at
[01:48] <AggAway> https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/network-configuration.html
[01:48] <david_> faeryNatsuki, and amarok has winamp skins (I think)... but I suggest you give something new a try... you might like it
[01:48] <Trixsey> Stormx2, you just run the commands from a .sh script?
[01:48] <Trixsey> Is it the same syntax?
[01:48] <AggAway> but all i did was lose my network config at that point.
[01:49] <AggAway> can someone guid me through the process?
=== AggAway is now known as Aggrav8d
[01:49] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Yeah.
[01:49] <jvai> lol @var
[01:49] <Trixsey> oh ok lol
[01:49] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Same as command line, amost.
[01:49] <Stormx2> *almost
[01:49] <Trixsey> Stormx2, so this is OK? http://www.mathbin.net/2545
[01:49] <faeryNatsuki> players used and discarded, xmmx, rhytmbox (because it looks like itunes -i hate software trying to manage my music by its criteria-)...
[01:50] <bobbyd_> hi
[01:50] <Trixsey> maybe an & in the end? no difference in this case?
[01:50] <Music_Shuffle> RhythmBox is wtfuseless I feel sometimes.
[01:50] <david_> lol... ubuntu servers are freenode... tricky ;)
[01:50] <Music_Shuffle> There are a lot of nice players though.
[01:50] <bobbyd_> if I just want the most basic x environment, what should I apt-get?
[01:50] <Music_Shuffle> XFCE?
[01:50] <Aggrav8d> actually, my first question is how to change the bash profile so that vi understands arrow keys, coloring, etc.
[01:50] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Should be, try and see.
[01:50] <Music_Shuffle> Fluxbox perhaps?
[01:50] <Trixsey> Stormx2, why do they use & in the end in this script?
[01:51] <EdLin> bobbyd_: x-windows-system-core fvwm xterm
[01:51] <Stormx2> Trixsey: & is for redirecting output I think.... I'm not sure. Ask the people in #bash, I never really was a good shell scripter
[01:51] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[01:51] <EdLin> x-window-system-core (no s, sorry)
[01:51] <faeryNatsuki> david_: then your suggestion is...?
[01:51] <DarthShrine> Stormx2, Runs it in the background, actually.
[01:51] <Goldfisch> Trixsey: You mean like => foobar 2>&1 ???
[01:51] <Stormx2> DarthShrine: Ah thats it...
[01:51] <Trixsey> no
[01:51] <Trixsey> I ment like
[01:51] <david_> faeryNatsuki, give amarok a try
[01:51] <Trixsey> in terminal you do "command &" so you can still use terminal
[01:52] <Trixsey> so one running program doesn't occupy it
[01:52] <bobbyd_> EdLin, thanks
[01:52] <Trixsey> what good is it in a shellscript?
[01:52] <EdLin> bobbyd_ there are a number of minimal window managers in ports.
[01:52] <Stormx2> Trixsey: Doesn't hold up everything
[01:52] <bad_> hey.. could anybody help me? i've tried to install Ubuntu 6.10 desktop now, but it has no effect.. The boot CD is running ok, it's reading data and next i see only black screen.. no action.
[01:52] <Trixsey> ok
[01:52] <jrib> Trixsey: if you don't put the &, the script won't continue until that command finishes
[01:52] <Goldfisch> Trixsey, if you need some command to background itself, and make way for your next command.
[01:52] <bobbyd_> EdLin, what would you suggest?
[01:52] <conn> hi, I'm using kubuntu with gnome apps, and I'm wondering how I can change the gnome icon theme to Human and make it persist in KDE? It seems to default to the "industrial" theme in KDE, and "Human" in GNOME. I want it to by Human in both environments
[01:52] <EdLin> bobbyd_: apt-cache search x-window-manager
[01:52] <bobbyd_> EdLin, thanks
[01:53] <SilentDis> bad_:  so, you get to boot the cd, the splash comes up asking you to pick an option, then just a black screen, right?
[01:53] <Stormx2> conn: Theres a kubuntu human theme?
[01:53] <faeryNatsuki> david_: i like amarok, but i like another alternative, just for... testing new players, i want to explore some good alternatives ;)
[01:53] <Trixsey> ok brb! :)
[01:53] <EdLin> bobbyd_: there's also a website devoted to window managers, I forgot the URL but Google should put it near the top.
[01:53] <bad_> SilentDis: yep, i choose Install ubuntu, then was logo with progress bar, and then after ~5min = only black screen..
[01:54] <SilentDis> bad_: how much memory in that machine?
[01:54] <bad_> SilentDis: 1024
[01:54] <bad_> ist notebook
[01:54] <Stormx2> bad_: Is this after installing? What install medium did you use? Desktop CD?
[01:54] <conn> Stormx2: no, you misunderstand. I have the Human theme installed that's part of ubuntu-desktop, an I want GNOME apps to use that theme while my desktop is set to KDE...
[01:54] <bad_> Stormx2: yes, desktop
[01:54] <SilentDis> bad_: ok (that's the most common one).  do you see an option for 'safe video mode' on the list?
[01:54] <faeryNatsuki> i'll try beep-media-player and... audacious
[01:55] <bobbyd_> EdLin, ok, thanks for the help
[01:55] <faeryNatsuki> david_: what is xmms2? a player? a server? both things?
[01:55] <bad_> SilentDis: yes, i've tried it too, and that has some problem
[01:55] <EdLin> bobbyd_: np
[01:55] <Stormx2> conn: Ah. Not sure why
[01:56] <EdLin> faeryNatsuki: apt-cache show xmms2, or look at the description in synaptic
[01:56] <bad_> SilentDis: the cd is reading and next it's stopped, and no action..
[01:56] <ludmil> hi. edgy with kernel 2.6.17-10 i386. for some reason all files in /proc (except kcore, mounts and self) are zero sized. I can not check meminfo, cpuinfo etc.? any ideas how to fix this?
[01:56] <faeryNatsuki> thanks EdLin ;)
[01:56] <qmf> what process is the gnome desktop wallpaper?
[01:56] <bad_> SilentDis: so files was copying to HDD and then stopped
[01:56] <EdLin> qmf: Nautilus handles the wallpaper, unfortunately.
[01:56] <SilentDis> bad_:  something is hanging SOMEWHERE... but I'm not sure if there's a way to display the text of what's going on.
[01:57] <SilentDis> bad_:  no files are copied to the HD during the boot of a liveCD environment.
[01:57] <bsamson> ludmil: you can still cat them even though they are 0 size, they are only 0 size because they aren't real files
[01:57] <faeryNatsuki> Stormx2: there's an audacious installer for edgy?
[01:57] <coopster> graft: ok, the odds were about right.  the new board made the HD click loudly, which can't be good.
[01:57] <qmf> EdLin: crap. is there a way to substitute nautilus for a different file manager?
[01:57] <EdLin> qmf: maybe.
[01:58] <qmf> i'll have a poke about
[01:58] <bad_> :(
[01:58] <SilentDis> bad_:  curious... have you tried the alt install cd, or the DVD version?
[01:58] <graft> coopster: new board? it hought you were getting a new drive...
[01:58] <narian> gnome, ubuntu ... Been experiencing some mayor "buggs" in my current setup, examples are: NIC suddenly unresponsive until reboot, OS suddenly hangs and i can't even shut down X, After a reboot all the window borders contain strange symbols (squares with numbers in them) instead of the window name, Once in a while when i start an application from one of the graphical menus the "starting app" appears but close without the actual program h
[01:58] <narian> ave been started... Is this cause to my hardware, buggs in the software, my setup or just me being plain stupid?
[01:58] <ludmil> bsamson: thanks.
[01:59] <coopster> graft: i took the pcb board off the new drive and put it on the busted one
[01:59] <bad_> SilentDis: nope.. what the difference in desktop and alternate? i've download desktop
[01:59] <EdLin> narian: sounds like a hardware problem
[01:59] <SilentDis> narian:  I had something similar myself... and still do, really.  I diagnosed it to a bad PSU.  not sure without being there to actually make such a recommendation for you though :(
[02:00] <coopster> the nerve of those WD people.  same board layout, same screw pattern, same _labeling_ on the parts, but the boards are not, in fact, exchangable.
[02:00] <EdLin> yeah, power supply problems affect everything
[02:00] <graft> coopster: ah... cheap disk recovery
[02:00] <coopster> graft:  yup.  workin on it, anyway.
[02:01] <SilentDis> bad_:  they've both got some other options during the boot process...  also, it'll rule out a 'bad burn' on the disk.
[02:02] <narian> SilentDis, EdLin, ahh okey, well i just upgraded my hardware so im quite sure there's a bunch of driver problems... but could a bad PSU really mess up my system that bad?
[02:02] <EdLin> narian: yes
[02:02] <tzbishop> How do I upgrade a deb package with dpkg?
[02:02] <dellorino> webcam in wine help me plz
[02:02] <bad_> SilentDis: does alternate ubuntu and desktop ubuntu has same packages?
[02:02] <faeryNatsuki> between audacious and beep media player, which one do you recommend to me? i want something friendly to the user, not only cute
[02:02] <SilentDis> bad_:  the dvd is an alt-install with a bunch of extra repos, basically.  usually an alt-install is the most people 'need' though.
[02:03] <SilentDis> narian:  you have no idea.  I've had numerous horrid errors cropping up due to this thing.  swapped it with a friend's, and all my problems disappeared magically lol
[02:03] <narian> EdLin, well then that will be my first priority, thank you.
[02:03] <SilentDis> narian:  watching the kernel 'Oops' multiple times, horrid kernel panics, you name it lol

[02:03] <jw_606> Hello, can I get help turning on accelerated 3D on my ATI Radeon 9800pro video card please? I am using Ubuntu 6.10
[02:03] <narian> SilentDis, hehe well then i hope thats my problem too sense its easy to fix (= thanks!
[02:04] <SilentDis> bad_:  no, they don't.  the base package list is about the same though, and the 'core components' are identical.
[02:04] <SilentDis> narian:  count yourself lucky if that's all it is lol
[02:04] <narian> EdLin, you've done more than i expected. now i got a lead (=

[02:05] <Aggrav8d> i installed 6.10 this morning.  i followed the steps in https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/network-configuration.html and set myself a static ip within our network.  when i ifconfig i don't get an ipv4 address and I can't ping anyone.  can someone please help me figure out what i did wrong?
[02:05] <SilentDis> narian:  I've run the same 400w PSU through multiple upgrades... over about 5 years or more.  add in that it's doing about 4x the stuff the original build was doing, 5 years of service, and that i'm a smoker... and well... you do the math rofl

[02:07] <Aggrav8d> LineOf7s - yes.  i set 192.168.0.99, everything below 100 is for static ips and i'm sure there's no conflict.

[02:08] <LineOf7s> Agg:  Once I figured that out, everything else worked fine.  Which is not very helpful in this context, granted.  :o)
[02:08] <Aggrav8d> LineOf7s - do you know a way to change bash so that it isn't chrooted?

[02:12] <shwag> am I suppose to install  sun-java5-jre   or sun-java5-bin ?
[02:12] <ludmil> ubuntu edgy - gedit does not open /proc/cpuinfo and meminfo. I can cat them, or open them in vi, nano and pico. ideas?
[02:12] <lupine_85> e.g. my public key ID is E91A6897
[02:12] <lupine_85> ludmil: that's fairly standard
[02:12] <lupine_85> you could copy it to somewhere else then open it in gedit? but why you'd want to, I dunno
[02:12] <ludmil> lupine_85: so - no way to view them in gui?
[02:12] <shwag> what is the difference between   sun-java5-jre  and  sun-java5-bin ?
[02:13] <EdLin> shwag: get -jre and apt will pull the -bin package in.
[02:13] <aleka> Can I post my gpg --listkeys output here?? it is 3 lines
[02:13] <SilentDis> ludmil:  i think that's by design.  the /proc area is not actually 'documents' per se, just outputs from the system about the system

[02:15] <ludmil> SilentDis: any idea how I can view this info in something else? it's not displayed in device manager. is there something like system info or so? device manager does not show all the info for cpu, as in the cpuinfo. and no meminfo
[02:16] <SilentDis> Josepe:  are you trying to transfer a working OS to another machine?

[02:17] <SilentDis> ludmil:  well... you could output that info to a file... cat /proc/cpuinfo > ~/cpuinfo.txt  && gedit ~/cpuinfo.txt should do it...
[02:17] <faeryNatsuki> i know xmms2 is a music player, but... i want to know if its a server or desktop application?

[02:17] <willys_fueguino> faeryNatsuki: desktop
[02:17] <narian> faeryNatsuki, desktop just like winamp
[02:17] <willys_fueguino> Does anyone else have problems alternating the X session with the console mode??
[02:17] <bruenig> faeryNatsuki, xmms is a desktop application insofar as it requires gui

[02:19] <Josepe>  SilentDis  so do the partiotion, and then use scp for example?
[02:19] <SilentDis> Josepe:  but, if you insist... the process would be to use dd to copy the drive to a file, then use dd again to copy the file to the drive
[02:19] <Mark___> ok, im nervous. what option do i choose with partitions?
[02:19] <Aggrav8d> LineOf7s - yes, all machines on the network start with 192.168.0.*
[02:20] <faeryNatsuki> mmm, umm, yes i know xmms, but i found something about xmms2...
[02:20] <faeryNatsuki> then i read again synaptic info about it :)
[02:20] <SilentDis> Josepe:  personally, I'd install the OS on the target machine, copy over the files in my home directory, maybe the apt cache files, and do the setup manually on the new machine.
[02:20] <LineOf7s> Josepe:  Have you looked into g4l  (Ghost For Linux)?  I've just used it to replicate a Ubuntu installation to identical hard disks seven times over.  It may not be appropriate for you in this instance (laptop -> desktop), but if the desktop HD is at least as big as the laptop's, and you don't have any info on there you wanna keep, it's an option.
[02:20] <flaccid> guys i got the bug where i get a white "X" screensaver instead of the right screensaver. how can i fix?
[02:20] <aleka> !gpg | aleka
[02:20] <ubotu> aleka: gpg is the GNU Privacy Guard.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
[02:21] <lupine_85> Josepe: netcat is cool for this. You can do it without ever having an intermediate file
[02:21] <SilentDis> Josepe: LineOf7s option is also good.  direct copying like that is just not a great idea, usually.
[02:21] <LineOf7s> Aggrav8d:  Figured they would be.  Is the network card you've assigned the static address to set to automatically start up boot/networking start?
[02:21] <lupine_85> of course, if there's a network problem, the second HD is borkened for a bit, but... :p
[02:21] <Trixsey> How do I terminate firefox?
[02:22] <Trixsey> Its running but I cant see it, and whining about things
[02:22] <lupine_85> Trixsey: killall firefox ?
[02:22] <SilentDis> Trixsey:  killall firefox-bin
[02:22] <un_operateur> Tristan, at a terminal -- killall firefox-bin
[02:22] <godless> Trixsey:  sudo killall firefox-bin
[02:22] <Mathew> So if MD5 Sums are different i have download again?
[02:22] <Mathew> So if MD5 Sums are different i have to download again?
[02:22] <Trixsey> thx
[02:22] <jrib> Mathew: yes
[02:23] <Gravy_Train> can someone help me fix my sound problem?
[02:23] <Josepe> LineOf7s well, laptop has 100GB (but I am using hda2 with 40GB) and PC has an empty 80 HD (deleting red hat)
[02:23] <Josepe> can I use g4u?
[02:24] <flaccid> this stupid bug https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/kdeartwork/+bug/70991
[02:24] <lupine_85> Josepe: definitely don't use dd
[02:24] <Mark___> WHat are the advantages of using ubuntu? i mean, what can it do that windows cant?
[02:24] <Josepe> hehehe
[02:24] <lupine_85> personally, I would just tar it up and copy it over
[02:24] <lupine_85> that /will/ work
[02:24] <Josepe> and partitioning desktop with the same as laptop, and then only to copy all files? it is a valid option?
[02:24] <lupine_85> yeah
[02:24] <lupine_85> that's what "tarring it up" means :)
[02:25] <LineOf7s> Josepe:  In theory, yes - g4l copies partitions, not hard drives.  But there's likely a better option, and I'll bet someone here knows it.  :o)
[02:25] <SilentDis> Mark___:  that's more of a 'personal' question, as in, what do YOU do with your 'puter.  what ubuntu gives you most of, imo, is freedom.
[02:25] <Josepe> lupine_85: so tar on laptop, and untar on desktop right? nice :), and special options for tar?
[02:26] <tossebear> hi, is there any gui for configuring wireless lan with wpa in edgy?
[02:26] <un_operateur> Mark___, if you are looking to ubuntu as a windows replacement, it's quite likely you will be disappointed, because it is not
[02:26] <cdevidal> Someone happened to my /dev/hdc (cdrom device), I'm running edgy... could someone please ls -l /dev/hdc ?
[02:27] <Mark___> I make websites and games and similar things. What i am wanting to know is, does linux have anything to offer in that area?
[02:27] <lupine_85> Josepe: no special options :)
[02:27] <lupine_85> might want to use -j to reduce the size though
[02:27] <un_operateur> Mark___, It nonetheless tries to provide everything a user might need (that windows already provides)
[02:27] <SilentDis> cdevidal:  what is the problem?
[02:27] <Josepe> thank all people :), replacing red hat 9.0 will done tomorrow hehehe :)
[02:27] <cdevidal> /dev/hdc is totally gone
[02:27] <lupine_85> Mark___: lots :)
[02:27] <cdevidal> dunno what happened
[02:27] <lupine_85> gcc is your friend
[02:27] <cdevidal> could you ls -l /dev/hdc ?
[02:28] <kitche> Mark___: well considering that most websites run on apache which is installed on Linux, but no games at least window games
[02:28] <Josepe> if it works, I will copy that to athers members of the office ;)
[02:28] <LineOf7s> Best of luck Josepe.  :o)  Spread the Joy!
[02:28] <un_operateur> Mark___, for websites, Linux makes a great server, all the tools you need to maintain a website are readily installable -- as for games, the linux games industry has a lot of way to go yet
[02:28] <Josepe> thanks again
[02:28] <SilentDis> cdevidal:  I doubt you'd want info about MY computer in this regard lol
[02:28] <cdevidal> SilentDis, worth a try
[02:29] <cdevidal> I can always remove it if it doesn't work
[02:29] <kitche> cdevidal: all ls -l will tell you is that it exists it's not a symlink like /dev/cdrom is it's a block device
[02:29] <SilentDis> un_operateur:  on linux games... lots already is there, doom3, ut2k4, nwn1... and, you can use cedega to run 'em otherwise :)
[02:29] <cdevidal> kitche, that's fine
[02:29] <cdevidal> I know how to use mknod
[02:29] <cdevidal> just don't know what the numbers and device are
[02:30] <jrib> Hi, I have gdm start 2 servers by having this in my gdm.conf: "[servers] \n0=Standard\n1=Standard" (\n isn't really there).  I can no longer switch to a gdm login screen by pressing ctrl-alt-f7.  It is just a black screen.  This used to work.  Any ideas on debugging?
[02:30] <cdevidal> could someone please just ls -l /dev/hdc ?
[02:30] <Mark___> I am finding it hard to see why people make a big fuss about linux. am i missing something? I realy want rid of windows but i dont see how linux is going to convice me
[02:30] <kitche> cdevidal: mine is 22, 0
[02:30] <cdevidal> kitche, that's what my CentOS box was.  Bummer, didn't work.
[02:30] <un_operateur> SilentDis, I didnt say Linux games were non-existent -- I said the industry has a long way to go yet to make linux any sort of a worthwhile contender
[02:30] <kitche> Mark___: it's about freedom
[02:30] <SilentDis> cdevidal:  it won't show what YOUR device should be though... it'll show what mine is.  but... very well.
[02:31] <cdevidal> SilentDis, yeah I'll just rm if it doesnt work
[02:31] <SilentDis> un_operateur:  that I do agree with, yes :)
[02:31] <Gravy_Train> Mark____ , for games it doesn't come close to what you get elsewhere, everything else is pretty solid
[02:31] <lupine_85> Mark___: freedom /and/ usability :)
[02:31] <un_operateur> cdevidal, it's like taking a picture of my car to compare with a picture of yours :) no good
[02:31] <pdiddy_79> Hello! There are 75 updates available for my computer (I haven't updated for ages), but before I install the updates a message says "Warning, you are about to install software that can't be authenticated!" The software that can't be authenticated is called "pmount". Is it ok to install this software along with all the other available updates?
[02:31] <cdevidal> un_operateur, ;-P
[02:31] <lupine_85> but if it's mostly games you want, and you don't like nethack, windows is a better bet
[02:31] <Aggrav8d> LineOf7s - all this time it was a loose cable.
[02:31] <cdevidal> un_operateur, what can it hurt?  I can always rm
[02:31] <Gravy_Train> Mark____ . for internet, media, word processing, it's all there
[02:31] <LineOf7s> YAY for Aggrav8d!!  :oD
[02:31] <Aggrav8d> thanks for putting up with my noobisms, everybody.
[02:31] <amonbish> don't know
[02:32] <PORDO> can anyone help me get sound working in edgy?  upgrading ubuntu distros always destroys my ICH5 onboard spdif.
[02:32] <Aggrav8d> now i just need to learn how to be a decent admin for this office and i'll be fine :)
[02:32] <lupine_85> cedega & wine do a good job with many games, also
[02:32] <LineOf7s> Agg:  At least you know you can configure it for a static IP successfully!
[02:32] <Gravy_Train> Mark____, and for practically no cost
[02:32] <un_operateur> cdevidal, if you intend of losing your hair before the age of 40, you're welcome to try anything out :)
[02:32] <cdevidal> un_operateur, I'd like to try this out if you please
[02:32] <crimsun_> PORDO: "destroys" is unreasonably and, I bet, utterly false.
[02:32] <Gravy_Train> Mark____ , so if you're tired of spending 200 on the new photoshop or whatever, switch
[02:32] <cdevidal> please ls -l /dev/hdc and paste it in here
[02:33] <Gravy_Train> Mark____, if you want your games so bad though, just dual boot and have a grand ole time
[02:33] <Aggrav8d> at what point in the install process am i supposed to have a choice of packages to install?
[02:33] <Aggrav8d> because it isn't obvious to me.
[02:33] <un_operateur> cdevidal, seriously -- there's no point to it -- but anyway -- brw-rw---- 1 root disk 22, 0 2006-12-19 02:17 /dev/hdc
[02:33] <lupine_85> Aggrav8d: you don't
[02:33] <kitche> Aggrav8d: whatever is on your live install is what get's installed
[02:33] <lupine_85> all package choices are done post-install
[02:33] <Mark___> Well thats no big deal to me. I beleive in freedom so all my software is cracked, even windows. So linux been free is no big deal
[02:33] <lupine_85> lol
[02:33] <Aggrav8d> well then someone should be told that https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/installing-from-cd.html is out of date for 6.10
[02:33] <lupine_85> 'free' as in Freedom, not as in beer
[02:33] <cdevidal> un_operateur, thanks for your concern, and thanks for the ls, already tried 22, 0 so I must have another problem, just wanted someone else to confirm that's the proper setting.  Thanks.
[02:34] <SilentDis> cdevidal:  you more than likely won't recover any useful information from this... but...  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38019/
[02:34] <Aggrav8d> there is no "install a LAMP server" option, it's being done by default.
[02:34] <crimsun_> PORDO: in any case, please unload all alsa modules and forcibly remove /var/lib/alsa/asound.state, then forcibly reboot
[02:34] <LineOf7s> Agg:  That's a different CD.
[02:34] <ThePub> Mark___: maybe you could crack linux too.. I forgot my activation key
[02:34] <un_operateur> cdevidal, 22,0 -- are you talking about device IDs ?
[02:34] <cdevidal> un_operateur, yep
[02:34] <Aggrav8d> LineOf7s - uh, no, that's what i downloaded.  6.10 server i386
[02:34] <Riyonuk> Hello, when I start to install ubuntu (latest version, which they had numbers instead of names, to hard to remmber) I have to live cd and then install. Can I skip that live cd thing? It takes to long...
[02:35] <LineOf7s> Agg:  Fair point then.  However, there is a CD that offers a LAMP install - but it took me two goes to get it.  The first time, it just happened... but it wasn't the LAMP install I wanted.
[02:35] <kitche> Riyonuk: the alternate cd doesn't have the live cd on it
[02:35] <LineOf7s> I can't remember if I downloaded the wrong CD or something else, though.
[02:35] <lupine_85> Riyonuk: latest version is 6.10 :)
[02:35] <cdevidal> mknod isnt working so I guess I'll just (arrg) reboot
[02:35] <lupine_85> and yeah...
[02:35] <cdevidal> thanks guys
[02:35] <lupine_85> !alternate
[02:35] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[02:36] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  the distros are all numered.  the names are simply another way to refer to them.  The current version is Ubuntu 6.10 (codename Edgy Eft)
[02:36] <lupine_85> cdevidal: MAKEDEV ?
[02:36] <Gravy_Train> can someone lend a hand with helping get my sound working again?
[02:36] <cdevidal> lupine_85, I guess I could try that
[02:36] <cdevidal> I was just running mknod on the commandline
[02:36] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, was it working anytime before?
[02:36] <Montaro> or 7.04 (Fiesty fawn) if your feeling a bit crazy ;)
[02:36] <cafuego_> Feisty
[02:36] <Montaro> thats what I said :P
[02:36] <pdiddy_79> Hi, quick question if somebody can help me out with it, thanks... There are 75 updates available for my computer (I haven't updated for ages), but before I install the updates a message says "Warning, you are about to install software that can't be authenticated!" The software that can't be authenticated is called "pmount". Is it ok to install this software along with all the other available updates?
[02:36] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  and the live CD will be your best bet.  it'll do the install for you, as well as give you a 'backup' in case of other problems (hd failing, drop in live cd, and fix it/copy files, as example)
[02:36] <lupine_85> not feisty
[02:37] <lupine_85> seriously
[02:37] <cafuego_> not Fiesty
[02:37] <lupine_85> pdiddy_79: do you trust the repo in question?
[02:37] <cdevidal> Lata
[02:37] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur , yes it was
[02:37] <jvai> is the alternate cd the same as debian's netinstall?
[02:37] <lupine_85> it's not supported by ubuntu, whatever it is
=== AfterDeath_ is now known as AfterDeath
[02:37] <lupine_85> jvai: no
[02:37] <LineOf7s> pdiddy:  If you don't trust it, you could deselect it, couldn't you?
[02:37] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, and then what happened to make it fail?
[02:37] <pdiddy_79> sorry, what's repo?
[02:37] <SilentDis> pdiddy_79:  did you add a custom repository to your system?
[02:37] <lupine_85> same type of non-GUI installer though
[02:37] <Cheese> why would my lcd not get a signal from the GPU after loading to the CD ?
[02:37] <jvai> ok
[02:37] <lupine_85> pdiddy_79: whichever one the unauthenticated package is coming from
[02:38] <pdiddy_79> no, i didn't add anything to it
[02:38] <lupine_85> pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:38] <lupine_85> I bet you did :p
[02:38] <lupine_85> !pastebin
[02:38] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:38] <Aggrav8d> LineOf7s - i stand corrected, it did eventually offer the option.  also it offered a DNS server option, which was not mentioned on the page.  it's a bit misleading because i thought "install lamp server" would be on the very first screen of the installer.
[02:39] <Riyonuk> Well I already have the cd burned so....and I meant numbers not like..like 6, just 6 then 7, not 6.10 then 6.10.5, etc
[02:39] <SilentDis> !pastebin | pdiddy_79 Please use pastebin to show us your /etc/apt/sources.list file.  It'll help us solve the problem for you -

[02:39] <LineOf7s> Agg:  Are you installing an Edgy server?  My experience was with the Dapper install - figured I'd go 'nominally stable' for a server.
[02:39] <pdiddy_79> lupine_85, it doesn't say where its coming from...just gives the name ("pmount")
[02:39] <lupine_85> apt-cache policy pmount
[02:40] <Aggrav8d> i figured edgy, being an official release, was stable enough.  it's not going to be a very busy server.
[02:40] <pdiddy_79> no, just says pmount
[02:40] <lupine_85> Riyonuk: now you're just being picky
[02:40] <Riyonuk> :p
[02:40] <Winter> anyone in here have experience with Cedega?
[02:40] <lupine_85> pdiddy_79: run the command...
[02:40] <lupine_85> pastebin that along with /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:40] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  6.10 is a 'standard' way of showing revisions.  Ubuntu releases at regular intervals.  usually the 4th month, and 10th month of the year.  so, 6 (2006).10 (october)
[02:41] <kitche> Winter what about Cedega?
[02:41] <SilentDis> !anybody | winter
[02:41] <ubotu> winter: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:41] <Winter> XP
[02:41] <pdiddy_79> ok, will give it a try
[02:41] <pdiddy_79> thanks guys
[02:41] <tossebear> hi, is there any gui for configuring wireless lan with wpa in edgy?
[02:41] <LineOf7s> Agg:  I figured that too, so I installed Edgy as a desktop.  I'm finding I was... optimistic.  :o)  Still, I'm sure the basics of the server are... mature.
[02:41] <Winter> i'm just looking for general opinions on Cedega
[02:41] <SilentDis> Winter:  and, yes, I know about cedega, as well as many many others here, probably :)
[02:41] <Riyonuk> oh
[02:41] <Riyonuk> Like ones supposed to know that >.>
[02:42] <tossebear> also, how can I add iso-8859-1 locales?
[02:42] <SilentDis> Winter:  Cedega = Linux Game Love :)
[02:42] <Winter> that's the hope, yes
[02:42] <kitche> Winter: well it's 15 bucks for support and it goes help develop so it works with games
[02:42] <Winter> how good is the support?
[02:42] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  you can always refer to them by names then!  :D  *snicker* *giggle*
[02:42] <Riyonuk> pssh
[02:42] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: are you still there?
[02:43] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, yes
[02:43] <kitche> Winter: no clue don't know it works with the latest games though
[02:43] <Riyonuk> Is ubuntu good for newbs? Someone affiliated with DSL (Damn Small Linux) tells me I should be using slackware
[02:43] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: the last thing i did was try to make it so my temp folder would be cleaned out when my system would shut down
[02:43] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: then i rebooted with no sound
[02:43] <SilentDis> Winter:  good from what I've experienced.  they update quickly, and "it just works" 99% of the time :)
[02:44] <kitche> Riyonuk: ubuntu is on the other end then slackware it's for people that dont know to much about *nix in generla
[02:44] <Winter> Slackware is great in the abstract... i am coming (directly) from Slackware... but the later releases haven't really had it all together (i'm thinking 9 and 10)
[02:44] <un_operateur> Riyonuk, that's like telling a beginner car driver to start driving a powerful mercedes
[02:44] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  out of all my exploration of linux distros, never have I found a more helpful and robust community as with ubuntu :)
[02:44] <Dekaritae> Are there any file managers for GNU/Linux that support the 7-zip archive format internally?
[02:44] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: i did everything the way it said so on ubuntuguide.org
[02:44] <jvai> <--noob, & been using ubuntu since hoary successfully, even in the workplace..:)
[02:44] <kitche> Winter: wow 9 and 10 are old well at least 10.0
[02:44] <lupine_85> Dekaritae: not exactly
[02:44] <LineOf7s> Riyonuk:  I chose Ubuntu as a noob to Linux (but not 'computing').  It has been kind - or as kind as the searing pain that is Linux can be, anway.  ;o)
[02:44] <Winter> kitche: yeah
[02:44] <SilentDis> !7zip | dekaritae
[02:44] <ubotu> dekaritae: Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[02:44] <lupine_85> if you have 7zip installed, ark and file-roller will work
[02:44] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, what did you do to ensure /tmp would be cleaned out?
[02:44] <Riyonuk> Thought so, Im sticking with ubuntu
[02:44] <Winter> i guess 11 is out now, but i opted for Ubuntu instead as a change of pace
[02:45] <Riyonuk> gonna go try to install it
[02:45] <Dekaritae> I don't mean support for creating/expanding archives, I mean transparent browsing ala xplorer
[02:45] <lupine_85> but the same goes for all the other compression formats - e.g. remove tar, and ark and file-roller won't be able to use it
[02:45] <lupine_85> oh.
[02:45] <Winter> (i really like synaptic-apt toolset, so far... don't really like a lot of the other stuff...)
[02:45] <lupine_85> konqueror
[02:45] <lupine_85> no idea what nautilus does w/rt that
[02:45] <Dekaritae> Wherein it treats the archives as just another type of folder
[02:45] <Riyonuk> so can I skip the loading of the live cd and go to the instalation?
[02:45] <LineOf7s> Speaking of the searing pain that is Linux:  If I start a process in the background (using the & operand) - a game server, for example - is there a way to 'get back into' it?
[02:45] <Riyonuk> Cause it takes forever
[02:46] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  the debian package system is also, imo, one of the best out there.  it's actually hard to shoot yourself in the foot with it :)
[02:46] <kitche> Riyonuk: if you get the alternate cd you can
[02:46] <Dekaritae> Ah, ok. Thanks
[02:46] <Riyonuk> what about the one Im stuck with since I dont have anymore blank cd's
[02:46] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: i did    sudo cp /etc/init.d/sysklogd /etc/init.d/sysklogd_backup gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/sysklogd  added a section rm -fr /tmp/* /tmp/.??*  and saved the file
[02:46] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: , just as the guide said
[02:47] <kitche> Riyonuk: that is onyl a live cd/install cd
[02:47] <SilentDis> Dekaritae:  did you check out that link from ubotu?  installing 7zip support will let you do just that, basically.  and it's detailed on that page :)
[02:47] <w3ccv> LineOf7s, what do you want to do with the game server that's in the background
[02:47] <Dekaritae> Yes, I'm reading that now
[02:47] <Riyonuk> yes I know, possible to skip it?
[02:47] <Riyonuk> Maybe with expert mode or something
[02:47] <lupine_85> Riyonuk: the altnerate CD doesn't load the live environment at all
[02:47] <lupine_85> so download and burn yourself a copy
[02:47] <bulio|> should 533mhz cpu and 380MB ram be ok on edgy eft?
[02:47] <Riyonuk> but I dont have any blank cd's
[02:47] <Riyonuk> I have a 1gig usb
[02:47] <tossebear> hi, is there any gui for configuring wireless lan with wpa in edgy?
[02:47] <lupine_85> bulio|: possibly
[02:47] <SilentDis> Riyonuk:  the Alt-cd will let you install from a 'text mode' interface
[02:48] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, thats not good -- whats happening is when you start up the system -- the sysklogd is removing everything from /tmp -- inlcuding lockfiles and others that other services need
[02:48] <Dekaritae> What I'm hoping for (but not terribly expecting much) is something akin to Zip Magic
[02:48] <LineOf7s> w3ccv:  potentially change various game parameters while it's running, rather than change the .cfg files, kill it and restart.  I can likely to everything I want to do 'remotely' (from the game client), but I thought there'd be a way to get back to a running process.
[02:48] <lupine_85> Riyonuk: the live cd doesn't let you skip the live environment
[02:48] <Dekaritae> Where the archives are made "transparent" at an OS-level
[02:48] <Riyonuk> bah
[02:48] <lupine_85> Dekaritae: konqueror does it
[02:48] <lupine_85> no idea about nautilus
[02:48] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, If i were you I would remove that line -- rm -fr /tmp/* /tmp/.??*
[02:48] <SilentDis> bulio|:  that's just about the EXACT specs of the machine I just gave my mom.  she loves ubuntu :)
[02:48] <Riyonuk> alright, this instaltion is gonna take at least 3 hours then
[02:48] <Riyonuk> :(
[02:48] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: oh, so what should i do
[02:48] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: ok
[02:48] <lupine_85> you just need the correct binary for your compressed file format
[02:49] <kitche> Gravy_Train: at least from the syslogd script
[02:49] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: will the files reload after a reboot
[02:49] <Dekaritae> Ok then
[02:49] <LineOf7s> Riyonuk:  3 hrs?  Are you running off a 2x CD drive or something?  :o)
[02:49] <Riyonuk> no but its old and shakes, this computer is lame and the ubuntu cd is scratched and dusty
[02:49] <Riyonuk> :D
[02:49] <lupine_85> LineOf7s: the live CD is incredibly pathetic IMO
[02:49] <bulio|> does fat32 work fine under ubuntu?
[02:50] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, they should, yes .. but you dont need a reboot -- try these two commands --- sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart; sudo gnome-sound-properties
[02:50] <LineOf7s> lupine:  Well, it may be - but 3hrs?
[02:50] <w3ccv> LineOf7s, not really. But if you start the server, then from the slell window do a ctl-Z that will put it to sleep, then 'bg' will backgorund it, and 'fg' will foreground it. BUt to do any changes the server must have some 'screen' input
[02:50] <SilentDis> bulio|: yep :)
[02:50] <kitche> bulio|: yes Linux has excellent support for fat32
[02:50] <bulio|> great
[02:50] <SilentDis> bulio|: I wouldn't install linux to a fat32 partition... but you can read/write data to/from them without any problem.
[02:50] <Dekaritae> My other question is, if there is a GNU/Linux image viewer with support for descript.ion metadata. Google has been unhelpful regarding this.
[02:50] <LineOf7s> w3ccv:  Okay, so if I start it with & at the end, then it's lost to me?  Not a big deal - it'll just be good to not wonder anymore.  :o)
[02:51] <bulio|> well that was easy
[02:51] <bulio|> converted my NTFS partition to fat32
[02:51] <karl> How can I make it so that my drives (I have 3 hard drives) spin down and are quiet when not in use?
[02:51] <lupine_85> LineOf7s: nah. you can return to it by running "fg"
[02:51] <Riyonuk> is it possiblt to install ubuntu without installing on a cd?
[02:51] <lupine_85> !install
[02:51] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[02:51] <lupine_85> lots of methods
[02:51] <bobbyd_> karl, check out hdparm
[02:51] <kitche> Dekaritae: did you check google's linux search engine but maybe GIMP can do what you but it's a piece of software like photoshop
[02:51] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: error message Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.
[02:51] <Gravy_Train> Without the GNOME settings manager running, some preferences may not take effect. This could indicate a problem with Bonobo, or a non-GNOME (e.g. KDE) settings manager may already be active and conflicting with the GNOME settings manager.
[02:52] <Riyonuk> Maybe create a partition, and drag the files to it?
[02:52] <SilentDis> bulio|:  you can read NTFS partitions just fine too from linux... the writing stuff is a bit complex right now... but it's in development
[02:52] <LineOf7s> lupine:  I will try that.  If it doesn't work, I'll consider it dead to me.  :o)
[02:52] <Dekaritae> Yes, I have The GIMP, but it loads too slowly for my purposes
[02:52] <w3ccv> LineOf7s, but if it doesn't have some interactive input, then there isnt' much you could do anyway.
[02:52] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, ok, just run the command -- gnome-settings-daemon
[02:52] <lupine_85> it'll work :
[02:52] <lupine_85> :)
[02:52] <dibblego> does anyone here use 'sticky notes'? I have some on my home machine, where I only have ssh access - wondering if I can access a sticky note on that machine
[02:52] <skunkworks> hmm - my battery went dead when I running the update manager.  now I get "Only one software management tool is allowed to run at the same time"
[02:53] <karl> I've looked at several hdparm things, but they are always just about dma
[02:53] <Aggrav8d> hm.  default sshd is unexpectedly disconnecting me before even giving me a login prompt.
[02:53] <LineOf7s> w3ccv:  Well if I *don't* start it in the background (with &), then it sits in the foreground and lets me type commands in as I choose to.  Btw, it's a Call Of Duty 2 server, if that helps.
[02:53] <phisrow> 
[02:53] <lupine_85> skunkworks: rm /var/cache/apt/lock should do the trick
[02:53] <kitche> Aggrav8d: you sure it's sshd doing it and not how ubuntu is setup by default
[02:53] <SilentDis> dibblego:  it stores it's notes in your home folder.  it's in a hidden folder... can't remember the name though.  do a ls -al in ~ to see it
[02:53] <arrenlex> skunkworks: rm -f /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[02:53] <Aggrav8d> kitche - what, like a firewall?
[02:53] <dibblego> ~/.gnome2/stickynotes_applet for anyone interested
[02:53] <LineOf7s> But most of what I wanna do I can do from within the game client, so that's okay (in a practical sense).
[02:53] <arrenlex> skunkworks: sudo on that, actually
[02:53] <Aggrav8d> how would i check?
[02:53] <lupine_85> oh, it's lib/dpkg? oops, sorry :S
[02:53] <dibblego> SilentDis, thanks found it
[02:54] <w3ccv> LineOf7s, don't know games, but that does sound like you could bring it back to the foreground and do things.  Then re-background ti .   good luck
[02:54] <wasabi_> anyone using an audigy 2zs on edgy? isn't the sound a little too low?
[02:54] <kitche> Aggrav8d: look at your hosts.allow and host.deny in /etc and configure firewall if you want
[02:54] <lupine_85> fg brings background jobs to the foreground
[02:54] <SilentDis> dibblego:  okes.  sorry I couldn't remember the name...  but glad you found it :)
[02:54] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur : it says i can have only one xsettings running at a time , i am in a xgl session, is that why?
[02:54] <LineOf7s> I'm heading downstair to try the magic of 'fg' right now.  Ta for helps.  :o)  I'll report back in a moment.
[02:54] <lupine_85> ctrl+z drops you back to the shell. usually.
[02:54] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: running beryl and 3d desktop graphics
[02:55] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: or is it talking about something different?
[02:55] <Dekaritae> kitche: Found one! XnView 1.70 for Linux/x86
[02:56] <arrenlex> Yo bruenig
[02:56] <wasabi_> anyone using an audigy 2zs on edgy? isn't the sound a little too low?
[02:56] <bruenig> !hi | arrenlex
[02:56] <ubotu> arrenlex: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[02:56] <kitche> wasabi_: why not make your volume louder with sudo alsamixer
[02:56] <Aggrav8d> kitche - seems it was just my choice of ports for ssh that it didn't like.  1322.
[02:56] <arrenlex> kitche: Why do you need to run alsamixer with sudo?
[02:56] <Alakazamz0r> /clear
[02:57] <LineOf7s> ps -ax to confirm it's running.  'fg'.  "-bash: fg: current:  no such job".  Oh well, no matter.  :o)
[02:57] <Gravy_Train> the volume level is not the problem, there is not sound coming from the speakers whatsoever
[02:57] <lupine_85> LineOf7s: did you start it in a different shell
[02:57] <wasabi_> kitche, i tried that it's up to the max and it's lower than what it is in windows
[02:57] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, ahh -- xgl -- sorry, i dont know much about it -- a reboot ought to do it tho
[02:57] <SilentDis> Gravy_Train:  using the digital output per chance?
[02:57] <lupine_85> LineOf7s: your best bet would be to run it in screen
[02:57] <Flick> Hello
[02:57] <Gravy_Train> ok thank you so much un_operateur
[02:57] <lupine_85> !screen
[02:57] <ubotu> screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[02:57] <LineOf7s> lupine:  Not to my knowledge.
[02:57] <lupine_85> that will work
[02:57] <Gravy_Train> un_operateur: appreciate the effort
[02:58] <skunkworks> lupine_85:  cannot remove `/var/cache/apt/lock': No such file or directory
[02:58] <un_operateur> Gravy_Train, np and yw :)
[02:58] <arrenlex> skunkworks: sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[02:58] <kitche> arrenlex: you don't need to but I was gonna say then store the settings
[02:58] <J-_> !cron
[02:58] <lupine_85> mm, it's /var/lib/dpkg/lock :) sorry
[02:58] <ubotu> cron is a way to schedule execution of software/scripts. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto  -  There is also a decent Howto at http://www.tech-geeks.org/contrib/mdrone/cron&crontab-howto.htm
[02:58] <LineOf7s> lupine:  It's okay - I'll just suck it up.  Was more of a "fill a hole in my knowledge" question than a "ZOMG SOMEONE HELP MEEE!!111" one.  :o)
[02:58] <lupine_85> lol :)
[02:58] <lupine_85> screen is good, though. it'll let you come and to to the server process as you please
[02:58] <wasabi_> kitche, cranking master and pcm is about half as loud as it would be in windows on full
[02:58] <Flick> i have just moved from 6.06 to 6.10
[02:59] <LineOf7s> lupine:  I've heard good things about 'screen', but I'll continue to stick with bash for the time being so my questions can be based somewhat on a 'standard' config - until I know better.
[02:59] <malikeye> I must say, I think this is the most crowded channel I've ever been in
[02:59] <lupine_85> wasabi_: I typically have 3-4 independent volume controls when playing sound. Make sure they're all up to full :)
[02:59] <aleka> I have been using beryl for about a week now, and yesterday I installed kiba-dock from a CVS build....since I've been running kiba-dock.. my system has been lagging considerablly and xorg is taking up to 20% cpu time, followed by beryl... I just had the gnome applet crash on me twice just because I was right clicking on a taskbar to close an open (gedit) txt file...Are it common for kiba-dock to start these kind of problems or is somet
[02:59] <aleka> hing going on in the bg I am not aware of?
[02:59] <Dekaritae> Ok last question! Has anyone had problems using Ubuntu on a 480x320 display?
[02:59] <Flick> well i foind my sound go's distorted on full no matter what speekers i plug in
[02:59] <wasabi_> lupine_85, yea i will give that a try
[02:59] <arrenlex> malikeye: Welcome :)
[03:00] <lupine_85> malikeye: wait 'till we end up with >1000
[03:00] <lupine_85> Dekaritae: you'll be able to do terminal
[03:00] <skunkworks> lupine_85: it deleted the directoy - but I still get the same error
[03:00] <lupine_85> X will load, but it won't be pretty
[03:00] <Dekaritae> I mean full GUI
[03:00] <skunkworks> thanks btw
[03:00] <Dekaritae> I'm looking at my options regarding a port through garux
[03:00] <Dekaritae> I mean, the possibility of one
[03:00] <SilentDis> Dekaritae:  i haven't ever seen a res like that lol.  Terminal window should work though.  some sort of embedded device or something?
[03:00] <Dekaritae> http://cache.gizmodo.com/gadgets/palm_tungsten_x_handheld.jpg
[03:01] <malikeye> who are the devs here ?
[03:01] <lupine_85> malikeye: the devs are too busy to sit around here :p
[03:01] <arrenlex> malikeye: I don't think the devs hang out here much.
[03:01] <arrenlex> ...yeah.
[03:01] <malikeye> so this is all userbase ?
[03:01] <Dekaritae> SilentDis: http://hackndev.com/palm/garux
[03:01] <lupine_85> they have their own IRC chans that are /for devs only/
[03:01] <Flick> ture
[03:01] <lupine_85> malikeye: yeah :)
[03:01] <malikeye> man
[03:01] <Flick> we have to help are selfs
[03:01] <SilentDis> malikeye:  they don't hang around here, usually.  the ops, on the other hand, do like to jump out and bop trolls without warning, though :D
[03:01] <arrenlex> malikeye: There are lurking mods that also help sometimes. But yes.
[03:01] <lupine_85> not /all/ the userbase though
[03:01] <lupine_85> that would be insane :P
[03:02] <SilentDis> Dekaritae:  ahhhh, a PDA :)
[03:02] <Dekaritae> Yus!
[03:02] <Dekaritae> I'm probably overly optimistic at this point
[03:02] <Dekaritae> I just want a better UI than Qtopia
[03:02] <Crony1> anyone have any experience getting ultravnc viewer with the MSRC encryption plugin to work with wine?
[03:02] <Crony1> from what i read, the answer will probably be know, but this is my last hope :(
[03:03] <Crony1> er, know=no
[03:03] <Flick> i gave up with Wine
[03:03] <LineOf7s> malikeye:  This channel (and the helpful users within) are a big part of the reason why Ubuntu is as 'friendly' as it is.  Or so I've found.
[03:03] <Dekaritae> SilentDis: http://hackndev.com/palm/z72
[03:03] <malikeye> I thought it was just easy to use :)
[03:03] <Flick> if u do get summit to work in Wine it like to brake on its own
[03:03] <lupine_85> malikeye: that too :p
[03:03] <LineOf7s> It's based on Linux - of course it's not 'easy to use'.  ;o)
[03:04] <malikeye> LineOf7s: I'm a longtime gentoo user so....
[03:04] <SilentDis> Dekaritae:  ok, you just managed to waste a good amount of my life on me.  thanks.  roflmao
[03:04] <LineOf7s> Oh well - you're set then.
[03:04] <arrenlex> malikeye: You would like my quit message then. :)
[03:04] <Dekaritae> Yes, but it's cool!
[03:04] <malikeye> arrenlex: and that would be ?
[03:04] <Flick> well i use to use SUSE up till 10.1 then it was just buggy so i switched to Ubuntu
[03:04] <malikeye> not a suse fan
[03:04] <malikeye> well... not a yast fan, lets put it that way :)
[03:05] <Dekaritae> Warning, do a full backup before you play around with anything. The bootloader will use the entirety of the device's internal memory
[03:05] <Flick> nope SUSE sucks now they have broke the Yest installer in it
[03:05] <malikeye> it looks nice though :)
[03:05] <Flick> ture Suse looks nice
[03:05] <lupine_85> Yast never works :p
[03:06] <Flick> but whats the Point in looking nice if you carnt install your programs
[03:06] <malikeye> a woman at work ran yast the other day, update completed, rebooted, and reiser thrashed her fs.....
[03:06] <malikeye> that's bad
[03:06] <lupine_85> SuSE are teh 3vil
[03:06] <kitche> Flick: that's why smart was made but anyways it's offtopic
[03:06] <malikeye> in fact I reinstalled 10 today and it almost did it again
[03:06] <Flick> well it worked 100% up to SUSE 10.0 butt dunno what they did in 10.1 it just crashes when installing programs
[03:06] <tossebear> how can I add ISO-8859-1 locales in edgy?
[03:07] <bulio> does edgy eft detect 2 CD-rom drives ok?
[03:07] <bulio> I have 2 CD-rom drives and 5.10 failed the install because of confusion with the drives
[03:07] <the_rick> Isn't Yast supposed to work in 10.2 now?
[03:07] <LineOf7s> builo:  It did okay on mine when I installed Edgy.
[03:07] <kitche> tossebear: dpkg-reconfigure locale perhaps not sure if it works on ubuntu some distros it will work on
[03:07] <Flick> i think so but im never going back to SUSE
[03:07] <malikeye> I don't know why it would get confused
[03:07] <bulio> although 4.10 worked fine because I could remove the install CD and put it into the otyher drive during install
[03:08] <the_rick> I'm trying out Ubuntu, but I'm having trouble getting used to this "no root" concept
[03:08] <tossebear> kitche: I thought so myself, but it just generates them  :(
[03:08] <malikeye> sudo -s H, the_rick
[03:08] <Flick> just use sudo command insted of root
[03:08] <malikeye> sorry... sudo -s -H
[03:09] <lupine_85> the_rick: it's a pain, wot? :p
[03:09] <lupine_85> especially when (note: when, not if) sudo breaks
[03:09] <Flick> i think Novell have stuffed up what linux is allabout
[03:09] <the_rick> I can handle sudo enough, but what about like logging into SWAT to administer samba?
[03:09] <malikeye> or just create a root password
[03:09] <arrenlex> malikeye: We're not supposed to recommend that.
[03:09] <lupine_85> arrenlex: it's a good backup
[03:09] <malikeye> didn't recommend it
[03:09] <malikeye> it's an option
[03:09] <Flick> lol
[03:10] <arrenlex> lupine_85: Sudo "breaks"? xD What?
[03:10] <sque> Hi! I have an old laptop (Gateway Solo 9500) with an ATI Mobility M4, and my screen work the most at 800x600 although it is capable for more. How can I change this? I am on Edgy (Full updated) and I am using the 'ati' driver.
[03:10] <the_rick> Is there anyway to do that?
[03:10] <Flick> i have set a password up for root just for if i eva need it
[03:10] <arrenlex> !fixres | sque

[03:10] <lupine_85> seriously. Change the date/time. change the hostname. Accidentally bork your permissions
[03:10] <LineOf7s> That reminds me:  My current Edgy install is 'broken' because I stupidly changed the permissions of /var/run/sudo.  I've seen solutions to use the 'recovery' CD to chroot in and change the permission back... but how do I access this 'recovery CD'?  I assume it's the Live/Install CD booted a different way somehow?
[03:10] <lupine_85> oh noes! sudo broke! I have to reboot to fix it!
[03:10] <lupine_85> LineOf7s: just the live CD
[03:11] <Flick> any body els think that Novell & Microsoft teaming up is bad
[03:11] <lupine_85> or load up your HD install in 'recovery mode'
[03:11] <kitche> LineOf7s: live cd at boot there is a rescue option
[03:11] <lupine_85> Flick: +1
[03:11] <bimberi> LineOf7s: recovery mode (a boot option)

[03:11] <ubotu> Flick: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:11] <the_rick> Flick: Is there a way to log into SWAT and administer shares without creating a root password?
[03:11] <Alakazamz0r> anyone ever set up a LDAP server?
[03:11] <cafuego_> yup
[03:11] <bimberi> !anyone
[03:11] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:11] <cafuego_> lots of people have
[03:11] <Alakazamz0r> well
[03:11] <Flick> i think sudo can do it
[03:11] <Aar0n444> Hi
[03:11] <lupine_85> but are any of them here..? L
[03:11] <Alakazamz0r> anyone here that feels like helping?
[03:11] <lupine_85> another thing sudo can't do - really stupid, this - is cd
[03:11] <LineOf7s> Oh.  THAT 'recovery mode'!  The one that lives happily in my GRUB list that I've never given a second thought to?   *slaps forehead*
[03:11] <Flick> sudo is like a mini root well thats how i think of sudo
[03:12] <Aar0n444> I'm trying to boot/ install Ubuntu, and I remember I had to have a boot option before, but I can't remember what it was.
[03:12] <jrib> lupine_85: sure it can
[03:12] <Aar0n444> Otherwise it doesn't boot
[03:12] <lupine_85> you can't sudo cd $some_dir
[03:12] <malikeye> did that bot just smack you Flick ?
[03:12] <bimberi> cafuego_: that's what I'm tempted to say to almost every "Anyone..." question :)
[03:12] <jrib> lupine_85: sudo -i
[03:12] <malikeye> sudo kill bot :)
[03:12] <lupine_85> lol
[03:12] <Dekaritae> Oki bai!
[03:12] <Flick> jrib lol
[03:12] <Markov> hello. can someone point me to documentation on how to boot from a flash memory stick?
[03:12] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: sudo apt-get install openldap
[03:13] <J-_> Just heard about cron jobs, and man do they looks handy =D
[03:13] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: it's not particularly hard :-)
[03:13] <lupine_85> so what's the difference between sudo -i and su root ?
[03:13] <Alakazamz0r> i know, its the configuration im having a problem with.
[03:13] <Alakazamz0r> well
[03:13] <Markov> i want to do something livecd-esque from a memory stick. can someone piont me in the right direction?
[03:13] <Alakazamz0r> its configured.
[03:13] <kitche> Markov: depends but you have to make sure your bios supports booting or make an entry in grub to do it for you
[03:13] <Flick> just install what eva linux on to the usb stick then ask your bios to boot from usb
[03:13] <coopster> ok.  cheap hard drive recovery take two - second replacement electronic board, courtesy of curcuit city.
[03:13] <lavid> where can i get the patchfile applied to the vanilla kernel to make it the 64bit kernel? I'm looking for the patchfile and not the patched sources. Thanks.
[03:13] <un_operateur> lupine_85, ones asking for your password -- another for roots
[03:13] <lupine_85> aside that the former is more likely to use a less-secure password :p
[03:13] <Alakazamz0r> im just trying to import email addresses into it so i can have my spam firewall authenticate against it.
[03:13] <Alakazamz0r> brb
[03:14] <jrib> lupine_85: sudo -i is equivalent to su -, su - isn't the same as su.  sudo -i will reset your environment variables
[03:14] <xenakis> what app should I use to scan?
[03:14] <cafuego_> xenakis: sane
[03:14] <Aar0n444> What boot parameters are there? Like acpi=off and stuff? i can't boot Ubuntu and I don't know what command I used to use
[03:14] <kitche> lavid: there is no patch file to make it 64bit you just tell what the processor you want the specialications in the kernel for
[03:14] <bimberi> lupine_85: why is a user password less secure than a root password?
[03:14] <lupine_85> xenakis: xsane
[03:14] <Alakazamz0r> ok back
[03:14] <lupine_85> because it's going to be used in more places, that's why :p
[03:14] <Markov> kitche: hmmm... so, assuming that my bios is okay with it, could i do a livecd-style boot from a memory stick?
[03:14] <foamyhead> Can anyone help me with 8.32.5 fglrx drivers
[03:14] <PORDO> why do i get this error when i run certain apps after upgrading to edgy? http://www.swedish.org/body.cfm?id=1621&action=detail&ref=229
[03:14] <malikeye> because users are usually less likely to not use their cats name :)
[03:14] <xenakis> cafuego, lupine_85: thanks
[03:14] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: you you want an ou that holds a list of email addresses?
[03:14] <lupine_85> my root password is a stupidly large size
[03:14] <Alakazamz0r> Dec 19 20:10:01 httlws80 slapd[4184] : conn=236 fd=18 ACCEPT from IP=127.0.0.1:48824 (IP=0.0.0.0:389)
[03:15] <kitche> Markov: yes if you install it to the usb
[03:15] <lupine_85> my user password isn't
[03:15] <Alakazamz0r> looks like its working, somewhat.
[03:15] <the_rick> Is it possible to administer samba with SWAT in Ubuntu?
[03:15] <J-_> !offtopic
[03:15] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:15] <Alakazamz0r> cafuego yes... in essence.
[03:15] <Flick> u get app errs cus they are meny for older ubuntu
[03:15] <Alakazamz0r> right now, our domain controller is win2003
[03:15] <Alakazamz0r> but it doesn't have the email addys on it
[03:15] <Flick> ment*
[03:15] <lavid> kitche: i'm looking to compile a kernel that doesn't have certain parts removed that seem to be removed in the 64bit ubuntu kernel
[03:15] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: I find it easiest to manage via phpldapadmin (I use that to handle the Windows domain too)
[03:15] <jrib> PORDO: what is this?
[03:15] <lupine_85> !kernel
[03:15] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[03:16] <lupine_85> what bits are removed?
[03:16] <PORDO> jrib ack!  wrong paste.  gnome-volume-control: symbol lookup error: gnome-volume-control: undefined symbol: __gst_debug_min
=== rexbron_ is now known as rexbron
[03:16] <PORDO> that's the error.
[03:16] <lupine_85> apart from the i386-specific bits :p
[03:16] <lavid> lupine_85: sonypi
[03:16] <Flick> a few bits are taken out thats why u carnt run all 32bit programs on it
[03:16] <jrib> PORDO: heh ok, I have no clue on that one
[03:16] <Alakazamz0r> cause the email server is a qmail server, and im trying to set up a way for the barracuda spam firewall to know what addresses to reject.
[03:16] <the_rick> No one using SWAT in here?
[03:16] <Flick> but i couldnt help with fixing that
[03:16] <Alakazamz0r> cafuego i have that installed, i cant get it to connect though.
[03:16] <bimberi> lupine_85: that just means _your_ user password is less secure than your root password
[03:17] <Flick> ture
[03:17] <lupine_85> yep - and it's bound to be a trensd
[03:17] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: did you give the spam firewall the correct login details and base dn to check for emails?
[03:17] <lupine_85> plus, if you have 10 users with sudo access, that's 10 different passwords with root permissions.... e.g. 10x the risk..
[03:17] <Alakazamz0r> i cant even log in to the phpldapadmin page right now
[03:17] <DigitalNinja> I'm trying to get software raid working. I went through the server install and everything seems ok. However, when the system boots it just does a reboot.
[03:17] <Flick> well sudo is not 100% full root
[03:17] <faeryNatsuki> hello boys
[03:18] <Flick> hey
[03:18] <DigitalNinja> I'm using grub
[03:18] <malikeye> Flick yes it is
[03:18] <the_rick> !SWAT
[03:18] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[03:18] <lupine_85> how much root must a root shell have if a root shell must be root?
[03:18] <faeryNatsuki> i'm using amarok, how can i use winamp skins with amarok?
[03:18] <Alakazamz0r> cafuego its like the server isnt running, but it obviously is in the syslogs.
[03:18] <lupine_85> if rm -rf works, what more does one need?
[03:18] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: does your slapd.conf have root login credentials?
[03:18] <Flick> no its not i tryed to reright the hole X server from scratch and when i put in sudo it sed enter root
[03:18] <malikeye> it's just that people that usually get sudo are single taskers not smart enough to know
[03:18] <Flick> sudo would not work
[03:18] <cld2> is there an easy way to disable my wlan card, I want to use my eth card while at my desk. something like right click disable in windows? thanks.
[03:18] <Alakazamz0r> cafuego that i dont know, let me check.
[03:18] <LucianSolaris> test
[03:18] <Alakazamz0r> you mean the slapd user?
[03:19] <DigitalNinja> can someone tell me if Dapper does software raid well
[03:19] <Alakazamz0r> or the user the daemon runs as?
[03:19] <Alakazamz0r> brb
[03:19] <malikeye> s/smart/knowledgable/
[03:19] <DigitalNinja> I've done software raid on CentOS and it workd fine. It's ubuntu that's giving me problems
[03:19] <malikeye> software raid works awesome
[03:19] <Flick> i would up grade to Edgy for raid
[03:19] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: nono, it should contain lines starting with 'rootdn' and 'rootpw'
[03:19] <malikeye> 1.2TB here :)
[03:19] <cafuego_> DigitalNinja: works fine for me[tm]  :-)
[03:19] <Alakazamz0r> sorry way too much lag.
[03:19] <Flick> Linux raid is no way as good as windows
[03:19] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: nono, it should contain lines starting with 'rootdn' and 'rootpw'
[03:20] <Alakazamz0r> hmm
[03:20] <malikeye> where's the bot when you need it ?
[03:20] <Alakazamz0r> right now phpldapadmin is saying it cant bind to the ldap server
[03:20] <Alakazamz0r> thatever that means.
[03:20] <cafuego_> Alakazamz0r: if not, you may want to purge the server config and reinstall it

[03:22] <Flick> if you what your screen rez bigger than 1024x768 type the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[03:22] <cafuego_> Oh you use dmraid? I'm unlikely to touch that with a ten foot pole
[03:22] <Flick> then select what u like but u can only pick three at a time
[03:22] <DigitalNinja> cafuego: Looks like i have a problem. Oh, I'm using LVM

[03:23] <un_operateur> !cloning | n2diy
[03:23] <ubotu> n2diy: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type "dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages", move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type "sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade"
[03:23] <Aggrav8d> question: what do i need to do so that mysql query browser can access the database on my server?
[03:24] <Aggrav8d> i already have the database running and a user account set up
[03:24] <malikeye> what is a mysql query browser ?
[03:24] <n2diy> un_operateur: ?
[03:25] <Flick> any of u guys tryed XGL or AiGLX
[03:25] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, are you getting errors? if so what are they?
[03:25] <Aggrav8d> malikeye it's a nice graphical app for surfing through databases.
[03:25] <un_operateur> n2diy, ?
[03:25] <LucianSolaris> ALL: i need an X.org expert, is there anyone here who claim to be such an expert?
[03:25] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - all i know is i can't connect.  i'm assuming the port isn't open, maybe?
[03:25] <malikeye> oh... it's a mysql product... hmm
[03:25] <Flick> what wrong with your x.org
[03:25] <Alakazamz0r> cafuego, how many variables should i have to configure
[03:25] <lupine_85> LucianSolaris: experts are few and far between, but ask your question and maybe someone will know )
[03:25] <Alakazamz0r> just where i put my host and domain names
[03:25] <Alakazamz0r> passwords and IP's right?
[03:26] <cld2> under Sysytem->Administration->Networking it says my wlan card is not configured yet it still gets an IP via dhcp. any ideas?

[03:26] <malikeye> is the DB on the same box as the browser ?
[03:26] <Aggrav8d> even though mysql claims to be running.  the db is not on the same box as the browser.
[03:26] <n2diy> un_operateur: What this, a language barrier? :)  I want all the files on this box, on the other box.

[03:29] <Alakazamz0r> thtas true

[03:29] <faeryNatsuki> but i want skins for amarok, where can i found some?
[03:29] <liberion> Red-Sox, did u install the ati-linux driver?
[03:29] <Alakazamz0r> Gnome has a new Amarok type app... but ... i forget what its called.
[03:29] <malikeye> yeah, it's a pig, but it has awesome features
[03:29] <lupine_85> faeryNatsuki: www.kde-look.org ?
[03:29] <malikeye> amarok doesn't really skin
[03:29] <n2diy> lupine_85: tarball my entire hard drive, that is an interesting idea.
[03:29] <malikeye> it just changes colors
[03:29] <faeryNatsuki> there are only themes for the navigation bar :(

[03:31] <Aar0n444> Help.
[03:31] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, well, does it connect??

[03:32] <lupine_85> nah, it's typical debian
[03:32] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - yes, it connects.  i can log in as root and view all the databases/tables

[03:32] <lupine_85> as usual, much better than the red hat approach; a bit worse than the gentoo approach
[03:32] <malikeye> the gentoo approach is horrible
[03:32] <malikeye> WAY over complicated
[03:33] <liberion> Red-Sox, some ati cards just use the radeon driver and add themselves to an dri group to get it to run

[03:33] <n2diy> I'm trying to get the latest version of Mondo working, and it is complaining about my version of libc6, as I understand it, you don't mess with libc6?
[03:33] <malikeye> redhat is kinda weird cause the gateway is the only thing that is in another file, granted I know why it's there, it's kinda weird to get used to
[03:33] <lupine_85> exactly 1 config file...
[03:33] <Aggrav8d> 10061
[03:33] <lupine_85> n2diy: pretty much :D

[03:33] <linucs> hi everybody
[03:34] <Flick> hey
[03:34] <lupine_85> changing libc6 is the fastest way to break your linux install that i know of

[03:35] <arrenlex> Aggrav8d: The free radeon driver.
[03:35] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: 3D alleceleration with my card
[03:35] <liberion> Red-Sox, was it working before?
[03:35] <Red-Sox> lupine_85: What are they called?
[03:35] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: What card?
[03:35] <Aggrav8d> arrenlex - ah.
[03:35] <Red-Sox> liberion: nope never
[03:35] <Flick> i use to have a ATI Radeon 9550 and the ATI drivers friom there site worked grate
[03:35] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: Radeon X1300 mobility
[03:36] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: Oh. You will need fglrx to get 3D accel on that, yes.
[03:36] <lupine_85> linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic - Non-free Linux 2.6.17 modules on x86_64 generic
[03:36] <liberion> Red-Sox, yes try the radeon driver just change it in xorg.conf to radeon
[03:36] <lupine_85> xorg-driver-fglrx - Video driver for ATI graphics accelerators
[03:36] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: Although the drivers in the repos should suffice.
[03:36] <Flick> i just find Nvidia card a lot better to work with in linux
[03:37] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: What's the package name?
[03:37] <slap_me> mmm
[03:37] <slap_me> heh
[03:37] <Red-Sox> liberion: So, where exactly is the xorg.conf?
[03:37] <J-_> Glad  I have a Nvidia Graphics Card then
[03:37] <arrenlex> !fglrx | Red-Sox
[03:37] <ubotu> Red-Sox: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:37] <p00h> anyone gotten Linksys Compact Wireless-G USB going?
[03:37] <arrenlex>  ^ Will tell you what you need to know.
[03:37] <Red-Sox> I've tried that like 453900894350935 times arrenlex
[03:37] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - so i'm thinking it's probably a default firewall or something that's giving me trouble.
[03:37] <Flick> your x org config should be in /etc/X11/
[03:37] <p00h> Red-Sox: is that approx?
[03:37] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: And what happen? Somebody set up us the bomb?
[03:37] <Red-Sox> p00h: No exact
[03:37] <Alakazamz0r> ok here's another... how can i set Thunderbird as my email client system wide?
[03:37] <p00h> nice
[03:38] <arrenlex> That quit message is SO what inspired fglrx.
[03:38] <arrenlex> How appropriate.
[03:38] <Flick> yes u can set Thunderbird up like that
[03:38] <Alakazamz0r> Flick, how?
[03:38] <Flick> i think u set it up sorta the same way as Firefox
[03:38] <liberion> Red-Sox, yes just change xorg.conf in the device section to "radeon"
[03:39] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, what was the error you were getting again?
[03:39] <Red-Sox> liberion: where is it located?
[03:39] <liberion> Red-Sox, the driver that is
[03:39] <Alakazamz0r> Flick, firefox set itself as default automaticaly.
[03:39] <malikeye> anybody use ubuntu on server class machines ?
[03:39] <Flick> i havnt used Thunderbird for younks on linux for like 2years now
[03:39] <n2diy> Alakazamz0r: system/prefrences/preferred apps.
[03:39] <DustOfTheEarth> no it is an old card   is working simply MEPIS witch automatically let me reconfig xserver
[03:39] <Alakazamz0r> and... it has an option for it to check to see if its the default.
[03:39] <lupine_85> malikeye: 2 machines
[03:39] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: I highly doubt radeon will give you 3D accel on X1300.
[03:39] <lupine_85> DAPPER :D
[03:39] <Alakazamz0r> malikeye, i have 2 ubuntu servers @ work.
[03:39] <malikeye> arch ?
[03:39] <Alakazamz0r> that re in production

[03:39] <liberion> Red-Sox, lol in your kernel modprobe radeon out of x to see if its there
[03:39] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - 10061, WSAECONNREFUSED, probably due to security settings.
[03:39] <lupine_85> one i385; the other amd64
[03:40] <Alakazamz0r> n2diy, checking
[03:40] <lupine_85> erm, i386 :)
[03:40] <slap_me> i am more than positive this question has been asked millions of times, but..how would i go about getting usb drivers for my surfboard modem in ubuntu?
[03:40] <Flick> yeah but go in to Thunderbird prefs and it should be in there to set as defult it was on the old thunderbirds
[03:40] <incognito> guys which c++ ide would you recommend that works well with ubuntu?
[03:40] <slap_me> = \
[03:40] <Alakazamz0r> freakin A thanks n2diy !!!
[03:40] <malikeye> I am talking server class machines... not servers in general... like are they quads with 8GB ram ?
[03:40] <malikeye> :)
[03:40] <n2diy> Alakazamz0r: nada
[03:40] <Alakazamz0r> :D
[03:40] <crowley1027> I have VCDgear and i don't know how to install it.
[03:40] <lupine_85> malikeye: one is a tri-opteron with many GB :p
[03:41] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, are you running the query browser locally or from another machine?
[03:41] <malikeye> lupine_85: nice
[03:41] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - another
[03:41] <un_operateur> n2diy, have you checked out apt-cacher yet?
[03:41] <lupine_85> (one of the CPUs failed recently. it /was/ a quad opteron)
[03:41] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - another within the network.
[03:41] <protoloco> if im using intel core duo, what family processor do i have to choose ? in the Config of my KERNEL ??
[03:41] <crowley1027> !vcd
[03:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vcd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:41] <crowley1027> !vcdgear
[03:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vcdgear - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:41] <malikeye> we've been testing power boxes at work
[03:41] <liberion> Red-Sox, as root (err sudo) did u /sbin/modprobe radeon
[03:41] <p00h> may I repeat a question I asked 2 min ago or will I get booted?
[03:41] <malikeye> works out of the box :)
[03:42] <malikeye> impressive, really
[03:42] <incognito> anyone? which c++ IDE would you recommend for ubuntu? I've tried kdevelop but ti doesn't seem to work correclty right out of the box,
[03:42] <Red-Sox> liberion: No.
[03:42] <Flick> just use standart intell family for any intellprocessor
[03:42] <bruenig> !info anjuta
[03:42] <liberion> Red-Sox, sudo /sbin/modprobe radeon
[03:42] <ubotu> anjuta: A GNOME development IDE, for C/C++. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.2-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1494 kB, installed size 3760 kB
[03:42] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, 10061, WSAECONNREFUSED on google tends to hint that the server is refusing connection -- that could be due to a firewall on the server or a socket error on your machine
[03:42] <n2diy> un_operateur: no not yet, I'll make a note to do so. I gotta go now.
[03:42] <incognito> ok thanks
[03:42] <Flick> works on my friends computer with his core 2
[03:42] <n2diy> 73 all
[03:42] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are Changelog, Credits, vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it) and vcdgear.cfg
[03:42] <liberion> Red-Sox, that turns it on
[03:42] <lupine_85> incognito: kdevelop works fine here
[03:42] <lupine_85> it rocks :)
[03:42] <lupine_85> does all the makefile wizardry for you and everything
[03:43] <Alakazamz0r> could someone tell me if they get a SSH reply from mikeking.bounceme.net
[03:43] <Alakazamz0r> that's my @ my house.
[03:43] <Alakazamz0r> where im at...
[03:43] <Red-Sox> liberion: http://pastebin.us/10303
[03:43] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, from the other box -- telnet mysql.server.name 3306    -- see if that connects you up
[03:43] <malikeye> yes
[03:43] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are Changelog, Credits, vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it) and vcdgear.cfg
[03:43] <liberion> Red-Sox, then in device section of xorg.conf change the driver to radeon
[03:43] <malikeye> that was a real bad thing to broadcast :)
[03:43] <Alakazamz0r> malikeye, was that a yes to me?
[03:43] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - right, i should have thought of that :)  one second....
[03:43] <Alakazamz0r> naah, im a hacker
[03:43] <Alakazamz0r> :D
[03:43] <Davo_Dinkum> How can I decompress .rar files under Edgy?
[03:43] <liberion> Red-Sox, are u doing this in a gui??
[03:43] <Red-Sox> liberion: How do I open the xorg.conf?
[03:44] <Alakazamz0r> Dave123, aptitude install unrar
[03:44] <incognito> I have tried both anjuta and kdev, however both are giving erros
[03:44] <Flick> Incognito: Download Automatix & install that its simple then that has same programs like IDE C++ u should like and it will download them for u and set it up
[03:44] <Red-Sox> liberion: Yeah
[03:44] <Alakazamz0r> Red-Sox, gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:44] <lupine_85> Davo_Dinkum: installl unrar
[03:44] <incognito> kdev gives the ugliest errors
[03:44] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: Firstly, why are you on a -386 kernel? You should be in generic. Secondly, I say again, I very highly doubt radeon supports x1300. Liberion, you might want to check it out properly before recommending it.
[03:44] <malikeye> hows the weather in houston ? :)
[03:44] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - could not connect on 3306.  connection failed.
[03:44] <lupine_85> then use ark or file-roller or unrar e <file>
[03:44] <incognito> thanks guys
[03:44] <Davo_Dinkum> lupine_85: What license is that under?
[03:44] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are Changelog, Credits, vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it) and vcdgear.cfg
[03:44] <lupine_85> that one is non-free
[03:44] <Alakazamz0r> file-roller is better in my eyes
[03:44] <lupine_85> there's unrar-free though
[03:44] <Flick> its ok
[03:44] <lupine_85> !unrar
[03:44] <ubotu> unrar is rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression  There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[03:44] <liberion> ok add a line to /etc/modules add radeon to it
[03:44] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - as i said before, it was listen off in netstat, i thought that might mean the port was closed.
[03:44] <lupine_85> !unrar-free
[03:44] <ubotu> unrar-free: Unarchiver for .rar files. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:0.0.1+cvs20060609-1 (edgy), package size 17 kB, installed size 80 kB
[03:45] <asusathlon> hi iwas wondering if anyone can help me with xdvdshrink problem? Iwas able to change it from rpm to deb and install it but when i hit the start copy it pops up for a second and then dies with no error message?
[03:45] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: You're saying my card (with 128MB onboard) doesn't support 3D accel?
[03:45] <malikeye> Red-Sox: is it ATI ?
[03:45] <Flick> i dont use rar files at all onlinux
[03:45] <Red-Sox> malikeye: yes
[03:45] <lupine_85> me neither :D
[03:45] <malikeye> then barely
[03:45] <Flick> cuz there just as bad a zip files
[03:45] <lupine_85> bz2 is your friend
[03:45] <liberion> arrenlex, why wouldnt radeon support x1300 it has supported higher cards
[03:45] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, no, that "off" doesnt pertain to the state
[03:45] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are Changelog, Credits, vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it) and vcdgear.cfg
[03:45] <crowley1027> how do i run VCDgear?
[03:45] <Flick> yep bz2 or tar
[03:46] <lupine_85> or both
[03:46] <lupine_85> tar.bz2 :)
[03:46] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - ah.
[03:46] <Flick> lol yeah both
[03:46] <malikeye> you will probably get 3d, but probably bad performance
[03:46] <lupine_85> fglrx should work...
[03:46] <malikeye> for games, etc
[03:46] <asusathlon> i believe the problem may have to do with the config of my dvd drive?
[03:46] <lupine_85> at the risk of the FSF hunting you down and covering you in feathers :p
[03:46] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: Of course not. I am saying that the free, open-source radeon driver will not give you 3D.
[03:46] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - so i'm being blocked from the outside but presumably when i "mysql -u root -p" and connect it is doing it through 3306, yes?
[03:46] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are Changelog, Credits, vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it) and vcdgear.cfg       how do I run/install VCDgear?
[03:46] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, now i get it -- you need to enable mysql-server to listen on address 0.0.0.0 instead of only to 127.0.0.1
[03:46] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: Okay
[03:47] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: Any drivers that _would_?
[03:47] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - any idea how?
[03:47] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, you'll need to edit /etc/mysql/my.cf
[03:47] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are Changelog                    Credits                     vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it)                               vcdgear.cfg                                   how do I run/install VCDgear?
[03:47] <|rt|> anyone know where you set the reset x server keyboard shortcut?
[03:47] <arrenlex> liberion: radeon wouldn't support 3D acceleration because as far as I know, it only supports < RV370=9600=X300. My own card just started working with it in one of the most recent releases, and it is X300.
[03:47] <slicky_> hey.. anyone here who in to wifi and ubuntu?
[03:47] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: fglrx would.
[03:47] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - change the bind address?
[03:47] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, and change the entry -- bind-address to 0.0.0.0 -- and then restart mysql-server -- i think it is  /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[03:48] <|rt|> somehow it got remapped to shift backspace on my laptop which is too easy to hit
[03:48] <Flick> i just dont like the ATI card when using linux
[03:48] <slicky_> Im Running an Atheros Based Chipset Wireless card  Im Trying to set the Mode on the Atheros card to "Monitor" mode when i Execute  iwconfig ath0 mode monitor  I get the following Error:  Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06) : SET failed on device ath0 ; Invalid argument.  Any advice would be great
[03:48] <Red-Sox> arrenlex: Does it have a name?
[03:48] <LineOf7s> !offtopic
[03:48] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:48] <arrenlex> Red-Sox: does what have a name?
[03:48] <crowley1027> i have VCDgear, but the only files in the main folder are                       Changelog                    Credits                     vcdgear (diamond shape icon with gears in it)                               vcdgear.cfg                                   how do I run/install VCDgear?
[03:48] <malikeye> fglrx
[03:49] <Flick> maybe now ATI are owned by AMD they will maybe do some good linux drivers
[03:49] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - found it.  comment out the bind-address line in my.cnf and it will listen to more than just the localhost
[03:49] <crowley1027> !who | LineOf7s
[03:49] <ubotu> LineOf7s: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say, or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[03:49] <Red-Sox> malikeye: package not found
[03:49] <asusathlon> anyone experience this shutdown problem with xdvdshrink?
[03:49] <lupine_85> Flick: nah :(
[03:49] <malikeye> hmm... sorry I use nvidia cards... usually packages are labeled with fglrx
[03:49] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, no dude -- change it to 0,0.0.0
[03:49] <LineOf7s> crowley1027:  Thanks - but I was doing it for myself to find the name of the #ubuntu-offtopic channel so I might join it.  :o)
[03:49] <un_operateur> 0.0.0.0 *
[03:49] <crowley1027> oh :)
[03:49] <Aggrav8d> why 0.0.0.0:* instead?
[03:49] <liberion> Red-Sox, u must add your self to the dri group
[03:50] <liberion> Red-Sox, you are part of the video group correct?
[03:50] <Flick> lupine: maybe good drivers could come for ATI but then i think ATI think there Linux drivers are better than Nvidias
[03:50] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, because thats the address of INADDR_ANY -- the socket that daemons listen to if they need to be connectable to from anywhere
[03:50] <Sir_Lewk> anyone know anything about getting a 'ATI Rage Pro Turbo AGP' working in ubuntu?
[03:50] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - yeah, that's the same as commenting the line out completely.
[03:51] <crowley1027> !who |all
[03:51] <ubotu> all: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say, or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[03:51] <arrenlex> Flick: ATI's drivers are just slightly better than creating all your images manually with etch-a-sketch. Just slightly.
[03:51] <malikeye> haha
[03:51] <Davo_Dinkum> I tried using unrar-free, it just said "Extracting [filename]  failed"
[03:52] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, did you read the comment on the line before?
[03:52] <cld2> I need help with bluetooth. If I do hidd --server hidd --search it will find my mouse and work but it doesnt working using the hcid thats started via /etc/init.d/bluetooth. any ideas? I really dont know whats going on with bluetooth. anything will help im sure. thanks.
[03:52] <Flick> arrenlex: i have all ways used ATI graphics and after having driver problems or getting them to work i would have bugs all the time i got my 1st Nvidia card and OMG it just works no problems at all
[03:53] <Red-Sox> liberion: ?
[03:53] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, and it's not 0.0.0.0:* -- just 0.0.0.0
[03:53] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - now i'm getting rejections because it doesn't want to let my ip connect.
[03:53] <Sasa> Hello All
[03:53] <Flick> hello
[03:53] <Sasa> I was rioting last night because it was my first Linux install ever
[03:54] <Sasa> well
[03:54] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, well, what did you do??
[03:54] <Sasa> I have a simple question
[03:54] <Aggrav8d> Sasa - tipping over cars?  setting fires?
[03:54] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - i tried it your way and mine.
[03:54] <Flick> Sasa: how did you find the install
[03:54] <malikeye> Aggrav8d: that's what I was thinkin
[03:54] <asusathlon> can someone who knows about xdvdshrink let me know how to fix this problem?
[03:54] <Davo_Dinkum> The extraction might have failed because the file names are way too long. Is it possible to rename the files in the .rar file?
[03:54] <Aggrav8d> now i get 1130, host 'a.b.c.d' is not allowed to connect.
[03:54] <Aggrav8d> i'll google it
[03:54] <xenakis> I have a mem48u usb scanner which isn't working with xsane. Xsane is saying there are no scanning devices. What should I try?
[03:55] <Davo_Dinkum> They are all PDF documents
[03:55] <Sasa> I cannot play MP3 files that I dragged from my windows partition because I "don't have a decoder" in Rhythmbox 0.9.6
[03:55] <liberion> hey guys in ubuntu is the user already a member of the video group?
[03:55] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, I just tried it on my machine -- seems to work fine
[03:55] <fit4lfe_> has anyone tried to play ts files on vlc or mplayer yet
[03:55] <un_operateur> Aggrav8d, you sure the server has no firewall running?
[03:56] <Sasa> well, I called mr. Gates and told him to shove it
[03:56] <Aggrav8d> un_operateur - i haven't set one up (yet)
[03:56] <Sasa> I wouldn't really call that a riot
[03:56] <liberion> im not using ubuntu so i dont know if user is already added to the video group are they?
[03:56] <malikeye> Aggrav8d: iptables --list empty ?
[03:56] <Sasa> but then I got really pissed and I set a car on fire
[03:56] <Aggrav8d> malikeye - looks to be
[03:57] <Flick> Sasa: i take it u are using ubuntu so go to getautomatix.com and install Auto Matix and after that is installed just go in to it and click what u whant to download like the Cods for playing MP3's and DvD's
[03:57] <Sasa> anyways, anyone know how I can install MP3 decoder for Rhythmbox 0.9.6
[03:57] <LineOf7s> wot Flick sed
[03:57] <Sasa> thank you flick

[03:57] <Flick> Sasa: its ok any time
[03:58] <LineOf7s> ...ando now Sasa can make an informed decision.
[03:58] <malikeye> we must all keep in mind that the beauty of linux lies in it's command line! ( as we all clickety click and scroll )

[03:59] <crowley1027> Why is it that when i shut down ubuntu, it goes thru the shutdown thing...then it just has a blank UBUNTU logo screen
[03:59] <crowley1027> with a bar that has no color in it (such as the scroll bar in bootup that has an orange scroll)
[03:59] <LineOf7s> Sasa:  Well at least I brought your attention to it.  :o)
[03:59] <malikeye> crowley1027: acpi problems ?
[04:00] <Sasa> sure did
[04:00] <crowley1027> malikeye: how do i check
[04:00] <malikeye> it's not shutting down ?
[04:00] <Sasa> thank you 7
[04:00] <bimberi> crowley1027: so it doesn't power off?
[04:00] <crowley1027> nope
[04:00] <Sasa> I didn't get it though
[04:00] <crowley1027> bimberi: nope

[04:00] <malikeye> you need to search for acpi and shutdown
[04:00] <Sasa> so my driver is fine
[04:00] <Flick> Auto matix is only good for Ubuntu 6.06 or later
[04:00] <coopster> =/
[04:00] <Sasa> is just the MP3 decoder
[04:00] <crowley1027> also, when i hit ALT + CTRL + F1 it goes ballistic.
[04:00] <LineOf7s> np Sasa.
[04:00] <bimberi> crowley1027: yes, as malikeye is saying (but not using your nick)

[04:01] <Sasa> it got 6.1-

=== malikeye is now known as malikeye|noob
[04:01] <newbuntu> feisty fawn
[04:01] <Flick> Sasa: if u are going to use Auyo Matix u better have 6.06 ot 6.10 installed
[04:01] <Flick> Auto*
[04:01] <LineOf7s> Yes, it's the decoder you need.  That's what Flick was referring you to Automatix for.  Bear in mind though, if it breaks your installation, you'll be in trouble.  It's worked for many people though - you may or may not be one of them.
[04:01] <Sasa> I don't want to use it unless I really really have to
[04:01] <Flick> or*
[04:01] <crowley1027> bimberi: is there any total diagnostic that i can run for my system?

[04:02] <crowley1027> malikeye: is there any total diagnostics tool i can run to check my system?
[04:02] <LineOf7s> Sasa:  Automatix isn't a media player - it's a script that downloads a bunch of not-necessarily-open codecs and applications you may want and/or need.
[04:02] <bimberi> crowley1027: not an all-encompassing one - that i know of
[04:02] <|rt|>  DigitalNinja: i'm running on a machine at work....not under ubuntu but I may be able to answer your questions
[04:02] <malikeye> crowley1027: dunno what that really means
[04:02] <bimberi> newbuntu: sh file.sh
[04:02] <LineOf7s> Sasa:  Downloading the codec for mp3 will let you play mp3s in Rhythm Box.
[04:02] <Flick> Sasa: i use it to install what i need what i need to get the system up and running like Audio cods and dvd cods works just fine never had a problem with it at all
[04:02] <newbuntu> dont let automatix freeze while installing... it gets broken
[04:02] <jvai> sum1 made a "linux mint" distro.. it's ubuntu 6.10, but with all the restricted stuff. i managed to get the "barbara" linux mint installed, since then, they  took the blue ubuntu logo off of the menu icon
[04:02] <crowley1027> malikeye: checking every aspect of the original install to see if there were any problems.

[04:03] <crowley1027> bimberi: is there a diagnostic that i can check core system files to see if \anything is corupt?

[04:16] <cymuHep> where i can get ATI driver for my card? :)
[04:16] <LineOf7s> cymuHelp:  OpenGL is the alternative to Direct3D.  It doesn't address all the other aspects of DirectX (DirectShow, DirectDraw, DirectPlay etc etc).  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
[04:16] <h0ndaracer2> thats what it gave me
[04:16] <Flick> if a game lets u use OpenGl all ways use it i find it runs better thah DX
[04:16] <cld2> cymuHep: dont bother, the binary version is broken for now.
[04:16] <Flick> bye guys#
[04:16] <cymuHep> :(
[04:16] <jeffm515> w32codecs -- for mplayer?
[04:16] <LineOf7s> cld2:  Depends how 'religious' you are, I guess.  It's a 'closed' and propietary format.  It's not free (as in speech).  That bothers some (many?) people.  I am not one of them (yet).
[04:17] <cymuHep> i need openGL i need driver for ATI graphic card.. :/
[04:17] <arrenlex> jeffm515: w32codecs are w32codecs. For anything. If you have the package installed, mplayer will find them.
[04:17] <noelferreira> arrenlex: http://pastebin.ca/285884
[04:17] <jeffm515> It won't play streaming video off the web, just gives me the mplayer splash
[04:17] <cld2> LineOf7s: yeah. I hear you on that. im having a hard time where I draw the line. I used to be a fan of RMS and his way of computing but it just gets to be so much of a hassle.
[04:18] <cld2> cymuHep: if you want to try the binary drivers here is the howto https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[04:18] <arrenlex> jeffm515: With mozilla-mplayer?
[04:18] <jeffm515> yup
[04:18] <jeffm515> arrenlex:  I'm totally lost
[04:18] <daftvader> Does anyone know how to change the font size for the gdm?
[04:19] <cymuHep> so what about to getting ATI and OpenGL? Where?
[04:19] <daftvader> I mean the GDM login screen?
[04:19] <daftvader> It is so tiny
[04:19] <arrenlex> cymuHep: You were answered.
[04:19] <noelferreira> did you see the pastebin arrenlex? it was working fine. but now i installed new ati drivers and a got that error
[04:19] <arrenlex> noelferreira: Why did you do this if it was working fine? =P
[04:19] <cld2> I need help with /etc/init.d/bluetooth I cant seem to get hidd started. if I do hidd --server hidd -search from the cli it works but wont hold that config after a reboot. ideas?
[04:19] <LineOf7s> cld2:  If there's an OSS alternative that works just as well (or near-as-dammit), I'll go with that and be happy about it.  If not, I'll use whatever I need to in order to get the functionality I'm used to and/or need.  I might personally love .oggs with a passion, but no-one else I know has heard of them.  mp3 is a necessary evil (in a very loose usage of the term 'necessary').
[04:19] <arrenlex> jeffm515: Does this work? http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/menu.html?f=test.mpg
[04:20] <noelferreira> because there where new drivers. so i thought it were better
[04:20] <lupine_85> .mp3 is patented, but that doesn't make it evil :p
[04:20] <jeffm515> nope
[04:20] <jeffm515> arrenlex: nope
[04:20] <shogunx> software patents are a joke anyway
[04:20] <LineOf7s> lupine:  Depends who you ask.  :o)
[04:20] <cld2> LineOf7s: yeah true. when I can find flac or other lossless i will rip down to ogg. but you just dont find anything in ogg. :( and converting from mp3 to ogg = shite.
[04:20] <arrenlex> LineOf7s: Actually, to my vast surprise I found that ALL my totally computer-n00b friends on Windows XP who don't know the location of the control panel can play .ogg files.
[04:20] <noelferreira> lupine_85: can you help me with my XFree86-DRI problem?
[04:20] <coopster> arrenlex:  can play != has heard of them
[04:21] <arrenlex> coopster: fair enough.
[04:21] <lupine_85> noelferreira: if the dri extension is loaded, I don't know what else to suggest
[04:21] <arrenlex> jeffm515: But mplayer can play movies generally?
[04:21] <lupine_85> I'm not an ATi user
[04:21] <LineOf7s> arrenlex:  I put it to you something they've installed has enabled that capability without them even knowing.  :o)

[04:21] <GigaClon> anyone know why I would be sent to a page called adt.asp, it does this on many different websites including ones that don't run asp
[04:22] <h0ndaracer2> any help for me
[04:22] <noelferreira> how can i be sure if it is loaded lupine_85? i guess reinstaling new drivers broke up some links.
[04:22] <cld2> GigaClon: whats the url
[04:22] <arrenlex> LineOf7s: One had VLC for some reason. The other had winamp, I think.
[04:22] <lupine_85> noelferreira: check Xorg.0.log
[04:22] <GigaClon> it happends on many urls
[04:22] <jeffm515> arrenlex: yes..
[04:22] <noelferreira> ok
[04:22] <jeffm515> arrenlex: I'm wondering. what about wmv 's
[04:22] <GigaClon> no particular site does it, which is the weird part
[04:22] <arrenlex> jeffm515: What about them? Try one.
[04:22] <GigaClon> and it doesn't happend all the time
[04:22] <jeffm515> arrenlex: I just did..
[04:22] <arrenlex> And?
[04:23] <LineOf7s> arrenlex:  Just having VLC on their computer puts them beyond 'n00b', surely?  But I digress.
[04:23] <jeffm515> arrenlex: just gives me the splash
[04:23] <cld2> any hidd hcid bluetooth experts around?
[04:23] <jeffm515> arrenlex: and I get audio.. just not video
[04:23] <arrenlex> jeffm515: Then you don't have w32codecs.
[04:23] <jeffm515> arrenlex: and to install them? :)
[04:23] <J-_> Waht package do I need to install to play mp4's in xmms?

[04:28] <jeffm515> arrenlex: okay, now no video OR audio
[04:28] <cld2> CaptainDoom: put your xorg.conf file up on a paste bin and let me take a look. ill show you.
[04:29] <arrenlex> jeffm515: What's the output of " ls /usr/lib/win32/ | wc -l "?
[04:29] <noelferreira> arrenlex: i don't use aiglx but glx
[04:29] <jeffm515> arrenlex: 130
[04:30] <arrenlex> noelferreira: jeffm515: run the mplayer command from the command line for that file. Pastebin all the output.
[04:30] <arrenlex> noelferreira: I don't have it in my xorg.conf but it appears. I don't think it's related to what you run, it's just there.

[04:30] <cld2> cymuHep: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[04:30] <ubotu> cymuHep: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:31] <noelferreira> so what shoul i do arrenlex?
[04:31] <cymuHep> where i can get ATI drivers?
[04:31] <jeffm515> um..
[04:31] <arrenlex> cymuHep: You were answered.
[04:31] <arrenlex> Twice.
[04:31] <cld2> several times
[04:31] <Fastly> anyone here know how to mount a windows shared folder from my laptop onto my ubuntu desktop/
[04:31] <cymuHep> where i didnt see
[04:31] <cymuHep> :(
[04:31] <cld2> cymuHep: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[04:31] <cymuHep> thnx
[04:31] <arrenlex> ...
[04:32] <jeffm515> okay, gimme the command again?
[04:32] <cld2> Fastly: from the "places" go to either network servers or connect to server
[04:32] <jeffm515> that you want the output for
[04:32] <arrenlex> cld2: Did that exchange also physically hurt you? Or is it just me?
[04:32] <jeffm515> arrenlex: cld2: I'm in pain
[04:32] <the_rick> How do you log in to SWAT with Administration priveledges in Ubuntu?
[04:32] <LineOf7s> Can I use VMplayer to use the Windows installation on my dual-boot machine, or do I need to install Windows from scratch into the virtual machine?
[04:32] <cld2> arrenlex: yeah, my back and head are a little melty I also gave him that same link at 7:19
[04:32] <seamus7> Hi... I just installed linux-restricted-modules-386 .... but now when my computer starts I have two kernels listed: generic and 386 ... I wasn't expecting this ... can I uninstall one? which?
[04:32] <noelferreira> lupine_85: did you saw my Xorg.log ?
[04:33] <arrenlex> cld2: Yes, I remember !fglrx-ing him earlier as well.
[04:33] <the_rick> The only solution I have found is to give the root user a password and I'm trying to buy into this whole sudo thing
[04:33] <jeffm515> arrenlex:  okay, so mplayer ls /usr/lib/win32/ | wc -l  -?
[04:33] <arrenlex> seamus7: uninstall -386. -generic is newer.
[04:33] <arrenlex> jeffm515: No.
[04:33] <cld2> arrenlex: I need some hand holding for the gui ish things like bluetooth and such but I at least try to read what im being told. ;)
[04:33] <arrenlex> jeffm515: Use the mplayer command on your .wmv file. i.e. "mplayer <file.wmv>". Pastebin all output.
[04:33] <seamus7> arrenlex: ok thx ... so i should then install the generic version of the linux-restricted-modules?
[04:34] <cld2> seamus7: there is really no need to uninstall old kernels. you can only use one at a time.
[04:34] <jeffm515> okay, it's a streaming video file, from the web..
[04:34] <arrenlex> seamus7: Yes.
[04:34] <jeffm515> inbedded in a table..
[04:34] <noelferreira> arrenlex: what should i do to fix that problem?
[04:34] <PORDO> how can i remove a package without removing the packages that depend on it?
[04:34] <arrenlex> noelferreira: Downgrade? Google? I have no idea, I've never seen that error before. Sorry. = /
[04:34] <noelferreira> ok
[04:34] <arrenlex> PORDO: dpkg --remove --force-depends=<package> package
[04:35] <arrenlex> PORDO: dpkg --remove --force-depends=<package> <package>
[04:35] <tritium> PORDO: that's not the best idea
[04:35] <seamus7> cld2: well I just installed the older kernel by mistake and it now is the default OS that boots if I don't choose the generic or WXP ... but it's good to know it won't cause any problems thanks
[04:35] <Fastly> cld2: it's showing the name of my laptop (wideboy) but when i click the link it says "The location is not a folder.".
[04:35] <Fastly> any idea?
[04:35] <jeffm515> arrenlex: what the heck: it'll play when I use the direct url... but not in firefox
[04:35] <PORDO> Tristan well, somehow my libgstreamer is messed up.
[04:35] <arrenlex> PORDO: Actually, only one package in that, sorry. dpkg --remove --force-depends <package>
[04:35] <PORDO> things that depend on it complain that they can't find some symbol.
[04:36] <zspada15_> 0.o
[04:36] <zspada15_> o.0
[04:36] <cld2> Fastly: your laptop is the windows box with a windows share?
[04:36] <the_rick> Anyone using SWAT?
[04:36] <Fastly> yes
[04:36] <PORDO> maybe there's a better way here.
[04:36] <the_rick> Bueller?
[04:36] <arrenlex> PORDO: Then reinstall it directly.
[04:36] <arrenlex> PORDO: apt-get install --reinstall <package>
[04:36] <cld2> Fastly: can you connect to it from another windows box?
[04:36] <PORDO> arrenlex ah!
[04:36] <LineOf7s> seamus:  If it's the default, and you don't want it to be, you'll want to change your GRUB menu.lst - are you familiar with how to do that?
[04:36] <Fastly> i don't have another windows box here...
[04:36] <arrenlex> jeffm515: That's a different issue. Go to about:config in Firefox and pastebin the whole page.
[04:36] <Fastly> i can in the office...
[04:36] <jeffm515> okay...
[04:37] <PORDO> crap..that didn't fix it. :(
[04:37] <cld2> seamus7: you could also edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst and change the default from 0, I assume to the associated kernel you want to use.
[04:37] <PORDO> apt-get install --reinstall
[04:37] <PORDO> oops
[04:37] <arrenlex> PORDO: what's the whole error?
[04:37] <jeffm515> where do I find the about:config?
[04:37] <PORDO> thoggen: symbol lookup error: thoggen: undefined symbol: __gst_debug_min
[04:37] <cld2> Fastly: is they share wide open or user or ip resitriced?
[04:37] <arrenlex> cld2: At this point, isn't it actually easier to remove the 386 kernel?
[04:37] <Fastly> ahh... it's a firewall issue
[04:37] <PORDO> rhythmbox: symbol lookup error: rhythmbox: undefined symbol: __gst_debug_min
[04:37] <Fastly> fixed
[04:37] <LineOf7s> See?  cld2 said almost exactly what I did, so it must be right.  ;o)
[04:37] <PORDO> edgy is killing me.
[04:37] <jeffm515> arrenlex: where do I find the about:config ?
[04:37] <seamus7> Lineof7's: once I uninstall the 386 only my generic will remain as it did just a couple minutes ago ... it will then be the default OS ....... I assume.
[04:37] <arrenlex> PORDO: That is probably because the gstreamer API changed when you upgraded versions but rhythmbox doesn't know about it.
[04:37] <arrenlex> jeffm515: Type it into the address bar.
[04:37] <PORDO> nm -D /usr/lib/libgstreamer-0.10.so|grep __gst_debug_min
[04:38] <PORDO> nm: '/usr/lib/libgstreamer-0.10.so': No such file
[04:38] <the_rick> so no one in here is using SWAT? What are you using?  Just config samba by hand?
[04:38] <LineOf7s> seamus:  If you really wanna uninstall it... you sure you want to?  Are you that short on space?
[04:39] <seamus7> Linof7s: not short on space but I literally just intalled it by mistake ... do you think it could cause problems uninstalling it?
[04:39] <h0ndaracer2> how come when i go to pages in my firefox it exits out of it
[04:39] <h0ndaracer2> ?>
[04:39] <cld2> arrenlex, LineOf7s: just preference I always like having an 'old reliable' kernel to fall back on. but i think changing the default from 0 to 1 is easier then backing out an older kernel.
[04:39] <h0ndaracer2> like closes the whole browser down
[04:39] <arrenlex> seamus7: You can uninstall it without problems. Just make sure you're not running it when you remove it. :)
[04:39] <seamus7> Lineof7s: I would be uninstalling Linux-restricted-modules-386 to be exact.
[04:40] <seamus7> arrenlex: yeah thx ... I started to uninstall it and then realized that's what I'm currently logged into  .... thanks for the reminder though.l
[04:40] <arrenlex> cld2: When I upgrade to a newer kernel, I keep the old one until I am certain my machine boots and functions fine. Then I remove the old one.
[04:40] <cld2> seamus7: aptitude seems pretty smart about pulling out kernels. Ive never had a problem
[04:40] <arrenlex> cld2: I have never had a problem with a kernel except one I compiled myself when I was a n00b and had no idea when I was doing.
[04:40] <cld2> arrenlex: so you only run with one kernel in /boot after you are done testing?
[04:40] <arrenlex> seamus7: It'll tell you, don't worry.
[04:40] <seamus7> cld2: thx
=== Vich|Away is now known as Scobbledok
[04:40] <arrenlex> cld2: Yes, I have only one kernel on my machine.
[04:40] <cld2> and it sounds like neither has arrenlex.
[04:41] <arrenlex> cld2: Like neither what has what, sorry?

[04:41] <cld2> arrenlex: I guess I need to drop my gentoo ish ways. im used to having shit just hit the fan in a major way and an older working kernel is nice to have.

[04:42] <holycow> excellent article
[04:42] <cld2> arrenlex: oh telling seamus7 that you regularly remove your old kernels with no problems
[04:42] <holycow> that should be in the topic on the bot

Is there a way to tell the OS that it isn't in fact writeprotected? Or is that something the hardware is enforcing for some reason? (this is on vmware)
[04:50] <thedoors> I have installed xgl/compiz on my ubuntu and i have gnome
[04:50] <borat> hey, does anyone know where to find a font called luxi sans???!!!
[04:50] <thedoors> thing is , i don't know how to configure it , and i don't know what is that "super" key
[04:51] <hugh-1> jagshemash
[04:51] <newbuntu> hello all, i'm still having troubles installing any .sh file , i'm going to the directory , typing as root  sh /Desktop/cedega_timedemo_installer
[04:51] <newbuntu>   and I get Cannot create target directory /tmp/selfgz67883797
[04:51] <thedoors> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=luxi+sans&btnG=Google+Search
[04:51] <arrenlex> maebmij: root partition has the switch "on errors, remount read-only". If it is remounting read-only, I assume it is because you are getting errors.
[04:51] <newbuntu> no matter what .sh file i try to install
[04:51] <thedoors> I have installed xgl/compiz on my ubuntu and i have gnome
[04:51] <thedoors> thing is , i don't know how to configure it , and i don't know what is that "super" key
[04:51] <linuxeatswindows> thats the windows key I think
[04:51] <victor__> thanks a lot. Looks right
[04:51] <arrenlex> maebmij: Observe the fstab line: /dev/sda5       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
[04:51] <arrenlex> maebmij: See?
[04:51] <jvai> linuxatswindows: i think it has alot to do w/ when msn joined yahoo's IM service.. my msn IM doesnt disconnect as much on gaim 1.5, but it does @ tymes still
[04:52] <mebaran151> macbook users out there?
[04:52] <mebaran151> and why would hal scripts interfere with hibernation or sleep
[04:52] <maebmij> arrenlex: cool, ok... but does that explain the fact that mount refuses to remount rw, even when explicity told to?
[04:52] <arrenlex> maebmij: How are you telling it to?
[04:52] <cymuHep> :/
[04:52] <newbuntu> no matter what sh file I try to install I always get the same error   cannot create /tmp/selfgz67883797

[04:53] <arrenlex> newbuntu: What's the output of "mkdir /tmp/foo"? As normal user.
[04:53] <maebmij> arrenlex: like this: mount -o remount -n -w /dev/sda1
[04:53] <arrenlex> maebmij: And what happen?
[04:53] <newbuntu> says  Segmentation fault
[04:54] <maebmij> arrenlex: the response from mount is: "mount: block device /dev/sda1 is write-protected but explicit `-w' flag given"
[04:54] <genii> foo would be created unless the parent dir was not owned by that user in which case you get something like "you do not have proper priveleges" or similar
[04:54] <asubedi> are any of the lisp gtk+ binding available in ubuntu? (searching in synaptic did not help)
[04:55] <newbuntu> arrenlex  says segment fault
[04:55] <javiolo> hi
[04:55] <arrenlex> newbuntu: ....really now.
[04:55] <newbuntu> segmentaion fault actually
[04:55] <arrenlex> newbuntu: That means your system is pretty darn screwed up.
[04:55] <bruenig> Segmentation fault is a good thing, no?
[04:55] <AfterDeath> no
[04:56] <zspada15_> arrenlex: what is a segmentation fault?
[04:56] <arrenlex> bruenig: It's fantastic when you don't want anything to work!
[04:56] <newbuntu> now im worried
[04:56] <AfterDeath> a segmentation fault is when a program has a major error
[04:56] <arrenlex> zspada15_: It's when you try to access memory in an illegal manner.
[04:56] <mebaran151> a segfault is a program error
[04:56] <AfterDeath> such that the OS kills it
[04:56] <lupine_85> zspada15_: where memory tries to access a memory segment it shouldn't
[04:56] <newbuntu> .sh files used to be easy to install wah wah
[04:56] <zspada15_> newbuntu: is this a new machine?
[04:56] <lupine_85> a stupid coder, essentially
[04:56] <javiolo> some help with NFS this is my /etc/exports   -> /home/javier/shared 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0(rw,async,insecure,all_squash,anonuid =1000,anongid=1000)    I get syntax error
[04:56] <newbuntu> newish install
[04:56] <mebaran151> do we still use memory management with segments?
[04:56] <arrenlex> zspada15_: For example: int i; i = "Hello"; <--- segfault
[04:56] <mebaran151> I thought that was an antiquated idea
[04:56] <lupine_85> mebaran151: virtual segments
[04:56] <arrenlex> zspada15_: Another way to cause it is to try to write to read-only memory.
[04:56] <zspada15_> neil_edgy: the hardware?
[04:56] <mebaran151> ah
[04:56] <newbuntu> yes 1 to 2 year old machine
[04:56] <zspada15_> arrenlex: like kernel memory?
[04:56] <lupine_85> each program has a "segment" of memory it can access
[04:57] <arrenlex> mebaran151: It's old terminology that has stuck around despite not applying anymore.
[04:57] <lupine_85> but the kernel doesn't have to load pages, etc
[04:57] <mebaran151> arrenlex: that wouldn't even compile; you'd would need to make an error with malloc and free or something, or do some shifty pointer math
[04:57] <PORDO> can anyone tell me how to set up dmix in ubuntu?

[05:01] <javiolo> some help with NFS this is my /etc/exports -> /home/javier/shared 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0(rw,async,insecure,all_squash,anonuid =1000,anongid=1000)  I get syntax error: bad option list
[05:01] <Mantix> can someone help me, a ubuntu nood, with an install?
[05:01] <cymuHep> !ubotu
[05:01] <bruenig> levander, if by flaky you mean bad and should not be used, then yes
[05:01] <javiolo> !ask
[05:01] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:02] <bruenig> cymuHep, I still don't know what your problem is, you said something about time
[05:02] <linuxeatswindows> lol
[05:02] <Mantix> ok
[05:02] <ThePub> Why would Nautilus generate a warning window tell me a file is C code and shouldn't be opened?  It does this when I attempt to open Java files with GEdit.  (just curious what mechanism controls this)
[05:02] <Mantix> trying to install streamripper for drake
[05:02] <arrenlex> ThePub: I'm guessing it doesn't have an association for c files.
[05:02] <Mantix> got the package from the ubuntu server and auto installed it
[05:02] <Mantix> I also installed the KDE front end
[05:02] <mebaran151> does anyone have any experience with macbook and linux
[05:02] <arrenlex> !anyone | mebaran151
[05:02] <Mantix> I can't find the application anywhere

[05:02] <ubotu> mebaran151: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:02] <levander> bruenig: it's wierd so many people are using an application if everyone's having problems with it.  People are talking about that app all over ubuntu forums.
[05:02] <feesioux> hi.. is there any way that I can download a .deb package (from packages.ubuntu.com) and make it automagically download all the dependencies packages too? manually finding teh dependencies is a too recursive process =/
[05:03] <Mantix> and don't know what to look for?
[05:03] <arrenlex> newbuntu: ...no. Seperately.
[05:03] <EdLin> feesioux: use synaptic or aptiude or apt-get
[05:03] <levander> bruenig: is it because of this gcj stuff? is that stuff flaky?
[05:03] <mebaran151> macbook and hal specifically
[05:03] <ThePub> arrenlex: idk why that would matter for a java file.  what in nautilus would control this sort of error generation?
[05:03] <arrenlex> newbuntu: Do this as its own command, exactly as it appears without changing anything, as normal user " mkdir /tmp/foo "
[05:03] <LineOf7s> levander:  I use Azureus regularly on Windows, but as you've seen, it has a very poor reputation on Linux.  There are alternatives though, of course.
[05:03] <bruenig> levander, it is best that you install it separately. When I did use it, I installed it separately. There are just too many permission issues because azureus likes to write and add stuff to its installed directory instead of putting it all in a home configuration directory. I found that to be a  big issue
[05:04] <LineOf7s> bruenig:  Given Azureus' failings, do you have a suggestion as to an appropriate alternative?
[05:04] <levander> bruenig: i'm removing it now and installing gnome-btdownload...
[05:04] <newbuntu> arrenlex it's weird i still get  sgmentation fault
[05:04] <bruenig> LineOf7s, utorrent
[05:04] <levander> bruenig: you know if gnome-btdownload is any good
[05:04] <linuxeatswindows> my mplayer says error with video_out device? but my other movieplayer works? whats wrong with mplayer?
[05:04] <LineOf7s> brue:  Thankyou
[05:04] <EdLin> my ISP blocks bittorent. :-(
[05:04] <bruenig> levander, pretty basic. Just a little prompt with a progress bar pretty much.
[05:05] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: Please pastebin the entire output of mplayer?
[05:05] <bsamson_> ktorrent is awesome by the way
[05:05] <bruenig> s/prompt/dialog
[05:05] <LineOf7s> EdLin:  How very narrow-minded of it.
[05:05] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: starting from the command to the output.
[05:05] <arrenlex> newbuntu: The command "mkdir /tmp/foo", BY ITSELF, causes a segfault?
[05:05] <bruenig> ktorrent is getting there. When they finally fixed that bug I reported in the rss plugin, I almost switched to it, but still using utorrent.
[05:05] <levander> bruenig: what's the package name for utorrent?  "apt-cache search utorrent" shows up nothing
[05:05] <newbuntu> yes
[05:05] <EdLin> LineOf7s: they also block popular P2P programs, and you can't activate your connection without Windows+IE.
[05:06] <bruenig> levander, utorrent must be run through wine, it is a windows app
[05:06] <arrenlex> newbuntu: ...is that possible? o_o
[05:06] <newbuntu> I know eh
[05:06] <bruenig> levander, but they should get a linux port out in the future
[05:06] <arrenlex> EdLin: Please stop using Microsoft as your ISP. o__O
[05:06] <feesioux> EdLin: i want to download the packages for an offline instalation...
[05:06] <newbuntu> reinstall time....  lol
[05:06] <levander> bruenig: yech, forget utorrent then
[05:06] <LineOf7s> EdLin:  Are you *fond* of this ISP?  :o)
[05:06] <EdLin> I use Verizon, also an evil monopoly. :-(
[05:06] <newbuntu> I broke my linux  wah wah
[05:06] <JRGC_> Can someone please tell me if ubuntu 6.10 supports reiserfs?
[05:06] <JRGC_> I'm trying to install kubuntu and I don't find any option for this.
[05:06] <LineOf7s> bruenig:  Wine?  Bummer.
[05:06] <elysium444> yes it supports reiserfs
[05:06] <feesioux> that's why I need to download all the dependencies packages beforehand
[05:06] <linuxeatswindows> how do I start mplayer gui from the terminal?
[05:06] <EdLin> LineOf7s: I already had entered the contract when I found out I couldn't activate it without lying to tech support for a half hour.
[05:07] <ajayc> anyone from stanford university?
[05:07] <bruenig> levander, not that hard to set up. Well not for me, I am pretty used to it by now having installed it on 3-4 different installs
[05:07] <noiesmo> linuxeatswindows, gmplayer
[05:07] <levander> bruenig: i don't even like to install kde apps...
[05:07] <bsamson_> I'm a kde dork bso maybe i'm biased toward ktorrest but its the closest to azuereus in functionality that ive seen thats not terribly slow
[05:07] <LineOf7s> EdLin:  Verizon - the "can't differentiate between cents and dollars" company.  :o)
[05:07] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: Not gui. I want you to run the command line version. "mplayer <file>"
[05:07] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: And pastebin all the output.
[05:07] <bruenig> levander, there is a howto in the forums, takes you all the way through installing wine, then installing utorrent.
[05:07] <arrenlex> LineOf7s: That sounds awesome! I want an ISP that can't differentiate between cents and dollars.
[05:08] <linuxeatswindows> okay
[05:08] <arrenlex> LineOf7s: "Your monthly bill is $50" *hands two quarters* "Thank you, have a nice day!"
[05:08] <EdLin> LineOf7s: yeah, it was a mistake. I can't back out of it for a year though.
[05:08] <Music_Shuffle> levander, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=191161
[05:08] <bruenig> LineOf7s, in there defense .002 is the same when you look at it in the calculator
[05:08] <LineOf7s> arrenlex:  Yeah - but as in quote prices in cents, and charge in dollars.  :o)
[05:08] <PORDO> hey, rhythmbox won't play vorbis files for me.  what the hey?!
[05:08] <mebaran151> you probably need to add some gstremer stuff, pordo

[05:08] <cmiuc007> hello I am trying to install another distro along with ubuntu and win xp...what changes do i need to do in grub and how should I partition the drives?
[05:08] <newbuntu> I think the best thing if you want to play windblows games is to have a dual boot and thats just what im going to do
[05:09] <linuxeatswindows> it works from commandline, but not from gui
[05:09] <mebaran151> cmiuc007: they can share swap and maybe even the home partition
[05:09] <EdLin> newbuntu: there's cedega
[05:09] <mebaran151> though the home partition might result in oddness
[05:09] <bruenig> LineOf7s, that was genius, 2 cents different than 2 dollars? yes, .2 cents different than .2 dollars? yes, .002 cents different than .002 dollars? no
[05:09] <linuxeatswindows> arrenlex, it works from command line but not from gui
[05:09] <newbuntu> edlin yah but thats what im trying unsucesfully install and it cost money anyways
[05:09] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: Then go to the GUI and change the settings to reflect what you saw it use in the command line.
[05:09] <elysium444> can somebody help me with nat problem???
[05:10] <elysium444> azuerus nat problem?
[05:10] <LineOf7s> bruenig:  We don't have Verizon in Australia (yet) - feel free to keep it contained to North America.  :o)
[05:10] <EdLin> newbuntu: sorry to hear that. I use vanilla WINE to run IE in order to test websites. It works perfectly.
[05:10] <bsamson_> cmiuc007: why do you want to do that it sounds messy.  you should look into vmware
[05:10] <newbuntu> for some reason mkdir doesnt work for me
[05:10] <jvai> hey ppl it was good.. ty & gn
[05:10] <cmiuc007> mebaran151: my second distro is going to be Opensuse how can I make it share swap, but I am definitely going to do a differnt partition for suse
[05:10] <newbuntu> I have wine but games dont work well trhough it
[05:10] <elysium444> Suse sucks
[05:10] <EdLin> newbuntu: yup
[05:11] <elysium444> I dont know about the new version
[05:11] <bruenig> LineOf7s, that is our educational system
[05:11] <mebaran151> when you get to the partitioning, you should just select the same swap partition
[05:11] <elysium444> but the 10.1 sucks
[05:11] <newbuntu> I distain windows
[05:11] <cmiuc007> elysium444 its just personal choice :)
[05:11] <levander> bruenig: Are bittornado or bittorrent any better than gnome-btdownload?  I noticed that those two are also written on top of gtk.
[05:11] <bruenig> levander, bittornado is
[05:11] <bruenig> levander, bittorrent I don't think is actually a client
[05:12] <levander> bruenig: bittorrent-gui is a package in the repositories
[05:12] <elysium444> no I used to love suse but with the 10.1 version I didn't like it anymore
[05:12] <bruenig> oh well bittorrent-gui
[05:12] <Pelo> utorrent works well on wine
[05:12] <EdLin> the difference between Ubuntu and Windows is like the difference between being entertained with commercials, and being entertained without them.
[05:12] <bruenig> Pelo, they shot that down already, I tried
[05:12] <levander> i'll probably try one of those two next time I need a bittorrent clint

[05:17] <zaatar> hi, i installed the xfce4 package with all it's dependancies, how do i uninstall it all?
[05:17] <levander> if it was only heck, that doesn't sound so bad
[05:17] <levander> zaatar: what tool did you use to install it?
[05:17] <zaatar> levander, synaptic
[05:17] <levander> zaatar: i'd guess synaptic does orphan tracking, but i'm not sure
[05:18] <levander> zaatar: maybe someone in here knows how you could "simulate" a remove with synaptic to see what packages would be removed if you were to do it...
[05:18] <levander> zaatar: i know with aptitude, it's the --simulate option
[05:18] <zaatar> levander, well according to synaptic, it just says xfce will be remove
[05:18] <Pelo> levander,  if you mean it unisntalls packages that are no longer in use if you uninstall something else , yes it does
[05:19] <levander> Pelo: tell zaatar how to di that
[05:19] <tonyyarusso> bruenig: Frankly, even if there's just that many users you join in quick succession, I'd recommend typing it out and just waiting on the <Enter> - maybe drop us a line in #ubuntu-ops too - but wait on hitting it a moment, and of course that doesn't apply to netsplit rejoins.
[05:19] <Pelo> levander,  I was talking about synaptic, no need to dl it

[05:32] <Rookie_> You have to forward within the script, open port - then portforward it
[05:32] <seamus7> elysium444: you need to go into the router's administration panel via the browser and often need to set a static ip.
[05:32] <ThePub> bruenig: no, that is not the issue.  The issue is that *.java is mapped to text/x-csrc
[05:32] <seamus7> elysium444: I second portforward.com
[05:33] <elysium444> ok I will check
[05:33] <ThePub> bruenig: What that means is that when Nautilus goes to muck around with java files it prevents anything from happening automatically (like opening them with a text editor) because the contents and the mime type do not match.
[05:33] <magic_ninja> zspada15_: s/org/xorg?
[05:33] <dcode> I'm trying to use rssh to restrict access to sftp only...my users are being authenticated against an LDAP server...I'd like to override the shell for each user that i want to give access based upon a local group membership...is there anyway to do this?
[05:33] <maebmij> scott__: gcc is a good way... what errors are you getting?
[05:33] <superb0wl_> scott__ doyou get an error?  gcc is outstanding at compiling code
[05:34] <Rookie_> !paste
[05:34] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:34] <dcode> I have to change the shell to /usr/bin/rssh, but that would require  local passwd entry for every user
[05:35] <Rookie_> elysium444 - this is one way to forward ports within the script - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38040/
[05:36] <zspada15_> Rookie_: thats iptables
[05:36] <Rookie_> yea, you have to set the paths but thats the rules
[05:37] <zspada15_> oops
[05:37] <elysium444> Rookie_:thanks
[05:37] <Rookie_> zspada15_ - his prob showed up after he tested the script on that forum he posted a thread from
[05:37] <superb0wl_> dcode i'm pretty sure that you can set up a field in ldap called loginshell to handle that
[05:38] <dcode> superb0wl_: I don't want to change the loginshell for access to every server, just this sftp server
[05:39] <dcode> that and I don't have rights to change those shells in ldap
[05:39] <javiolo> some help with NFS this is my /etc/exports -> /home/javier/shared 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0(rw,async,insecure,all_squash,anonuid =1000,anongid=1000)  I get syntax error
[05:39] <Rookie_> !nfs
[05:39] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[05:40] <SimpleSimon492> Also I made XP hda2 and linux hda1 how do I switch then
[05:40] <dylan_> Can Emacs play ogg/mp3, read news and mail, do irc, and browse the web easily?
[05:40] <maebmij> javiolo: seems like you should have a colon after the IP address and before the path..
[05:40] <Falstius> SimpleSimon492: you don't have any data you wanted on that XP partition do you?
[05:40] <javiolo> maebmij: colon ?
[05:40] <elysium444> Rookie_: I had the problem before testing the script
[05:40] <elysium444> Rookie_: I thought the script would solve it
[05:41] <maebmij> javiolo: ":" (but read the document that ubotu linked to)
[05:41] <Rookie_> elysium444 - depence on how you connect to the net ...
[05:41] <SimpleSimon492> nope got everything i wanted
[05:42] <Rookie_> windows (nfts and fat) really should be on hda1, makes it easier for win to find the partition
[05:42] <javiolo> maebmij: Im reading the docs but theres no : before
[05:42] <elysium444>  Rookie_: I got a lan connection from somebody else, my ip 192.168.1.4 static
[05:42] <Falstius> SimpleSimon492: good.  To switch the partition order you have to delete the partitions and recreate them which will destroy all the data.
[05:43] <maebmij> javiolo: sorry, I think I'm wrong.
[05:43] <Rookie_> by switch or router or private gateway ?
[05:43] <SimpleSimon492> That is what I thought OK thank you
[05:43] <Falstius> SimpleSimon492: unless you need windows for games, you're better off running it in a virtual machine than dual booting.
[05:45] <superb0wl_> dcode: you could write a custom nss module
[05:45] <Rookie_> elysium444 - i guess you have a router, check the rules in the router, if nothing wrong with the rules then flush the iptables rules ( iptables -F ) and run the sc ript you want
[05:45] <elysium444>  Rookie_: by switch I think I am not sure about that
[05:45] <superb0wl_> dcode: that's starting to get pretty complicated though
[05:45] <elysium444>  Rookie_: the script has the command "iptables -F"
[05:46] <dcode> superb0wl_: you're right :-/  I stumbled across a patch for openssh for this...but not quite what I need
[05:46] <dcode> i'll hack on that
[05:46] <superb0wl_> it sounds like a fun way to spend a day or two or work
[05:46] <Rookie_> yea, but you might have to set all the paths ...
[05:46] <insomnia> hey, I got a funny question for someone.
[05:46] <dcode> heh...luckily I've got a day or two to spend
[05:47] <insomnia> I'm just trying out ubuntu for the first time here...and it seems to have by default, not installed make or gcc.
[05:47] <insomnia> is that S.O.P. ?
[05:47] <Falstius> dcode: why do you want to restrict them to sftp?
[05:47] <cherubiel> insomnia: build-essentials
[05:47] <Falstius> insomnia: yes, they're easy to install though.
[05:47] <Konnektion> insomnia" apt-get install build-essential
[05:47] <superb0wl_> insomnia: i think they gear ubuntu for normal (read: less technical) people
[05:47] <insomnia> oh?  from the cd?
[05:48] <rpedro> !info build-essential
[05:48] <dcode> Falstius: because it's a file server...and the only people that need shell access are the administrators
[05:48] <ubotu> build-essential: informational list of build-essential packages. In component main, is optional. Version 11.3 (edgy), package size 6 kB, installed size 48 kB
[05:48] <insomnia> Konnektion: that would assume, that my NIC is supported
[05:48] <dcode> which is me :D
[05:48] <insomnia> and I don't need to compile a driver for said NIC
[05:48] <insomnia> before I can connect to teh 'net.
[05:48] <insomnia> but since I have to compile the driver....
[05:48] <insomnia> hmmm.
[05:48] <Rookie_> elysium444 - you see it says "iptables" in the beginin of each row ? but the system dont know where that is, you have to set up a path for that ... and you need paths and definition for each NIC / eth too
[05:48] <Falstius> insomnia: they are included on the CD
[05:48] <cherubiel> insomnia: get the compiler first, then think about how to get the drivers compiled :)
[05:49] <insomnia> cherubiel: yea.  I'm getting that catch 22 feeling.
[05:49] <insomnia> Falstius: since it's a VM, I don't really -have- a cd.  just an ISO image.  ;)
[05:49] <Falstius> insomnia: then its on the ISO image :-P
[05:50] <jwickard> Anyone know how to rotate logs in multiple directories for apache virtual posts?  like /var/dir1/*.log /var/dir2/*.log /var/dir3/*.log { <config options /> }
[05:50] <cherubiel> insomnia: mount the iso, and add it to the repo list in sources.lst
[05:50] <insomnia> yea.
[05:50] <insomnia> which is...um...where?
[05:50] <TraceGreen> Hello, my hardisk has "host area protected", I check dmsg and find: "hda: Host Protected area detected but disabled", can i enable it in linux?
[05:50] <anichak> can anybody give me some link on setting up struts in ubuntu please
[05:51] <Rookie_> almost 6 am ... need coffee
[05:51] <jwickard> anichak: jakarta struts?
[05:51] <anichak> jwickard: yes
[05:52] <minerale> I just installed beryl, followd all instructions from the wiki, I logged out, logged back in on beryl -- now what ? how do I enable the animations? everything seems the same
[05:52] <emilia> hey guys, i cant right click on my desktop, and it doesnt show whats in /home/user/desktop ?
[05:52] <anichak> jwickard: I am using eclipse but not getting much success
[05:52] <jwickard> anichak: it's something you'd put in your webapp, kind of independent from the os / distro
[05:52] <elysium444>  Rookie_: I did the iptables -F and run the script again but doesnt work, I send a new reply to the forum with the output that i got: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1909088#post1909088
[05:53] <insomnia> geez.  seriously convoluted.
[05:53] <Winter> say, in Gnome i have hda2 and hda3 (a second hard drive) showing up on my desktop... they are an eyesore, is there any way to get rid of them other than umounting them?
[05:54] <jwickard> anichak: if you're using eclipse it's even easier.  For example I have a directory I keep all my downloaded java libraries in, then I use eclipse to define my own libraries that I can import into any project I'd like.
[05:54] <ubuntu> someone here

[06:00] <ubuntu> hlds becouse Vista need to be cracked man it is so sweet that Bil Gates can this windows in his ass

[06:02] <hlds> i dont play i just host my server
[06:02] <n2diy> ubuntu, my goal is to live forever, so far, so good. :)

[06:02] <ubuntu> n2diy ok mans
[06:02] <emilia> hey guys, i cant right click on my desktop, and it doesnt show whats in /home/user/desktop ?
[06:02] <hlds> yea someone will crack it sometime.
[06:02] <daya> n2diy, for it u have to configure cron job
[06:03] <hlds> people already did.
[06:03] <ubuntu> Rookie_ man and how you think that Bil Gates only try to see how till be the product
[06:03] <ubuntu> on the market
[06:03] <ubuntu> hlds but the crack didn't work
[06:03] <bimberi> emilia: Desktop (Capital D)
[06:03] <ubuntu> it is trial versoin
[06:03] <Falstius> insomnia: that might not be on the CD .. it is a large package.
[06:03] <hlds> mine was activated.
[06:03] <n2diy> daya, I want to copy all my files, and you don't need to run it from cron.
[06:03] <daya> n2diy, for eg. i need to copy hda1 to hda2 used this rsync -a /mnt/hda1 /mnt/hda2
[06:03] <insomnia> Falstius: lovely.
[06:03] <hlds> but i formated.
[06:03] <superb0wl_> insomnia the kernel source is linux-source but you might just need the headers which is kernel-headers
[06:03] <daya> n2diy, then u can do other method
[06:03] <ubuntu> hlds no man go in run then put ver
[06:03] <insomnia> so.  suggestions?
[06:03] <insomnia> :)
[06:03] <emilia> bimberi: the desktop doesnt display anything
[06:03] <daya> n2diy, like ssh
[06:03] <somerville32> ubuntu, hlds: This might be a better discussion for -offtopic :)
[06:03] <Rookie_> elysium444 - you have to spec your internal ip, if you use the puter as a gateway too you need to spec both nics
[06:03] <ubuntu> you will see that is Evaluation
[06:03] <daya> n2diy, scp et
[06:03] <insomnia> would it be on the server cdrom?
[06:03] <emilia> bimberi: but i see the files in ~/Desktop
[06:04] <hlds> dude it was it said i had GENUINE.
[06:04] <emilia> bimberi: and i can't right clickon it

[06:04] <emilia> bimberi: yeah
[06:04] <Tonren> Hey guys, I let my laptop run out of batteries and it went into hibernate.  I think it wrote something bogus to the swap partition because now I can't boot up.  Will someone please help me?
[06:04] <daya> n2diy, then you can do scp
[06:04] <ubuntu> and now can someone say how to configura Zimbra
[06:04] <daya> n2diy, did you get the point
[06:05] <Tonren> My laptop's been out of commission for 3 days and I've been in here all the time.  I really don't want to switch back to Windows, but if something like this can knock everything out, I just might have to.
[06:05] <ubuntu> hlds what copy of VIsta you use ???
[06:05] <hlds> Vista RTM.
[06:05] <hlds> build 6000
[06:05] <Rookie_> elysium444 - you wan to take the shortcut, try this - http://easyfwgen.morizot.net/gen/
[06:05] <ubuntu> hlds for BIl Gates or no?
[06:05] <bimberi> emilia: hmm. perhaps it's a gconf setting.  ALT-F2 "gconf-editor" and see if there's someting in /apps/nautilus/...
[06:05] <superb0wl_> n2diy if you still want to use rsync you can set --rsh=ssh
[06:05] <n2diy> daya, no, I missed the point, sorry. Roger scp.
[06:05] <hlds> is called RTM i think is the same.
[06:05] <ubuntu> bad here is 6:00 is SPain
[06:05] <lupine_85> so, interesting question. What's the plural of ubuntu?
[06:05] <elysium444>  Rookie_: I need to do some learning...what are nics and puter is there another link you can send me or iptables is just fine?
[06:05] <lupine_85> I just settled on ubunti...
[06:06] <Tonren> lupine_85, What's the plural of George Bush?  It's a proper noun.
[06:06] <daya> n2diy, secure copy
[06:06] <ubuntu> hlds man bastards from where do you download it.

[06:06] <n2diy> superb0wl_: roger that too.
[06:06] <hlds> dis chaccnel is nice
[06:06] <insomnia> why didn't you just tell me to run synaptic?
[06:06] <insomnia> lol
[06:06] <Rookie_> NIC - Network InterfaCe, puter - computer/pc
[06:06] <emilia> bimberi: no, nothing in there :(
[06:06] <simeon> you can run aptitude, insomia
[06:06] <hlds> NIC= network interface card.
[06:07] <lupine_85> more than one george bush == lots of trouble :p
[06:07] <n2diy> daya, roger secure copy, haven't used that either, no experience with networking here.
[06:07] <bimberi> emilia: sorry, out of ideas for now :/
[06:07] <lupine_85> but you can definitely have more than one ubuntu
[06:07] <Rookie_> ahh, yes, your right hlds
[06:07] <hlds> lol.
[06:07] <Akuma_> is there important stuff to be backed up outside of ~ ?

[06:08] <hlds> i think crack dont work anymore.
[06:08] <Tonren> My laptop's been out of commission for 3 days and I've been in here all the time.  I really don't want to switch back to Windows, but if something like this can knock everything out, I just might have to.
[06:09] <Tonren> Someone please help out.
[06:09] <ubuntu> hlds man i don't use VIsta
[06:09] <Tonren> I let my laptop run out of batteries and it went into hibernate.  I think it wrote something bogus to the swap partition because now I can't boot up.
[06:09] <ubuntu> i have it only for test in Vmware
[06:09] <hlds> o
[06:09] <ubuntu> hlds but from where you download it.
[06:09] <hlds> u have 2 gigs of RAM?

[06:10] <ubuntu> ok man i will go
[06:10] <llindy> LOL
[06:10] <n2diy> Tonren: what does your swap partition have to do with booting up?
[06:10] <llindy> crashed
[06:10] <Akuma_> i downloaded some security updates yesterday night, and now gnome wont boot anymore. did anybody hear about problems with the latest updates?
[06:10] <hlds> yea i know how but i had windows vista.
[06:10] <Tonren> n2diy, when you go into hibernate, it writes memory into the swap partition.  right?  Then, when you boot up, it reads from the swap partition.
[06:10] <hlds> and den installed Xp on another HD
[06:10] <llindy> ah, uh hu
[06:10] <hlds> so it wont do dat.
[06:10] <hlds> i need a pro.

[06:11] <ubuntu> i' will go out becouse i need to see zimbra
[06:11] <n2diy> Tornre, I don't think so, when you boot, you read from the mbr.

[06:11] <simeon> exit
[06:11] <hlds> i will come here more often
[06:11] <hlds> simeon is not exit
[06:11] <Music_Shuffle> Jerimiah40, you don't have to, but its optimized for the A64 cores, so you might as well.
[06:11] <ubuntu> hlds ok man from where are you.

[06:11] <hlds> DAM my xp says is not genuine.
[06:11] <BrianSteffens> jerimiah40 no you can use either 32 bit or 64 bit versions. 32 bit will not use all of your processing power but 64 bit is less compatible with different softwares
[06:12] <Jerimiah40> Music_Shuffle - is it like Windows in that the x64 version has almost zero compatability?
[06:12] <daya> n2diy, then for eg your remote box ip is 192.168.2.3 and your ip is 192.168.2.5 then just run scp -r <what you want to copy , path name> root@192.168.2.5:/
[06:12] <Jerimiah40> Brian - Oh, okay.  So, in your opinion, which one should I choose for a dualboot between Windows and Ubuntu?
[06:12] <daya> n2diy, I think you get it.
[06:12] <lupine_85> hlds: is it? :p
[06:13] <daya> n2diy, try googling ssh how to
[06:13] <BrianSteffens> jerimiah40 if you have a 32 bit version of windows dual-booting with ubuntu, i would go with the 64 bit version of ubuntu and use windows as your 'compatibility os'
[06:13] <hlds> never said dis before.
[06:13] <Jerimiah40> Okay, sounds good
[06:13] <hlds> ill format again i guess.
[06:13] <n2diy> daya, roger all that. My isp isn't involved, it is a lan setup, I just need to do my homework.
[06:13] <hlds> for ubuntu just use Vmware dont dualboot.
[06:13] <llindy> holds,maybe your system blocked that damn windows advantage ping?
[06:13] <Tonren> Here's a thread with my error info in it: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1909152#post1909152
[06:14] <Jerimiah40> Now, this leads to the next question, how much of a pain in the ass is it to dual boot?  From what I've read it's rather difficult
[06:14] <hlds> its easy.
[06:14] <lupine_85> Jerimiah40: verr easy
[06:14] <Jerimiah40> okay
[06:14] <hlds> install ubuntu first den xp and there u go.
[06:14] <lupine_85> no
[06:14] <lupine_85> install xp first
[06:14] <Geoffrey2> install xp first, then ubuntu
[06:14] <Jerimiah40> hlds - there's the problem.  I've got an OEM copy of XP
[06:14] <lupine_85> XP is not linux-aware. Linux is windows-aware.
[06:14] <n2diy> Jerimiah40:  Piece of cake, just load Winders first, and then ubuntu.
[06:15] <llindy> I did xp, then Ubuntu
[06:15] <hlds> OEM/
[06:15] <Jerimiah40> ah, okay.  That's where I was worried, a lot of things I read agreed with what hlds said
[06:15] <hlds> u have the real one?
[06:15] <Jerimiah40> yeah, my computer came with XP home preinstalled
[06:15] <Bambang> .id
[06:15] <hlds> hmm i see.
[06:15] <daya> n2diy, just see their ip and give me the path what you want to copy i will provide u command
[06:16] <Bambang> .id
[06:16] <Dave___> the ubuntu live cd is locked inside my drive and wont eject!!!!!!!
[06:16] <n2diy> daya, I don't have the network cabled, so it won't happen tonight, but thanks anyway.
[06:16] <syte> use a papercl
[06:16] <syte> ip
[06:16] <hlds> open it up.
[06:16] <Dave___> ok
[06:16] <Konnektion> !ntfs
[06:16] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[06:16] <lupine_85> Dave___: you'd need to unmount it before it'll eject
[06:16] <syte> i think u can mess around with one of the gears using a paperclip to open it up
[06:16] <Jerimiah40> Dave - on the front of the drive, there will usually be a little tiny hole.  Stick a paperclip in, and the drive should pop open
[06:17] <lupine_85> that's standard behaviour in *nix
[06:17] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: dual booting is not hard, but it is a waste of time
[06:17] <hlds> damm i need a new XP cd key.
[06:17] <daya> n2diy, o.k
[06:17] <daya> n2diy, :)
[06:17] <daya> n2diy, can u talk in PM
[06:17] <Dave___> ok thanks
[06:17] <lupine_85> but you probably don't want to unmount it while running off i...
[06:17] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - in what way?
[06:17] <syte> whenever i play cs, the arrow stays, anyway to get rid of that
[06:17] <n2diy> daya, what is PM? maybe?
[06:17] <syte> using cedega
[06:18] <syte> like cursor stays in the middle of my screen. it really gets annoying :(

[06:18] <Maelgwyn> Hi, i need a solution to a problem
[06:18] <Maelgwyn> As we all do
[06:18] <Maelgwyn> Then I will be out of your hair
[06:18] <hlds> shoot it

[06:18] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: because virtualization is a much better solution for primarily using one OS and occasionally switching to another.  Especially for work situations.  For games it is a little different.
[06:18] <Dave___> paperclip didnt work
[06:18] <n2diy> daya, ok, I'm running xchat.
[06:18] <syte> someone mine helping me with cedega for a second?
[06:18] <daya> n2diy, have u registered you nick name in irc channel
[06:18] <syte> mind*
[06:18] <Falstius> And if you need your XP for games, install linux in a virtual machine and expand it to full screen most of the time.
[06:19] <hlds> im having problems with a xp cd key so... lol
[06:19] <Maelgwyn> I need to play a DVD that is saying its illegal, but i had played it before
[06:19] <Maelgwyn> Need an easy easy solution
[06:19] <n2diy> daya, I think so, I'm here aren't I?
[06:19] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - okay, fair enough
[06:19] <daya> n2diy, yes but did u see my private message in the tab below at my name
[06:19] <Falstius> my machine is set up dual boot, and the 20GB XP partition is just wasted space since I never reboot.
[06:19] <n2diy> daya, nope.
[06:19] <AllenA> i cannot for the life of me get pilot-link to work... i dont even know where to start, the usb and visor mods are installed /var/log stuff shows handspring visor/palm attached to ttyUSB1... i tried using udev and when pressing hotsync /dev/pilot shows up but still cannot seem to communicate it just sits on waitg for connection on whateverport
[06:20] <daya> n2diy, then o.k
=== numist is now known as drunkmist
[06:20] <daya> n2diy, any way where r u from
[06:20] <AllenA> oh yeah running edgy, and a treo650
[06:20] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - I'm still mostly going to use XP, but I'd like to just mess around with linux at this point
[06:20] <LineOf7s> Falstius:  Since you're talking about virtual machines so confidently, I'll ask you:  Can I use a virtual machine to run the WinXP I already have installed on my dual-boot machine, or do I need to install it into the virtual machine specifically?
[06:20] <n2diy> daya, USA, Pa.
[06:20] <daya> n2diy, fine me from nepal
[06:21] <n2diy> daya, cool, I'm a Ham Radio
[06:21] <daya> n2diy, are a school boy?
[06:21] <Tonren> I'm desperate, guys.  I've been out of commission for four days.  someone please help.  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1909152#post1909152
[06:21] <Falstius> LineOf7s: you can with the paid version of vmware virtual server, or so I've heard.
[06:21] <Nemnix> I'm using vmware server at the moment
[06:21] <Nemnix> it's free but you have to register to get a key
[06:22] <LineOf7s> Falstius:  Aaah.  Well that's something.  Thanks.
[06:22] <n2diy> daya, I'm a Ham Radio Operator, and you are my first contact from Nepal!
[06:22] <Jerimiah40> okay, so I think for now I'll use a VM then
[06:22] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: then install linux in a virtual machine.  You use it more if you don't have to reboot in to it.
[06:22] <Maelgwyn> Yes you can from VMWare, but its messy
[06:22] <Jerimiah40> so, from how you're talking I'd assume that "VMWare" is a specific program I could download and use?
[06:22] <daya> n2diy, :)
[06:22] <Nemnix> when I get around to apt-getting some kernel source I'll worry about the vmware tools ;)
[06:22] <hlds> hahahaha silly mE!!
[06:22] <Nemnix> www.vmware.com
[06:22] <hlds> i know why my copy was GENUINE!
[06:22] <Jerimiah40> n2diy - what's your call?
[06:23] <hlds> WRONG CD!!!! hahaha
[06:23] <llindy> jerimiah40, vmware is bad to the bone!
[06:23] <Maelgwyn> Anyway, anyone got my DVD problem?
[06:23] <n2diy> daya, yes I am, I'm still learning at the age of 50, I've been 50 years old for 23 minutes!
[06:23] <Jerimiah40> lol, ok
[06:23] <the_rick> Ok, someone please tell me a GOOD reason NOT to give root a password, because I for the life of me cannot figure out how to login to SWAT without root access.
[06:23] <daya> n2diy, Ham what is it its name of the radio
[06:23] <hlds> funny i crack myself up.
[06:23] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: sorry, yes it is.  VMware player is free for download.  You can download several different pre-built linux virtual machines for it too.
[06:23] <hlds> brb
[06:23] <n2diy> Jerimiah40: n2diy!!!
[06:23] <daya> n2diy, very fascinating
[06:24] <Jerimiah40> ah, that makes sense >.<
[06:24] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - okay
[06:24] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: then once you're addicted to linux and know what you're doing, you'll wipe off that nasty MS stuff.
[06:24] <Jerimiah40> lol
[06:24] <Jerimiah40> At this point, I'm going to go one of two ways.   Vista comes out in January, so I'm going to get Ubuntu now and start learning.  Once Vista comes out, I'm either going to switch to it, or switch to Ubuntu
[06:24] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah...especially after yo uknow what you're doing.
[06:24] <the_rick> Or someone tell me how I can remotely configure my samba shares without root access
[06:25] <Music_Shuffle> Well, with Beryl, you get all the eye candy of Aero too.
[06:25] <lupine_85> Music_Shuffle: and then some! :p
[06:25] <carutsu> vista is not woth
[06:25] <Music_Shuffle> xD
[06:25] <n2diy> daya, fascinating, and the coolest hobby in the world
[06:25] <Jerimiah40> yeah, Beryl is one of the things I want to play with..... I recently saw a video of it
[06:25] <pwn> hi

[06:26] <Maelgwyn> Done that Geoffrey2

[06:26] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: here is a ubuntu virtual machine http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/ubuntu.html

[06:26] <magic_ninja> Jerimiah40: do you do alot of gaming?
[06:26] <daya> n2diy, hope i will help to solve your coming problems
[06:26] <daya> n2diy, bye
[06:26] <Maelgwyn> I personally use the opposite

[06:26] <Jerimiah40> magic_ninja - practically none
[06:26] <pwn> it doesnt recgonize my screen at the prompt and says my harddrive doesnt have 16398 sectors
[06:26] <pwn> i need to change the cylinders
[06:26] <n2diy> daya, 73, don't work to hard, tnx
[06:26] <Ilovemypuppy> whats the main difference between the server release of 6.06 and 6.10
[06:27] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - wait, you mean it comes preinstalled as ubuntu, I don't need to install it?
[06:27] <mohlert2> ANyone: When I try to play "racing stripes" a dvd in the movie player it gives me the following error - "Totem cannot play this type of media (DVD) because you do not have the appropriate plugins to handle it" -------- "Please install the necessary plugins and restart Totem to be able to play this media"  Can you help me with what is going on?
[06:27] <pwn> i looked at my harddrive manual but i dont know how to change the cylinders
[06:27] <magic_ninja> Jerimiah40: then just install ubuntu dual boot and play with it
[06:27] <carutsu> can anyone tell me how to make ascii code avalible i mean alt+#, like alt+64 for @,..
[06:27] <magic_ninja> i lot the net for like 2 years so i had no updates and stuff
[06:27] <Music_Shuffle> magic_ninja, if he installs Windows over it now, he's going to tear up grub
[06:27] <Jerimiah40> magic_ninja - that's what I was thinking about originally.  Now I'm torn :P
[06:27] <magic_ninja> i just got a laptop did a fresh install of edgy, it still runs good on the old laptop with normal settings and then i put xubuntu on my gaming desktop
[06:27] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: that one does.  You download and install vmware player and then download the virtual machine and open it with vmware player.  Its already installed for you.  I haven't tried that exact one.
[06:27] <Geoffrey2> mohlert2, totem by default can't play encrypted DVDs
[06:28] <magic_ninja> its really easy to use and does a great job of autodetecting hardware
[06:28] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - ah, okay
[06:28] <AllenA> anyone in here familiar with pilot-link, if not can anyone direct me somewhere more appropriate or recommend another palm toolset?
[06:28] <magic_ninja> you will probably have some codec issues for playing movies and music...but thats ok its pretty easy to fix
[06:28] <magic_ninja> and you will love the meathods of downloading software
[06:29] <magic_ninja> Music_Shuffle: boot with a win98 boot disk and fdisk /y and it will fix the bootloader
[06:29] <carutsu> can anyone tell me how to make ascii code avalible i mean alt+#, like alt+64 for @,..
[06:29] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: the main weakness of virtual machines is the graphics.   You should be able to run aiglx and beryl though if you have a fast machine.
[06:29] <Jerimiah40> Falstius - define fast?
[06:29] <hlds> im back
[06:29] <magic_ninja> whats so special about beryl
[06:29] <magic_ninja> it makes windows all bubbly?
[06:29] <Jerimiah40> I've got 2.2GHz athlon 64, 512MB RAM, integrated graphics
[06:29] <Geoffrey2> Ilovemypuppy, biggest differences are that 6.10 has a more recent linux kernel, a more recent version of Gnome, and supports Firefox 2.0
[06:29] <Music_Shuffle> Its really cool?
[06:29] <Music_Shuffle> Lol.
[06:29] <lupine_85> magic_ninja: what's so special about X?
[06:29] <lupine_85> it makes consoles all glitzy? :p
[06:29] <Music_Shuffle> lolol
[06:30] <mohlert2> Feoffrey2:  then what do I need to do?  Installed some codecs through terminal like I was told and it would play the first 20 minutes or so of a dvd.  Now it don't play the dvd at all.........Help!  I am new to Linux Edgy 6.10..
[06:30] <carutsu> i like beryl
[06:30] <lupine_85> it's all eyecandy in the end
[06:30] <hlds> i have a AMD Athlon 64 3000+ 2.00Ghz
[06:30] <noodles12> is it unreasonable to want a vnc connection that isn't painfully slow using a wireless connection to a wired lan computer? By slow i mean sometimes i have to use my mouse as a magic "paintbrush" to show a new window that opened.
[06:30] <lupine_85> but beryl does have some real usability improvements
[06:30] <magic_ninja> sorry accidently closed xchat
[06:30] <hlds> 1GIG RAm.
[06:30] <hlds> nVIDIA geforce.
[06:30] <Music_Shuffle> hlds, and what about it again...?
[06:30] <lupine_85> :p 1.5GB RAM so ner
[06:30] <hlds> iono lol im just making up stuff im bored.
[06:31] <hlds> lol
[06:31] <Geoffrey2> magic_ninja, my biggest problem is that my wireless doesn't like to play nice with Ubuntu...if I decided to run Ubuntu under Windows, I could, I believe, use the native windows drivers for the wireless, which I would hope would take care of the problem
[06:31] <Music_Shuffle> Well, this IS a help channel :P
[06:31] <carutsu> nobody knows?
[06:31] <Ilovemypuppy> Geoffrey2, no big deal there, im more worried about things like apache, dovecot, squirrelmail, and postfix
[06:31] <the_rick> noodles12: My experience with VNC is that just happens on certain systems.  Nothing to do with network connection
[06:31] <hlds> does any of u know how to hack my LAN conection?
[06:31] <hlds> like my brothers pc?
[06:31] <magic_ninja> Geoffrey2: i'm going to set up a wireless network for my laptop but i don't have $$$ for parts
[06:32] <Jerimiah40> so, to summarize: I have an OEM copy of XP installed and running, and I want to be able to run Ubuntu as well.  What is the best way to do it, dual-boot or VM?
[06:32] <lupine_85> hlds: yeah. His I Pwill be 127.0.0.1
[06:32] <noodles12> the_rick: did you use freenx instead to get those systems to work normally? the server is a dell using xp and the client is an asus laptop running edgy.
[06:32] <hlds> magic all u need is $40
[06:32] <Ilovemypuppy> hlds, just watch the movie "hackers" and itll teach you everything you need to know.
[06:32] <carutsu> can anyone tell me how to make ascii code avalible i mean alt+#, like alt+64 for @,..
[06:32] <hlds> lupine can u exploain more plz?
[06:32] <Aggrav8d> hello.  how do i list installed packages so i can remove/reinstall a package?
[06:32] <sloof3|arr> When my screen is blanked the backlight never comes back on when it should.
[06:32] <the_rick> noodles12: I have to use VNC so much at work that I've kinda gotten used to it
[06:33] <Falstius> Jerimiah40: for your first try, VM.  It is 100% safe.  After you're more comfortable you might want to dual boot.  You should have a gig of ram though, atleast 756MB.
[06:33] <lupine_85> hldz: you need to get a hammer and smash 127.0.0.1 to pieces. Then you can pick all the juicy pr0nz out of the remains
[06:33] <the_rick> :(
[06:33] <sloof3|arr> Aggrav8d: dpkg --get-selections

[06:33] <hlds> wtf u guys talking about?
[06:33] <Ilovemypuppy> hlds, if you REALLY want to hack him, urinate on his computer while it's on
[06:33] <Jerimiah40> hlds - Ubuntu.  It's the topic of this room, kinda
[06:34] <the_rick> noodles12: No, usually use the encryption plugin it comes with if necessary

[06:37] <cyber> hi guys, is there a way i could sync my clocks using terminal? a command in other words, cause clicking sync in the date and tiem manager isnt helping
=== cyber is now known as Cyber_Linux
[06:37] <Aggrav8d> how do i clean remove mysql so when i reinstall it i can set the root pw?
[06:37] <n2diy> hlds, you are trying to hack your brother box!
[06:37] <frogzoo> Cyber_Linux: why not just enable ntp?
[06:38] <Cyber_Linux> well frogzoo when i clicked sync, it installed it
[06:38] <n2diy> hlds' and that ain't hacking, that is cracking.
[06:38] <Cyber_Linux> but its not synced :? its a whole day off
[06:38] <P3L|C4N0> greetings
[06:38] <frogzoo> Cyber_Linux: now select a couple of closish ntp servers, & select autoupdate
[06:38] <lupine_85> hlds: California?
[06:38] <buitenzorg812_> hello guys, are there anyone who had experience of having trouble with your rhtyhmbox after upgrading from dapper to edgy?
[06:38] <lupine_85> You'll be breaking several laws by hax0ring a box that isn't your property
[06:39] <lupine_85> including the Patriot Act, most likely
[06:39] <Kruger> hi all
[06:39] <the_rick> I know that someone out of the 852 people in here must be using SWAT...
[06:39] <Kruger>  anybody know about a open source software for PBX call accounting ?
[06:39] <lupine_85> Kruger: asterisk? :p
[06:39] <Ardonik> Kruger: Asterisk, maybe.
[06:39] <frogzoo> !anyone | the_rick
[06:39] <ubotu> the_rick: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[06:39] <Cyber_Linux> lool
[06:39] <rob> Kruger: try asterisk@home (trixbox)
[06:39] <nothlit> does anyone know what 'no swt-pi-gtk-3235 in java.library.path' means if i've installed libswt already?
[06:40] <the_rick> well, I've asked the question before and !no one answered it
[06:40] <Kruger> but, for analog phone
[06:40] <Cyber_Linux> frogzoo, how do i get it to sync correctly, ntp is installed
[06:40] <Kruger> not VoIP
[06:40] <lupine_85> Kruger: yep, asterisk can do that too
[06:40] <the_rick> Is it possible to use SWAT in Ubuntu to administer samba shares?  I can't login through the web page as root
[06:40] <n2diy> Kruger, I think it is called asterik
[06:40] <lupine_85> if you're using a proprietary hardware PBX, then you'll need proprietary software...
[06:41] <Kruger> hmmmm
[06:41] <lupine_85> but asterisk can do call accounting /and/ LCR :D
[06:41] <Kruger> ok thanks
[06:41] <the_rick> frogzoo: I'm fairly new to Ubuntu and trying to keep from giving root a password.  Is it possible to configure SWAT without giving root a password?
[06:41] <lupine_85> it can interface to analogue lines, and it also a lot cheaper to run
[06:41] <n2diy> Asterix, or Asterik is OO PBX software.
[06:42] <lupine_85> Asterisk
[06:42] <lupine_85> aka. *
[06:42] <carutsu> although some support from companies would be great
[06:42] <carutsu> wrong topic
[06:42] <carutsu> can anyone tell me how to make ascii code avalible i mean alt+#, like alt+64 for @,..
[06:42] <n2diy> lupine_85:  ok, that works.
[06:42] <lupine_85> carutsu: AltGr + a key tends to work:  :p
[06:43] <frogzoo> carutsu: many options - install alternate keyboard, (with deadkeys maybe), and sys -> prefs -> keyboard
[06:43] <lupine_85> you can altgr+shift+ a key@ 
[06:43] <carutsu> i need tildes and the n~
[06:44] <the_rick> I know this shouldn't be that hard.
[06:44] <carutsu> so alt+# willn't work?
[06:44] <the_rick> but I cannot find anything on the net about getting SWAT to work without giving root a password in Ubuntu
[06:44] <lupine_85> carutsu: doesn't work here
[06:44] <Cyber_Linux> frogzoo, how do i get an ntp gui up? i have ntp installed, but yeam it auto installed so i dont know what i should do frmo here
[06:45] <Cyber_Linux> lol
[06:45] <the_rick> ok, none of those worked...
[06:45] <carutsu> lupine_85 too bad
[06:45] <the_rick> Is anyone using SWAT?
[06:45] <Cyber_Linux> frogzoo, never mind, i think i found my solution
[06:45] <flip> hey quick question -- is there any issue w/ using PCF fonts in ubuntu? i installed shine.pcf into my /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc or wherever fixed was... ran mkfontdir and xset fp rehash and i cant use it.. ive tried several now
[06:45] <the_rick> :)
[06:45] <Kruger> bye
[06:45] <Seamus7> Hi.... my system froze after rebooting ... I booted into recovery mode and got "BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!"  .... I'm have a Centrino Core 2 Duo and using Edgy ... ???
[06:45] <lupine_85> flip: ~/.fonts
[06:46] <flip> lupine_85: ok lemmie try
[06:46] <dayar> rapid, can u tell me can i upgare ubuntu of earlier version by current one
[06:46] <dayar> rapid, using the live cd
[06:46] <the_rick> Ok, flip side...What are the reasons (if any) that I should not give root a password?
[06:46] <flip> lupine_85: negative.
[06:47] <lupine_85> the_rick: paranoia
[06:47] <lupine_85> following the Ubuntu party line
[06:47] <frogzoo> the_rick: it makes remote password cracking a lot easier
[06:47] <lupine_85> frogzoo: since when?
[06:47] <LineOf7s> !printing
[06:47] <ubotu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[06:47] <dayar> can i upgrade ubuntu without lossing my data?
[06:47] <frogzoo> lupine_85: since they know to try 'root' as an account name
[06:47] <lupine_85> dayar: yep
[06:47] <rapid> dayar: what makes you ask me?
[06:47] <lupine_85> frogzoo: Since when did anyone with any sense enable logging in remotely as root?
[06:48] <n2diy> Seamus7: Your using new hardware, and edgy software, you are living on the edge.
[06:48] <frogzoo> lupine_85: easiest to just leave it disable & require sudo
[06:48] <magic_ninja> do i wanna use kernel framebuffering
[06:48] <flip> lupine_85: any other ideas... moved my fonts there... mkfontdir xset fp rehash xterm -fn shine no go
[06:48] <lupine_85> frogzoo: even when sudo is inadequate? :p
[06:48] <dayar> lupine_85, i mean can i upgrade my pc with recent version of the ubuntu that contains old ver.
[06:48] <Seamus7> n2diy: ok ... but i've not had this problem previously with my hardware on Edgy.
[06:48] <lupine_85> dayar: as long as you don't skip a version, sure
[06:49] <dayar> lupine_85, without lossing my data
[06:49] <frogzoo> lupine_85: what can't you do with sudo that you need root access for?
[06:49] <lupine_85> e.g. go breezy->dapper->edgy, not breezy->edgy
[06:49] <dayar> lupine_85, i didnt
[06:49] <the_rick> frogzoo: Log into SWAT
[06:49] <lupine_85> [05:44]  <the_rick> but I cannot find anything on the net about getting SWAT to work without giving root a password in Ubuntu
[06:49] <dayar> lupine_85, get u
[06:49] <n2diy> Seamus, ok, what else has changed?
[06:49] <rapid> dayar: ?
[06:49] <lupine_85> plus, sudo breaks very easily
[06:49] <dayar> rapid, can i upgrade ubuntu with recent ver.
[06:50] <the_rick> frogzoo: Err, log in and have admin access to configure shares
[06:50] <lupine_85> fixing it without a root password generally involves a reboot
[06:50] <dayar> rapid, that contains old ver.
[06:50] <frogzoo> the_rick: sudo -i
[06:50] <lupine_85> that is /not good/ on a production server
[06:50] <rapid> dayar: it appears that was just answered.
[06:50] <Seamus7> n2diy: I just installed some packages to monitor cpu temp and fan???
[06:50] <dayar> rapid, without lossing data.
[06:50] <flip> is dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig supposed to present me w/ options?  like enabling Bitmap font support?  it just does a dance and returns me to the prompt :F
[06:50] <rapid> dayar: don't format.
[06:50] <PORDO> anyone know of a good dmix guide for ubuntu?
[06:50] <dayar> rapid, i didn't get
[06:50] <Seamus7> n2diy: I then rebooted and that's when my computer froze and I got the error in the recovery mode.
[06:51] <lupine_85> anyway, it certainly doesn't make your system less secure
[06:51] <the_rick> frogzoo: I specifically meant the web access
[06:51] <dayar> rapid, then how can i install
[06:51] <dayar> rapid, recent ver
[06:52] <jakub_> hello
[06:52] <jakub_> i have a problem with a chinese file that i have mounted via samba
[06:52] <Music_Shuffle> hai2u2.
[06:52] <Seamus7> n2diy: I'm wondering what I can use to uninstall those packages?
[06:53] <jakub_> what fonts would i need to view chinese files properly on the command line?
[06:53] <jakub_> so /mnt/mount/mandarin/????.doc is what i want to copy over to my home directory
[06:53] <dayar> lupine_85, have u understand my questions
[06:53] <jakub_> i can stat the file, but i can't copy the file because cp says stat failed
[06:53] <n2diy> Seamus7:  How did you install them, with synaptic, dpkg?
[06:53] <phos-phoros> I did it!
[06:54] <Seamus7> n2diy: via the terminal
[06:54] <lupine_85> dayar: not really, now.
[06:54] <Seamus7> n2diy: apt-get
[06:54] <lupine_85> no*
[06:54] <jakub_> hello?
[06:54] <ChevronX> I  just installed Beryl using this guide(http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html) , now I have lost my top menu bar. What do I do?
[06:54] <rajshekhar> can anyone tell me about BIND9
[06:54] <lupine_85> !bind
[06:54] <ubotu> bind: Internet Domain Name Server. In component universe, is extra. Version 1:8.4.6-1 (edgy), package size 888 kB, installed size 2092 kB
[06:54] <ChevronX> I lost my menu bars in every application
[06:55] <rapid> about that much ^ and to read bind howto
[06:55] <gpd> my snowflakes are square - despite chosing different png (beryl)
[06:55] <lupine_85> it's a bit complicated to go into the full workings of it... plenty of how-to's around, though :)
[06:55] <lupine_85> !bind9
[06:55] <ubotu> bind9: Internet Domain Name Server. In component main, is optional. Version 1:9.3.2-2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 292 kB, installed size 724 kB
[06:55] <lupine_85> better :)
[06:55] <hlds> lupine_85?
[06:55] <n2diy> Seamus7:  fine business, then use the terminal to uninstall them, dpkp -r (package)
[06:55] <hlds> can u now help me?
[06:55] <lupine_85> [05:54]  <rajshekhar> can anyone tell me about BIND9
[06:55] <lupine_85> well, no
[06:55] <Aggrav8d> does anyone know how i can delete *all* the mysql table data without logging into mysql?
[06:55] <flip> Is anyone using a PCF terminal font in here for rxvt or xterm?
[06:55] <lupine_85> explain why I should become an accomplice to your illegal actions?
[06:55] <Aggrav8d> i fsck'd my root mysql access. :P
[06:55] <hlds> is not illegal.
[06:55] <Seamus7> n2diy: can I do this in recovery mode? I think my system is freezing once it gets to the error message?
[06:56] <lupine_85> is too :p
[06:56] <flip> lupine_85: whats illegal
[06:56] <ChevronX> I  just installed Beryl using this guide(http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html) , now I have lost my top menu bar. What do I do?
[06:56] <hlds> is just hacing control over my LAN
[06:56] <rajshekhar> ubotu : i install bind now tell me about how bind used
[06:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about how bind used - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:56] <lupine_85> he wants to hax0r a PC that doesn't belong to him
[06:56] <n2diy> Seamus7: i don't know that.
[06:56] <hlds> IS MY PC!
[06:56] <hlds> IS ON MY LAN

[06:56] <lupine_85> just say 'let me on my PC'
[06:56] <hlds> i just want to have control over my lan
[06:56] <Seamus7> n2diy: ok well thx ... i'm going to reboot and see if I can get a prompt in recovery mode in order to do the uninstallations
[06:56] <lupine_85> srsly d00d, j00 sux
[06:57] <dayar> lupine_85, just one question , can i use apt-get update, apt-get upgrade
[06:57] <hlds> theres a pc i cant get it too.
[06:57] <Tango_Down> Hello, I have an ATI rage card with 128 MB of ram. I have the r128 drivers installed. When I try and start GLX gears I find that I get approximatly 1 frame every 3 seconds. Admitadly, my hardware is old. ( a 480mhz with 256 megs of ram) but I should be able to do better than a frame every couple of seconds.
[06:57] <dayar> lupine_85, or can i directly use cd
[06:57] <jakub_> can someone please my question? it has nothing to do with hacking, and is a legitimate question
[06:57] <hlds> because room is locked.
[06:57] <lupine_85> dayar: either. but it's dist-upgrade
[06:57] <lupine_85> oh noes!
[06:57] <flip> hlds: then tell your gf you want the key back?
[06:57] <Music_Shuffle> lol.
[06:57] <lupine_85> it's your house. demand that the door be unlocked
[06:57] <ChevronX> I  just installed Beryl using this guide(http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html) , now I have lost my top menu bar. What do I do?
[06:57] <lupine_85> either way, it's offtopic
[06:57] <flip> hlds: theres a PC in your house.. on your lan... you cant get to because the room is locked?
[06:57] <hlds>  we rent dat room.
[06:57] <Seamus7> Anyone know what "BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0" means ... I get this in recovery mode on Edgy.
[06:57] <flip> hlds: and you want what?
[06:57] <n2diy> Seamus7: Good luck
[06:57] <Seamus7> n2diy:thx

[06:59] <rajshekhar> ubotu : become a administrator what i do?
[06:59] <jakub_> Music_Shuffle: thanks anyway
[06:59] <lupine_85> rob: hax0rin b0xen isn't exactly on-topic, wot? :p
[06:59] <rapid> rajshekhar, ubotu is a bot
[06:59] <Music_Shuffle> rajshekhar, ubotu is...a bot..
[06:59] <dayar> lupine_85, if i run dist-upgrade is all the application upgraded?
[06:59] <hlds> NVM u guys not helping just making fun of me.
[06:59] <lupine_85> dayar: yep
[06:59] <Madpilot> ubotu, sudo | rajshekhar
[06:59] <ubotu> rajshekhar: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:59] <hlds> thx anyways.
[06:59] <rob> lupine_85: well if he is just trying to recover his own pc, its not exactly hacking
[06:59] <Cyber_Linux> rob, hlds would like some one to show him how to hack a machine on his lan he claims he owns it
[06:59] <flip> i cant imagine that using PCF fonts just faded away one day
[06:59] <Music_Shuffle> rob, its...not his.
[07:00] <frogzoo> Music_Shuffle: you don't know that
[07:00] <llindy> awwe, holds,  Im not
[07:00] <hlds> is mine1
[07:00] <lupine_85> rob: it's his, for a given value of his. that given value being that it's attached to his LAN
[07:00] <Cyber_Linux> lol
[07:00] <ChevronX> I  just installed Beryl using this guide(http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html) , now I have lost my top menu bar. What do I do?
[07:00] <rob> hlds: simply google it, read a book, you won't get an answer on doing that here
[07:00] <flip> hlds: knock on the rented door
[07:00] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah. True. But I don't think it is, so I'm not going to help him.
[07:00] <lupine_85> but when it's behind a locked door and is owned by someone else, it becomes not his
[07:00] <Cyber_Linux> yea, but its behind a locked door to a room that he supposedly owns 2
[07:00] <Music_Shuffle> Hahaha yeah.
[07:00] <hlds> dude is my router MY house MY property and my PC
[07:00] <lupine_85> then you DON'T need to hack it
[07:00] <frogzoo> Music_Shuffle: sure, your choice, but not grounds for a banning
[07:00] <rob> hlds: yep, is off topic here
[07:00] <hlds> my conection
[07:01] <Music_Shuffle> Then open the door and stop asking here...other people are asking for LEGIT help.
[07:01] <Tango_Down> Then ask politely and MOVE YOUR PC!
[07:01] <carutsu> is there a way to change the screensaver everytime it shows up?
[07:01] <ThePub> anyone know where I change the mime assocation of a file?  (*not* the application association)
[07:01] <flip> hlds: THEN KICK THE F;N DOOR IN *!@&)(!&@)(*!&@)(!&@)
[07:01] <lupine_85> soliciting aid in illegal activities is definitely off-topic
[07:01] <Cyber_Linux> lol
[07:01] <Music_Shuffle> And they might even NEED it. Because I remember coming here and actually needing help.
[07:01] <n2diy> hlds, unplug him!?!?
[07:01] <Madpilot> caradhras, yes, there's a random mode
[07:01] <frogzoo> carutsu: sys -> prefs -> screensaver
[07:01] <jakub_> if it's offtopic why is it still being discussed?
[07:01] <hlds> hahah ive done dat.
[07:01] <wasabi__> how come there are no ops on this channel?
[07:01] <flip> Music_Shuffle: same here... havent fixed it yet
[07:01] <ChevronX> This is what I hate about Ubuntu, the support
[07:01] <hlds> he knocks in my door.
[07:01] <Music_Shuffle> ChevronX, you're running Emerald?
[07:01] <Cyber_Linux> there is proof
[07:01] <hlds> he is right behind me.
[07:01] <Cyber_Linux> hah
[07:01] <ChevronX> I think so
[07:01] <flip> ChevronX: get a refund.
[07:01] <jakub_> ChevronX: amen
[07:01] <carutsu> frogzoo i cant find a random mode
[07:01] <Cyber_Linux> just admited its not his machine
[07:01] <Flick> hello
[07:01] <Music_Shuffle> Lol. THe support is great, you got shafted by timing, sorry. I just set up Beryl myself actually. ^^
[07:01] <hlds> is mine but he gets mad when i discinect him./
[07:02] <frogzoo> carutsu: oh it's gone - mebbe try xscreensaver
[07:02] <lupine_85> *sigh*
[07:02] <hlds> how is dat saying is not mine.
[07:02] <wasabi__> anyone run counter strike source using cedega?
[07:02] <n2diy> hlds, he knocks in your door!? Call the cops!
[07:02] <lupine_85>  /ignore hlds

[07:02] <Cyber_Linux> lol
[07:02] <syte> :(
[07:02] <wasabi__> i am wondering if the frame rate suffers
[07:02] <Music_Shuffle> ChevronX, yeah that guide didn't work for me.
[07:02] <dellthinker> Anyone good with c++ ?
[07:02] <Madpilot> synchk, 'man ssh'
[07:02] <Music_Shuffle> ChevronX, http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/BerylOnEdgy
[07:02] <ChevronX> Do you know how to fix it?
[07:02] <Cyber_Linux> syte, have you tried ssh <ip> ?
[07:02] <Flick> i just took the Jum from 6.06 + XGL to 6.10 AiGLX
[07:02] <Cyber_Linux> :P
[07:02] <Madpilot> syte, man ssh
[07:02] <hlds> alrighty sorry guys ill just shut up.
[07:02] <lupine_85> dellthinker: there's a ##c++ that might be better
[07:02] <Music_Shuffle> I just set mine up with that not 2 hours ago.
[07:02] <Tango_Down> Hello, I have an ATI rage card with 128 MB of ram. I have the r128 drivers installed. When I try and start GLX gears I find that I get approximatly 1 frame every 3 seconds. Admitadly, my hardware is old. ( a 480mhz with 256 megs of ram) but I should be able to do better than a frame every couple of seconds
[07:02] <jakub_> dellthinker: yes, but it's offtopic in here, please go to ##c++
[07:02] <flip> jesus
[07:02] <ChevronX> thx
[07:02] <dellthinker> ty
[07:02] <frogzoo> carutsu: scroll to top - select 'random'
[07:03] <Music_Shuffle> Good luck! Its well worth it ;)
[07:03] <n2diy> lupine_85:  what does ignore /XXXX do?
[07:03] <lupine_85> ignores XXXX nickname
[07:03] <Music_Shuffle> You don't see that person's comments.
[07:03] <syte> cyber linux, i've tried that
[07:03] <jakub_> Tango_Down: you probably don't have direct rendering: try glxinfo | grep rendering
[07:03] <lupine_85> second-best after a ban/kline
[07:03] <rajshekhar> for linux administrator which institute would i refer
[07:03] <Music_Shuffle> What does GLX gears even do?
[07:03] <syte> it didnt work it asked me for the ip's password
[07:03] <B_166-ER-X> whats the command to list the running processes ? (like on a frozen cd-rom) ?
[07:03] <Flick> AiGLX is so much better than XGL and simpler to set up
[07:03] <Cyber_Linux> syte, "man ssh"
[07:03] <lupine_85> rajshekhar: qualifications-wise, the LPI
[07:03] <syte> i have an ssh server as well
[07:03] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah, much simpler.
[07:03] <Tango_Down> Thank you.
[07:03] <lupine_85> linux professionals institute
[07:03] <Music_Shuffle> Anyone? GLXGears does...?
[07:04] <hlds> Thx people for everything lol.
[07:04] <Music_Shuffle> Watching the gears, I just see no point to it. >.>
[07:04] <jakub_> Music_Shuffle: it displays a simple OpenGL program that has three rotating gears
[07:04] <Flick> GLX Gears is realy just to show you that your OpenGL is working
[07:04] <Cyber_Linux> syte, if it asked for password give it one, otherwise im assuming ure not ment to be connecting :P
[07:04] <jakub_> Music_Shuffle: it's to test if your opengl + direct rendering is intact
[07:04] <hlds> ill just go ask for my pc back.
[07:04] <Music_Shuffle> Oh, so there's no cool readout or anything?
[07:04] <Aggrav8d> please, somebody, i'm going nuts.   i destroyed my installed copy of mysql and i need to do a clean reinstall.  can someone walk me through the process?
[07:04] <rajshekhar> iupine 85 :where it is
[07:04] <llindy> bye4now guys
[07:04] <rapid> Aggrav8d, i'm sure there are docs designed fort his
[07:04] <Flick> there was a read out on 6.06 but but in 6.10 i dont get a read out
[07:04] <carutsu> frogzoo i found it, its on others or somethign
[07:04] <Aggrav8d> rapid - i can't find 'em.
[07:04] <n2diy> hlds, then you have to knock in his door?
[07:05] <lupine_85> Aggrav8d: apt-get remove --purge (package) && apt-get install (package)
[07:05] <Music_Shuffle> Aggrav8d, wish I could help, but I have no idea about MySQL, sorry.
[07:05] <carutsu> thank you
[07:05] <Flick> if GLX Gears dose not lag at all then its fine
[07:05] <rapid> Aggrav8d, try that.
[07:05] <Tango_Down> Correct direct rendering is not operational.
[07:05] <hlds> is not his door is my house lol.
[07:05] <Music_Shuffle> Flick, oh good.
[07:05] <jakub_> Agrajag: after you apt-get remove the mysql installation. locate mysql and remove pretty much every file that doesn't seem like it should exist (like configuration files, etc.)
[07:05] <Cyber_Linux> n2diy, leave him b
[07:05] <Tango_Down> Any advice on how to activate it?
[07:05] <zaatar> hey, how do i make a process stay running after i close the terminal?
[07:05] <hlds> my dad wants me to let him borow a pc.
[07:05] <jakub_> zaatar: check out screen
[07:05] <lupine_85> zaatar: exec <command>
[07:05] <rapid> zaatar, add a & at the end of the command
[07:05] <lupine_85> or use screen :D
[07:05] <lupine_85> rapid: that won't work
[07:05] <rapid> why?
[07:05] <rapid> yes it does
[07:05] <zaatar> yeah & doesn't work
[07:05] <lupine_85> the program will be terminated with it's parent
[07:05] <jakub_> because the backgroudned process ends at the end o the session
[07:05] <lupine_85> try it
[07:06] <zaatar> i did
[07:06] <rajshekhar> lupine_85 : where is LPI
[07:06] <n2diy> Cyber_Linux: 10-4
[07:06] <rapid> It works on my distribution
[07:06] <lupine_85> rajshekhar: no idea
[07:06] <lupine_85> google knows
[07:06] <Cyber_Linux> lol n2diy  :P
[07:06] <jakub_> lupine_85: if he's on BSD, then it should work...
[07:06] <lupine_85> rapid: your distro is...?
[07:06] <ThePub> rapid: it will only work if it's an autospawning process.
[07:06] <Cyber_Linux> dont want to spark it off again
[07:06] <carutsu> can anyone remind me how to cancel a sheduled shutdown?
[07:06] <rapid> lupine_85, slackware.
[07:06] <lupine_85> and this channel is...
[07:06] <ThePub> rapid: meaning.. when you kill the terminal the applicaqtion does quit, but respawns again.
[07:06] <Cyber_Linux> LOL
[07:06] <Cyber_Linux> BEAWHAHWAHA
[07:06] <jakub_> whoa, i don't think linux supports that at the kernel level rapid
[07:06] <Flick> if you are usning Nvidia gra[phis just install AutoMatix and install the Nvidia drivers with that then they should be set up and working
[07:06] <frogzoo> carutsu: atrm ?
[07:07] <Music_Shuffle> !automatix
[07:07] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:07] <lupine_85> !automatix
[07:07] <rapid> jakub_, it does!
[07:07] <Flick> u will have to restart X after installing the drivers to turn them on
[07:07] <Music_Shuffle> HAH! MY WIN!
[07:07] <Music_Shuffle> ^^
[07:07] <carutsu> frogzoo atrm? wasnt shutdown -someletter
[07:07] <lupine_85> better, just sudo apt-get install nvidia-glzx
[07:07] <lupine_85> erm, nvidia-glx
[07:07] <Cyber_Linux> :P
[07:07] <jakub_> rapid: not according to what i've read about it. but if you're a staunch advocate for it, i'll go test on my slackware box later tonight
[07:07] <Cyber_Linux> spelling ftl
[07:07] <frogzoo> carutsu: -c
[07:07] <frogzoo> carutsu: also, man shutdown
[07:07] <Music_Shuffle> lupine_85, what for now?
[07:07] <rapid> jakub_, you do that :)
[07:07] <ThePub> rapid: & is a bash command to background an application, it's still tied to the bash process that started it though.
[07:07] <jakub_> anyway, now that (hopefully) the trolls have left, can someone please answer my question?
[07:08] <the_rick> hlds: What OS you running?
[07:08] <Flick> Lupin: doing the Apt-get may not all ways work for evry body
[07:08] <carutsu> frogzoo the problem is i dont know how to get out of a man
[07:08] <jakub_> i have a problem with a chinese file that i have mounted via samba
[07:08] <jakub_> what fonts would i need to view chinese files properly on the command line?
[07:08] <frogzoo> carutsu: q
[07:08] <jakub_> so /mnt/mount/mandarin/????.doc is what i want to copy over to my home directory
[07:08] <dellthinker> nmap
[07:08] <lupine_85> Flick: doing it the automatix way will screw it for many people
[07:08] <jakub_> i can stat the file, but i can't copy the file because cp says stat failed
[07:08] <Flick> it didnt work for my friend but Automatix did
[07:08] <carutsu> frogzoo lol thank you
[07:08] <frogzoo> carutsu: also, man less
[07:08] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah, but don't recommend it HERE was lupine_85's point.
[07:08] <lupine_85> but apt-get + a couple of edits to /etc/X11/xorg.conf will do the trick
[07:08] <lupine_85> !worksforme
[07:08] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[07:08] <Music_Shuffle> Because officially, we don't support it.
[07:09] <lupine_85> this is, after all, the "Official Ubuntu Support Channel"... :p
[07:09] <dellthinker> Can anyone tell me why i cant fit a freebsd install on one cdr disc?
[07:09] <Music_Shuffle> Lol
[07:09] <Aggrav8d> how do i list pakages with dpkg?
[07:09] <Music_Shuffle> dellthinker, because its...too big?
[07:09] <carutsu> frogzoo if i type exec somecommand it closes the terminal
[07:09] <carutsu> si it stays
[07:09] <jakub_> dellthinker: you know that there are other channels right?
[07:09] <the_rick> lupine_85: So how do you configure your samba shares?
[07:09] <ThePub> Anyone know how to remove a mime association?
[07:09] <lupine_85> the_rick: I don't
[07:09] <lupine_85> I use ssh
[07:09] <n2diy> dellthinker: , yes, we don't do BSD
[07:09] <dellthinker> Music_Shuffle - well i see that, is there another way to install it with out having to do that and not pay for it?
[07:09] <ThePub> Specifically:  How do you fix Nautilus when its mime association is wrong.
[07:10] <Music_Shuffle> Those installs are designed to fit on one disk, aren't they?
[07:10] <lupine_85> ThePub: nautilus can edit MIME types
[07:10] <Cyber_Linux> lol
[07:10] <lupine_85> in the options somewhere
[07:10] <jakub_> dellthinker: okay, you can do a floppy install, but redirect all non-Ubuntu questions to *bsd channels, NOT HERE
[07:10] <dellthinker> n2diy - who does?
[07:10] <moab_> Anyone here running ubuntu 6.10 on a laptop with suspend functioning properly?
[07:10] <ThePub> lupine_85: mime and application assocation are two different things, if that is what you're getting at.
[07:10] <lupine_85> moab: yes, my acer works fine
[07:10] <Jordan_U> moab_: I am
[07:10] <the_rick> lupine_85: I do too, but my roommates use windows and want a simple way to move their pics to my server
[07:10] <lupine_85> ThePub: ah, OK
[07:10] <Cyber_Linux> dellthinker, /join #freebsd
[07:10] <rapid> !samba
[07:10] <frogzoo> carutsu: just type the command name, no exec
[07:10] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:10] <lupine_85> the_rick: sftp on their computer
[07:11] <lupine_85> or psftp, rather
[07:11] <Aggrav8d> ugh, i think i finally got it.  thank you one and all for putting up with my noobisms.
[07:11] <Cyber_Linux> this is #ubuntu we dont support freebsd :P
[07:11] <moab_> lupine:_thanks
[07:11] <frogzoo> moab_: 100s of people
[07:11] <Flick> Lupine:the only way Automatix can mess up yore system is if u dellete the repositories for Auotomatix to update from and you would have to be some kind of dumb ass to
[07:11] <carutsu> frogzoo: yes but if i, say shedule a shutdown the terminal just freezes
[07:11] <lupine_85> Flick: have you bothered to look at the source for automatix?
[07:11] <Tango_Down> ANyone know how to enable direct rendering, or can point me to the correct man file?
[07:11] <the_rick> lupine_85: I suppose that could work, but they won't like it.  Of course it is my server so they may have to deal.
[07:11] <n2diy> dellthinker: I know a guy that does, but he  doesn't participate much.
[07:11] <lupine_85> Or is that a stupid question?
[07:11] <Music_Shuffle> But officially, we DON'T support it.
[07:11] <lupine_85> the_rick: it's a standalone executable
[07:11] <mneptok> Flick: i would disagree
[07:11] <Music_Shuffle> And this channel is 'official'.
[07:11] <Jordan_U> !fglrx | Tango_Down
[07:11] <ubotu> Tango_Down: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:11] <Flick> Lupine: a lil breef y?
[07:12] <Music_Shuffle> the_rick, they want to move the files across?
[07:12] <lupine_85> meh, officially or not... if it worked and was safe, I'd recommend it. But it doesn't, and isn't
[07:12] <Music_Shuffle> On a LAN?
[07:12] <Music_Shuffle> lol
[07:12] <Tango_Down> The R128 drivers are installed according to the Package manager..
[07:12] <the_rick> lupine_85: I know sftp, but they are VERY windows oriented.  Giving them a user and mounting a drive to the right share just worked very well for them
[07:13] <Music_Shuffle> the_rick, just move them from their PC to yours.
[07:13] <moab_> well I must be missing something...i am unable to get it to happenin on this evo n610c...if anyone can point me to a solution i would be very grateful
[07:13] <lupine_85> heh, ok :) linux /can/ do samba, I'm sure
[07:13] <lupine_85> I've just never used it
[07:13] <Music_Shuffle> Samba is just installing the package.
[07:13] <Music_Shuffle> Rebooting.
[07:13] <lupine_85> !samba
[07:13] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:13] <the_rick> Music_Shuffle: Well, I don't want to be their file beeyotch either
[07:13] <Music_Shuffle> And then opening the folder to transfer files.
[07:13] <Flick> Automatix is grate just dont delete the Repositories for it or Automatix will not update when a new 1 comes meeding 90% of all your repositories are out of date
[07:13] <Music_Shuffle> Well, what are you trying to do?
[07:13] <mneptok> Ubuntu most certainly does Samba, and quite well.
[07:13] <lupine_85> ...sigh...
[07:13] <jakub_> Tango_Down: paste the output of dmesg before and after you sudo rmmod r128 (or whatever the driver is exactly) && sudo modprobe r128 (or whatever the driver is exactly), also paste the output of lspci on some sort of pastebin
[07:14] <Music_Shuffle> That was @ the_rick btw.
[07:14] <lupine_85> Automatix is almost as good as a dull fork to the testicular area.
[07:14] <Music_Shuffle> Rofl.
[07:14] <lupine_85> but it's off topic anyway
[07:14] <carutsu> i tried to open a song with amarok, its on a shared folder in a windoes pc, but it just crashes, is it amarok or samba?
[07:14] <the_rick> Music_Shuffle: Just have easy access to files for other people in my apartment (music, pics, etc)
[07:14] <Music_Shuffle> For you to access their files?
[07:14] <Music_Shuffle> Like, with samba, the REALLY easy setup will let you view their shared folders on your machine.
[07:14] <mneptok> carutsu: can you open other files via Samba?
[07:14] <the_rick> Music_Shuffle: No, them to access mine, but read/write
[07:15] <touchme> I'm about 4 hours from having to reformat to Winblows XP... can someone please help me prevent this by telling me how to make Kubuntu recognize my touchscreen monitor? It shows it being plugged into /dev/input/ts0, but the touchscreen part is still inactive. PLEASE help!
[07:15] <Music_Shuffle> So really, you can move stuff to them, and from them, but they're pretty restricted in what they can touch on yours
[07:15] <Flick> Carutsu:its most probly amarok
[07:15] <Music_Shuffle> Unless you go into more depth with the setup.
[07:15] <Jordan_U> How do I update the clamav database?
[07:15] <carutsu> mneptok yes, actually i can copy them or open files, but i can't play from there
[07:15] <mneptok> the_rick: you want Samba, and you want to read up on Unix permissions and smb.conf variables.
[07:15] <Flick> use a better program than amarok
[07:15] <lupine_85> amarok is great :)
[07:15] <lupine_85> it must be samba, as once mounted amarok can't tell the difference
[07:15] <Jordan_U> But nothing else is seriously super :(
[07:16] <the_rick> My real problem is I just want to configure samba with SWAT and not have to constantly edit text files
[07:16] <carutsu> flick: i though so, so i used kafeine instead, same result
[07:16] <n2diy> Anybody have Mondo working with Dapper?
[07:16] <Cyber_Linux> !touchscreen
[07:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about touchscreen - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:16] <jakub_> Flick: are you going to substantiate why or are you trying to start a holy war in here?
[07:16] <Flick> Songbird is 100 times better than amarok at playing music and u can allso surf the web in it
[07:16] <Music_Shuffle> Lol.
[07:16] <the_rick> but I can't login to SWAT without a root password
[07:16] <Music_Shuffle> jakub_, I was wondering that. :P
[07:16] <Music_Shuffle> the_rick, so use yours?
[07:16] <lupine_85> funny. I always thought web browsers were for surfing the web
[07:16] <carutsu> i like songbird, but its too slow for me right now
[07:16] <Music_Shuffle> Your login is your root password, unless you changed it.
[07:16] <Music_Shuffle> login pw*
[07:16] <lupine_85> although amarok's auto-load-wikipedia and auto-find-lyrics is very cool
[07:17] <the_rick> Music_Shuffle: I can't configure the shares when I log in with my password
[07:17] <mneptok> the_rick: trust me, you want to learn smb.conf configuration, not SWAT. SWAT requires a web server and more open ports. all you want is SMB. why install more services than you need just to get a GUI?
[07:17] <touchme> bots is empty as far as touchscreens are concerned
[07:17] <hiroki> hello. does anyone can help me with a bash script i'm trying to do?
[07:17] <Cyber_Linux> touchme,
[07:17] <the_rick> Music_Shuffle: When I log in with SWAT, it gives me a page that I can view the open connections but not change anything.
[07:17] <Cyber_Linux> have you checked the forums?
[07:17] <Flick> yeah but Songburd is a music player that has a mozilla web browser built in so if u go to a site that has links to music files like .mp3 then it can play then and they will come up in a nice play list and play strat off the web with in seconds
[07:17] <lupine_85> hiroki: ##bash ? or #bash, I forget
[07:17] <zaatar> Hey, i'm trying to compile some source code and it gives me a compiler error, says C compiler cannot create executables
[07:17] <the_rick> mneptok: You may be right.  I should just do it that way, but I've always just used SWAT in the past.
[07:17] <Cyber_Linux> you know how mny times i have found exactly what i need on the forums
[07:17] <zaatar> but i have gcc installed
[07:17] <lupine_85> zaatar: install build-essential
[07:17] <Music_Shuffle> Eh. Ive never tinkered enough with Samba to do that. I find my simple setup works ok for me.
[07:17] <lupine_85> you need ld, etc as well
[07:18] <hiroki> oh, ok. thanks.
[07:18] <lupine_85> hiroki: far more expertise there than here :)
[07:18] <mneptok> the_rick: smb.conf configuration is pretty easy, really. there are *tons* of samples on the web.
[07:18] <lupine_85> does SWAT bind to localhost ?
[07:18] <touchme> Yup Cyber_Linux, no one knows there either.
[07:18] <the_rick> mneptok: You are right.  Instead of b**chin about how it doesn't work, I should just use samba.conf

[07:19] <n2diy> zaatar, what's that?
[07:19] <the_rick> mneptok: However, in my defense, there should be a way to make SWAT work in Ubuntu
[07:19] <lupine_85> !pastebin
[07:19] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:19] <n2diy> I play with Xastir.
[07:19] <zaatar> n2diy, what's what?
[07:19] <Flick> If you like Firefox you will like Songbird its built by some of the guys who work on Firefox
[07:19] <lupine_85> Flick: MPL?
[07:19] <elysium441> I got two sound cards in my pc how can I switch between them? I use Alsa.
[07:19] <carutsu> i love firefox, however im fine with amarok right now
[07:20] <lupine_85> elysium441: one will be card 1/default, the other will be 2
[07:20] <frogzoo> the_rick: why exactly doesn't it work?
[07:20] <n2diy> never mind, it is your name.
[07:20] <Music_Shuffle> elysium441, System -> Prefs -> Sound
[07:20] <lupine_85> ALSA-aware applications let you specify the card you want to use
[07:20] <elysium441> yes
[07:20] <the_rick> frogzoo: So when I go to the login page, you cannot log in as root (no password set) and if I log in as my user, I have no admin access
[07:20] <Flick> lupine: soz half a sleep i will kick my self for asken but what dose MPL stand for?
[07:20] <elysium441> is there any command
[07:20] <lupine_85> Mozilla Public License
[07:20] <the_rick> frogzoo: I can log in as my user, but that only allows me to view current setup, not change anything
[07:21] <zaatar> how do i check what version of gtk i have?
=== Cyber_Linux is now known as Cyber_AFT
[07:21] <Flick> oh yeah
[07:21] <lupine_85> so why should I use it when a perfectly good GPL alternative is available?
[07:21] <mneptok> the_rick: http://pastebin.ca/285993 <--- there's one of my public read/write share entries from an smb.conf file
[07:22] <frogzoo> the_rick: I suspect you could fix this by creating a 'samba' group & chgrp the requisite files
[07:22] <elysium441> without using alsaconf is there any other way?
[07:22] <elysium441> a command but not alsaconf
[07:22] <lupine_85> elysium441: on a per-application basis?
[07:22] <lupine_85> or system-wide?
[07:22] <the_rick> mneptok: Thanks, I'll give it a go
[07:22] <zaatar> How can i fix this error: checking for GTK... configure: error: GTK+-2.8 is required to compile
[07:23] <mneptok> the_rick: be aware, Samba *strictly* obeys Unix permissions
[07:23] <lupine_85> !info gtk
[07:23] <ubotu> Package gtk does not exist in any distro I know
[07:23] <the_rick> mneptok: So just chmod 777?
[07:23] <the_rick> for ease
[07:23] <Tango_Down> Oops. Sorry about that.
[07:23] <Flick> just take a look at SongBird ment to be the Open source alterative to programs like iTunes song birdworks a lot better than iTunes dose for 1 it has 100% no DRM
[07:23] <frogzoo> the_rick: noes - don't do that
[07:24] <the_rick> Well, maybe no execute
[07:24] <lupine_85> !info ? amarok does iPod interfacing as well
[07:24] <ubotu> Package  does not exist in edgy
[07:24] <lupine_85> it's pretty standard
[07:24] <lupine_85> ooops
[07:24] <zaatar> lupine_85, !info is not found
[07:24] <lupine_85> and it's still an MPL program
[07:24] <lupine_85> zaatar: forgot to delete half an old line :p
[07:24] <zaatar> so just gtk?
[07:25] <mneptok> the_rick: sudo mkdir /home/samba && sudo chmod 755 /home/samba && sudo mkdir /home/samba/public && sudo chmod -R 777 /home/samba/public
[07:25] <lupine_85> zaatar: try installing the libgtk development files
[07:25] <Flick> yeam but in amarok can u got a sit in side the program that has mp3's on it and a play list for them come up and u click and up 2 3seconds later the play
[07:25] <lupine_85> search for them in synaptic or adept
[07:25] <the_rick> mneptok: Yes, that is what I was thinking...
[07:25] <anddreaz> any have blu  distributor-logo.png??
[07:25] <Flick> site*
[07:26] <mneptok> the_rick: then just paste my entry, and replace "samba-public" with just "samba" then restart samba
[07:26] <lupine_85> Flick.... you're completely missing the main thrust of my argument
[07:26] <Flick> lupine what do you meen
[07:26] <lupine_85> although it does have integration with last.fm
[07:26] <lupine_85> MPL != GPL
[07:26] <lupine_85> these things are important

[07:27] <touchme> Is there like a channel or number that I can call that I could pay for support on touchscreens? I"m pretty desparate here.
[07:27] <Flick> Lupine: who realy cares as long as its a good program its free and u can get the source for it
[07:27] <lupine_85> ^^

[07:28] <anddreaz> sorry
[07:28] <mneptok> frogzoo: we cannot guarantee hardware support, though.
[07:29] <jakub_> touchme: try #hardware
[07:29] <Flick> i like to no that a program is not stoping my freeedom to do what i like
[07:29] <mneptok> frogzoo: if that touchscreen vendor has supplied no basic information to the Linux community a support contract won't magically make that happen, sadly.

[07:34] <JediSpam> and does anyone have it working
[07:34] <Flick> most are anti mac tho
[07:34] <lupine_85> JediSpam: probably not
[07:34] <lupine_85> depends on whether they're using 64bit cores, I guess
[07:35] <Flick> no 64bit is mostly for AMD processors i think
[07:35] <elysium444> joke me
[07:35] <Flick> ok u asked for the joke u get it
[07:35] <mercykiller> AMD64 != EM64T
[07:35] <Flick> This is Linux land In silent nights you can hear the Windows machines rebooting
[07:35] <leandro-1> why to activate beryl, don see windows border?
[07:35] <lupine_85> mercykiller: they're compatibly
[07:35] <elysium444> :)
[07:35] <lupine_85> compatible*
[07:35] <n2diy> Next
[07:35] <lupine_85> amd64 kernel runs on em64t arch
[07:36] <mercykiller> lupine_85: Didn't know that
[07:36] <mercykiller> heh
[07:36] <Flick> AMD64 works diffrent to EM64T
[07:36] <lupine_85> amd beat intel to the 64-bit desktop, so intel  followed their lead :D

[07:37] <TraceGreen> Hello, does any one know what file "vax-order 68k blit mpx/mux execuable" is? Is it compressed file?
[07:37] <mneptok> leandro-1: you need a new Metacity with Beryl, iirc
[07:37] <frogzoo> !sound | wero
[07:37] <ubotu> wero: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[07:37] <Music_Shuffle> leandro-1, run Emerald.
[07:37] <leandro-1> yep
[07:37] <lupine_85> TraceGreen: it's an executable for a VAX

[07:38] <leandro-1> music_shuffle thanks
[07:38] <Music_Shuffle> GL.
[07:38] <Flick> AMD64 has some diff Instructions EM64T some of it mite work and some of it will not its not been fully tessted would be nice to get a 64Bit intel and test it my self i only have a AMD64
[07:39] <rcrook> can you get ubuntu for sparc?
[07:40] <sirk234au> does anyone know of any benchmarking tools in ubuntu?
[07:40] <mneptok> rcrook: yes

[07:40] <rcrook> cool.:) got a u2 at work that needs it
[07:40] <Flick> to get Ubuntu for sparcs i think you need the Power Pc install
[07:40] <scott__> If I wanted to write and compile a C Program in Ubuntu, what would be the fastest way_
[07:40] <J-_> If so, is there anyway I can fix it?
[07:40] <sirk234au> thanks
[07:40] <lupine_85> scott__: kdevelop is your friend
[07:40] <Music_Shuffle> There's not a SPARC install?
[07:40] <jakub_> scott__: this is heavily biased as you can use any compiler and any editor: vim + gcc.
[07:40] <mneptok> Flick: no. SPARC and PPC are completely different architectures.
[07:41] <Flick> i didnt no that
[07:41] <carutsu> is there an wasy way to work with the n~, and accents on kubuntu?
[07:41] <mneptok> Music_Shuffle: yes, there is a separate SPARC CD
[07:41] <Flick> unless its standat PC hardware i couldnt realy tell you about it
[07:41] <lupine_85> ubuntu only supports 3 archs - i386, amd64, sparc - iirc
[07:41] <Music_Shuffle> Thought so ;D
[07:41] <lupine_85> !architectures
[07:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about architectures - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:41] <lupine_85> bah
[07:41] <mneptok> lupine_85: PPC
[07:42] <lupine_85> my ubotu-fu is low today
[07:42] <lupine_85> erm, yeah. ppc :)
[07:42] <Music_Shuffle> lupine_85, so wait...if you run dual, which do you install?
[07:42] <lupine_85> dual...?
[07:42] <Music_Shuffle> Right. Cored. Such as a C2D, x2, Opteron, Xeon, what have you.
[07:42] <lupine_85> if it's CPUs, then all the kernels come with SMP support these days
[07:42] <lupine_85> so it doesn't matter
[07:42] <Flick> if u run intel Dual get the standard i386 install
[07:42] <lupine_85> you run the kernel appropriate to your architecture, regardless of how many cores you have
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> Oh so you would pick which then? The AMD64 works with not just the AMD chips, correct?
[07:43] <ForgeAus> hmmm I preeefer Konversation over this.... bbbbbbrb...
[07:43] <mneptok> Music_Shuffle: you install whatever architecture it is, and the -generic kernel in Edgy contains all the SMP stuffs.
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> Or solely the Athlon 64/FX series?
[07:43] <Flick> but it its amd get the 64bit or i386
[07:43] <rcrook> the u2 I have at work has two ultra sparcs
[07:43] <lupine_85> AMD64 works with x86_64 architecture
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> Right. So if its a C2D chip, which would you--ahh ok.
[07:43] <lupine_85> I have no idea what architecture a core 2 duo chip is, though
[07:43] <harry> ubuntu 6.10!
[07:43] <lupine_85> last intel chip I had was a celeron 433MHz... and I used it for 2 days :p
[07:43] <mneptok> Music_Shuffle: C2D can use i386/i686 or AMD64
[07:44] <lupine_85> everything else has been amd - from K6-2 233MHz. to 2500+ Sempron64
[07:44] <Music_Shuffle> mneptok, is one preferable to the other?
[07:44] <harry> whats the new features of edgy?
[07:44] <Flick> AMD64 hasnot realy been fully tessted on any other 64bit chips than AMD cus of the Instructions sets in processors but could some 1 post to the Ubuntu forums if they get a intell 64 fully working on AMD64 install would be goot to know cus my friend asked me the same thing
[07:45] <PORDO> harry it's just prettier and stuff.
[07:45] <mneptok> AMD64 ain't a great choice for desktop use as there's no Flash, and getting it to work is more hassle that it's worth, IMO. besides, with <4GB RAM the performance gain will be negligible.
[07:45] <carutsu> is there an wasy way to work with the n~, and accents (tildes) on kubuntu?
[07:45] <Music_Shuffle> FF 2.0! :D
[07:45] <Flick> edgy has AiGLX much better than XGL
[07:45] <harry> PORDO: does it still look like the dapper drake desktop?
[07:45] <Music_Shuffle> mneptok, with a budget that allows me to get >4 gigs of RAM, I'll not mind using i686. :P
[07:46] <DebiaKnight> how is ubuntu pronounced anywho?
[07:46] <maitivolksfi> I could really use some help with my WiFi if anyone here can.  I'v spent 2 days going through HOWTOs, forums, and other pages.
[07:46] <Music_Shuffle> Ooh-boon-too?
[07:46] <FiFo> hi all
[07:46] <Flick> Ture AMD64 install is pointless i have a AMD64 processor but still go with the i386 install as its the 1 i find runs best on my processor
[07:46] <lukasz> witam
[07:46] <jakub_> maitivolksfi: what do you need?
[07:46] <mneptok> DebiaKnight: "sek'SAY"

[07:48] <mneptok> maitivolksfi: iirc, the BC43xx stuff doesn;t need ndiwrapper, just the firware cutter and firmware injection.
[07:48] <lupine_85> have you tried using the bcm43xx driver? :p

[07:50] <Music_Shuffle> YES. aldsj!

[07:54] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:54] <Music_Shuffle> Geoffrey2, see, like lupine_85 said, then you can't protect people FROM that sort of information.
[07:54] <maitivolksfi> initially the network util in the system menu had a wifi thing with the title eth1.  One of the supposed helpful guides I followed had me delete the eth1 line in /etc/iftab because they said on reboot the system will find that hardware and call it wlan0.  Neither of those things appear now...
[07:54] <lupine_85> but seriously, deb repos are orders of magnitude simpler than the windows method of installing things. Why persist with broken attempts to make it even simpler?
[07:54] <Music_Shuffle> Laziness.
[07:54] <Flick> all right then i can give vista beta keys away microsoft sed it can bee used on up to 10 computer but it only works on the beta
[07:55] <Music_Shuffle> ./Sigh.
[07:55] <jakub_> thank you

[07:57] <jakub_> maitivolksfi: if you have the ndiswrapper loaded, then what does iwconfig show you (if you can't find it locate iwconfig)
[07:57] <carutsu> se yya guys
[07:57] <the_rick> mneptok: Thanks, everything looks good on all ends now
[07:58] <Kcilf> any body hacked Mac OS X yet and put gnome on it
[07:58] <the_rick> Should have just looked through the smb.conf file, I think I could have figured it out
[07:58] <the_rick> call me lazy
[07:58] <jakub_> by the way, Kcilf = Flick if it's not painfully obvious enough
[07:58] <maitivolksfi> iwconfig tells me that lo, eth0, and sit0 all have no wireless extensions.
[07:58] <Kcilf> thats the point
[07:58] <lupine_85> maitivolksfi: any useful output in dmesg ?
[07:58] <mneptok> the_rick: splendid. :)
[07:58] <jakub_> maitivolksfi: strange. so dmesg | grep wlan0 ?
[07:58] <lupine_85> and how about ndiswrapper -l ?

[07:59] <the_rick> mneptok: I'm finally going to become one of those die hard "only edit config files with vi and scripts" guys at this rate
[07:59] <maitivolksfi> oh, wait
[08:00] <the_rick> ;)
[08:00] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: then possibly try with grep -i wlan0
[08:00] <mneptok> the_rick: *gasp* then you might become one of those "i don't understand how you can effectively remotely manage services with a GUI" people!
[08:01] <the_rick> lol
[08:01] <maitivolksfi> it says ndiswrapper loaded, driver is not 32bit, bad magic, could not prepare driver bcmwl5, load ndiswrapper failed, check system log
[08:01] <the_rick> baby steps
[08:01] <lupine_85> maitivolksfi: what it says. Use a 32-bit driver.
[08:02] <maitivolksfi> hmm, i thought this was, it came from the downloads of dell.com acording to my service tag
[08:02] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: try /var/log/messages as well
[08:04] <sw33t> wow my internet is so GAY today
[08:04] <sw33t> internet explore dont work but mirc msn aim and stuff.
[08:05] <lupine_85> ...
[08:05] <Ralith> hey
[08:05] <jfrench> Maybe dont use IE
[08:05] <maitivolksfi> I grepped ndiswrapper, but didn't get anything. I'll try to grab one off the ndiswarpper list drivers and give it another go. Still not sure why it disagreed w/ the drivers from the dell site.
[08:05] <Ralith> I've installed flashplugin-nonfree, but there's no matching .so in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins

[08:09] <murali> hi all
[08:09] <fnf> Is there a way to make moving between workspaces 'wrap-around' in GNOME/metacity ? Currently I cannot switch from 1-> with the Ctrl-Alt-(Arrow) key, it becomes pretty annoying.
[08:09] <jakub_2006> murali: you aren't running IRC as root are you?
[08:09] <fnf> !Hi | murali
[08:09] <ubotu> murali: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:10] <Ralith> crimsun_, 9
[08:10] <Ralith> lupine_85, what?
[08:10] <lupine_85> ??
[08:10] <murali> jakub_2006:yup..hou'd u knou tht?
[08:10] <crimsun_> Ralith: using the version in backports?
[08:10] <Ralith> [23:05:36]  <lupine_85> Ralith: dpkg
[08:10] <murali> hi fnf
[08:10] <Ralith> crimsun_, dunno
[08:10] <lupine_85> oh, the command. Will tell you what files are installed by the package
[08:10] <crimsun_> Ralith: dpkg -l flashplugin-nonfree |grep ^ii
[08:11] <Madpilot> murali, because you came in here as 'root@125.22.88.174'
[08:11] <Seamus7> Hi... how can I disable my wireless card during boot up?
[08:11] <lupine_85> of course, I've just remembered that the package doesn't actually install the .so - just downloads and runs the installer
[08:11] <maitivolksfi> use my comoputer
[08:11] <maitivolksfi> that will make your wireless not work
[08:11] <Ralith> crimsun_, you sure it's ^ii? Nothing returned
[08:11] <murali> madpilot:oh ok..
[08:11] <crimsun_> Ralith: then you don't have flashplugin-nonfree installed
[08:12] <crimsun_> Ralith: apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree
[08:12] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: i totally understand your frustration man. sorry for not being of much help, and though people here may advise against me saying this: try somewhere like ##linux (where honestly you'll meet much less n00bs)
[08:12] <maitivolksfi> jakub_2006, I figured out what I was looking at.  There is no mention of any networking devices that I can tell other than the 10/100/1000 ethernet card.
[08:12] <murali> can somone plz tell where can i find actual code ,atleast snippets of them,the way they are implemented in networking.. i'm tired of jus reading. i want to see actually how they work..
[08:12] <Music_Shuffle> The trick is to have a problem lots of others have.
[08:13] <maitivolksfi> Thats one thing I have noticed in the small amount of time I have spent here.  Its the default irc channel for Ubuntu so lots of traffic and lots of people who don't really want/need to be here/know where here is.
=== drunkmist is now known as numist
[08:13] <jakub_2006> murali: what language? C? then go to ##c, C++? then go to ##c++, Java, Perl, PHP, et al? go to their respective channels
[08:13] <un_operateur> . o 0 ( I think he wants ubuntu++ )
[08:14] <lupine_85> a lack of source-code in an open-source os? not likely!
[08:14] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: totally agree and it causes a great deal of frustration. at least the ops here are responsive though.
[08:14] <murali> and i was jus curious.. where can i see the header information of the packets tht leave my computer or come into it... is there a way tht i can know tht..??
[08:14] <lupine_85> just apt-get source $some_package and see how $some_package does what it does
[08:14] <jakub_2006> murali: check out wireshark or tcpdump
[08:14] <lupine_85> murali: ethereal/wireshark
[08:14] <jakub_2006> lupine_85: it's officially wireshark now though.. but sure ethereal
[08:14] <murali> jakub_2006:are those commands or  tools??
[08:14] <un_operateur> lupine_85, some non-free and commercial packages dont have source counterparts eh
[08:15] <lupine_85> "some"
[08:15] <lupine_85> most packages will have the source, though :)
[08:15] <lupine_85> and it's certainly educational, looking through
[08:15] <Seamus7> Hi... I need to install a patch in order to fix a bug that is preventing my system from booting even in recovery mode ... I've read that either turning on wireless while Ubuntu boots or disabling the wireless device will allow me to fully boot up so that I can apply the patch... any idea how i can do either 1) enable wifi while booting or 2) disabling the wireless device???
[08:15] <jakub_2006> murali: is there a difference? for your purposes, it doesn't matter. just sudo apt-get install ngrep tcpdump wireshark
[08:15] <un_operateur> lupine_85, aye, but you said --  a lack of source-code in an open-source os? not likely!
[08:16] <murali> jakub_2006:thanks so much
[08:16] <lupine_85> I could calculate a p-value from the ratio of open to closed-source programs in the repos, but I'd be taking you a bit too literally then :p
[08:16] <jakub_2006> murali: no problem, good day
[08:16] <lupine_85> but if you want to learn basic TCP/IP programming skills, where better to start than apt-get source netcat ?
[08:16] <corey> quit
[08:17] <velvetgreen> hello - is this the ubuntu crowd?
[08:17] <lupine_85> velvetgreen: yep :)

[08:17] <velvetgreen> hi lupine!  i am logging in via windows but have ubuntu running on my other machine!
[08:17] <jakub_2006> lupine_85: i would actually try to understand the basics of programming as everything else related to it is irrelevant (it just comes naturally after that). looking through well developed, but massive applications, is probably not the best place to start. but again, this is *offtopic*
[08:18] <lupine_85> mm, netcat is massive, I agree... :p
[08:18] <velvetgreen> i need to add the chatzilla to my ubuntu firefox
[08:18] <swami> hi all
[08:18] <frogzoo> velvetgreen: it's under extensions
[08:18] <lupine_85> I'd say that how to get source-code in a ubuntu distro using ubuntu features is on-topic for a ubuntu chan though
[08:18] <velvetgreen> so - is everyone on edgy yet?
[08:18] <swami> anyone works with mono around here?
[08:18] <jakub_2006> lupine_85: agreed
[08:18] <velvetgreen> thanks frog

[08:18] <ubotu> You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[08:18] <frogzoo> velvetgreen: well the LTS server edition is 6.06, so I'd guess not
[08:19] <swami> any one using monodevelop around here?
[08:19] <lupine_85> velvetgreen: not everyone

[08:19] <velvetgreen> i felt brave going to edgy from dapper all by myself - but it worked
[08:19] <velvetgreen> EVENTUALLY
[08:19] <lupine_85> probably a good proportion though

[08:20] <Seamus7> Here's a tricky question: How can I get into my file system when I'm experiencing a bug that is preventing boot up even in recovery mode? I need to apply a patch from launchpad.
[08:20] <lupine_85> magic_ninja: should work regardless
[08:20] <maitivolksfi> I'm definetly going for the one from the ndiswrapper page now,

[08:21] <velvetgreen> i had to rebuild the kernel tomake VMWARE run - but the rest was fine
[08:21] <jakub_2006> Geoffrey2: it's a bug in the nonfree Flash 9 by Adobe. they say they are trying to fix it though...

[08:29] <CaptainDoom> anybody with a laptop using twinview for a second screen successfully?
[08:29] <aztracker1> hmm.. okay, looks like it's already 9... not sure, haven't tried any flash 8-9 sites lately..
[08:30] <coopster> nothlit: if i can fix the resolution, that's fine by me, but do you have a clue how i'd get there before X loads automatically?\
[08:30] <maitivolksfi> CaptainDoom, I'v heard of it happening.  I haven't tried myself but no problems with the graphics drivers so I don't know why it wouldn't work
[08:30] <nothlit> coopster, ctrl + alt + f1 sudo /etc/init,d/gdm stop
[08:31] <CaptainDoom> ive kind of gotten it working by accident but i really can't figure out what i'm doing
[08:32] <aztracker1> cool, must not have noticed the update whenever it happened...
[08:32] <CaptainDoom> at first i had the system detecting both monitors, but now that i've read the documentation i can't remember how i did it
[08:32] <aztracker1> was on 7 for a long time..
[08:32] <maitivolksfi> ati or nvidia?
[08:32] <coopster> nothlit: ty
[08:32] <aztracker1> now if MS will release WPF/E
[08:32] <CaptainDoom> kinda hoping somebody with working twinview could post their xorg.conf
[08:32] <CaptainDoom> nvidia
[08:34] <moab_> anyone here running on a Evo n610c laptop
[08:34] <CaptainDoom> no success stories i guess?
[08:34] <un_operateur> !anyone
[08:34] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:34] <maitivolksfi> just looking at it, I'd guess you need a monitor section for each different kind you have
[08:34] <moab_> the real question is that suspend aint happenin
[08:34] <maitivolksfi> also 2 screen sections
[08:35] <moab_> i was wondering if i could find some newer info that "it will be addressed in the next kernel"
[08:35] <coopster> is there a good howto on how to run 64-bit edgy with a chroot/linux32 support?  and/or does anyone who uses it feel that it's ready?
[08:35] <moab_> from a message i saw from april of this year
[08:36] <un_operateur> moab_, I take it you've upgraded the kernel since?
[08:36] <maitivolksfi> yeah, actually now that I look at it closer I have no idea how I would do that manually. CaptainDoom.
[08:36] <moab_> i am running 6.10
[08:36] <maitivolksfi> I did it under slack with the proporietary nvidia driver b/c it comes with the gui config tool
[08:37] <maitivolksfi> I don't think ubuntu has the same one.
[08:37] <CaptainDoom> i have had it half-ass working with only one section of each. i get the 2 monitor sections now, but which screen section would get the twinview options?
[08:37] <moab_> from the cd
[08:37] <un_operateur> what happens when you try and suspend?
[08:37] <moab_> i believe i did all of the updates provided
[08:38] <J-_> Is there anyway that I can give permissions to something which'll let my controller work in zsnes as user?
[08:38] <moab_> got the W200 running thanks to some nice instructions i found but i am stumped on suspend....
[08:38] <CaptainDoom> oops those options go in device anyway... maybe i just need sleep. thanks for your patience
[08:38] <maitivolksfi> My guess (could be completely wrong) would be that you have to do something in addition to the xorg.conf file.  maybe somehting with the 'nvidia' driver itself, some kind of flag or something
[08:38] <moab_> it freezes and requires a hard reboot
[08:38] <un_operateur> moab_, some packages are held back from updating -- especially the linux kernel -- you can check if there are any -- sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude upgrade
[08:39] <lupine_85> apt-get dist-upgrade is your friend
[08:39] <moab_> i found a message and that a bug report had been submitted ling before 6.10 even came out so i figured i was good to go
[08:39] <un_operateur> lupine_85, he's already on edgy as far as i can see
[08:39] <moab_> am wrong to make that assumption?
[08:39] <CaptainDoom> i'll take another shot at it once i've had some rest. if i can get it working simply i'll post my results on forum
[08:39] <lupine_85> un_operateur: dist-upgrade  doesn't care
[08:40] <maitivolksfi> good luck
[08:40] <J-_> Is there anyway that I can give permissions to something which'll let my controller work in zsnes as user rather tahn root?
[08:40] <moab_> un_operator_:thanks i will look at that
[08:40] <lupine_85> it upgrades all available packages, in most cases - like ones skipped by upgrade
[08:40] <un_operateur> moab_, well, what you can do is see if there has been any progress in regards to the bug report filed out
[08:41] <coopster> J-_:  check the permissions on your controller device (/dev/joystick maybe?) and make sure that all users can access it, that may be the problem
[08:41] <moab_> yeah i tried that and the message bounced back saying i wasnt allowed to post....i guess i will have to find a faq for the mailing list
[08:42] <un_operateur> moab_, the issue probably goes beyond just ubuntu -- since it's probably an ACPI issue, you might like to check out the various other mailing lists too
[08:42] <fek> moin
[08:42] <barata> G.OO.D N.EW.S: Picasa really suckSSSSSSSSSSSS
[08:42] <J-_> k cool i'll check it out
[08:42] <barata> NEVER install that Windoz hybrid in Linux
[08:43] <barata> it's just a matter of fact for now that Linux has no good pics browser like ACDSee in Windoz
[08:43] <maitivolksfi> hopefully someone knows what the arp (number) flag in /etc/iftab means and will tell me...
[08:43] <barata> gthumb should be the best we can get by with for now
[08:43] <un_operateur> barata, it depends on how you define good -- good as in functional and practical or good as in pretty and beautified

[08:44] <CaptainDoom> if there were two screen and 2 monitor sections, how do you identify which correlate? is there a way to assign one of each to DFP and one of each to CRT?
[08:44] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: two line flood follows (if you man 5 iftab, you would see the same, but i don't know what your man page installation status is..)
[08:44] <coopster> !hi | kgs
[08:44] <ubotu> kgs: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:44] <jakub_2006>        arp arp-type
[08:44] <jakub_2006>               Matches the ARP type (also known as the Link type) of the interface, which can be obtained by using ifconfig(8) or ip(8).
[08:44] <jakub_2006> hmm, three line, that's still fine.
[08:44] <J-_> coopster: yeah there's no /dev/joystick
[08:45] <barata> good as it can nice itself ... I highlight like 100 pics to open with Picasa .. then my system was busy for 30' and I just cannot do anything
[08:45] <moab_> un_operator_:yes that IS the case from what i have read...also I have not been able to find any info more current than this link provides   https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/laptop-testing-team/2006-April/000642.html
[08:45] <barata> killing each of them is like a gonorhea in the ass
[08:45] <maitivolksfi> ok, thats what I see.  I tried man /etc/iftab
[08:45] <maitivolksfi> I'll figure all this out one of these days
[08:45] <un_operateur> !language | barata
[08:45] <ubotu> barata: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:46] <barata> ca va operateur ... ca marche pas si on parle le francais ... n'est-ce pas con?
[08:46] <J-_> Is there anyway that I can give permissions to something which'll let my controller work in zsnes as user?
[08:46] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: usually, a configuration file will have a man page with the syntax man <configuration file> and not man absolute-path/<configuration path>
[08:46] <pitillo> hi good morning. Im trying to dont load some modules at ubuntus startup. I added them to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist in this way "blacklist module" but seems that they load. Anyone know what am I missing?
[08:46] <coopster> J-_: well, the file will be different depending on your controller, but it should be recorded in the zsnes settings
[08:46] <kgs> I have been searching the Ubuntu website, but have been unable to find any information on the minimum system requirements. Does anyone have any idea what they may be? I am planning on installing it on a virtual machine (with VMware).
[08:46] <maitivolksfi> noted, thanks
[08:46] <J-_> coopster: k i'll try and find it
[08:47] <CaptainDoom> ohh then identifier name... that's it i'm too tired to make sense. thanks
[08:47] <barata> kgs: just download the dvd, burn it, put it on your cd tray and run it
[08:47] <barata> its not gonna install anything
[08:47] <barata> you dont even need an VM
[08:47] <barata> it's called 'livecd'
[08:48] <barata> just make sure you can boot from cd ... that's it
[08:49] <kgs> Okay.
[08:49] <wasabi__> what's a good alternative linux usenet program that rivals newsleecher?
[08:50] <barata> most probably (depending on your chipsets & system of course) you can also go online kgs
[08:50] <mneptok> wasabi__: try Pan
[08:50] <coopster> wasabi_: klibido works pretty well
[08:51] <pitillo> !blacklist
[08:51] <ubotu> To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add "blacklist modulename" to the end of that list
[08:51] <wasabi__> okay. does it have a super search like newleecher?
[08:51] <wasabi__> news*
[08:51] <coopster> wasabi_: nope
[08:52] <wasabi__> lol looks like they've been busy updating pan huh...
[08:52] <wasabi__> hah
[08:53] <wasabi__> so if i am searching for a certain file. then is there a good web-based usenet search engine i can use?
[08:54] <wasabi__> i'm trying to find hdtv rips of frontline
[08:54] <wasabi__> if anyone watches that show... i highly doubt it since it's on pbs
[08:54] <wasabi__> hah
[08:56] <wasabi__> eh i'll just try newsleecher on wine

[09:05] <gvikaskc> hello all i m a lawyer! and we work on legal worksheet/page. when ever i open OpenOffice2.0 i have to set Page properties to US legal from A4. is there any way to make it permanent
[09:06] <maitivolksfi> !!!!!!!!!
[09:06] <maitivolksfi> My "WiFi is on" indicator light just came on!
[09:06] <kane77> are there any tests out there that would prove or fail 64bit linux actualy being faster than the 32??
[09:07] <Gunny> Yes
[09:07] <jamesbrose> Get to pc's
[09:07] <Gunny> It's approx 15% faster
[09:07] <kgs> I plan on installing Ubuntu, but I don't want to reformat my entire disk. Does the live disk or installation disk offer a way to resize a Windows NTFS partition(s) safely to allocate the space I need for Ubuntu?
[09:08] <maitivolksfi> ....but my router is not here at the moment, so I can't test it.
[09:08] <kgs> I want to keep Windows, because there are some games I can't let go of.
[09:08] <lupine_85> kgs: resizing ntfs is possible
[09:09] <lupine_85> HOWEVER, IME it's not particularly
[09:09] <lupine_85> ...safe
[09:09] <gvikaskc> can any one help me on openoffice
[09:09] <maitivolksfi> but ifconfig lists wlan1 as a real device with a mac address and everything, I think its going to work.  Thanks for the help those of you who are still awake...
[09:09] <lupine_85> so if you want the live cd to do it for you, please - please - make a backup
[09:09] <kgs> Oh no..

[09:10] <maitivolksfi> kgs: I have had lots of luck with partition magic doing that if you have access to that piece of software
[09:10] <kgs> partition magic?
[09:10] <kgs> That's a Windows XP app?
[09:10] <maitivolksfi> yeah
[09:10] <kgs> Hmm..
[09:10] <kgs> And it would be safer?
[09:10] <lupine_85> kgs: much
[09:10] <nicois> it's much better than parted, last time i tried it
[09:10] <kgs> Alright..
[09:10] <maitivolksfi> I can't guarantee it, but I have resized ntfs partitions successfully with it
[09:11] <kgs> I'll look into it.
[09:11] <lupine_85> I've never heard of partition magic breaking an ntfs partition. ntfsresize, however, I /know/ has broken at least 2
[09:11] <kgs> I suppose.
[09:11] <nicois> ghost 2003 is also handy, if you don't mind commercial apps (I missed the start of the convo, so not 100% sure what the situation is)
[09:11] <maitivolksfi> its *usually* not free I believe
[09:12] <Toma-> What would be the best server to use for a single connection to it, hosting 1 webpage that has java and flash content?
[09:12] <kane77> kgs,  I used partition manager, as partition magic couldnt figure out my partitioning...
[09:12] <nicois> can anyone help me with an lvm problem I have in edgy? i've deleted a physical volume in a volume group, and now it won't let me access any logical volumes, even though none of the missing PV was allocated to LVs
[09:13] <kgs> kane77, that's by Paragon, right?
[09:13] <kane77> kgs, yes
[09:13] <kgs> Ah yes..
[09:13] <kgs> I believe I have that somewhere around here..
[09:13] <kgs> Too bad it's in German.
[09:13] <maitivolksfi> gvikaskc, what did you want to know about openoffice?
[09:13] <kgs> *cough*
[09:13] <lupine_85> toma: lighthttpd ?
[09:14] <lupine_85> there's also tomcat
[09:14] <Toma-> lupine_85: i was looking at thttpd
[09:14] <un_operateur> tomcat is far from light :)
[09:14] <lupine_85> that  too
[09:14] <lupine_85> heh, why not netcat? :p
[09:14] <kgs> Toma-: thttpd is very good.
[09:15] <lupine_85>  /that/ is light :p
[09:15] <kgs> I have used it before, it is my favorite.
[09:15] <Toma-> kgs: well its settled then! i think ill go with it. thanks
[09:15] <kgs> But then again, I used to run a very simple website from my only computer.
[09:15] <lupine_85> but flash content would be something of a no-no, I guess
[09:15] <Toma-> kgs: thats all i want to do
[09:15] <lupine_85> it's great :)
[09:15] <Toma-> setting up a flashmp3 player and java vnc viewer so i can access my music and pc from my Wii once the internet channel goes up! :D
[09:16] <kgs> Toma-: You'll like it, it's very easy to configure. As long as you read the docs that is.
[09:16] <Toma-> kgs: ahh great. i can RTFM :P
[09:16] <kgs> Heh
[09:17] <gvikaskc> l
[09:18] <Toma-> kgs: urlpat can specify full adresses?
[09:18] <Toma-> like, not just extensions
[09:18] <gvikaskc> maitivolksfi: i want to set openoffice page properties to legal . permanently
[09:19] <touchme> Can someone tell me how to correct this error

[09:20] <ChevronX> I aquired a cpkg package, how do I install it
[09:21] <eNaq> hey guys..... ive having problems running applications.
[09:21] <kgs> Toma-: Not sure man. It was a while back when I fooled around with it. I beleive they have a very good website with tons of info, and a channel on freenode aswell.. But again, I've been out of the *nix loop for quite some time.
[09:21] <eNaq> i downloaded marble blast gold.... and i cant run it
[09:21] <Toma-> ahh k. thanks!
[09:21] <eNaq> even if i change the permissions.
[09:21] <jbutler> i still cant get over how much faster this machine is than with windows.
[09:22] <eNaq> yeah..
[09:22] <kgs> Oww my head. I need a cig. :-(
[09:22] <jbutler> how in the world can people afford to build something like this for free?
[09:22] <eNaq> uh... time
[09:22] <eNaq> hey... its free for the developers too... so why not share it?
[09:22] <kgs> jbutler: You mean excellent free OS's?
[09:22] <maitivolksfi> jbutler, I love it too.  My old 266mhz laptop is useless unless I put linux on it, then I can watch videos and do all sorts of things.
[09:22] <eNaq> hm... i still cant figure it out
[09:22] <eNaq> i need some help here.
[09:23] <kgs> You see.. certain people take joy out of building things.
[09:23] <eNaq> where should i start with linux?
[09:23] <jbutler> of course, but to be able to build something like this from the ground-up...
[09:23] <kgs> And other certain people take even more joy out of spreading that joy... for free.
[09:23] <emun> what can I use to do a backup, and there any software that will clone my disk. I want to move it to another disk.
[09:23] <touchme> Anyone?
[09:23] <eNaq> anybody here that can help me set up my ubuntu system?
[09:23] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: does it fully work now?
[09:23] <gvikaskc> maitivolksfi:  can u help me on that. setting page property to Legal PAge forever
[09:24] <eNaq> i have no idea what to do.
[09:24] <jbutler> i posted about this on the ubuntu forums, but i cant get over how fast my computer is running.  on XP my machine would slow down noticably big-time running IE, Word and winamp.

[09:24] <kgs> jbutler: It wasn't all from the ground up. Besides there are plenty of people working on the different *nix's.
[09:24] <maitivolksfi> the tradeoff is that when linux works, wow.  When it doesn't, what a headache tryin to figure out why, at least for me.
[09:24] <rafa_25> k pasa

[09:24] <eNaq> everything...

[09:24] <maitivolksfi> jakub_2006, as far as I can tell.  I don't actually have any other WiFi devices at this location to test with, but it is configged, everything says good, the power light came on, and ifconfig recognizes it.  Good enough for now I suppose
[09:25] <Cyber_Linux> eNaq, if you wnt help here you have to be specific :P
[09:25] <eNaq> cyber_linux.. can you set up a private room please?
[09:25] <jakub_2006> maitivolksfi: can you connect to wireless access points?
[09:25] <maitivolksfi> gvikaskc, I don't really know anything about how openoffice stores its defaults
[09:25] <Cyber_Linux> a private room? you want me to pvt you?
[09:25] <jbutler> kgs: this whole "open source" thing is really cool... do these developers charge corporate interests?
[09:25] <eNaq> its hard to talk in this
[09:25] <Cyber_Linux> lol you can speak here, dont worry
[09:25] <Cyber_Linux> im a complete n00b too :P

[09:25] <eNaq> ok...
[09:25] <kgs> I've always run FreeBSD, but now I only have this wacked out Windows XP machine.. And I think it may be too much of a headache to get FreeBSD going on it. Much nicer to use Linux... it's so much easier.

[09:37] <un_operateur> brianl, choice
[09:37] <coopster> any thoughts?
[09:37] <ajayme> brianl : what is commad for playin VLC
[09:38] <GreyGhost> eNaq ,PM wouldn't help anyway... u aren't identified..
[09:38] <jakub_2006> eNaq: lsmod basically lists every kernel module you have. the kernel is the heart of the operating system and modules allow users to add and subtract functionality on the fly
[09:38] <un_operateur> ajayme, vlc
[09:38] <eNaq> i seee...
[09:38] <eNaq> so then.. what is my problem, if there is one?
[09:38] <jakub_2006> eNaq: lspci shows a list of every PCI active piece of hardware, which usually has your AGP sets, etc.
[09:38] <ajayme> ya ok tell me comand for playing vlc
[09:38] <eNaq> yes....
[09:39] <brianl> coopster give us some more info what video card are you using at what type of monitor?
[09:39] <reverseblade> How can I install open office 2.1 ?
[09:39] <jakub_2006> eNaq: ah, you want drivers for games, as in 3d graphics hardward based acceleration
[09:40] <eNaq> yes, i do.
[09:40] <reverseblade> emun, just follow the links . you will see
[09:40] <un_operateur> ajayme, vlc is the command to launch vlc -- at a terminal type -- vlc &
[09:40] <GreyGhost> eNaq ,u want graphics drivers ?
[09:40] <eNaq> for exampel, i want to play dark horizons lore invasion
[09:40] <eNaq> yes
[09:40] <GreyGhost> eNaq whihc card?
[09:40] <jakub_2006> eNaq: that's usually tricky because programs that emulate windows like wine don't do such a good job, in my opinion and it's rarely possible to have games that natively work
=== _steve is now known as steve
[09:40] <eNaq> this program is for linux.
[09:40] <eNaq> no emulation
[09:40] <ajayme> un_operateur : what &
[09:41] <emun> herzi , thanks I have wondered what those symbols mean , now I understand , thanks
[09:41] <jakub_2006> eNaq: so first off, you have a Radeon 9200 ATI card i take it?
[09:41] <GreyGhost> WINE just gives an DX to OGL wrapper for gammers ... and the Win API obviously...
[09:41] <eNaq> i think... only 32mb vram
[09:41] <herzi> emun: you're welcome
[09:41] <un_operateur> ajayme, if you stopped asking questions and just experimented -- you'd get somewhere :)
[09:41] <eNaq> so yes, i do
[09:41] <Mathew> So if i've never used linux should i download 6.06 or 6.10?
[09:41] <ajayme> un_operateur : thanks
[09:41] <jakub_2006> eNaq: you need to sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-<kernel-version-goes-here>
[09:42] <jakub_2006> Mathew: 6.06 then you get the option of updating if you wish and 6.06 is supported longer
[09:42] <eNaq> what is my kernel version?
[09:42] <mneptok> jakub_2006: you do not need to specify the kernel revision to install restricted modules. and it's actually better not to,
[09:42] <jakub_2006> eNaq: uname -a should tell you all that you should need to know about it
[09:43] <mneptok> eNaq: sudo aptitude install linux-restricted-modules
[09:43] <jakub_2006> mneptok: true, so eNaq: i guess uname -a's output is technically irrelevant, but i have seen bug reports on the 9200 before, so if you have problems with it beyond that, then you might have to end up checking that out
[09:43] <jakub_2006> mneptok: aptitude...? apt-get would be faster
[09:44] <mneptok> eNaq: that will install the correct version for your kernel, as well as grab any updates when future kernel builds are dleivered.
[09:44] <ajayme> i am going good afternoon all of you
[09:44] <J-_> what's the difference between aptitude, and apt-get?
[09:44] <eNaq> it couldnt find the package
[09:44] <jakub_2006> J-_: aptitude is an ncurses based GUI that uses apt-get as a backend
[09:44] <mneptok> J-_: same as the difference between Coke and Pepsi
[09:44] <J-_> cool
[09:44] <J-_> lol
[09:44] <brianl> eNaq if it's an ATI card you could always use http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ to install fglrx packages
[09:44] <jakub_2006> mneptok: no... aptitude is a GUI for the command line whereas apt-get is a command by itself
[09:44] <herzi> mneptok: which one is the pepsi one?
[09:44] <un_operateur> but like pepsi -- aptitude is a little sweeter :)
[09:45] <shubacka> hi folks,
[09:45] <shubacka> do you know how to move a partition ?
[09:45] <jakub_2006> hello shubacka
[09:46] <un_operateur> jakub_2006, aptitude is not a GUI -- its a ncurses program (for manual use) that can also be used as a command line utility (in scripts)
[09:46] <GreyGhost> !hi | shubacka
[09:46] <ubotu> shubacka: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:46] <mneptok> jakub_2006: uhhh ... aptitude is an executable of its own. not just an ncurses wrapper for apt.
[09:46] <shubacka> I wish to change my second hard drive for a bigger one
[09:46] <jakub_2006> un_operateur: how is it not a GUI? it's a *graphical* *user interface*
[09:46] <J-_> what did i start -.-
[09:46] <jakub_2006> mneptok: ever look at what it's doing inside of aptitude? it's apt-get updating, apt-get installing, et al
[09:47] <jakub_2006> shubacka: you can't really "move a partition" if you want to resize it, use any of the parted variants such as gparted
[09:47] <un_operateur> jakub_2006, it is not a GUI that uses any of the conventional GUI widget factories like GTK or QT or Wx .. it uses ncurses and can only be used from within a command line terminal
[09:47] <jakub_2006> un_operateur: who said that's conventional by any standard? ncurses or not, it's a GUI.
[09:47] <shubacka> Thanks for the welcome,and excuse me if my english is not 100% stict, it comes from frnce
[09:47] <jakub_2006> un_operateur: regardless, does it really matter?
[09:47] <mneptok> jakub_2006: then by that logic, apache is just a GUI wrapper for PHP, as it just calls PHP scripts. :)
[09:47] <herzi> un_operateur: so, win-apps are not GUIs because they don't use GTK+, QT or WX?
[09:48] <jakub_2006> mneptok: no your *browser* is the GUI
[09:48] <coopster> !fr | shubacka
[09:48] <ubotu> shubacka: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[09:48] <un_operateur> jakub_2006, well, yea, can you call the BIOS utility of a modern PC a GUI ?? i think not
[09:48] <brianl> ENaq are you taking a look at http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ in fact all you newbies should take a look here you can install many packages to make your windows transition easy.
[09:48] <jakub_2006> un_operateur: then you can be mistaken. it's still a graphical user interface dude, whether it's up to your standards of eye candy or not
[09:48] <shubacka> ther is not too much traffic right now on ubuntu-fr
[09:48] <mneptok> jakub_2006: ncurses UIs are not commonly called GUIs, despite your usage. :)
[09:48] <ir4> hello my fellow ubuntu-ers :) I just installed dhcp server on my xubuntu and provided a fixed ip's mac address related. What's puzzling me is that in logs I see lots of 'duplicate lease' info :) anyone could tell me why? I'd be gratefull :)
[09:49] <un_operateur> jakub_2006, believe it or not aptitude is used more like apt-get within scripts than as an ncurses utility anyway
[09:49] <herzi> so for you, "GUI" starts with having pixels?
[09:49] <brianl> by the way does anyone here play UT2004?
[09:49] <jakub_2006> un_operateur: that's great but aptitude by itself is still a GUI, whereas apt-get *has no frontend* in and of itself
[09:50] <jakub_2006> herzi: what part of *graphical* *user interface* do you not understand? it has nothing to do with aesthetics
[09:50] <un_operateur> jakub_2006, I hope you're not implying aptitude is a front end to apt-get -- its not
[09:50] <mneptok> jakub_2006: it's not a GUI, it's an executable wrapper with ncurses extensions.
[09:50] <herzi> jakub_2006: that's what I say, I just wanted to make a sentence from what un_operateur said
[09:50] <herzi> (to me curses uis are GUIs)
[09:51] <brianl> I'm having a small problem mouse lag on menus I remember having this problem a while back on a different machine and resolved it but that was so long ago i forgot what I did :)
[09:51] <rcrook> GUI  = *Graphical* User Interface.
[09:51] <brianl> Mouse lags under UT2004 Menu only
[09:51] <un_operateur> herzi, if you like to see it that way -- a terminal is also a *graphical* interface eh
[09:51] <mneptok> brianl: sounds like a UT problem.
[09:51] <herzi> yes
[09:51] <jakub_2006> mneptok: ncurses "extensions" are "graphical" extensions if that's how you understand it
[09:51] <herzi> even the browser is
[09:51] <shubacka> So I will try to be more clear : wishing to put a bigger slave hd, I wish to know if I can "move" the partition  present on the old slave hd to the new one ?
[09:51] <reverseblade> How can I install open office 2.1 ?
[09:52] <orangey> hey all!
[09:52] <jakub_2006> but like i said a little while ago, does it really matter? no
[09:52] <orangey> are there any ubuntu packages of openwengo 2.0?
[09:52] <rcrook> A terminal is for *Text*
[09:52] <mneptok> jakub_2006: it's not how *i* understand it. it's how the prgramming community has chosen to apply the term "GUI." and the programming community does not apply the term GUI to ncurses.
[09:52] <herzi> jakub_2006: if it did matter, we'd already have stopped the "discussion" ;-)
[09:52] <un_operateur> jakub_2006, I think the distinction we make nowadays between GUI and terminal based apps is whether or not they rely on an underlying terminal to operate -- and aptitude does rely on a terminal
[09:52] <brianl> Yeah it is a UT Problem but I was just asking if anyone here has had the same issue and have solved it.
[09:53] <herzi> un_operateur: so, synaptics is not a GUI?
=== ir4 is now known as pielgrzym_praca
[09:53] <herzi> (it relies heavily on the terminal)
[09:53] <herzi> -s
[09:53] <herzi> synaptic
[09:53] <jakub_2006> no, this place has a lot of pointless discussions. i am a developer and as part of the programming community, i say that ncurses based *graphical* user interfaces are GUIs.
[09:53] <un_operateur> herzi, synaptics does not rely on a terminal?
[09:53] <herzi> un_operateur: it does
[09:53] <herzi> every update is being executed in one
[09:53] <un_operateur> synaptics relies on python and gtk dude
[09:53] <Flannel> herzi: no, synaptic is a GUI.  apt-get is a terminal rendition.  They both are package managers, "aptitude" for isntance, has both.  Although the GUI is terminal based.
[09:53] <herzi> it just doesn't have a shell for the user
[09:54] <rcrook> think of it this way.... Terminals display text. you need bitmapping for graphical. mor dumb terminals do not support bitmapping.
[09:54] <jakub_2006> *sigh* whatever, waste your time, i'm going back to work
[09:54] <rcrook> s/mor/most
[09:54] <mneptok> jakub_2006: i have yet to hear a community Ubuntu developer or one of my colleagues refer to ncurses as a GUI
[09:54] <jakub_2006> mneptok: that's good for you, now leave me alone
[09:54] <mneptok> jakub_2006: in fact, you're the only person associated with Ubuntu i have ever heard consider ncurses a GUI.
[09:54] <brianl> I agree with you jakub most of the time I find myself using mc midnight commander for my file manager
[09:55] <rcrook> terminal and ncurses user interfaces are just that.... UI
[09:55] <rcrook> drop the G
[09:55] <brianl> Just because I like the quickness of mc over nautilus bloat
[09:56] <un_operateur> rcrook, is midnight commander not a *graphical* utility?
[09:56] <rcrook> no it isnt
[09:57] <un_operateur> lol ok
[09:57] <rcrook> there is no graphics involved
[09:57] <rcrook> ladt time I used mc (yesterday) I did not see any graphics in it
[09:57] <rcrook> last*
[09:57] <un_operateur> errm yea, its just characters and colourful backgrounds, lines and borders and whatnot right -- things that do not constitute graphics
[09:57] <brianl> yeah it's a graphical utility over the plane old shell.
[09:58] <nevro1> which software do you like to play dvd's in ubuntu
[09:58] <brianl> but allows you to use the shell anyways it's most likely and old school tool for most of you
[09:58] <rcrook> ok.. does that mean I cant use it on an old Wyse terminal????? which does not support graphics????
[09:59] <rcrook> of course I can....
[09:59] <brianl> nevro1 I use VLC it supports  DVD menus
[09:59] <rcrook> because it does not use graphics
[09:59] <nevro1> do i need the dvd playback support thing or does vlc work with a default installation
[09:59] <rcrook> its a very good fat User Interface.,
[09:59] <rcrook> s/fat/tast
[10:00] <kambei> Is anyone here knowledgeable about LDAP?
[10:00] <brianl> no goto http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ download this and install libdvdcss
[10:01] <brianl> again my favorite fixer upper
[10:01] <rcrook> good my typing is bad tobight.
[10:03] <brianl> anyways rcrook there's many dvd movies players out there for linux you might install all of them from synaptic and find the one that best suits you.

[10:13] <rcrook> if I am thinking straight if you copy you ttf fonts into .fonts in your home directory they will be picked up automagically.

[10:22] <reverseblade> How can I install open office 2.1 ?
[10:22] <un_operateur> reverseblade, errm. sudo aptitude install openoffice.org2
[10:23] <reverseblade> un_operateur, its 2.1
[10:23] <un_operateur> reverseblade, aye, 1 is a minor revision there -- and apt will find the latest one for you provided you have updated apt
[10:24] <reverseblade> un_operateur, I know it thanks
[10:24] <reverseblade> un_operateur, I am just trying to install OO2.1 and nothing else
[10:24] <reverseblade> un_operateur, and 1 is not a minor revision here
[10:24] <reverseblade> it is a medicore revision
[10:25] <Glerry> Hi Room!
[10:25] <un_operateur> reverseblade, OO.org is one of those funny packages, it has X-dependencies between 1 and 2

[10:39] <redDEADresolve> retype first you gotta install your graphic card driver
[10:39] <redDEADresolve> then you gotta decide if you want to use beryl or compiz. google is your friend. no howto works for everyone's system you gotta do a little work
[10:39] <ReTyPe> redDEADresolve: i have it installed, i have a dell, my x driver is i810

[10:41] <umarmung> What does 1: in front of a ubuntu package version number mean?
[10:41] <redDEADresolve> i just updated my ati driver and everything works great except my login screen the resolution on it is wonky. i can log in but only see about 40% of the screen
[10:42] <Flannel> umarmung: that's the original version.
[10:42] <[swb] > anyone know what kind of spec computer I would need if I want to run beagled deskbar and compositing but I want it to be responsive and quick
[10:42] <dungodung> redDEADresolve: what ati card do you have?
[10:42] <redDEADresolve> x1600
[10:42] <[swb] > on my current 1.4ghz athlon it doesnt like it
[10:42] <dungodung> I've been trying to find drivers for my 1650
[10:42] <umarmung> Flannel: Xchat-gnome has the version 1:0.13 but upstream is 0.13
[10:42] <dungodung> redDEADresolve: where did you find the driver?
[10:43] <redDEADresolve> got it from amd-ati site
[10:44] <eNaq> helo
[10:44] <eNaq> hello*
[10:44] <redDEADresolve> used this guide http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide
[10:44] <nothlit> dungodung, you can always just use archive.ubuntu.com
[10:44] <Flannel> umarmung: the 1 in front came along with the fork, (debian stopped doing xchat gnome), then you have the 'real' version number, -0, zero means zero debian specific changes, then "ubuntu9" means, there have been nine ubuntu tweaks since "1:0.13-0"
[10:44] <VMT2007> geez GAIM is horrible, be right back.
[10:44] <dungodung> ok, will try
[10:45] <maddash> how do I install flash 9 on breezy?
[10:45] <eNaq> how do i run a game thats made for debian to run on ubuntu?
[10:45] <VMT2007> eNaq: easy
[10:45] <nothlit> Toma-, man tightvncserver
[10:45] <VMT2007> ubuntu should run most debian applications, if not all
[10:45] <fritzsche> i don't get my "AVM GmbH ISDN-Connector TA" installed and after sdtarting ubuntu my teleohone line is cut. i don't need it to be online or ... so how do i deactivet the concerning usb "Bus 005 Device 002: ID 057c:2800 AVM GmbH ISDN-Connector TA"? help ...
[10:46] <nothlit> maddash, download it from adobes beta section and extract it to ~/.mozilla/plugins
[10:46] <nothlit> why are people still running breezy
[10:46] <Flannel> eNaq: the binary deb may run on ubuntu, the source deb WILL compile
[10:46] <umarmung> Flannel: Thanks for the great explanation. Just what I was looking for. :)
[10:46] <Flannel> nothlit: because there's no reason to upgrade?
[10:47] <lupine_85> Flannel: the source deb Probably Will compile
[10:47] <VMT2007> breezy = 6.06 right?
[10:47] <nothlit> there almost always is when they come in here
[10:47] <Flannel> VMT2007: no, breezy = 5.10
[10:47] <fritzsche> sorry, i don't know who to address my question
[10:47] <VMT2007> i'm new to ubuntu
[10:47] <Flannel> VMT2007: dapper = 6.06
[10:47] <VMT2007> i'm using edgy

[10:51] <VMT2007> I downloaded and installed a few non-free applications that come in makeself archives
[10:51] <eNaq> the game is labeled with the file extentions: sh.bin
[10:51] <VMT2007> does the packaging system recognize those?
[10:51] <eNaq> its an application, im sure..
[10:51] <[swb] > does anyone know if the PLF apt sources are working yet?
[10:51] <VMT2007> eNaq: .bin?
[10:51] <eNaq> but ubuntu thinks different
[10:52] <VMT2007> just run it
[10:52] <eNaq> binary... right?
[10:52] <VMT2007> "sh file.bin"
[10:52] <VMT2007> that's a makeself archive
[10:52] <nothlit> yeah but it could be an image file
[10:52] <VMT2007> huh?
[10:52] <VMT2007> was it accompanied by a .cue?
[10:53] <nothlit> i'm just saying .bins aren't always binaries (and they don't always need .cues)
[10:53] <eNaq> it wont run it
[10:53] <eNaq> its says its "dangerous"
[10:53] <VMT2007> many commercial linux games come as .bins or .runs
[10:53] <eNaq> hm.
[10:54] <eNaq> should i make it .run?
[10:54] <VMT2007> just run it like a shell script
[10:54] <VMT2007> "sh file.bin"
[10:54] <eNaq> ok
[10:54] <VMT2007> however, what game is it?
[10:54] <eNaq> dark horizons lore invasion
[10:55] <VMT2007> and it was a download from a site?
[10:55] <VMT2007> as a linux version?
[10:55] <eNaq> yes
[10:55] <eNaq> linux
[10:55] <eNaq> but it didnt say it was for ubuntu, though
[10:55] <eNaq> it had redhat and debian listed
[10:56] <VMT2007> yeah run it with sh
[10:56] <eNaq> .sh?
[10:56] <VMT2007> "sh file"
[10:56] <VMT2007> in the terminal
[10:56] <brandon__> can anyone help me with static sound
[10:57] <VMT2007> it's a lot like those self-extracting winzip archives
[10:57] <fritzsche> how to address a question to get an answer?
[10:57] <eNaq> vmt2007: so i name it sh file.bin?
[10:57] <VMT2007> no
[10:57] <VMT2007> go to the terminal
[10:57] <eNaq> ok
[10:57] <eNaq> then?
[10:57] <lupine_85> head -n1 file.bin
[10:57] <FirstStrike> ah, late night kernel compiling
[10:57] <VMT2007> yeah that's a good idea
[10:57] <lupine_85> if it begins EL it's an executable binary file
[10:58] <lupine_85> if it begins #! it's an executable script
[10:58] <lupine_85> otherwise it's probably half of a .bin/.cue combination
[10:58] <eNaq> its neither
[10:58] <Flannel> fritzsche: just keep repeating it every so often. No one knows at the moment.  Might as well poke around on the web (google, forums, etc) trying to see if you can figure anything out while you're waiting.
[10:58] <lupine_85> !bchunk
[10:58] <ubotu> bchunk: CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2.0-1 (edgy), package size 12 kB, installed size 68 kB
[10:58] <lupine_85> use that
[10:58] <lupine_85> it's a raw CD image, most likely
[10:58] <VMT2007> without a header file?
[10:59] <VMT2007> weird
[10:59] <lupine_85> VMT2007: the .cue isn't always necessary
[10:59] <lupine_85> indeed, the bchunk man page gives several example .cue files for various default formats
[10:59] <lupine_85> it can be a bit hit 'n miss though :p
[11:00] <eNaq> terminal did nothing
[11:00] <fritzsche> Flannel: thanks, i already have found several answers to this problem online but they all were just a try and didn't work
[11:00] <Blake1> is there any way to set ubuntu so it automatically logs in via XDMCP on startup?
[11:01] <VMT2007> I prefer .ISO images, tbh
[11:01] <lupine_85> VMT2007: definitely :)
[11:01] <VMT2007> mount -o loop -t iso9660 file.iso /mnt
[11:01] <VMT2007> have it in the back of my hand
[11:01] <eNaq> are you talking to me?
[11:01] <lupine_85> but when people are illegally downloading teh prons and teh animez and teh warez via. $p2p_app, they don't take much time to look at the file format
[11:02] <VMT2007> nah
[11:02] <eNaq> no... right?
[11:02] <eNaq> thought so.
[11:02] <VMT2007> lol, limewire.
[11:02] <eNaq> i still have no idea how to run the game.
[11:02] <VMT2007> bittorrent my friend.
[11:02] <VMT2007> Blake1: one second
[11:02] <lupine_85> eNaq: it's probably a CD image
[11:02] <lupine_85> so you need to burn it to a CD, then install it
[11:02] <eNaq> its not.... im sure..
[11:02] <eNaq> its a download
[11:02] <lupine_85> ...got an URL?
[11:03] <eNaq> yeah
[11:03] <lupine_85> let's take a look then

[11:03] <VMT2007> galeon? when did I install that.
[11:03] <VMT2007> meh
[11:04] <VMT2007> man
[11:04] <VMT2007> I hate limewire but it's the only P2P application available
[11:04] <VMT2007> decent one, anyway
[11:05] <lupine_85> *sigh*
[11:05] <lupine_85> it begins #!/bin/sh
[11:05] <eNaq> ok
[11:05] <lupine_85> so chmod a+X file
[11:05] <lupine_85> erm, a+x
[11:05] <VMT2007> what?
[11:05] <lupine_85> then ./file
[11:05] <VMT2007> i just use +x
[11:05] <eNaq> then step-by-step, what do i do?
[11:05] <VMT2007> easy
[11:05] <lupine_85> eNaq: that's it#
[11:05] <VMT2007> chmod a+x file.bin
[11:05] <VMT2007> ./file.bin
[11:05] <VMT2007> :)
[11:05] <eNaq> what?
[11:05] <VMT2007> could even do that w/ nautilus
[11:06] <VMT2007> right click the file
[11:06] <VMT2007> properties
[11:06] <eNaq> ok
[11:06] <VMT2007> permissions
[11:06] <eNaq> yeah
[11:06] <VMT2007> check executable on user and group
[11:06] <eNaq> yeah
[11:06] <VMT2007> apply, and double click it like anything else
[11:06] <VMT2007> :P
[11:06] <VMT2007> hey
[11:06] <Nael> How do i get samba to rescan? i am using dapper
[11:07] <Nael> it isn't showing up in network browsers
[11:07] <lupine_85> but seriously -
[11:07] <lupine_85> [09:58]  <lupine_85> if it begins #! it's an executable script
[11:07] <VMT2007> freebsd is easy, man
[11:07] <Jewfro-Macabbi> if you enjoy pain
[11:07] <VMT2007> no
[11:07] <VMT2007> it's damn easy
[11:07] <Jewfro-Macabbi> manually configuring X, that's just uncessesary pain....
[11:08] <VMT2007> you learn though
[11:08] <Jewfro-Macabbi> sure, but I prefer to learn "after" I have a useable environment
[11:08] <VMT2007> that's the way the distributors do it anyway
[11:08] <VMT2007> :)
[11:08] <VMT2007> usable?
[11:08] <VMT2007> are you kidding me?
[11:08] <Jewfro-Macabbi> command line is not yet "usable" for me
[11:08] <VMT2007> the console is easy
[11:08] <eNaq> ubuntu still says i cant open it, vmt2007
[11:09] <Jewfro-Macabbi> I can clunk around, do some things, but I want my x window
[11:09] <VMT2007> what does it throw at you, eNaq ?
[11:09] <VMT2007> Jewfro-Macabbi: that's why you learn, young jedi.
[11:09] <eNaq> a window with the title:
[11:09] <ChrisBradley> hello
[11:09] <eNaq> cannot open dhli_demo_v2_0_2.sh.bin
[11:10] <eNaq> yeah
[11:10] <VMT2007> right click it
[11:10] <VMT2007> open with
[11:10] <VMT2007> open with other
[11:10] <eNaq> ok..
[11:10] <VMT2007> use a custom command
[11:10] <VMT2007> put "sh" in there
[11:10] <VMT2007> close it
[11:10] <VMT2007> weell
[11:10] <VMT2007> click open
[11:11] <VMT2007> Jewfro-Macabbi: what do you have against command lines, though?
[11:11] <lupine_85> VMT2007: now you're taking GUI to ridiculous extremes
[11:11] <eNaq> same thing
[11:11] <VMT2007> they're not hard to learn.
[11:11] <lupine_85> ./file
[11:11] <lupine_85> problem solved
[11:11] <eNaq> ok
[11:11] <eNaq> the window that opened
[11:12] <eNaq> "this installation doesnt support glibc-2.1 on Linux / unknown"
[11:12] <lupine_85> what it says, then
[11:12] <eNaq> fatal error, no tech support email configured in this setup
[11:12] <VMT2007> meh, just open a terminal, cd to the directory it's located in
[11:12] <VMT2007> sh file.bin
[11:12] <lupine_85> it's incompatible with your version of glibc
[11:12] <eNaq> where can i upgrade my gilbc?
[11:13] <Giooooo> join #prog reti
[11:13] <lupine_85> eNaq: it's probably a downgrade. And you don't want to
[11:13] <lupine_85> !info glibc
[11:13] <ubotu> Package glibc does not exist in any distro I know
[11:13] <Jewfro-Macabbi> VMT2007, nothing I use it all the time, in combination with my nice X window. I'm just not adjusted to pure command line yet, haven't learned all the commands.

[11:14] <lupine_85> eNaq: playing with that is the fastest way to borken your install that I know of
[11:14] <VMT2007> hmm
[11:14] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Can I add some additional parameters to my /etc/wvdial.conf file, like never disconnect, redial x times?
[11:14] <VMT2007> I want to compile FreeBSD with the GNU C library
[11:14] <lupine_85> eNaq: ask for the source and rebuild against your current libc6
[11:14] <VMT2007> it's a closed source game isn't it
[11:15] <eNaq> yeah
[11:15] <eNaq> it is
[11:15] <eNaq> not open sourc
[11:15] <lupine_85> well, tell them to push a newer build themselves
[11:15] <eNaq> source*
[11:15] <lupine_85> almost nobody uses glibc2.1 any more
[11:16] <eNaq> where can i download it, anyway?
[11:16] <lupine_85> eNaq: www.gnu.org
[11:16] <lupine_85> seriously, you don't want to try to install it
[11:16] <VMT2007> no
[11:16] <VMT2007> you don't
[11:16] <lupine_85> not even a little bit
[11:16] <eNaq> why not?
[11:16] <VMT2007> you'll corrupt your ENTIRE linux installation
[11:16] <eNaq> arg
[11:16] <eNaq> that stinks
[11:17] <lupine_85>  /every/ package on your system is built against a specific version of libc6
[11:17] <eNaq> so there is nothing i can do
[11:17] <VMT2007> yes
[11:17] <eNaq> sigh~
[11:17] <VMT2007> it depends on the .so files in /usr/lib
[11:17] <VMT2007> those get replaced with a different version
[11:17] <lupine_85> changing the libc6 binary version means that all your prebuilt binaries will probably stop working
[11:17] <VMT2007> you're going to have quite a bit of trouble
[11:17] <eNaq> huh
[11:18] <VMT2007> i mean seriously
[11:18] <eNaq> is there any way i can emulate it?
[11:18] <VMT2007> vmware, maybe
[11:18] <eNaq> hm
[11:18] <VMT2007> or use the windows version w/ wine
[11:18] <eNaq> that means it'll go slower?
[11:18] <lupine_85> if you can find a really old linux distro :p
[11:18] <VMT2007> not really
[11:18] <lupine_85> eNaq: not much
[11:18] <roadboy> hi all, is there anyone using mldonkey for p2p?
[11:18] <eNaq> where can i find vmware?
[11:18] <VMT2007> a well-configured wine installation shouldn't be slow
[11:18] <VMT2007> it's commercial, enaq
[11:18] <VMT2007> try wine first
[11:19] <eNaq> wine?
[11:19] <eNaq> cheers.
[11:19] <VMT2007> vmware is an entire emulated x86 system
[11:19] <VMT2007> wine is just a compatibility layer
[11:19] <VMT2007> the latter is far faster
[11:19] <dungodung> I installed the ATI driver readDEAD<something>... gave me and now I can't login to my edgy
[11:19] <VMT2007> unless you have four quad-core processors
[11:19] <VMT2007> ... in which case it'd be the same thing
[11:20] <eNaq> so then, i can use wine?
[11:20] <VMT2007> yeah
[11:20] <VMT2007> their native linux build is built against a very outdated version of libc
[11:20] <Blake1> !info wine | Blake1
[11:20] <ubotu> wine: Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (Binary Emulator and Library). In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.22-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 9001 kB, installed size 42452 kB
[11:20] <eNaq> i can run lore on wine?
[11:20] <VMT2007> well, the windows version
[11:20] <VMT2007> it should work
[11:20] <eNaq> oh sweet!
[11:20] <eNaq> but it'll go the same speed?
[11:21] <VMT2007> well
[11:21] <VMT2007> not the same speed it would go on a windows machine
[11:21] <VMT2007> but it should run fine
[11:21] <eNaq> hm
[11:21] <eNaq> ok
[11:21] <VMT2007> well
[11:21] <VMT2007> to be honest
[11:21] <eNaq> but i have a ppc processor...
[11:21] <VMT2007> oh
[11:21] <VMT2007> god
[11:21] <VMT2007> no wonder nothing worked
[11:21] <eNaq> *ouch*
[11:21] <VMT2007> that game is built against an x86 architecture
[11:21] <eNaq> seriously?
[11:21] <VMT2007> yes
[11:22] <eNaq> but im running ubuntu on this
[11:22] <VMT2007> powerpc version, of course
[11:22] <eNaq> yeah
[11:22] <lupine_85> ...
[11:22] <eNaq> but i can still use wine...right?
[11:22] <lupine_85> no
[11:22] <Jewfro-Macabbi> try try the mac version...
[11:22] <VMT2007> wine is useless on ppc
[11:22] <lupine_85> not even a little bit
[11:22] <eNaq> hm
[11:22] <VMT2007> windows applications are built for x86 processors\
[11:22] <eNaq> i dont want the mac version
[11:22] <VMT2007> always.
[11:22] <eNaq> because it messes up my openAl
[11:23] <VMT2007> linux gaming is a strange concept to me anyway
[11:23] <eNaq> thats why i have ubuntu in the first place...
[11:23] <eNaq> to run linux games
[11:23] <VMT2007> lol, what a wide selection of games for linux
[11:23] <lupine_85> the Macintosh version would be more use to you than the Linux or Windows version, TBH
=== drivera90 is now known as driv[sleep] 
[11:23] <VMT2007> nexuiz, wolf:et, ut2007, tremulous
[11:24] <VMT2007> all of which have Mac versions
[11:24] <lupine_85> although you still won't be able to play it, at least it'll be compiled for the right architecture :p
[11:24] <eNaq> lol
[11:24] <VMT2007> there are no mac compatibility layers for linux from my knowledge
[11:24] <VMT2007> well
[11:24] <VMT2007> i don't know because, uh, I don't use a PPC machine :P
[11:24] <Jewfro-Macabbi> VMT2007,  Pear?
[11:24] <eNaq> i guess ill wipe ubuntu
[11:24] <VMT2007> pear?
[11:24] <ssam> eNaq, any of the games in synaptic will work on powerpc linux
[11:24] <eNaq> and install panther in its place
[11:25] <VMT2007> besides man
[11:25] <eNaq> i am confused,,
[11:25] <ssam> there is mol (mac on linux)
[11:25] <Jewfro-Macabbi> VMT2007, I thought there was a mac compat layer, or perhaps emulation, pear something
[11:25] <VMT2007> OS X runs over a BSD-based layer
[11:25] <VMT2007> you can compile linux games :P
[11:25] <ssam> mol lets you boot mac os x from within ubuntu
[11:25] <VMT2007> if you can find the dev tools
[11:25] <VMT2007> ...
[11:26] <lupine_85> ssam: that's  pretty cool

[11:26] <rpedro> Jewfro-Macabbi: pear is a ppc arch emulator for x86 pcs

[11:27] <ssam> eNaq, its more like vmware than wine
[11:27] <tortho> anyone got a good solution on how to fix a extreeme slow firefox with flash.... about 2 minutes to load the page, and 30 seconds to scroll it..
[11:27] <VMT2007> yeah
[11:27] <Jewfro-Macabbi> rpedro, that's what I was thinking of...
[11:27] <VMT2007> you need a fast processor for it to be effective
[11:27] <VMT2007> well
[11:27] <VMT2007> ppc processors are pretty fast
[11:28] <rpedro> Jewfro-Macabbi: not really useful, no that Apple uses intel architecture, and you can run the old ppc architecture apps on the new OSX
[11:28] <Blake1> is there something like mol but for windows?
[11:28] <VMT2007> vmware
[11:28] <VMT2007> but lol
[11:29] <lupine_85> vmware doesn't do ppc architecture
[11:29] <VMT2007> windows, it'll run at a garden snail's pace
[11:29] <VMT2007> oh, it doesn't.
[11:29] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Blake1, PearPC, but not sure how good it is
[11:29] <lupine_85> besides, you can get Mac OS X for intel arch now
[11:29] <ssam> mol, only runs on powerpc (it does not do processor emulation(this makes it very fast))
[11:29] <VMT2007> yeah
[11:29] <VMT2007> i don't like that transition
[11:29] <VMT2007> I don't see the point
[11:29] <Jewfro-Macabbi> rpedro, he was needed mac on linux anyway
[11:29] <VMT2007> PowerPC processors are far more efficient than intel x86s
[11:30] <lupine_85> everyone knows that the ppc arch is not as good as the risc arch :p
[11:30] <VMT2007> yeah lol
[11:30] <VMT2007> if you can afford it
[11:30] <lupine_85> ?!
[11:30] <lupine_85> RISC is cheap as chips, m'lud
[11:30] <lupine_85> I got a RISC machine for free last year
[11:30] <VMT2007> oh.
[11:30] <VMT2007> I keep thinking of something else.
[11:30] <lupine_85> (and not running RiscOS either - debian :p )
[11:30] <VMT2007> UltraSPARC, yeah
[11:31] <rpedro> Jewfro-Macabbi: ah! right, maybe there's a modified version to emulate ppc on *ppc* linux
[11:31] <VMT2007> SPARC is RISC-based anyway
[11:31] <Jewfro-Macabbi> rpedro, dunno, but the mol application sounds better
[11:32] <coliny> hello. i have a firewire interface problem.
[11:32] <VMT2007> man one day
[11:32] <coliny> i have an ieee1394 problem
[11:32] <AdviZzzor> hi all
[11:32] <ssam> coliny, tell us about it
[11:32] <ootput> argh, how on earth do i reduce the virtual workspaces in gnome to 1?
[11:32] <AdviZzzor> gentoo rulezz?
[11:32] <ootput> i thought it'd be in right-click-> properties, or soemthing
[11:33] <VMT2007> I want to build a cluster of FreeBSD machines on UltraSPARC 3i processors
[11:33] <ssam> ootput, right click on the switcher

[11:33] <coliny> ssam: i need to get my equipment, and the file first to describe the problem. wait a minute. aoeu!
[11:33] <AdviZzzor> i need see mark ? he here?
[11:33] <ssam> ootput, and go to preffs
[11:33] <coliny> aoeu
[11:33] <AdviZzzor> i had any questions
[11:34] <ruschi> @VMT2007: and why are you asking this on an ubuntu group
=== ootput is now known as arbslackomput
[11:35] <ssam> AdviZzzor, mark shuttleworth?
[11:35] <mc44> AdviZzzor: what is your question?
[11:35] <ruschi> well then, I got problems with the permissions "udev" gives to the device-nodes /dev/sgX
[11:35] <AdviZzzor> ssam yes =)
[11:35] <AdviZzzor> ssam ia want tell him thanks
[11:36] <ruschi> /dev/sg1 belongs to gorup cdrom as it should be but /dev/sg0 is still group root
[11:36] <AdviZzzor> he can be here?
[11:36] <coliny> here is the first bit of info, ssam. whenever i try to connect my cd/rw over firewire/ieee1394, i get the following message out of every dmesg: [17203813.828000]  ieee1394: Error parsing configrom for node 0-00:1023
[11:36] <coliny> [17203813.828000]  ieee1394: Node changed: 0-00:1023 -> 0-01:1023
[11:36] <coliny> can you explain to me what it means? i have no idea?
=== zak_ is now known as llama32
[11:36] <ruschi> I checked /etc/udev/rules.d/permission
[11:36] <VMT2007> ruschi: perhaps because linux isn't that suitable for high-powered computing?
[11:36] <ruschi> but ther is no device node /dev/sg0 listed
[11:37] <mc44> AdviZzzor: no he is not here
[11:37] <ssam> AdviZzzor, his irc name is sabdfl
[11:37] <ruschi> @VMT2007, ok could be but anyway I just wanted to know what a bunch of ubuntu-linux user have to do with FreeBSD questions
[11:37] <AdviZzzor> ssam mc44 big thanks
[11:37] <lupine_85> VMT2007: oooh, harsh

[11:38] <AdviZzzor> mneptok ok
[11:38] <coliny> || i don't have such a file as /etc/udev/rules.d/permission on my hard disk | my cd/rw only gets recognized over a usb connection | but i want it to be recognized over firewire, as well ||
[11:38] <ruschi> anyway, I have no clue where the permissions for dev/sg0 are set, this is the actual burning device
[11:38] <arbslackompwelpu> ssam: thanks mate
[11:38] <malt> is unrealircd hard to setup on ubuntu?
[11:38] <ruschi> @coliny: the correct filename was 40-permission.rules
[11:38] <malt> unreal ircd*
[11:38] <ssam> coliny, sorry not sure about that
[11:39] <mneptok> malt: no
[11:39] <coliny> ssam: what are not sure about?
[11:39] <mneptok> ruschi: i'd be more concerned with the permissions of the mount point that the device node.] 
[11:39] <ssam> coliny, the problems you are getting
[11:40] <mneptok> s/that/than/
[11:40] <ruschi> its not the mount action: I burn as user in K3b and it is forbidden
[11:40] <toba_> HI! Is someone in here using the netgear wg511 v2 wlan nic? I cant seem to find the proper .inf driver and am wondering if someone would be kind enough to tell me where i can get it. I searched netgeras homepage but it has yielded no results
[11:40] <ruschi> then I change the permission of /dev/sg0 to root:cdrom 660
[11:40] <ruschi> and it works
[11:41] <mc44> toba_: try looking here
[11:41] <mneptok> ruschi: you should be changing the permissions of the mount point, not the /dev device node entry.
[11:41] <PORDO> what do i have to do so that nautilus gets its auto-updating feature back?
[11:41] <ruschi> therefor I think the problem is how udev sets the permission of the device node
[11:41] <mc44> toba_: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List
[11:41] <aidehua> Are universe packages in 6.06 LTS security updated?
[11:41] <toba_> mc44: thanx =)
[11:41] <coliny> okay, this text is sourced from a file i've written myself. here it is. sorry i don't have /dev/sg0.
[11:41] <RamiKassab> hey guys I'm running kubuntu on an old HP machine with a Pentium 4 1.8 GHz CPU and, according to the PCI section under KInfoCenter, an ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra TR. I recently purchased a Hanns-G HW292D 19" widescreen monitor that runs at a native 1440x900 resolution and am having a hard time getting Kubuntu to run the monitor's native resolution. I would greatly appreciate any help in doing so.
[11:41] <ruschi> @mneptok: The thing is not muoted for burning!
[11:41] <coliny> Here's my problem:

[11:42] <To1> RamiKassab: are you using the binary drivers?
[11:42] <RamiKassab> Also, when I first install Kubuntu and booted into it on the machine, it seemed to have run the correct resolution until the first reboot

[11:42] <RamiKassab> To1: what do you mean binary drivers? where can I get these from?
[11:42] <To1> they should be in the repos
[11:42] <To1> someting like xorg-driver-fglrx
[11:42] <RamiKassab> To1: do you mean binary drivers for my specific video card? hmm let me check... that would be awesome
[11:43] <mneptok> RamiKassab: does that Rage128 even do 1440x900?
[11:43] <RamiKassab> To1: do you know how it would look for my specific video card?
[11:43] <To1> but i dont know if rage are supported.....
[11:43] <To1> 2 mins
[11:43] <RamiKassab> mneptok: I'm not sure but I think I saw that the rage in this PC has 64M of memory
[11:43] <RamiKassab> mneptok: you'd think it would be able to
[11:43] <mneptok> RamiKassab: no i wouldn't
[11:44] <RamiKassab> mneptok: lol
[11:44] <RamiKassab> mneptok: are ATI Rage's just not able to run widescreen resolutions?
[11:44] <mneptok> RamiKassab: the Rage 128 was a purely consumer card. it was released when most consumers were not using anything above 1280x1024.

[11:44] <To1> i dont think the rage is supported by the binary driver.... but you can surely just edit your xorg.conf?
[11:44] <aidehua> mc44: how quickly is universe updated compared to Debian stable?
[11:45] <ruschi> @mneptok, this does not do the trick because cdrecord uses the devicenode not hte mountpoint!
[11:45] <RamiKassab> To1: I wouldn't even know what the modeline would look like for this monitor
[11:45] <mc44> aidehua: security updates are not officially supported for universe, therefore there is no way of knowing how long they will take
[11:45] <aidehua> I'm guessing that 6.06 Universe updates will pretty closely track any security updates in Debian stable, and I'd like to use 6.06, but maybe if I need long term support for universe stuff I should stick to Debian.
[11:45] <RamiKassab> To1: is that all I'd have to do is just insert the right modeline and force everything?
[11:45] <aidehua> mc44: right -- sounds like I have to use Debian stable then -- ta :)
[11:45] <To1> id think so, then it will give it its best shot at least
[11:46] <mneptok> RamiKassab: forcing modes your monitor cannot handle can destroy your monitor.
[11:46] <RamiKassab> mneptok: what's funny is that when I first booted in Kubuntu the resolution looked native... on the ATI Rage in this PC
[11:46] <mc44> aidehua: and they could just stop, so yes, you're better with Debian :)
[11:46] <coliny> sorry i to have to temporarily get in and out of the irc. ssam - is that you? have you interpreted my file?
[11:46] <RamiKassab> mneptok: is this normal or just a fluke?
[11:46] <mneptok> RamiKassab: what does reconfiguring xorg do for you?

[11:56] <coliny> what's the purpose of that page?
[11:56] <To1> phpmyadmin?
[11:56] <mc44> coliny: no, when you paste it, it should give you a new link#
[11:56] <mc44> coliny: you click the paste it button, right?
[11:56] <GreyGhost> coliny , something like this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38093/
[11:57] <GreyGhost> coliny paste it from ur address bar ...
[11:57] <coliny> i didn't get a link. or maybe i don't get it. i'm confused.
[11:57] <GreyGhost> coliny , ok do this
[11:57] <GreyGhost> first paste all the contents of the file in the "text" area
[11:57] <willys_fueguino> To1: thanx
[11:57] <RamiKassab> mneptok: should I select ATI or Vesa for the driver? Vesa was selected by default
[11:57] <GreyGhost> click on "Paste it" ...
[11:58] <coliny> do what? i want send the bulk info - show me how!!! i'm having a bit of an aoeu temper
[11:58] <mneptok> RamiKassab: vesa
[11:58] <GreyGhost> coliny ,first paste all the contents of the file in the "text" area .... click on "Paste it" ...
[11:58] <mneptok> RamiKassab: i don;t believe the ATI binary blob supports anything less than a Radeon
[11:58] <ssam> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38092/
[11:58] <mc44> mneptok: it supports some FIreGL stuff I think
[11:58] <GreyGhost> coliny ,then the link in ur adress bar should chane .... copy paste that link here..
[11:59] <mc44> ssam: nicely done :)
[11:59] <coliny> okay, here's what i'm attempting: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38097/
[12:00] <year0369> moin
[12:00] <coliny> these are just echos of my file. i sure hell don't know what's going on! just read the text!
[12:00] <mneptok> mc44: could be. i keep ATI stuff at a very safe distance from my computing activities.
[12:00] <year0369> wie kann ich in meinem system kopieren
[12:00] <ssam> coliny, :-) we can see it now
[12:00] <RamiKassab> mneptok: ok crazy thing just happened, reconfigured just now with ati and left all else as is except added 1440x900 resolution and then rebooted, kubuntu loaded and the res is 1440x900 but the screen is shifted off the left side of the monitor
[12:00] <mc44> mneptok: chicken
[12:00] <RamiKassab> there is a vertical ~3" black strip on the right
[12:00] <mneptok> RamiKassab: so you use the monitor controls to adjust the raster borders.
[12:01] <coliny> i'm talking about my firewire problems, not an ati graphics card. i can't understand german - it's all navajo to me.
[12:01] <RamiKassab> mneptok: auto adjust didn't work
[12:01] <coliny> ssam?
[12:01] <mneptok> RamiKassab: so you use the monitor controls to adjust the raster borders.
[12:01] <mc44> coliny: there are other people in this channel who are not talking to you, dont worryt
[12:01] <year0369> jemand mal einen rat geben
[12:01] <RamiKassab> mneptok: let me see if this monitor even let's me adjust manually

[12:02] <FatherLavaGuard> I've tried to follow instructions on ubuntuguide on how to set up write permission on my NTFS partition but the darned thing doesn't mount. Does anyone have any alternative instructions?
[12:02] <GreyGhost> do i just run .pl files from the console?
[12:02] <lupine_85> !ntfs-3g
[12:02] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[12:02] <mneptok> FatherLavaGuard: please do not try to write to NTFS from Linux. it's dangerous.
[12:03] <ssam> coliny, i am not an expert on firewire, have you tried googling for some of those messages
[12:03] <FatherLavaGuard> Will it injure my cat or something?
[12:03] <RamiKassab> mneptok: wow it looks like it's working... with the ati driver
[12:03] <RamiKassab> mneptok: it looks a bit blury though
[12:04] <coliny> yes, i have. and i got confused on these. the obscure part is the word "configrom"
[12:05] <Jewfro-Macabbi> FatherLavaGuard, it can kill your windows installation.
[12:05] <coliny> tried all different methods, with no luck. even replaced the firewire card with a usb/firewire combo.
[12:05] <lupine_85> meh, it's only windows ^^
[12:06] <Jewfro-Macabbi> lupine_85, I know, I tried it, and it killed mine.
[12:06] <coliny> i don't really have enough equipment to test the stuff.
[12:06] <coliny> ssam: can you get over to me an expert on firewire?
[12:06] <naelphin> how do i see if dma is beign used?
[12:07] <psmurfy> rawr
[12:07] <ssam> coliny, i dont think i know any
=== psmurfy is now known as P-Smurfy
[12:07] <coliny> ssam, shame.
[12:07] <ssam> coliny, you could maybe file a bug
[12:07] <coliny> should i do this another day?
[12:08] <coliny> file a bug? where?
[12:08] <coliny> i'll just disconnect my device.
[12:08] <P-Smurfy> Does anyone have the problem of Edgy being extremely slow with the internet connection?, i disabled ipv6 completely and its still only getting about 90Kb/s
[12:08] <ssam> coliny, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
[12:08] <FatherLavaGuard> Jewfro-Macabbi, but it won't hurt my cat huh. He's a good cat. Had him for 8 years. If it hurt my windows installation I'd need to rely on Ubuntu!! Hmmm..suddenly not so worried (as long as the cat is safe:)
[12:09] <Jewfro-Macabbi> FatherLavaGuard, yeah the cat will be fine :)
[12:09] <FatherLavaGuard> Good.
[12:09] <coliny> i just looked at the page.
[12:10] <Jekichan> what is the cat?
[12:10] <lupine_85> the cat: http://www.acc.umu.se/~zqad/cats/index.html?view=1166456861-tongueulence.jpg
[12:11] <Jekichan> :))))
[12:11] <coliny> i don't know how to file a bug.
[12:11] <P-Smurfy> rawr... *cries* no one?
[12:12] <coliny> i don't want to have to register just file a bug; i think i'm only going to use it once ever.
[12:13] <coliny> okay.
[12:13] <ssam> coliny, you could try the ubuntu-users mailing list
[12:13] <elisa> i need some help'
[12:14] <mneptok> coliny: Launchpad is used for more than bug reporting. if you use Ubuntu, it's a good idea to have an LP account.
[12:14] <flarfu> damn cat
[12:14] <coliny> i'm not accustomed to filing bug.
[12:14] <coliny> what can launchpad do?
[12:14] <mneptok> coliny: go play with it a bit.
[12:14] <elisa> does anyone know how to get NFS sharing files ?
[12:14] <mc44> !nfs
[12:14] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[12:15] <P-Smurfy> !ics
[12:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ics - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:15] <coliny> i will be received my registration stuff. over the email channel. i don't know if the large text is precise enough for the programmers.
[12:15] <P-Smurfy> using 90 Kb/s on a cable connection is freaking weaksauce
[12:16] <FatherLavaGuard> Jekichan: The cat is a regular cat of the domestic short hair variety with an appearance similar to Sylvester from the old cartoons.
[12:16] <mneptok> P-Smurfy: i get far higher speeds than that and i use Edgy.
[12:16] <P-Smurfy> i know
[12:16] <FirstStrike> so..for some reason i'm stuck at 50 hz refresh rate. i did a reconfigure on xorg and even edited the xorg.conf by hand with no results. here's my monitor info: monitorrange: 30-81, 56-76 (it's a Dell 1905FP)
[12:16] <P-Smurfy> i did before too
[12:16] <mneptok> P-Smurfy: and i assure you that the Canonical servers running Edgy in the DC get >90Kbps
[12:16] <P-Smurfy> but this last time installing, its not working right
[12:16] <mc44> P-Smurfy: are you sure its not your provider?
[12:16] <P-Smurfy> yes very
[12:16] <P-Smurfy> its just this pc
[12:16] <coliny> how about some engrish?
[12:17] <mneptok> P-Smurfy: what flavor of NIC?
[12:17] <P-Smurfy> bleh, i gforget sec
[12:18] <coliny> i'm not playing around with launchpad.
[12:18] <mc44> mneptok: canonical servers running edgy... hahahaha  :p
[12:18] <coliny> ssam: it's good you tried to help me out of my firewire mess.
[12:18] <P-Smurfy> thinks realtek
[12:19] <seatouch> !tell me about xgl
[12:19] <RamiKassab> mneptok: is vesa just a generic driver?
[12:19] <ssam> coliny, if you post a bug and it does not have enough detail a developer will probably ask for more information, and tell you how to get it
[12:19] <ssam> coliny, sorry i could not help more
[12:19] <mc44> RamiKassab: yes it is likely to be slow
[12:20] <RamiKassab> mc44: do you know if the ati driver supports ati rage?
[12:20] <P-Smurfy> bleh, feck this, ive had enough the the x/k/ubuntu bugs, im going for suse,, this pos cant even use a vid card right
[12:20] <coliny> ssam: that's okay. i'll have to look for more. i'll probably have to wait a couple of weeks. maybe i should get a second firewire device? i have only device that make the connection. next time i'm thinking it should be a hard disk drive.
[12:21] <Enzyme2000> Anyone know how to get beryl to load on startup?
[12:21] <ssam> coliny, firewire hard disks have worked well for me
[12:21] <QwertyM> some urgent help here please, I connected a 6681 Nokia mobile now, what could be the DEV name for it? KMobileTools is asking one... do I need to mount it?
[12:21] <mc44> RamiKassab: the ati proprietary driver, fglrx?
[12:21] <QwertyM> its getting detected in lsusb
[12:21] <ssam> coliny, i use the lacie d2 ones
[12:21] <coliny> ssam: you use firewire? have you tried cd drives on firewire?
[12:22] <coliny> what about a firewire scanner?
[12:22] <RamiKassab> well, either the one that I see when doing a reconfigure or the proprietary driver
[12:22] <ssam> coliny, i have not tried with a cd drive
[12:22] <coliny> ssam: how about other firewire equipment?
[12:22] <RamiKassab> mc44: well, either the one that I see when doing a reconfigure or the proprietary driver
[12:22] <Enzyme2000> beryl-manager more specifically
[12:22] <ssam> coliny, i think a scanner worked ok, an epson perfection, or something like that (though i might have used the usb)
[12:22] <OmniD> kino seems to be unable to import my video
[12:23] <mc44> RamiKassab: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38100/ is  a list of cards the proprietary driver supports
[12:23] <OmniD> "The playlist is empty and the default preferences for video creation have not been specified - aborting."
[12:23] <OmniD> I thought I set up the preferences..
[12:23] <llama32> anyone know of any decent animation apps? something like flash - but not necasarily as featuresome - i'm just wanting to draw some stupid little flipbook type things
[12:23] <OmniD> And there seems to be no playlist that I can see
[12:23] <coliny> #ssam: of course i'll have to try and get a spare hard disk from somewhere and getting a matching enclosure. i'll know where to look...this'll be done over a couple of weeks. aoeuidhtns...
[12:24] <Enzyme2000> Has anyone here installed and used Beryl?

=== lynucs is now known as lynucs|g07_r007
[12:24] <RamiKassab> mc44: ok so it doesn't support the rage... well shit did people just forget about the ATI Rage? these cards are fairly common yet I can't find shit on google about getting mine properly setup in ubuntu

[12:25] <RamiKassab> sorry guys... getting frusterated
[12:25] <QwertyM> no ans? :(
[12:25] <Enzyme2000> Over it already..so any answers or just a little lecture about "anyone"?
[12:25] <QwertyM> like what dev should I use? /dev/______ ?
[12:26] <coliny> QwertyM: i use dvorak. aoeuidhtns...
[12:26] <mc44> RamiKassab: what is the model of your card?
[12:26] <ndlovu> hi all. if I'm connected to two networks, is there some way I can easily switch routing between them? I connect to the Internet through ppp0, and at the moment I have to disable eth1 (wireless network) before I dial.
[12:26] <coliny> ssam: have you tried other firewire equipment?
[12:27] <RamiKassab> mc44: per 'lspci -x' command, it is an ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra TR
[12:27] <Titto> slt
[12:27] <Titto> ouou
[12:27] <Titto> Hello
[12:27] <Titto> gutmargen
[12:27] <mc44> RamiKassab: have you tried the ati driver?
[12:27] <ssam> coliny, also for a dv camera (but i use mac os x for that (bows head in shame))
[12:28] <coliny> so firewire is only meant for hard disk?
[12:28] <QwertyM> coliny, what?
[12:28] <Titto> do you speak french?
[12:28] <QwertyM> :s
[12:28] <RamiKassab> mc44: yeah and it displayed the resolution but things were messed up on the screen somewhat
[12:28] <Enzyme2000> OK, thanks for the help. I now know that I should not start a question with "does anyone"...most helpful indeed.
[12:28] <christopher_l> where can I find settings, for setting proxy environment variables?
[12:28] <mc44> !fr | Titto
[12:28] <ubotu> Titto: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[12:28] <coliny> ssam: you actually use firewire on linux? what profession are you?
[12:28] <RamiKassab> mc44: first I had to do a bunch of tweaking on the screen to get the whole picture to show (it was pushed way off to the left)
[12:29] <Titto> thank
[12:29] <mc44> RamiKassab: well I believe that is the only driver that will support your card, apart from Vesa, and vesa is likely to be very slow
[12:29] <Titto> By
[12:29] <QwertyM> coliny, my question was ----> some urgent help here please, I connected a 6681 Nokia mobile now, what could be the DEV name for it? KMobileTools is asking one... do I need to mount it?
[12:29] <ssam> coliny, i am a student
[12:29] <Enzyme2000> Any other useful advice? Like "Don't split infinitives" or make sure you omit the apostrophe from the possessive "its"?
[12:29] <RamiKassab> mc44: second, in Konqueror, when I would move my mouse around on some of the icons on the left it would cause a white strip across the screen's width
[12:30] <RamiKassab> mc44: ok I'll go back to the ATI driver, how do I know what my vertical and horizontal refresh rates are?
[12:30] <coliny> QwertyM: never mind. i've noticed the name of the old keyboard in your irc name. yes, i do use the dvorak arrangement.
[12:30] <ssam> Enzyme2000, have you asked a question yet?
[12:30] <Enzyme2000> Or perhaps cats shouldn't be mentioned?
[12:30] <QwertyM> coliny, lol :)
[12:30] <mc44> RamiKassab: for your monitor?
[12:30] <RamiKassab> mc44: yeah
[12:30] <mc44> RamiKassab: also did you try the radeon driver?
[12:30] <mc44> RamiKassab: not sure sorry
[12:30] <Enzyme2000> ssam ages ago, all I got was a nice "doesanyone" lecture
[12:31] <RamiKassab> mc44: no I haven't should I give it a whirl?
[12:31] <coliny> ssam: thanks for your info. should i try and go get a hard disk to put onto the firewire port?
[12:31] <Enzyme2000> phleh!
[12:31] <ssam> Enzyme2000, so all you want to know is if people use beryl? (i dont, but i have tried compiz)
[12:31] <RamiKassab> mc44: radeon isn't even an option when reconfiguring
[12:32] <mc44> RamiKassab: hmm is this on edgy?
[12:32] <RamiKassab> mc44: yeah, Kubuntu Edgy
[12:32] <ssam> RamiKassab, i think you need to choose ati
[12:33] <RamiKassab> ssam: ok that's what I'm going with
[12:33] <Titto> dou you speak french?
[12:33] <Enzyme2000> ssam thanks but the question was... does anyone know how to get beryl-manager to load on startup?
[12:33] <RamiKassab> I'm stuck in the Monitor's horizontal syn range and vertical refresh rate though
[12:33] <RamiKassab> I have no idea what to put there for my monitor... it defaults to 28-72 for horizontal and 43-60 for vertical refresh range
[12:33] <ssam> Enzyme2000, oh, sorry i did not see that bit
[12:33] <mc44> Enzyme2000: System -> Preferences -> Sessions -> Start Up programs
[12:34] <mc44> Enzyme2000: and add it there
[12:35] <Enzyme2000> thanks mc44... tried that but it didn't seem to save, next startup it didn't load beryl manager and when I rechecked it wasn't listed in the"start up programs" list. Tried about 4 times any other hints?
[12:35] <coliny> ssam? i was in the toilet
[12:36] <Enzyme2000> Is there some sort of save option that I'm missing?
=== aloysio is now known as AFigueiredo

[12:36] <LoneWlf> so... in an attempt to apt-get upgrade, I've run into issues with getting the new kernel installed, it seems that lilo is having some issues with devfs, the exact error msg is short, so I'll paste it here: Fatal: device-mapper: dm_task_run(DM_DEVICE_TABLE) failed
[12:37] <LoneWlf> can anyone help me?
[12:37] <LoneWlf> or at least point me in the right direction?
[12:37] <ndlovu> QwertyM, did anyone answer you yet about the device name?
[12:37] <QwertyM> no
[12:37] <QwertyM> am waiting lol :)
[12:37] <QwertyM> you know? :D
[12:38] <ndlovu> QwertyM, I have an idea...
[12:38] <coliny> ssam?
[12:38] <ssam> coliny, if you need to. my main computer is a powerbook, so my only options for more disk space is usb1 or firewire
[12:38] <ndlovu> QwertyM, are you using a data cable?
[12:38] <QwertyM> ndlovu, yeah
[12:38] <QwertyM> data cable
[12:39] <mc44> Enzyme2000: no it should save, when you log on try chosing a different option from the Session menu
[12:39] <ndlovu> QwertyM, then it's probably /dev/ttyACM0 that you want to use
[12:39] <ssam> coliny, if you can use ide or sata instead that might be better for you
[12:39] <coliny> ssam: ah, sorry. evetually i'll get a firewire hard disk. to hold high quality screencast when find the screencasting program.
[12:40] <QwertyM> ohk, let me try that one now thanks a lot ndlovu, you own the same?
[12:40] <ndlovu> QwertyM, but if you want to make sure, type "tail -f /var/log/messages" from the commandline just before you plug it in
[12:40] <ndlovu> I use an N70, QwertyM, but it should be the same
[12:40] <coliny> i have a desktop with not enough disk drive bays and also a thinkpad laptop - so this is why i've considered firewire disk drive.

[12:47] <QwertyM> I dont wish to use it as a modem, just transferring images, music and maybe read and send sms too would do :)
[12:47] <QwertyM> ok thanks ndlovu

[12:49] <NineTeen67Comet> g'day all .. I've went and installed another Distro (call me a Disto ho) .. but I told it NOT to install grub, since I've got my precious Ubuntu's grub going .. My "Q" is .. what's the syntax for grub to handle another distro? It doesn't have an init file in /boot like Ubuntu, just the vmlinuz file ..
[12:49] <QwertyM> ndlovu, hehe, my phone isnt 3g :( and I got a good net connection too... so ttyacm0 it is, great, my ubuntu shift is now complete !
[12:50] <elisa> im green little smurf
[12:50] <QwertyM> NineTeen67Comet, there must be some grub.conf somewhere if grub's there right?
[12:50] <QwertyM> no, blue
[12:50] <ndlovu> QwertyM, congratulations, I'm glad it's working for you!
[12:51] <FirstStrike> interesting
[12:51] <NineTeen67Comet> QwertyM: yeah, the ubuntu menu.lst is still functioning well .. I just need to add the new distro's info to the menu.lst file .. (it doesn't have a /boot/grub since I didn't install it ..
[12:55] <malt> I know i have asked this before, but what do you guys/girls think is the best apache module to install to cap apaches upload speed?
[12:56] <dc2448> I'd rather rate limit upstream - but bm_mod will do it at the apache lvel iirc
[12:57] <apokryphos> malt: I think there was mod_throttle, which I used to use

[01:03] <sedra> did anyone know how to install 2 linux distributions and the fuucked redmond product together should i use lilo or grub

[01:05] <sedra> how should i configure grub
[01:05] <sedra> i have 3 partitons 1 ntfs 1 ext3 and 1 jfs

[01:10] <Lynx> Can a linux-swap partition be of a size 2GB?
[01:10] <skyblue> hi all
[01:10] <gilan> hi skyblue
[01:10] <skyblue> I'm on feisty and I'm having a problem with gnome-screensaver
[01:11] <skyblue> when I lock the screen, I can't unlock it.
[01:11] <skyblue> apparently /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver is correct
[01:11] <skyblue> I guess this is broken by some recent upgrade, possibly of today's updates.
[01:11] <orestyle9> I have somehow removed the top and bottom tool bars from my screen.  How do I get them back?
[01:12] <highneko> orestyle9: Try typing gnome-panel
[01:12] <vijaymateti> Lynx: Yes It can be..it depends n how much load is taken by your machine and it should be double the ram
[01:13] <highneko> orestyle9: I have never tried it myself. Does it work?
[01:13] <Lynx> I have such a partition and Kubuntu cannot find it.
[01:13] <vijaymateti> check for manual edit of partitions on installation
[01:13] <Lynx> mm, can the linux-swap partition follow the root linux partition on hdd?
[01:14] <orestyle9> No.  Not sure what happened, I was just trying to add icons on the toolbar at the top and "wham"  it was gon..
[01:14] <vijaymateti> Lynx: Yep You can do that
[01:14] <sedra> anyone can help me
[01:14] <sedra> i have 3 partitons 1 ntfs 1 ext3 and 1 jfs
[01:14] <Lynx> vijaymateti: i've created this partition separately, with the partition editor
[01:14] <vijaymateti> sedra: Yes, What ?
[01:14] <sedra> but the problem  ubuntu cant boot
[01:14] <orestyle9> I am just not sure how to get the toolbars to show back up again.
[01:14] <sedra> grub boot on opensuse or windoze
[01:15] <Lynx> currently i have no permanent system installed  :)
[01:15] <screechingcat> whats the command that gives you the option to choose between kdm and gdm ?
[01:15] <sedra> can i boot on 2 linus systems
[01:15] <bimberi> orestyle9: see if 'killall gnome-panel' does anything (also guessing)
[01:15] <orestyle9> Is there some setting in the settings manager, etc that will bring back icons etc to the desktop?
[01:15] <sedra> and how configure grub??
[01:16] <orestyle9> Says no process killed
[01:16] <bad_> anybody have problems with notebook Acer 1692 and black screen?
[01:16] <bimberi> orestyle9: yes, run 'gconf-editor' and look in /apps/nautilus/desktop
[01:17] <sedra> anyone can help me
[01:17] <bimberi> orestyle9: :( (killall not working)
[01:17] <bimberi> orestyle9: note that that's for desktop icons though, not the panel icons
[01:18] <highneko> orestyle9: Try killall gnome-panel
[01:18] <firepol> hi, what is the diference betweeen the desktop installer and the server installer? does the server installer come with less package (minimal installation)?
[01:18] <highneko> nvm someone suggested that.
[01:18] <screechingcat> firepol: yep
[01:18] <orestyle9> Ok, so what could I have done on the desktop to make side bars and icons disapear?
[01:18] <highneko> orestyle9: killall nautilus
[01:18] <screechingcat> orestyle9: did you change the default magnification ?
[01:18] <Lynx> does linux-swap need to be formatted?
[01:19] <highneko> yes
[01:19] <sedra> no
[01:19] <orestyle9> still nothing.  I am using kubuntu if that matters...
[01:19] <highneko> it gets formatted when I make it.
[01:19] <Lynx> omg, that's the problem
[01:19] <Lynx> or may be not
[01:19] <sedra> anyone can help me
[01:19] <sedra> i have 3 partitons 1 ntfs 1 ext3 and 1 jfs
[01:19] <sedra> but the problem  ubuntu cant boot
[01:19] <highneko> Lynx: What's the problem? Try typing 'free'
[01:19] <sedra> grub boot on opensuse or windoze
[01:19] <firepol> what about the server install, is it also a live cd or is it like the "alternate cd"?
[01:19] <sedra> can i boot on 2 linus systems
[01:20] <sedra> and how configure grub??
[01:20] <bimberi> orestyle9: lol, yes, gnome-panel is not part of KDE.  Not sure what the KDE equivalent is
[01:20] <orestyle9> xfdesktop?  would that be the process I need to kill?
[01:20] <sedra> anyone can help me
[01:20] <screechingcat> bimberi: its kicker
[01:20] <Lynx> highneko: Swap:            0          0          0

[01:21] <jrib> sedra: ask it one line and then wait patiently
[01:21] <Lynx> swapon -a didn't help
[01:22] <firepol> sedra, yes u can, modify your /boot/grub/menu.lst
[01:22] <bimberi> screechingcat: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm' does it iirc
[01:22] <dax_> what I have to type in my terminal do see which version I'm running at the moment ?
[01:22] <sedra> firepol: how
[01:22] <DBO> bimberi, I was watching, I was just too slow...
[01:22] <jrib> !version | dax_
[01:22] <ubotu> dax_: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[01:22] <screechingcat> bimberi: whats iirc ?
[01:22] <FirstStrike> For some reason I have working sound (alsa) in xmms, but not in any video programs (mplayer or vlc)

[01:23] <diminthedam> hi. suddenly my keyboard only responses afttter holding buttons down for 2 seconds. can smn  help please?
[01:23] <highneko> JustNew: Use the flash non-free package?
[01:23] <JustNew> yes, thats what it says in the instructions
[01:23] <screechingcat> JustNew: just open add/remove programs and check the flash package and click apply

[01:24] <JustNew> Ok, are we talking in synaptic?
[01:24] <firepol> sedra, a suggestion: i would use a boot partition, shared on the 2 linux systems

[01:24] <FirstStrike> sedra: Don't spam the channel like a 5 year old and I might be more inclined to help you.
[01:25] <firepol> sedra. i mean u have 2 linux installations, but use the same boot partition and swap partition. then you copy the 2 different kernels in the same boot partition. also make some backups of the kernels etc so in case u mess up something
[01:25] <sedra> but both ubuntu and suse are installed with windoze
[01:25] <screechingcat> JustNew: then it should be installed. open firefox and type about:plugins in the URL bar
[01:25] <firepol> sedra, no problem for that
[01:25] <JustNew> ok
[01:26] <firepol> sedra, i realized that the boot partition doesnt matter. once the boot sector is installed you can also use 2 separate boot partitions for the 2 separate linux installations
[01:26] <JustNew> Flash isnt in there
[01:26] <sedra> firepol: thnk u man | firstSrike: sorry
[01:26] <screechingcat> JustNew: does flash show up on that page ?
[01:26] <JustNew> no
[01:26] <highneko> JustNew: dpkg -l '*flash*'
[01:27] <JustNew> what is that command?
[01:27] <firepol> sedra: maybe in order not to mess uo, use the ubuntu grub-install
[01:27] <screechingcat> JustNew: did you install the package flashplugin-nonfree or mozilla-flashplayer ?
[01:27] <highneko> JustNew: Try it and see.
[01:27] <sedra> ok
[01:27] <JustNew> non free

[01:29] <bimberi> *(s)he
[01:29] <JustNew> om sorry about the posting
[01:29] <nevron> what should i do bimberi do you have ubuntu 6.10
[01:30] <stefg> jrib: another util around to do that? I'm constantly shifting partitions atm and it would be really handy to go uuid-style on my dapper installtion as well
[01:30] <orestyle9> Are there any other options for restoring the start bar in Kubuntu?  At this time, I almost feel I have to reinstall to get back to default..
[01:30] <jrib> stefg: use blkid to get the uuid's and put them into your fstab
[01:31] <nevron> bimberi can you paste bin your sources list if you have ubuntu 6.10
[01:31] <daisuki> #ubuntu-za
[01:31] <highneko> orestyle9: you're using kde?
[01:31] <bimberi> nevron: i do. stand by.  although it looks like you haven'd added the key for the kubuntu.org repo to apt
[01:32] <stefg> jrib: yeah, that's what i do now... thought there
[01:32] <nevron> but where would i find the key and btw why do i need a key?
[01:32] <stefg> 's some automated way
[01:32] <orestyle9> not sure.. at this point I cant get the system to do anything
[01:32] <visvak> how do i quit a program thats running in the terminal ?
[01:32] <visvak> like aptitude or bitchx
[01:32] <rapid> visvak, kill `pidof program`
[01:32] <nevron> visvak does crtl + c help
[01:32] <highneko> ctrl+c
[01:32] <diminthedam> dmesg gives error [17181956.804000]  atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x7f on isa0060/serio0). what does it mean?
[01:32] <jrib> stefg: well you could read /var/lib/dpkg/info/volumeid.postinst and pick out the part you want.  I don't know of any automated way other than that script
[01:33] <clem> visvak: CTRL + C
[01:33] <UbnNoo2> Anyone who got a nice link for learning to write scripts? (Mount an iso-image and run a program from there and put it all in the Applications menu)
[01:33] <daisuki> doesn't pkill work to ?
[01:33] <bimberi> nevron: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38107/
[01:33] <orestyle9> I basically installed system default.
[01:33] <visvak> clem nevron what is ctrl + c supposed to do ?
[01:33] <nevron> thanks bimberi i am looking at it
[01:33] <rapid> UbnNoo2, too easy
[01:33] <clem> visvak: or close the terminal, or use the kill -9 command on its PID...
[01:33] <rapid> UbnNoo2, google for bash scripting
[01:33] <stefg> jrib: thanks for the tip. i could rip the relevant code and write a script of my own..
[01:33] <nevron> kill the app visvak?
[01:33] <UbnNoo2> rapid : ok
[01:33] <visvak> clem i have no GUI. cant close the terminal
[01:33] <clem> visvak: well if you really want to know, CTRL+C sends a SIGSEV signal to the process.
[01:33] <rapid> UbnNoo2, i could send you a template if you are really lazy
[01:33] <rapid> \] /
[01:34] <highneko> orestyle9: You don't know if you're using kde or gnome? x_x
[01:34] <visvak> clem well, it isnt quiting the program
[01:34] <bimberi> nevron: valid packages are signed and having the key added to apt will mean that apt tools will be happy to install the packages without warnings (like that one)
[01:35] <bimberi> nevron: i'll see if I can find the instructions for loading the kubuntu.com key
[01:35] <nevron> ok bimberi thank you though i just replaced my sources list with yours

[01:35] <nevron> i am checking to see if i get errors still
[01:35] <bimberi> nevron: oh ok :)
[01:35] <visvak> clem, i guess it takes a while to register. the program quit
[01:36] <visvak> clem whats the command to shut the computer down ?
[01:36] <sladen> shutdown -t now now
[01:37] <clem> visvak: halt
[01:37] <nevron> bimberi seems to me that the problem is solved however i would like to get beryl svn updates still hmm i try adding that and if that wont work i ll just revert to your sources list
[01:37] <visvak> clem, right thanks mate

[01:37] <DJAdmiral> Long time no see
[01:38] <clem> visvak: you're welcome

[01:39] <DJAdmiral> Hey - my friend has an AMD64 - should he get Ubuntu for 64 bit PCs or the x86 release? In either case he's going for Edgy
[01:39] <nevron> is there a commanbd to uninstall a package completely
[01:39] <rapid> 64 obviously
[01:39] <orestyle9> Sorry, I am using the xfce interface in Kubuntu and can not get the start bars to show up.  not sure how to restore them.
[01:39] <nevron> with all the directories it created
[01:40] <Hal_Horn> I'm DJ's friend
[01:40] <DJAdmiral> rapid: yes, but on the AMD website it says that 32 bit is also simultaneously supported by AMD64
[01:40] <nevron> !remove
[01:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about remove - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:40] <bimberi> nevron: 'sudo apt-get remove --purge package' or use "Complete Removal" in Synaptic
[01:41] <nevron> bimberi i tried doing that yet it seems to be not working everytime i reinstall the package it is somehow corrupt and works partially

[01:42] <starman_> is there a gdesklet compatible with beryl?
[01:42] <DJAdmiral> Okay then
[01:42] <DJAdmiral> thanks
[01:42] <bimberi> DJAdmiral: from what I've picked up around here:  for desktop use and < 4GB RAM - i386
[01:42] <nevron> bimberi i am giving it another try and this time i ll kill x and reinstall later
[01:42] <bimberi> nevron: any error message? (on pastebin)
[01:43] <livingdaylight> can anyone say anything about gcompris crashing my computer?
[01:43] <ssam> DJAdmiral, if you dont care for flash (and similar), or are happy messing around a bit to make it work, or you need more that 4GB ram the use 64bit

[01:43] <nevron> no error messages the messegas are coming from beryl actually and it tells me that some plugins are missing along with all the themes the package comes from but when i use synaptic i see that all of them are installed
[01:44] <ssam> livingdaylight, does it crash the whole computer? do you end up back at the login screen?
[01:44] <nevron> ok i am just pruging them all and hoping that a clean install will shead a light to this
[01:44] <livingdaylight> ssam, yes, login screen rather
[01:44] <kgs> Uh.. Hello. :-)
[01:44] <orestyle9> Hey, I got my startbar back!!!!!
[01:44] <bimberi> nevron: hmmk.  sorry idk much about Beryl :|
[01:45] <bimberi> orestyle9: cool. what did it?
=== pitti is now known as pitti_xmas
[01:45] <ssam> livingdaylight, that means it is crashing X (the graphical layer). it technically makes it an X bug, that gcompris is triggering
=== pitti_xmas is now known as pitti
[01:45] <kgs> I installed Ubuntu this morning and I was wondering if there is some way for me to access files on NTFS partitions while running Ubuntu (Don't tell me to boot back into Windows. :-P).
[01:46] <livingdaylight> ssam, ok, :|
[01:46] <ssam> livingdaylight, x bugs are usually caused by drivers. do you know which graphics driver you are using
[01:46] <orestyle9> I had to log in with new session, so I still dont know how to fix it, but I can work around it.
[01:46] <kgs> Does anyone have any idea? I remember being able to do this with some distro a while back..
[01:46] <bimberi> kgs: you can mount ntfs partitions read-only
[01:46] <bimberi> !mountwindows | kgs
[01:46] <livingdaylight> ssam, i've got integrated onboard graphics
[01:46] <ubotu> kgs: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:46] <orestyle9> I will check and see what I can find and possibly what caused them to disappear.
[01:46] <screechingcat> kgs: use the ntfs 3g driver
[01:46] <kgs> Thank you.
[01:47] <bimberi> orestyle9: kk
[01:47] <kgs> Wait.. is everything I need installed already?
[01:47] <mc44> kgs: if you just want read only, then yes
[01:47] <bimberi> kgs: should be
[01:47] <kgs> Isn't it dangerous to try to write to NTFS with Linux?
[01:47] <mc44> kgs: the drivers are in BETA, yes
[01:47] <LinuxHelp> Hi um not really sure why I'm getting this: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/vclG6U60.html How do I create /dev/md0 ?
[01:47] <kgs> Okay.
[01:47] <ssam> livingdaylight, can you run 'cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver' in a terminal
[01:47] <gnomefreak> kgs: extreamly
[01:48] <kgs> Cool, thanks.
[01:48] <bimberi> kgs: yes, beta but improving all the time :)
[01:48] <To1> how come everyone says that compiz is better than its beryl counterpart on the ubuntu forums? am i missing something here? (ignoring the fact that the beryl manager is horribly broken in feisty)
[01:48] <ssam> livingdaylight, whats the last line of output?
[01:48] <gnomefreak> To1: ther eis no beryl for feisty :)
[01:48] <livingdaylight> ssam, vesa?
[01:48] <mc44> To1: it is argubly more stable
[01:49] <gnomefreak> To1: and compiz on feisty is very nice and works :)
[01:49] <kryptoz> when i try to install vim from source. "make install" tells me "make: `install' is up to date." why is it behaving like this
[01:49] <ssam> livingdaylight, https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gcompris/+bug/67360
[01:50] <To1> theres no beryl for feisty :S wat am i using then? ahhh?
[01:50] <DarthLappy> kryptoz: Try checkinstall, but why are you installing from source?
[01:50] <orestyle9> bimberi:  might possibly have something to do with the panel manager and a setting in there, but so far, thats what I can find...
[01:50] <ssam> livingdaylight, so its a known issue (not that directly helps you)
[01:50] <livingdaylight> ssam, wow,
[01:50] <gnomefreak> kryptoz: sudo apt-get source -b vim :)
[01:50] <livingdaylight> ssam, no, lol
[01:50] <bimberi> orestyle9: kk, thanks :)
[01:50] <paranoia16> the new firefox came out, i have 2.0 in /opt/firefox. if i download the new version, can i overwrite this dir? will it work right?
[01:50] <livingdaylight> ssam, but now i know, thx. That was like magic what you did
[01:51] <livingdaylight> ssam, how did you so quickly find the bug?
[01:51] <kryptoz> vim7.0 has dependancies
[01:51] <ssam> livingdaylight, it says unconfirmed on the bug report, so i will change it to confirmed (seen as you are getting ti too)
[01:51] <gnomefreak> kryptoz: also are you using sudo make install
[01:51] <kryptoz> yeah
[01:51] <kryptoz> i am
[01:51] <ssam> livingdaylight, i did a search for gcompris, there are only a few
[01:51] <livingdaylight> ssam, yea, and it seems it used to work in dapper, so a shame that it has regressed in Edgy
[01:52] <gnomefreak> kryptoz: sudo apt-get build-dep vim will get you the depends
[01:52] <[GuS] > Hi!
[01:52] <kryptoz> okay will try the apt-get now :)
[01:52] <kryptoz> thanx gnomefreak
[01:52] <mc44> !hi | [GuS] 
[01:52] <ubotu> [GuS] : Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[01:52] <gnomefreak> kryptoz: yw you are gonna need the src repos
[01:53] <ssam> livingdaylight, if you subvscribe
[01:53] <[GuS] > lol
[01:53] <ssam> livingdaylight, oops
[01:53] <[GuS] > hello mc44
[01:53] <ssam> livingdaylight, if you subscribe to the bug you will get any updates about it
[01:53] <ndlovu> how can I route all traffic for 192.168.10.* through eth1, and everything else through ppp0?
[01:54] <ubitux> hi [GuS]  =D
[01:54] <[GuS] > my God!
[01:54] <[GuS] > :P
[01:54] <ssam> livingdaylight, the chance of it being fixed soon might be small, you maybe best of going back to dapper if possible
[01:54] <ubitux> ^^
[01:55] <DarkED> is there an easy way to install java in edgy?
[01:55] <rusher> automatix
[01:55] <rusher> easy
[01:55] <ssam> !java
[01:55] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[01:55] <mc44> rusher: please dont recommend automatix here
[01:56] <DarkED> thank you
[01:56] <DarkED> yeah, dont worry, i wouldnt use automatix if it was the ONLY way
[01:56] <DarkED> thanks again
[01:56] <To1> automatix is a great utility for beginners imho
[01:56] <DarkED> To1, and the probability that it will break your install is highly likely
[01:57] <mc44> !automatix
[01:57] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[01:57] <To1> it always seemed to work for me
[01:57] <mc44> !Worksforme | To1
[01:57] <ubotu> To1: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[01:57] <To1> i suppose you dislike easyubuntu as well then?
[01:57] <livingdaylight> ssam, not for that alone
[01:58] <narian> DarkED, in what way would automatix "break your system"?
[01:58] <mc44> narian: on upgrades for one
[01:59] <DarkED> narian, it broke mine three times, twice in breezy and once in dapper. something to do with the multimedia installs
[01:59] <narian> mc44, you mean of the packages Automatix install or the program itself?
[01:59] <DarkED> anyways, im not gonna argue about it, this isnt the place
[01:59] <DarkED> thanks again
[01:59] <narian> ...
[01:59] <derFlo> how can i set the resolution in the login-window? everything's so small there
[02:00] <mc44> narian: I mean on upgrades from e.g. Dapper to Edgy, but this is offtopic really, so I dont want to argue about it :)
[02:00] <paranoia16> i am trying to copy a folder from my desktop called firefox to /opt, i tried using sudo cp /home/matt/desktop/firefox /opt, but it says "omitting directory", there is already a folder in ?opt named firefox, i want to overwrite it, should i just delete it and the copy it over?
[02:00] <lafielle> Can anybody suggest a good GUI-based firewall manager besides firestarter?
[02:00] <rusher> guarddog
[02:00] <ssam> livingdaylight, you could try installing the dapper gcompis on edgy, but it might not work, and might not help
[02:01] <narian> mc44, ahh okey, just wanted to know (= im not in for an argument
[02:01] <lafielle> rusher: will I have to install KDE for that?
[02:01] <rusher> it will install some kde dependencies
[02:01] <rusher> not the whole desktop
[02:01] <livingdaylight> ssam, i just wanted some stuff for my little boy on here, but not if it is too hard
[02:01] <lafielle> rusher: I see.. this is a low end PC and I want to keep things minimal.. I'll check it out thanks.
[02:01] <paranoia16> how do you remove a dir that isn't empy? i tried sudo rmdir
[02:02] <rusher> rm -r directory
[02:02] <daisuki> try sudo rm -r
[02:02] <sedra> root
[02:02] <narian> paranoia16, cp =    -f, --force
[02:02] <narian>               if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it  and
[02:02] <narian>               try again
[02:02] <rusher> dos does not have deltre anymore =(
[02:02] <narian> ops
[02:02] <LinuxHelp> Okay, I've successuflly done a "mdadm --create /dev/.static/dev/md0 --level=linear --raid-devices=2 /dev/sd[ab] " but now what I'm asking, (I'll be compiling my own kernel), is will the kernel still be able to auto-start my md on /dev/sda and sdb? The reason I ask is that /dev/sda and /dev/sdb arent partitions (which I would usually mark with Linux Raid AutoDetect).
[02:03] <ssam> livingdaylight, http://packages.ubuntu.com/gcompris would help you find the old packages, then you can try installing them with double click
[02:06] <PecisDarbs> hello, does DVD version contains LiveCD envorement?
[02:08] <mc44> PecisDarbs: yes it does
[02:08] <PecisDarbs> mc44: thanks :)

[02:10] <orestyle9> recommendations on mp3 players in Ubuntu?
[02:10] <T2> amarok is awesome
[02:11] <flk> orestyle9: mms
[02:11] <T2> RxDx: try ffmpeg, it converts most things
[02:11] <PecisDarbs> orestyle9: Rhythmbox, XMMS, Amarok
[02:11] <PecisDarbs> orestyle9: all they need plugins for mp3 remember
[02:11] <orestyle9> native they will not play mp3?
[02:11] <flk> afternoon, when i try to install mplayer i keep getting a long list of error starting with " Depends: libasound2 (> 1.0.11) but 1.0.10-2ubuntu4 is to be installed"
[02:11] <T2> o right you need the codec package
[02:12] <mc44> orestyle9: due to patent restrictions, no
[02:12] <orestyle9> k
[02:12] <PecisDarbs> orestyle9: no, because they are seperated in codecs packages
[02:12] <flk> is there anything i can do to stop this supposed downgrade or whatever it is?

[02:22] <bambam> anyone got an idea or a solution for this?

[02:28] <kwahgib> Hi, when i'm trying to install ubuntu i get the following error continously "hda: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit" "Buffer I/O error on device hda, logical block 58694". I googled it up, and it seems many people seem to have this issue with Ubuntu 6.10.. I was wondering, is there a way around it?
[02:29] <mc44> flk: where are you trying to install the file with those dependencies from?
[02:29] <Buntex> Has anyone had anyluck getting the S-Video working with the Radeon 7500M chip?
[02:29] <Buntex> trying the ati2 module
[02:30] <bambam> other question: is anyone able to successfully load nvidiafb-module ??
[02:30] <flk> mc44: well i think its from multiverse/universe
[02:30] <flk> i am trying to get mplayer an vlc player
[02:30] <Buntex> S-Videooo
[02:30] <Buntex> lol
[02:30] <mc44> flk: if you have only official repos then there is something very wrong
[02:31] <mc44> flk: the dependencies should all be satisfied
[02:31] <flk> oh btw i also get this error "Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have"
[02:31] <flk> requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
[02:31] <flk> distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
[02:31] <flk> or been moved out of Incoming.
[02:32] <mc44> flk: right, but in the official repos, the dependencies should be met...
[02:32] <flk> hmm
[02:32] <flk> reinstall then it is :(
[02:32] <mc44> flk: is this a fresh install?
[02:32] <FiFo> hi all

[02:35] <mc44> Zodiac`: yes, but it is better to install ubuntu second, as windows will overwrite grub
[02:35] <Buntex> google insnt helping
[02:35] <Zodiac`> mc44, how to install grub after windows?

[02:36] <flk> at the bottom of the sourcelist i have a edgy security update
[02:36] <mc44> flk: er.. how did that get there?
[02:36] <Fastly> guys does anyone here have skype running on amd64?
[02:36] <flk> i think that got there via synaptics
[02:36] <derFlo> hi
[02:37] <seb__> Hi everybody, I'm triing to install Heroes of Might an Magic 3 version Linux, on my laptop with Ubuntu Edgy, but when I lanch the program, it sends "This installation doesn't support glibc-2.1 on Linux / x86". I'm a newbee with Linux, and I don't know what is "glibc", somebody could help me please????
[02:37] <flk> i remember ticking the security repos
[02:37] <allardh> I have a plantronics headset. The controls on the headset used to control the ALSA main volume control like they should, but since I upgraded to Feisty they stopped working. I get a volume indicator in Gnome that matches the events on the toggle button, but it doesn't modify the default pcm volume. How can I fix this? What program generates the volume bar mid-screen?
[02:37] <derFlo> gnome themes aren't displayed as they Shoud be..
[02:37] <flk> but i thought that would've only addedd repost for dapper not edgy...weird
[02:37] <derFlo> NO graphical buttons and the Top bar isn't from the theme...
[02:37] <Fastly> skype: error while loading shared libraries: libasound.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[02:37] <mc44> flk: very...
[02:37] <Fastly> alex@arnie:~$ locate libasound.so.2
[02:37] <Fastly> /usr/lib/libasound.so.2
[02:38] <Fastly> any ideas?
[02:38] <allardh> Fastly: can you run ldd on the program involved?
[02:38] <allardh> See how it is linked by the distributor
[02:38] <mc44> Zodiac`: the install CD rescue mode should let you do that
[02:38] <allardh> Fastly: /usr/lib/ should work though
[02:38] <flk> mc44: thnx for the help mate :D
[02:38] <Zodiac`> seb__, try sudo apt-get install glibc-2.1 in terminal?
[02:38] <mc44> flk: no problem
[02:39] <Fastly> libasound.so.2 => not found
[02:39] <Fastly>         libqt-mt.so.3 => not found
[02:39] <allardh> there you are :)
[02:39] <Zodiac`> mc44, so what i have to do is to install windows, and then install ubuntu in rescue mode again? but windows will overwrite all my files? :/
[02:40] <mc44> Zodiac`: no only when isntalling, it overwrites the Master Boot Record
[02:40] <allardh> Fastly: weird, ldd on skype gives me: libasound.so.2 => /usr/lib/libasound.so.2 (0xb7e8b000)
[02:40] <mc44> Zodiac`: because it is evil!
[02:40] <Fastly> allardh: are you running amd64?
[02:40] <Zodiac`> mc44, so windows wont erease all? =P
[02:40] <allardh> Fastly: can you run ldconfig as root?
[02:40] <Buntex> good to see such a large number of nixers in a chan
[02:40] <allardh> Fastly: no
[02:40] <Buntex> unless youre all bots :P
[02:40] <Fastly> hmm... that's the difference
[02:41] <mc44> Zodiac`: no if you install it on a seperate partition, it will only delete the MBR, after fixing with the LIveCD, your Linux should be the same
[02:41] <Zodiac`> mc44, aha.. how to partiotion in ubuntu then? :/
[02:41] <allardh> Fastly: yes I think the linker looks for it in /lib/tls/ or the likes
[02:42] <allardh> Fastly: meh, not there, but you get what I mean
[02:42] <allardh>  /usr/lib/$architecture
[02:42] <mc44> Zodiac`: using gparted. But you cannot partition your harddrive while using it, so you could use the LiveCD. Also the windows installer will allow you to repartition your drive
[02:43] <Fastly> i've been following this advice: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype#head-6c3cbecd1f1ecd4388bde1462ee364bb57e4533b
[02:43] <malt> Hello, say i buy two 100 gb hard drives, is there anyway i can link them togeather to make it where i can create home user directorys on w/e hd i choose to put it on?

[02:43] <Fastly> and i extracted the deb file libqt3-mt to /lib32
[02:43] <allardh> Does anyone know how the hardware events from my plantronics headset are handled? I get a volume bar mid-screen, but the default PCM volume is not modified

[03:06] <teky> ok
[03:07] <binary_goofy> mc44: downloaded n installed. when i run d risk with tegclient, asks for server to connect to. no other options highlighted. how do i work around this?
[03:07] <teky> i have a dell inspiron 6000
[03:07] <mc44> binary_goofy: tick start server locally
[03:07] <clem> teky: what wireless card do you have?
[03:08] <clem> teky: and what is the problem with it ?
[03:08] <fly_80> hello all
[03:08] <Throbbinhood> exit
[03:08] <binary_goofy> mc44: tried already. nothing happens when i ok after that. just shows the same window again.
[03:09] <fly_80> i ha d a fresh install of kubuntu, and it detects my wireless USB network interface, but it doesn't reach the network (with dhcp)
[03:09] <mc44> binary_goofy: in server name it should say "localhost"
[03:09] <binary_goofy> mc44: yes it lists localhost. name is my user name.
[03:09] <fr500> fly_80: do you use WPA on your network?
[03:10] <binary_goofy> mc44: server port is 1.
[03:10] <mc44> binary_goofy: try port 2000
[03:10] <teky>  with intel pro wireless 2915 abg
[03:10] <teky> i can turn it on but i cant seem to use it

[03:10] <fly_80> *wep
[03:10] <binary_goofy> mc44: works like a darling :) thanks a ton. God bless.
[03:10] <teky> i tryed change drivers like the posts says in most forums
[03:10] <fr500> hmmm
[03:11] <PeRCeVaL> anyone1 here got cedega and its using it for CS or WoW ?
[03:11] <mc44> binary_goofy: start -> add robot to add bots
[03:11] <fr500> did you set the right key fly_80
[03:11] <QwertyM> how do I setup a vnc web interface ? nobody? :D
[03:11] <QwertyM> !vnc
[03:11] <ubotu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[03:11] <mc44> binary_goofy: game -> add robot rather
[03:11] <fly_80> i think so, but it seems to not detect the ESSID
[03:11] <fly_80> I have to write myself
[03:11] <QwertyM> but I need it through browser
[03:12] <binary_goofy> mc44: its got a game, launch robot. when i click nothing happens.
[03:12] <fr500> fly_80: do you see the SSID if ryn iwlist scan?
[03:12] <fly_80> fr500: maybe I have to disable the other eth ?
[03:12] <fly_80> now i try
[03:12] <mc44> binary_goofy: it should add another coloured dot
[03:12] <fr500> fly_80: shouldnt be needed
[03:13] <fr500> fly_80: you need to enable the connection even to scan sometimes
[03:13] <fly_80> fr500: sudo iwlist ?
[03:13] <mc44> binary_goofy: try pressing start
[03:13] <clem> teky: does it show up in iwconfig?
[03:13] <fr500> nah, normal user is fine
[03:13] <mc44> binary_goofy: there should be two colours on the map
[03:13] <binary_goofy> mc44: yup. adds it. r d dots my turns??
[03:13] <fly_80> it returns: No scan result
[03:13] <teky> im running on ubuntu 6.10 installed on a dell laptop inspiron 6000 and cant get my wireless wifi going whish is a intel pro wireless 2915 abg anyone have an idea?? or a howto ?
[03:14] <mc44> binary_goofy: well whatever colour you chose is you. you can add up to 5 robots
[03:14] <mc44> binary_goofy: and of course you can play across the internet with people :)
[03:14] <teky> clem let me recheck that
[03:14] <fr500> fly_80: i thinkk your wifi nic is disable somethow
[03:14] <fly_80> nic?
[03:15] <binary_goofy> mc44: ok. but how do d robots help? am sorry if i sound stupid, but have only played the board game so far.
[03:15] <mc44> binary_goofy: they are people to play against...
[03:15] <mc44> binary_goofy: well robots to play against. if you have no one else to play
[03:15] <fr500> network interface card
[03:16] <binary_goofy> mc44: k, get the point. thanks a ton. God bless :)
[03:16] <mc44> binary_goofy: no problem
[03:16] <fly_80> fr500: no, it's active.... iwconfig detects it
[03:16] <fr500> iwconfig always detects it
[03:16] <fr500> the radio may be off
[03:17] <fly_80> i add to add the access point manually maybe?
[03:17] <fly_80> *had
[03:17] <fr500> nope
[03:17] <fr500> what nic?
[03:17] <binary_goofy> mc44: gud night. thanks once again :) over n out.

[03:19] <fr500> oh
[03:19] <fr500> hmmm
[03:20] <fly_80> don't know if ubuntu uses ndiswrapper or prism driver
[03:20] <fr500> weird, i think those work out of the box
[03:20] <fr500> try with ndiswrapper utils 1.8 and the latest windoze drivers, maybe thatl do it
[03:21] <fly_80> the problem is that iwconfig report some wrong data
[03:21] <fly_80> first it says 802.11b

[03:34] <naelphin> how can i test if xorg is using 2d acceleration?
[03:35] <ubuntu_> Hello !
[03:35] <un_operateur> 2d or 3d ?
[03:35] <DrLabel> is 7.04 good to work or i need to get other distro
[03:35] <ubuntu_> speak portugue /
[03:35] <gilnim> hey
[03:35] <DrLabel> e really need linux on my machine
[03:35] <un_operateur> 7.04 still needs quite some work done on it
[03:35] <DrLabel> bahhhhhhhhh
[03:35] <mjr> naelphin, grep -i driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf and if it doesn't say vesa or fbsomething there you're highly likely to have _some_ 2d acceleration
[03:35] <gilnim>  some of you still go to school?
[03:36] <DrLabel> why can't 6.10 install
[03:36] <pike_> DrLabel: its just a kernel thing personally im sticking with dapper for a while but a diff kernel or feisty might work. check ubuntuforums.org  maybe
[03:36] <ubuntu_> I don't speak english
[03:36] <AdviZzzor> hay ! were are you ?
=== reus is now known as MegaRoM
[03:36] <DrLabel> i have seen the forums and notting only for the prob of 6600Gt notting more :(
=== MegaRoM is now known as whazilla
[03:37] <DrLabel> pike_ but how do i put a diff kernel i
[03:37] <DrLabel> can i chose other kernel at install ???
[03:37] <naelphin> Driver          "ati"
[03:37] <naelphin> that means it is accelerated?
[03:38] <Jerimiah40> naelphin - no, that means it's made by ATI
[03:38] <Juhaz> no, it doesn't
[03:38] <naelphin> no vesa/fb
[03:38] <mjr> naelphin, yes it is
[03:38] <naelphin> (i know there is no 3d, don't mind)
[03:39] <pike_> DrLabel: i guess you could boot livecd; mount drive; chroot to it and apt-get a diff kernel. or just copy old dapper kernel and have edit menu.lst to boot it instead.. might be a little wierd but might work

[03:45] <un_operateur> pike_, sudo aptitude install linux-image=2.6.20

[03:46] <FlyingSquirrel32> I know I can use top to see cpu usage of my processes, but whats the best way to see how much memory each of the running processes are using?
[03:46] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, top again
[03:46] <McGyver^> miao
[03:46] <andrewc> FlyingSquirrel32, specifically "M".
=== McGyver^ is now known as inkompatible
[03:47] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: I tried looking for that in the manual 'cause i figured it might do it, but I got lost :(
[03:47] <fly_80> GaiaX11: i have not the internet connectio... ican't do apt-get
[03:47] <inkompatible> ubuntu sucks. Slackware rulez. It's not a problem of points of view. It's just a fact.
[03:47] <DrLabel> ok i nhave to go to work at night ill install again
[03:47] <DrLabel> bye and tks
[03:47] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, top has it under %MEM
[03:48] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: but how do I make it sort by mem?
[03:48] <tamacracker> guys?
[03:48] <tamacracker> how do i move scripts in gimp?
[03:48] <FlyingSquirrel32> I need to know which is using most mem, but it's not nessisarily the one using most cpu
[03:48] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, you can't have it sorted -- because its varying every nanosecond
[03:49] <tamacracker> when i click on the script i just typed, it automatically opens up the edit menu to retype it again.
[03:49] <GaiaX11> fly_80: Even so, check if you have modconf in your system with synaptic. I have checked here in my modconf and prism is native.
[03:49] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: but it could be averaged out...
[03:50] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: System monitor panel will say how much is used overall...
[03:50] <fly_80> GaiaX11: i have no modconf
[03:50] <andrewc> FlyingSquirrel32: type "top" in a Terminal. Press "M" in top. Top will then sort in descending order of mem usage (in %MEM), as polled every few seconds.
[03:51] <FlyingSquirrel32> andrewc: That's it! thanks.
[03:52] <GaiaX11> fly_80: How then are you talking in this channel if you don't have net connexion?

[03:57] <yacek19> hi
[03:57] <GaiaX11> fly_80: So have you configured your wireless card?
[03:57] <yacek19> I have some problem: I have 8 GB root partition, df shows that it has used 5,6 GB and 2,4 GB is free. But calculating the space of all folders, shows that it has 4,5 GB of used space, so where is 1,1 GB?
[03:58] <pike_> yacek19: du -ach /mountpoint | grep total  shows only 4.5 ?
[03:59] <finalbeta_> Just had enother great thing on my desktop, metacity (I assume) gets frozen. Can't move/change windows, yet I could still type in Xchat. On my laptop changing to another display helps, but on my desktop I had to restart X. (And it's not a memory problem, got about 1GB left)
[03:59] <vakuum> Ahoy. I've installed ubuntu server edition, and once the installation is complete and it reboots, i get a grub error, "Error 10", as it says. I tried re-installing it, tried installing debian too. No luck with either of them. Any idea what is wrong?
[03:59] <yacek19> pike_ I check the space with konqueror
[04:00] <yemu> hi, i have problem with fglrx driver, after booting module fglrx is not loaded and when i try to load it i get: FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/volatile/fglrx.ko': No such file or directory
[04:00] <fly_80> GaiaX11: i'm trying
[04:00] <yemu> when i copy the module
[04:01] <fly_80> it seems it is installed the driver
[04:01] <yemu> to the right place, it loads, but then after rebooting again it's gone
[04:01] <yemu> and i can't get the acceleration
[04:02] <FlyingSquirrel32> andrewc: Thanks again. That works great! Now I can trim back on my mem use without blindly closing programs till the usage goes down ;)
[04:02] <Surghi> hi
[04:02] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, why dont you get a docklet that displays memusage -- that way you dont have to have top open
[04:02] <Surghi> is there any inofficial package from "opengroupware.org"  for Ubuntu?
[04:02] <Surghi> I am using  Dapper and Edgy
[04:02] <fly_80> don't know why, maybe i have to tell the system to use ndiswrapper?
[04:03] <qmf> ipv6 is causing anything not in firefox (because it edited the about:config to not use ipv6 for dns) to take ages to resolve. i've tried to turn it off in modprobe.d/aliases but it's still being slow. any ideas?
[04:03] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: I do, but when my usage is high, it doesn't tell me which prog is using the most!

[04:04] <QwertyM> :s
[04:04] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: so I close the most common culprits until I hit the right one (Firefox with a ton of tabs, or rythmbox that has been running for a week, etc...)
[04:04] <Foskasse> QwertyM nice!! im portuguese!
[04:04] <QwertyM> lol

[04:04] <QwertyM> heh
[04:04] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, sounds so like me
[04:04] <un_operateur> :)
[04:05] <un_operateur> qmf, how slow is slow?
[04:05] <qmf> 10 seconds to resolve
[04:05] <un_operateur> qmf, damn
[04:05] <qmf> damn indeed
[04:05] <yemu> hi, i have problem with fglrx driver, after booting module fglrx is not loaded and when i try to load it i get: FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/volatile/fglrx.ko': No such file or directory
[04:05] <qmf> apt-getting anything is a pain in the arse
[04:05] <un_operateur> qmf, first things first, you on a slow connection?
[04:05] <qmf> no. 10 meg cable.
[04:06] <un_operateur> qmf, you use a router at home?
[04:06] <qmf> yes
[04:06] <yemu> when i copy the module to the right place, it loads, but then after rebooting again it's gone
[04:06] <Jekichan> Help! How to install XGI X5 video chip kernel module on laptop?
[04:06] <FlyingSquirrel32> now that I'm thinking of it, is there a utility in ubuntu that simply tells you the general specs of the system like mem, cpu, etc?
[04:06] <un_operateur> qmf, does your PC get its DNS settings from the router?
[04:06] <FlyingSquirrel32> kinda like the general tab of system properties in windoze?
[04:07] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, gnome-system-monitor
[04:07] <qmf> i guess so, im not too big on network setups.
[04:07] <qmf> it's worked perfectly before. always has.
[04:08] <un_operateur> qmf, at a command line -- nslookup
[04:08] <andrewc> un_operateur: that's quite pretty. I'd not seen that app before.
[04:09] <un_operateur> qmf, test out a few names -- google.com, yahoo.co.jp, fr.wikipedia.org etc
[04:09] <qmf> hmm, they work instantly
[04:09] <cmweb> Any one know of a software that will stream to a shoutcast server, and also play playlists?
[04:09] <cmweb> Sorta like Winamp
[04:10] <un_operateur> qmf, it's probably system load or networking-stack latency slowing it down then
[04:10] <aoirthoir> Howdy, how y'all doin?
[04:10] <un_operateur> andrewc, really?? you've never ever come across it before?
[04:11] <qmf> can't be system load. this is a totally stripped down xfce setup. and firefox displays stuff instantly.
[04:11] <qmf> it's just wget. apt-get. stuff like that
[04:11] <aoirthoir> Does anyone know how to make grub dual boot with an OS (windows) on an entirely different hard drive than grub?
[04:11] <andrewc> But top, ps, and kill do what I need already ;)
[04:11] <qmf> how can i check if ipv6 is still on?
[04:12] <jita> edgy-propsed
[04:12] <un_operateur> qmf -- lsmod i think
[04:12] <jita> what does edgy-propsed repo contain?
[04:12] <gubuntu> LOL
[04:12] <gubuntu> aptitude moo
[04:12] <gubuntu> then aptitude -v moo
[04:12] <un_operateur> qmf, lsmod | grep -i ipv6
[04:12] <gubuntu> and continue to add on more v's (i.e apitude -vv moo)
[04:12] <jita> gubuntu: ??
[04:12] <gubuntu> just do it
[04:13] <jita> thats not the answer to my question
[04:13] <qmf> un_operateur: returned nothing.
[04:13] <qmf> hmm
[04:13] <gubuntu> apt-get moo makes a ascii cow
[04:13] <jita> ok
[04:13] <un_operateur> qmf, it means you dont have the ipv6 module loaded
[04:13] <gubuntu> aptitude moo with continuing to add verbose flags is funny aswell
[04:13] <un_operateur> qmf, which release are you on? edgy?
[04:14] <qmf> un_operateur: yeah i dont want it loaded
[04:14] <qmf> yeah edgy
[04:14] <Stormx2> gubuntu: haha./
[04:14] <cmweb> Any one know of a software that will stream to a shoutcast server, and also play playlists like winamp?
[04:14] <gubuntu> its a snaked eating an elephant, ofcourse
[04:14] <Stormx2> cmweb: I wrote a guide on doing that, 1 second
[04:15] <edgy> Hi, I can't start azureus in edgy. It crashed after giving errors like:
[04:15] <edgy> # An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:
[04:15] <edgy> # SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0xb07c2d02, pid=13318, tid=3084998320
[04:15] <un_operateur> qmf, all updates installed -- especially libnet* and kernel?
[04:15] <Stormx2> How do i set ubuntu to look up stuff in my ~/bin for commands?
[04:16] <un_operateur> Stormx2, PATH=$PATH;~/bin
[04:16] <qmf> un_operateur: everything is tip top
[04:16] <Stormx2> un_operateur: Permanently...

[04:16] <ubotu> Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[04:16] <un_operateur> Stormx2,  if you want that to persist -- you need to add that line to ~/.bashrc
[04:16] <un_operateur> Stormx2, or the rc file of your shell if you use another other than bash
[04:17] <cmweb> Stormx2, nothing>
[04:17] <cmweb> ?
[04:17] <un_operateur> qmf, I can't really think of anything else really -- can you give me an example of just when it is slow --
[04:18] <un_operateur> qmf, are only lookups slow -- is connectivity hampered as well?
[04:18] <qmf> just lookups
[04:18] <cmweb> ki'
[04:18] <bayziders> well this isnt really a linux question but linux suers are very good with computers so i figured id ask.What is it that websites like go daddy do to give you a domain and how can you do it your self so it dosent cost you money?
[04:18] <qmf> like if i apt-get a prog. it'll hang while it's connecting to the server it's getting it from
[04:18] <cmweb> my  darn cat
[04:18] <cmweb> .
[04:18] <mutante_> What might the Free Software Foundation refer to when they say "software which communicates between the proprietary Ubuntu web application and the users' desktop has been disabled" what is this software?
[04:19] <Chousuke> mutante_: launchpad maybe?
[04:19] <mc44>  mutante_ automated bug reporting to launchpad
[04:19] <un_operateur> mutante_, mutant spyware with a good inclination :)
[04:19] <cmweb> Stormx2, Anything?
[04:20] <mutante_> they have made this new distro "gNewSense", the FSF recommends it, and its Ubuntu based but ..see quote above
[04:20] <age6racer> How do I set up a printer with Edgy/Xfce at the moment abiword defaults to lpr but I have a usb printer. do i need drivers? or do I just have to set it to the right usb port. (printer is a canon s630)
[04:20] <bayziders> any one know?
[04:20] <mutante_> plus the kernel has been cleaned from all "binary blobs" without source
[04:20] <aradia> how do i find out which irc network im connected to in xchat
[04:21] <aoirthoir>  /join #php
[04:21] <user-land> Hello, I don't find a way to make the margins smaller in OpenOffice. Is there a simpler word processor you would recommend ?
[04:21] <mutante_> So launchpad is not open source?
[04:21] <Stormx2> cmweb: Here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=298196
[04:21] <cmweb> Thnks
[04:21] <pike_> age6racer: i normally just go to localhost or 127.0.0.1:631 in my browser and configure cups from there
=== son18_confused is now known as iustin85
[04:21] <Stormx2> cmweb: Thats one way of doing it, but its a bit messy. You can do it in a few other ways
[04:21] <mc44> user-land: abiword
[04:21] <un_operateur> bayziders, did you mean this -- http://www.dyndns.com ??
[04:21] <user-land> thanks mc44
[04:22] <mc44> mutante_: no it is not
=== atoponce is now known as emcnabb
[04:22] <Sp4rKy> hi
[04:22] <mc44> mutante_: its a web service
[04:22] <Sp4rKy> does anyone know how to start soldat (soldat.pl) with wine / cedega ?
[04:22] <Sp4rKy> it doesn't start with me :/
[04:23] <mutante_> mc44: ah, i see, thanks, now i understand better what they mean
[04:23] <pike_> age6racer: that should work with anything using cups from solaris to ubuntu
[04:23] <age6racer> ok. i have no idea what cups is but i'll read up
[04:23] <cmweb> stormx2, can i host the stream my self?
[04:23] <bayziders> un_operateur; i was just wondering how they give you a domain?? like what do they do
[04:23] <user-land> do you use abiword or abiword-gnome ?
=== emcnabb is now known as goozbach
[04:24] <mutante_> has anybody ran a benchmark / test / comparison of Ubuntu Christian Edition vs. Ubuntu Satanic Edition yet ? :p
[04:25] <Stormx2> cmweb: You can, thats covered elsewhere
[04:25] <mutante_> i was just looking through a "list of ubuntu based distros and live cd"..damn there is everything-buntu by now
[04:25] <un_operateur> bayziders, they get you to fill out a form with details, about name, ip address, etc -- then update their DNS servers to ensure that name resolves to your current IP address -- they also give out a client which updates their servers of your address every half hour or so
=== goozbach is now known as atoponce
[04:25] <Stormx2> cmweb: It comes in two parts, the server and the streamer. My guide is only on streaming. I think there is a guide on setting up the server.
[04:25] <bayziders> un_operateur; is there any way to edit a dns bye your self?
[04:26] <un_operateur> bayziders, you can run your own DNS servers -- if thats what you mean
[04:26] <pike_> lol the satanic edition looks pretty well done
[04:26] <mutante_> bayziders: the simplest "DNS" is editing your /etc/hosts manually
[04:26] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: Hey. Soldat on Wine is horrible
[04:27] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: I haven't tried on cedega but I've heard its basicly unplayable too.
[04:27] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: I've tried, I write hacks for soldat.
[04:27] <bayziders> mutante: how do you do that? I have no way of buying any thing on the internet so im trying to find out how to get a free www.whatever.com domain
[04:27] <mc44> mutante_: if your very keen on everything being free then use Gnewsense
[04:27] <age6racer> thatnks pike. That couldnt have been easier!
[04:27] <age6racer> *thanks
[04:27] <wero> hi someone can tell how can I configure my keyboard shortcuts? cause I pres -Vol and +Vol and the icon appears on the screen but the volumen doesnt change =(
[04:27] <pike_> age6racer: np
[04:28] <mc44> pike_: Ubuntu SE goes great with beryl snow and burn :)
[04:28] <Stormx2> wero: System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
[04:28] <mutante_> mc44: yes, thats exactly what i was reading about, the quote is from an article about it
=== atoponce is now known as h
[04:28] <mutante_> mc44: and it made me wonder what software they meant
[04:28] <kane77> is it possible to have ubuntu for example in english but to install an aplication in other language?? if so how?
=== h is now known as atoponce
[04:28] <mc44> mutante_: well there isnt really anuthing that talks to launchpad, just opens a webbrowser really
[04:29] <iustin85> is it possible to start the GUI (gnome) manually, not to enter automatically in a gdm ?
[04:29] <Stormx2> kane77: Not sure if it'd be easy, but possible for sure :)
[04:29] <un_operateur> bayziders, are you looking for your own domainname such as bayziders.org .. or don't you mind hitch along with the free servers such as dyndns or zoneedit or no-ip ??
[04:29] <mutante_> bayziders: a free domain? well, there are a very few top level domains that used to give out free domains, like .to or .cx .. nto sure .. .ws?
[04:30] <Valmarko> I installed mozilla-mplayer plugin but firefox is not recognizing it. someone help me?
[04:30] <Stormx2> bayziders: no-ip is excellent if you want others to be able to access your computer.
[04:30] <mutante_> bayziders: or maybe your router has a "DynDNS" feature?
[04:30] <Stormx2> Valmarko: Have you restarted firefox? You have to close ALL firefox windows (view-source, downloads etc)
[04:30] <Valmarko> Yes, I did it...
[04:30] <bayziders> un_operateur & mutante ; actually i found something thats perfect for me its a .tk domain
[04:31] <Stormx2> Valmarko: Okay. The plugin won't show up in "add-ons"
[04:31] <Stormx2> Valmarko: But it should work.
[04:31] <kane77> okay... I get always some error when I return from hibernation about HAL... now my disks are unavailable... how can I fix it?
[04:31] <bayziders> are .org's free to?
[04:31] <mutante_> not really
[04:31] <Stormx2> bayziders: Hmm? registering a .org costs.
[04:31] <mutante_> maybe 1 dollar per month?
[04:31] <Valmarko> should I reinstall firefox ?
[04:32] <un_operateur> Valmarko, have you tried watching a movie online?
[04:32] <bayziders> well then a .tk will work i have no form of plastic money so i cant buy any thing off the inter net
[04:32] <Stormx2> bayziders: .tk isn't all that good either. They shove adds down your neck, make you pay to remove them, and use a frameset.
[04:32] <mutante_> bayziders: yes, .tk was it, i forgot
[04:32] <Valmarko> Yes. tv online
[04:32] <mutante_> but Stormx2 is right
[04:32] <wero> the shortcuts are funtionaly but the sound does change its volume
[04:32] <bayziders> well then whats a good one?
[04:32] <cmweb> Is dapper a Linux with a libc6 kernel
[04:32] <Stormx2> bayziders: people won't be to see the address of anything on your website, the address bar will always show "blah.tk"
[04:32] <cmweb> ?
[04:33] <Stormx2> cmweb: Eek, what?
[04:33] <jrecuero> j #ossim-devel 3puntosmenos
[04:33] <un_operateur> Valmarko, at a terminal -- ls -l /usr/lib/firefox/plugins   -- and paste the output in the pastebin
[04:33] <Stormx2> cmweb: libc is a piece of software...
[04:33] <un_operateur> !paste
[04:33] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:33] <Guest25282> hi all
[04:33] <bayziders> well whats a good one??
[04:33] <finalbeta_> jrecuero, thnx ;)
[04:33] <mutante_> bayziders: get the webspace elsewhere, seperated from the company where you get the domain
[04:33] <Valmarko> ok
[04:33] <Guest25282> can someone suggest me an internal 56 k modem fully compatible with ubuntu ?
[04:33] <Stormx2> bayziders: Personally I'd either 1) Buy a domain 2) use no-ip, which as I said is excellent
[04:33] <cmweb> stormx2, im installing shoutcast, it wants that
[04:33] <finalbeta_> jrecuero, let's not do that in channel windows but server windows...
[04:33] <mutante_> bayziders: and then make sure where you buy the domain ,they let you edit DNS
[04:33] <un_operateur> cmweb, almost any GCC compiled software nowadays uses libc6
[04:33] <Stormx2> cmweb: What exactly is it asking for?
[04:34] <jrecuero> dont worry
[04:34] <bayziders> Stormx2; what do no-ip domains look like?
[04:34] <Stormx2> bayziders: Mine is stormx.no-ip.org
[04:34] <cmweb> If you want to broadcast to listeners, you'll need:
[04:34] <cmweb> * 90Mhz or faster server, running one of Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME,
[04:34] <cmweb> * 90Mhz or faster server, running one of Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME,
[04:34] <cmweb>   Mac Ubuntu 6.06 TLS X, Sparc Solaris 2.7+, FreeBSD 4.x+, or Linux with a libc6 kernel.
[04:34] <Stormx2> cmweb: Don't paste.
[04:34] <mutante_> bayziner.no-ip.com , bayziner.dyndns.org ...like that
[04:34] <cmweb> sorry, i know
[04:34] <Stormx2> cmweb: Yes thats fine.
[04:34] <un_operateur> !paste | cmweb
[04:34] <ubotu> cmweb: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:34] <cmweb> just too long to get the pastebin i
[04:34] <cmweb> up
[04:34] <Valmarko> how do I pass the output to pastebin ?
[04:35] <iustin85> How is it possible to start manually GDM ? (graphical login)
[04:35] <bayziders> mutante_ i cant do that i need a www.domain.w/e one
[04:35] <Stormx2> Valmarko: Copy it, go to pastebin.com, paste it.
[04:35] <Stormx2> iustin85: yeah, I think "gdm" will do it.
[04:35] <wero> the shortcuts are funtionaly but the sound does change its volumen
[04:35] <Valmarko> ok
[04:35] <un_operateur> Valmarko, its a webpage -- open it up and submit your contents -- a url is then given to you which you can share with us
[04:35] <Stormx2> wero: System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
[04:35] <Valmarko> allright.
[04:36] <Stormx2> wero: if you're using a non-default mixer or something, it may not work.
[04:36] <iustin85> Stormx2, i have a server and from time to time i want to start the gnome interface
[04:36] <un_operateur> iustin85, at a terminal -- sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[04:36] <mutante_> bayziders: find a way to pay on the internet?
[04:36] <bayziders> i have no way to
[04:36] <cmweb> stormx2, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38117/
[04:36] <Stormx2> bayziders: You can't get .coms for free, ya know.
[04:36] <iustin85> thank you so much, un_operateur
[04:37] <cmweb> stormx2, im unsure of it
[04:37] <un_operateur> iustin85, yw
[04:37] <Stormx2> cmweb: Thats fine.] 
[04:37] <bayziders> well any thing will work some thing like www.bayzider.tk or .to or .cx or somein will work but some ones saying they shove adds down your thorught
[04:37] <cmweb> storm, im unsure on it, its the install procedure
[04:38] <Stormx2> cmweb: You just need to extract the files from the archive, edit the config, and run the server.
[04:38] <kane77> I get always some error when I return from hibernation about HAL... now my disks are unavailable... how can I fix it?
[04:38] <mutante_> well, basically either you pay, or you are shoved ads down your throat
[04:38] <cmweb> boy dont i feel stupid
[04:38] <mutante_> or its just somedomain.org/~yourname
[04:38] <Stormx2> cmweb: Its okay, don't worry. i'm happy to explain in small steps...
[04:38] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: so does it works with you ?
[04:38] <wero> How can I change the default mixer?
[04:39] <un_operateur> bayziders, if you use the dyndns domains -- you can host your own webpages -- and that way you control your own server, space, speed, etc etc -- no limits
[04:39] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: It worked for me in breezy... but very poorly. No one has had any sucess in running it above 1fps because it uses DirectX
[04:39] <mutante_> and if you can buy a real .org later, you can still make it just point to your dyndns adress
[04:39] <Valmarko> Pastebin is returning errors
[04:39] <bayziders> un_operator i know but the domains look messy
[04:39] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: :/
[04:39] <bayziders> so im just going to use .tk i guess ='(
[04:39] <kane77> how do I remount a drive??
[04:39] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: Sorry :) I just boot into windows to play soldat
[04:40] <wero> How can I change the default sound mixer?
[04:40] <Stormx2> kane77: unmount then mount?
[04:40] <un_operateur> bayziders, there's a reason diamonds cost money you know :)
[04:40] <bayziders> i got one more question should i dual boot windows and ubuntu?? what would i gain from that
[04:40] <bayziders> why do they?
[04:40] <Guest25282> can someone suggest me an internal 56 k modem fully compatible with ubuntu ?
[04:40] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: arghh, i've no place for a windows , and i don't want it
[04:40] <Stormx2> wero: Don't repeat. System > Preferences > Sound. Please post a topic on ubuntuforums.org about your issue
[04:40] <bayziders> the internet should be free like software but the world is full of danm nazis
[04:40] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: Yeah me neither... but Soldat just won't run on ubuntu unfortunately...
[04:40] <kane77> Stormx2, I just woken up PC from hibernation and it suddenly doesnt show my drives, but when I try to mount them it says they are already mounted
[04:41] <finalbeta_> wero, I'm only guessing what you are talking about, so: asoundconf set-default-card CARD
[04:41] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: yep:/
[04:41] <Stormx2> kane77: It may be GNOME not showing them. Checked in /mnt and /media ?
[04:41] <oetker201> Hilfe. Warum kann ich meine ATI Grafikkarte unter Ubuntu 6.10 installieren?
[04:41] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: is there online server for soldat ?
[04:41] <un_operateur> bayziders, well, the money to maintain the web has to come from somewhere -- and i think it's only fair if you pay $5 a year for a domain -- it's humanity and your contributing to a good cause
[04:41] <Hexidigital> how can i re-enable gdm start at boot? i used update-rd.d -f gdm remove to disable it, and can't remember how to reverse
[04:41] <Stormx2> Sp4rKy: The lobby server? Or do you want to act as a server?
[04:42] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: to join a server to play with others :)
[04:42] <bayziders> un_operatur : could i pay with a money order?? cause i was emanicapted and have no accses to any form of credit
[04:42] <Valmarko> un_operateur, Can I send you now a document with the output?
[04:42] <mutante_> bayziders: are you in a country where 1 dollar is hard to pay?
[04:42] <wero> finalbeta, tanks but my sound card y the correct my probleme is the channel, its a 7.1 chanel sound card
[04:42] <un_operateur> Hexidigital , at a terminal -- sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[04:42] <kane77> Stormx2, I guess it's gnome... I always see message that there is some problem with HAL... I haven't figured out how to fix it...

[04:42] <Hexidigital> un_operateur::  i know that... i want to add gdm to start at boot
[04:42] <Stormx2> kane77: It may be worth restarting X or gnome-panel
[04:42] <user__> hello
[04:42] <bayziders> no
[04:43] <user__> bello
[04:43] <Stormx2> kane77: Try this "killall gnome-panel"
[04:43] <un_operateur> bayziders, that depends on the reseller of the domains
[04:43] <bayziders> know of a good one?
[04:43] <carmenf> olaaaa
[04:43] <Sp4rKy> Stormx2: yep of course, but over win$, once the game is started, is there some server ?
[04:43] <Stormx2> bayziders: Please bring this to #web or #ubuntu-offtopic
[04:43] <un_operateur> Hexidigital, errm, i dont use gnome -- but what you need is the services manager
[04:43] <carmenf> alguien?
[04:43] <mutante_> bayziders: wikipedia foundation is giving away free webspace, btw
[04:43] <kane77> Stormx2, yes their back :D
[04:44] <Stormx2> mutante_: He doesn't want webspace, hes running it from his PC
[04:44] <kane77> Stormx2, thanx a lot..

[04:45] <cuddles^> :OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[04:45] <cuddles^> hai
[04:45] <Stormx2> cuddles^: Easy baby ;-)
[04:45] <oetker201> Danke.
[04:45] <finalbeta_> oetker201, damned. and I really suggest using the fglrx from the repositories. Not the one from ATI's site, cuz many fail to get that one running.
[04:45] <bayziders> lol theres a #windows rooom to you know?
[04:45] <cuddles^> what is this place
[04:45] <cuddles^> i accidentally came here
[04:45] <mc44> oetker201: please dont paste in the channel
[04:45] <Stormx2> cuddles^: See /topic
[04:45] <finalbeta_> cuddles^, Ubuntu operating system support.
[04:45] <carmenf> eeeoooo
[04:45] <Valmarko> pastebin is returning errors
[04:45] <cuddles^> ubuntu
[04:45] <Stormx2> Valmarko: What errors?
[04:46] <cuddles^> operating system support
[04:46] <bayziders> seriously why should i dual boot what would i gain from using linux?
[04:46] <cuddles^> so what does it do
[04:46] <mutante_> bayziders: you wont end up being told to "just reboot" with nobody ever knowing the actual cause of a problem, but instead you will always know you have a chance to find out if you wanted to
[04:46] <finalbeta_> cuddles^, it's on operating system like windows, but not like windows ;). It's a linux OS.
[04:46] <Stormx2> cuddles^: Its a linux distro. Its like windows, but better, see? Please see ubuntu.com for more info :)
[04:46] <cuddles^> howcome it's b etter than windows
[04:46] <un_operateur> Hexidigital, if you are looking for a command line utility to enable daemons -- sudo aptitude install sysvconfig
[04:47] <Valmarko> un_operateur, Pastebin is returning errors. May I send to your e-mail?
[04:47] <iustin85> un_operateur, when i type /init.d/gdm stop ... i also stop all X related applications and services ?
[04:47] <tony22> hi, there are 100s of threads on aiglx, compis,beryl and all that - it is like a jungle. what should i do to get a cool desktop? i have nvidia gfx..
[04:47] <Stormx2> cuddles^: This is purely a support channel. There is a lot of material on ubuntu.com about what it is, what it does, etc...
[04:47] <cuddles^> :/
[04:47] <un_operateur> iustin85, yes obviously :)
[04:47] <bayziders> i mean i used it for like 3 months but now im on windows and it just so widel supported and so easy to pirate i dont see the point =(
[04:47] <cuddles^> do i need a special pc for that
[04:47] <un_operateur> Valmarko, http://pastebin.ca
[04:47] <finalbeta_> cuddles^, #ubuntu-offtopic for chatting about it ;)
[04:47] <cuddles^> or how does this stuff works
[04:47] <Valmarko> ok
[04:47] <Stormx2> cuddles^: No. It'll run on pretty much any architecture.
[04:47] <Hexidigital> un_operateur::  you are misunderstanding what i am looking for
[04:47] <cuddles^> orly
[04:47] <cuddles^> but isn't it like
[04:47] <Stormx2> cuddles^: Please /j #ubuntu-offtopic I'll explain there :)
[04:48] <cuddles^> it wont be able to run as many programmes as windows
[04:48] <Stormx2> cuddles^: You're likely to get booted if you stay off-topic
[04:48] <bayziders> ...well every one thanks for your help im going to go over to #web
[04:48] <bayziders> see ya
[04:48] <cuddles^> ok
[04:48] <un_operateur> Hexidigital, you have the GDM installed -- but it isnt starting at boot right??
[04:48] <finalbeta_> cuddles^, windows programs mostly don't run on ubuntu, but ubuntu has about 16.000 programs you can download for free. Many programs do run on both OSses, like firefox, thunderbird etc
[04:49] <Hexidigital> un_operateur::  gdm is installed, and i disabled start at boot by "
[04:49] <Hexidigital> un_operateur::  gdm is installed, and i disabled start at boot by "update.rc-d -f gdm remove"
[04:49] <jrib> Hexidigital: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm should do it
[04:49] <Valmarko> un_operateur, http://pastebin.ca/286311
[04:50] <Hexidigital> jrib::  no, i tried, but it didn't enable it at boot...
[04:50] <computermc> can someone tell me what the difference is between using the "ls" command and the "dir" command?
[04:50] <Hexidigital> ah, found something... brb
[04:50] <iustin85> un_operateur, so if i install let`s say xfce-desktop over an ubuntu-server, when i`ll type /gdm stop .... i`ll remain with just the server ?
[04:51] <un_operateur> iustin85, yep, if thats how you define a server yea :)
[04:51] <uber_mort> computermc: ls is way more linux ;)
[04:51] <iustin85> ty, un_operateur ... i`m funny without will sometimes :D
[04:52] <rcrook> can anyone tell me if it is possible to resize a ext3 partition "on the fly" make it larger not smaller?
[04:52] <un_operateur> Valmarko, I see you have the totem-mozilla package installed too -- it probably is conflicting with mozilla-mplayer
[04:52] <computermc> uber_mort: thanks
[04:52] <Valmarko> umm... what should I do?
[04:52] <cmweb> Can some one try my server at cmweb.zapto.org:8000
[04:52] <mc44> rcrook: you dont want to resize a mounted drive
[04:52] <rapid> cmweb, audio?
[04:52] <cmweb> Yes
[04:52] <|rt|> mc44: that depends on the filesystem...but I don't believe that ext3 supports in place resizing of mounted file systems
[04:52] <rcrook> oops you are right.. but can you resize a ext filesystem
[04:52] <uber_mort> cmweb: I'm not getting anything, just sitting at connecting
[04:53] <un_operateur> Valmarko, uninstall it -- sudo aptitude purge totem-mozilla
[04:53] <cmweb> shoot
[04:53] <Valmarko> tanks
[04:53] <Valmarko> :)
[04:53] <cmweb> hold on let me check this stupid  no ip
[04:53] <mc44> rcrook: yes you can
[04:53] <mc44> |rt|: oh really, what fs's can?
[04:53] <cmweb> OK you should be able too now, um i think refresh
[04:54] <|rt|> mc44: any of the more modern journaled filesystems can...ext3 is the exception in this case...not the rule
[04:54] <un_operateur> reiserfs all the way :)
[04:54] <mc44> |rt|: ah like Reiser or somesuch?
[04:54] <|rt|> mc44: xfs and jfs both support live resizing
[04:54] <cmweb> Is anyone able to connect to cmweb.zapto.org now?
[04:55] <mc44> |rt|: interesting. of course Ive heard too many xfs horror stories to switch to that :)
[04:55] <Stormx2> cmweb: No, I can't.
[04:55] <|rt|> mc44: i only have experience doing it with xfs....but I manage a 20+TB file server here with LVM and xfs...and are constantly growing logical volumes and file systems while they are in use
[04:55] <cmweb> Ok ive run the no-ip updater 40 times
[04:55] <fly_80> can anybody help me with Wireless card config? it doesn't want to work!!
[04:55] <Hexidigital> jrib::  thanks for your help, dpkg-reconfigure gdm did work -- i never rebooted
[04:56] <|rt|> mc44: I've never had any problems with xfs...even when I had a scsi cable fail making parts of a xfs volume suddenly disappear that was in use
[04:56] <mc44> |rt|: thanks. Im sure virtually any advice I give in here is generally wrong :)
[04:56] <cmweb> storm, it working i think
[04:56] <rcrook> anyone got a link to a helpful page on how to resize the partition and ext3 filesystem?
[04:56] <cmweb> stormx2, i got a connection to it
[04:56] <|rt|> mc44: xfs cleaned up itself

[04:56] <|rt|> mc44: now i doubt that's true
[04:57] <eilker> i can connect to one machine via ssh, i wanna carry a file from my machine to the machine that i connected via ssh, how can i do it ?
[04:57] <stefg> !info sshfs
[04:57] <|rt|> mc44: if you look for horror stories on file systems you will find that you should be printing out all your data and retaining hard copies
[04:57] <ubotu> sshfs: filesystem client based on SSH File Transfer Protocol. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.6-1 (edgy), package size 29 kB, installed size 116 kB
[04:57] <stefg> eilker, read above
[04:58] <Valmarko> un_operateur, It's working :) Tank you again
[04:58] <mc44> |rt|: punchcards ftw!
[04:58] <walter> hello. I installed linux for friend of mine and tested this installation with two sets of keyboard mouse and monitor and worked. buttttttttttt
[04:58] <|rt|> mc44: every file system has horror stories and success stories...in both cases you have to take those stories with a grain of salt
[04:58] <cmweb> storm, do you have an internet capable radio on you box?
[04:58] <cmweb> stormx2, one that will connect to radiostations?
[04:58] <mc44> |rt|: true enough
[04:59] <walter> when he took the box home and connected his monitor and key and mouse, was ended up on X SERVER not configured section is that normal or i m missing something
[04:59] <eilker> stefg: sshfs must be installed in both 2 machines ?
[04:59] <tomix> anyone with an ipod experience these problems  Buffer I/O error on device sda2, logical block 58524793
[04:59] <tomix> ?
[04:59] <tomix> thats coming out when i use dmesg
[04:59] <un_operateur> Valmarko, yw :)
[04:59] <stefg> eilker: i don't use it so i don't know, but i'd guess yes
[04:59] <|rt|> mc44: resier for instance has a horrible fragmentation problem that causes the volumes to slow down drastically as they are used...currently the only way around this is to tar up the data to a different volume, reformat the volume and then untar your data back
[04:59] <zyth> How do I specify an application to open a type of file?
=== cypher1_ is now known as cypher1
[05:00] <|rt|> mc44: hopefully resier4 can address those issues on paper it looks to be pretty nice
[05:00] <tomix> read something about ipods reporting the wrong themselves as the wrong size and the kernel needing a patch, but given that there is no mention on the ubuntu tutorial for ipod setup im guessing this isnt neccesarily the case?
[05:00] <mc44> |rt|: yeah, I stick to ext3 just because I really dont need and particular journalling features
[05:00] <stefg> eilker: it it's just for a file now and then a 'man scp' might enlighten you
[05:01] <|rt|> mc44: yeah ext3 is the safe choice....of course the one time i have lost data due to a file system it was ext3 hehe...so there's a horror story
[05:01] <eilker> !scp
[05:01] <ubotu> SCP is a secure way of copying files across networks using !SSH. Usage: scp filename user@host:filename - WinSCP is a client for Windows, available at http://winscp.net/
[05:01] <mc44> |rt|: damn I have t change now
[05:01] <mc44> :)
[05:02] <|rt|> mc44: hehe...i still run all my / as ext3 even after that event

[05:03] <mphill_> dwightintx: there are about 5 million howtos
[05:03] <eilker> stefg: thanx
[05:03] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: sorry for the delayed response. system-monitor doesn't tell you how much memory you have in your system just the percentage used. same with cpu
[05:03] <mphill_> or use the lamp option when installing
[05:03] <Stormx2> cmweb: i don't understand what you're asking? Have you set up the SERVER and the STREAMER now?
[05:03] <walter> i guess no one knows . so i got to installe win on this system .. :(
[05:03] <anorexicpillow> whats wrong with democracy player?
[05:04] <anorexicpillow> i cant seem to install it by the .deb or the synaptic pm
[05:04] <dwightintx> thanks mphill & stefg, I'll start with the link provided
[05:04] <pike_> walter: thats an old trick but ill answer anyway :). Its normal do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:04] <FlyingSquirrel32> walter: did you try to do a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg on with his hardware connected?
[05:05] <stefg> !fixres | walter
[05:05] <ubotu> walter: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[05:05] <walter> i go the system back and booted ok .. im using that system in question to talk to you guys now
[05:05] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, I think you might need to enable more fields for process view  -- edit > preferences -- the system monitor does display quite a bit of information about processes
[05:05] <nofeardjb> good morning everyone :D
[05:06] <dwightintx> does the ubuntu server have any type of gui?  back on redhat years ago there was something called linuxconfig? or something like that
[05:06] <nofeardjb> nope
[05:06] <nofeardjb> you have to install one
[05:06] <cmweb> How do i restart the shoutcast server?
[05:06] <walter> oh , im new to linux, and his worst then me lol... and he lives very far.. so i did give him his pc back at work .. and didn't had a chance of looking up his hardware
[05:06] <bcardarella> I have Ubuntu server 6.10 and I can never get the system to shutdown properly. I am using the command: sudo shutdown now    The system broadcast message will come up telling me the system is going down for maintenance but then it just hangs.... any ideas?
[05:07] <walter> i know he uses very genric monitor key and mouse , same that i used to test this installation at work
[05:07] <un_operateur> dwightintx, servers are usually installed and run headless -- so it doesnt make sense to have a GUI running -- if you really want a lightweight WM -- you can try twm
[05:07] <stefg> bcardarella: the trick is sudo shutdown -h now ... the system waits for eternity too shutdown if don't provide 'now'
[05:07] <qmf> i want gxine but i dont want firefox. when i remove firefox it takes gxine with it, how can i get around this?
[05:08] <dwightintx> what is twm?  it wont get a DHCP address, all I have is the prompt staring at me
[05:08] <bcardarella> stefg: I use the 'now' option, but now the '-h' option. I'll give that a try...
[05:08] <stefg> bcardarella: no -h, no halt...
[05:08] <walter> i will remember that option .. i don't think linux realy is for that guy.. lol.. to bad.. been converting too many people to this OS .. lol
[05:08] <un_operateur> qmf, twm is what redhat and fedora used to use quite sometime back
[05:08] <un_operateur> dwightintx, sorry ^^
[05:09] <un_operateur> qmf, you can always install gxine after firefox is removed :)
[05:09] <bcardarella> stefg: cool, that worked. Thanks!
[05:09] <qmf> un_operateur: gxine installs firefox with it
[05:10] <stefg> dwightintx: if u have 128M of RAM and a 1.5 G spare hd-space consider installing xubuntu. you have xfce then as a gui and can install the lamp metapackage on that as well
[05:10] <dwightintx> twm does not appear to be in the path, is it on the CD?  The network does not work, thats what Im trying to fix
[05:10] <cmweb> What is the username for the shoutcast server stormx2?
[05:10] <un_operateur> qmf -- i think this might work -- dpkg -i --force-depends /var/cache/apt/archives/gzine*
[05:11] <dwightintx> thanks stefg
[05:11] <un_operateur> qmf, sudo that ^^
[05:11] <Stormx2> cmweb: its set in the config file.
[05:11] <Stormx2> cmweb: You have been through the config file, right?
[05:11] <cmweb> stormx2, i didnt see anything but the admin password
[05:11] <cmweb> stormx2, yes
[05:12] <dwightintx> is it possible to use ubuntu workstation and install the packages, apache, mysql, etc ?
[05:12] <Stormx2> cmweb: Beleive me there is a "password" option in the file.
[05:12] <Stormx2> dwightintx: Yes.
[05:12] <Stormx2> !lamp | dwightintx

[05:12] <un_operateur> dwightintx, do you mean installing those packages on the ubuntu desktop?
[05:12] <cmweb> stormx2, i got that part, but the webbased admin wants a user as well, i tryed admin, owner, and administrator
[05:13] <un_operateur> cmweb, did you try your own user credentials ? just a guess
[05:14] <qmf> un_operateur: it worked! but.. i guess gxine needs ff installed to run :P
[05:14] <dwightintx> thanks stormx2, I've read   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  I need more basic, the install these packages using < any method > link  was the problem.
[05:14] <cmweb> un_operateur,  yes
[05:15] <dwightintx> un_op yes, I started with ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[05:15] <un_operateur> qmf, gxine just depends on firefox -- or atleast it claims to be dependant on it -- but it isnt really that tightly bond to it
[05:15] <Stormx2> dwightintx: More basic? Hold on.
[05:15] <fly_80> I installed the ndiswrapper following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[05:15] <fly_80> but it doesn't work
[05:15] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: yeah, but I want to see how much is installed in the system overall, not per process (this is separate from what I what I was looking for before)
[05:15] <Stormx2> dwightintx: Just "sudo apt-get install apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server" should do it
[05:15] <fly_80> i checked the directory /etc/ndiswrapper/wusb54g/
[05:16] <FlyingSquirrel32> like the general tab in system properties on windows
[05:16] <Stormx2> dwightintx: Replace the 5's with 4's if you want php4
[05:16] <fly_80> there are 4 .conf files
[05:16] <habeeb> Any kiba-dock debs? The beryl one died when the forum died.
[05:16] <fly_80> is it normal?
[05:16] <un_operateur> dwightintx, sure, this should get you going -- aptitude search "apache|php|perl|mysql"
[05:16] <cmweb> stormx2, ever have to do this?
[05:17] <FlyingSquirrel32> un_operateur: many times I run the liveCD on a computer either given to me, or the people don't know what they own, and it would be cool to see how much mem is installed and the processor
[05:17] <Stormx2> cmweb: I stream myself, and I have many shoutcast servers hosted on a remote server.
[05:17] <dagon_> When installing applications I get the following error: E: graphviz-cairo: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 127. What can I do get rid of the problem?
[05:17] <Stormx2> cmweb: What is your upstream (upload) rate?
[05:17] <dwightintx> thanx stormx, that helps a lot!
[05:17] <cmweb> storm, figures, ever have to do a webbased admin?
[05:17] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, the system tab on my system monitor tells me how much RAM and CPU i have -- but i'm running feisty -- so that could be it
[05:18] <cmweb> stormx2, i can get maxed at 198K but but not on this connection
[05:18] <un_operateur> FlyingSquirrel32, you could always do this -- cat /proc/meminfo /proc/cpuinfo
[05:18] <Stormx2> cmweb: What connection will you be serving from?
[05:18] <sonda_cassini> hi!
[05:18] <Stormx2> cmweb: If you want, I can give you a shoutcast server.
[05:18] <cmweb> stormx2, my DSL
[05:19] <Stormx2> cmweb: And what upstream do you get on that?
[05:19] <cmweb> stormx2, Whats your charge?
[05:19] <obstfliege> hi
[05:19] <cmweb> stormx2, oh my DSl i get 245
[05:19] <Stormx2> cmweb: Zero. I barely use the server
[05:20] <cmweb> stormx2, do you host it?
[05:20] <Stormx2> cmweb: Serving an MP3 at standard quality, you could push 2 listeners on that.
[05:20] <cmweb> stormx2, you serious
[05:20] <Stormx2> cmweb: My friend runs a very unsucessful hosting business
[05:20] <cmweb> stormx2, its ogg
[05:20] <Stormx2> cmweb: xD he lets me use the server he has rented. 100mbits... etc.
[05:21] <cmweb> stormx2, whats the URl so i can test it
[05:21] <DrLabel> ppl hello to install kubuntu 6.10 i386  on amd64x2 i have to use irqpoll pci=noacpi noapic nolapic acpi=off yes or no ???
[05:22] <dwightintx> un_operateur, what is aptitude ?
[05:22] <stefg> !aptitude
[05:22] <ubotu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[05:22] <Stormx2> cmweb: uhg, hold on
[05:22] <cmweb> stormx2, it does have a URL?
[05:22] <cmweb> ok
[05:22] <gubuntu> can i get full tty shells on one monitor and x on another?
[05:22] <Stormx2> cmweb: Well the main website is anet-hosting.com, but the shoutcast thing is just something I setup / run for people I know.
[05:23] <stefg> gubuntu: cool idea... good question! I#d be interested in that, too
[05:23] <gubuntu> it would be great
[05:24] <gubuntu> to have vt1-5 on monitor 1 and x sessions on the other
[05:24] <dwightintx> un_operateur said --aptitude search "apache|php|perl|mysql"--- does this mean that I would need to install an application call aptitude?
[05:24] <un_operateur> dwightintx, aptitude comes with every debian/ubuntu install -- its part of the base system
[05:25] <un_operateur> dwightintx, i wonder why you didnt just try it out at the command line :)
[05:25] <DrLabel> ppl to install kubuntu 6.10 i386  on amd64x2 i have to use irqpoll pci=noacpi noapic nolapic acpi=off yes or no ???
[05:25] <jrib> dwightintx: do you know to use apt-get or aptitude or synaptic to install packages?
[05:25] <slicky_> finally.. iv got my nvidia card!!! and now.. let operate! :D
[05:25] <Neo|ite> Anychance someone could take a look at my post on the "Absolute Beginner" Section?
[05:26] <pike_> gubuntu: similar to http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO-14.html?
[05:26] <dwightintx> un_operateur, thats what I needed to know, I was looking all over for the icon on the menu
[05:26] <stefg> gubuntu: the difficulty in that setup is to decide, where the keyboard input goes... X or console?
[05:26] <pike_> gubuntu: i might have to try that
[05:29] <iustin85> how can i add X to ubuntu-server plain installation ?
[05:29] <computermc> how do I install a rpm package in ubuntu?
[05:30] <defrysk> sudo apt-get install xorg
[05:30] <LjL> !rpm > computermc
[05:30] <defrysk> !alien | computermc
[05:30] <ubotu> computermc: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[05:30] <gubuntu> stefg: keyboard input should be decided by scroll lock toggle
[05:30] <iustin85> defrysk, that`s all? so simple?
[05:30] <dimitrius> use alien...
[05:30] <defrysk> iustin85, want is to do it harder ?
[05:30] <dimitrius> apt-get install alien

[05:31] <iustin85> eriksays, my firefox chrashes too
[05:31] <defrysk> mine does not
[05:31] <dimitrius> you can try opera
[05:31] <iustin85> eriksays, do you user automatix?
[05:31] <defrysk> ;p
[05:31] <defrysk> !automatix
[05:31] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:31] <eriksays> iustin85: don't think so
[05:31] <Neo|ite> Can anyone take a look at my post http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=322329 and see if they know whats wrong?

[05:38] <clearscreen> if you're running the sshd daemon, the port is open.. it just depends if you're behind a router in which case you'll have to open up the port in your router config
[05:38] <semboy> i want to check how many gb is my harddisk holding
[05:38] <gubuntu> just read the framebuffer site

[06:29] <ubotu> Music_Shuffle: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:29] <Music_Shuffle> ;P
[06:29] <Music_Shuffle> Anyways. What's the bit about having to update nvidia drivers with beryl after each update?
[06:29] <Music_Shuffle> Is that kernel update? Or driver update?
[06:30] <Music_Shuffle> Although I just DLed both a kernel update and a driver update, so I guess its sorta ./moot in a way.
[06:30] <Lunar_Lamp> I want to edit the tag of an m4a audio file. How do I do this?

[06:33] <cymuHep> how to get and installl unrar-free?

[06:34] <Infeliz> manually
[06:34] <cymuHep> but where?
[06:34] <cymuHep> somebody know?
[06:34] <dentenz> cymuHep, sudo apt-get install unrar
[06:35] <spunk__> stefg, well, I've burned it several times on different disks. same thing... seems that 6.10 is shipped with poor drivers or bad settings for X...
[06:35] <Geoffrey2> thoreauputic, I'm trying to add the public key so I can access the repository...not having much luck doing so, though
[06:36] <stefg> spunk__: edgy can be a diva, that's true.. have you tried one of the dapper live-CD's?
[06:36] <corrupt> why would one want to use ubuntu over freebsd?
[06:36] <glombool> hey, I lost PCM for some reason. It was working one minute, then the next... nothing.  It still picks up my Mic.  Just won't play pcm.  I checked volume, all is well.  Besides, it was working fine before anyway.  I use ALSA.  Any ideas?
[06:36] <zzzerotime> hi
[06:36] <cymuHep> HMM
[06:36] <Music_Shuffle> Umm. I'm using AIGLX.
[06:36] <Music_Shuffle> Lol.
[06:36] <cymuHep> he asks for password
[06:36] <thoreauputic> Geoffrey2: why not just download the deb ? It's right there afaics
[06:36] <cymuHep> i type my password but he dont take i
[06:36] <cymuHep> it
[06:37] <spunk__> stefg, I'll try it. but then its a matter of performing a successful upgrade. :-) Or i'll just forget about 6.10 until 7.*...
[06:37] <thoreauputic> Geoffrey2: did you read the "front page" ? Gives the command for adding the key
[06:37] <thoreauputic> Geoffrey2: wget http://au.ubuntu.cafuego.net/969F3F57.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[06:37] <stefg> spunk__: missing out on edgy isn't such a dad deal.... :-/
[06:37] <zzzerotime> I have configured tv and webcam in linux, but now I cant watch tv, I think it has something to do with dev/video simbolic links
[06:37] <zzzerotime> but I have tried everyting and cant make it work
[06:37] <spunk__> stefg, ok. :-P
[06:38] <pike_> corrupt: freebsd is great but no flash etc. linux binary support is great too but not pain free.  linux is much gentler intro to a real OS imo
[06:39] <disasm> hello, I'm planning on testing an upgrade from debian sarge to ubuntu dapper, any suggestions? I know it's going to be a pain, but I need to run a test scenario and detail all the steps need to make the upgrade so I can seemlessly upgrade 50 other workstations as well (target deployment is June)
[06:39] <spunk__> corrupt, I use both freeBSD and Linux. good for different things. FreeBSD as server, Linux as desktop OS.
[06:39] <Music_Shuffle> Upgrade? Or conversion?
[06:39] <corrupt> i see, i see.
[06:39] <disasm> Music_Shuffle: conversion
[06:40] <Music_Shuffle> Umm. WHat about it again? >.>
[06:40] <disasm> Music_Shuffle: would you suggest going from sarge -> hoary -> breezy -> dapper or just going straight to dapper?
[06:40] <Mikaeln> It says that wpasupplicant needs to be reinstalld, but it can't find the package.. anyone has any ideas?
[06:41] <zzzerotime> does anyone know how to manage 2 different video devices ? how can I configure tvtime to access the propper dev/video?
[06:41] <Geoffrey2> thoreauputic, it downloaded, but the add command didn't seem to be working....so I simply downloaded it, went into Synaptic, and imported the key from there....whoever said there were many ways to skin a cat obviously used linux :)
[06:41] <Music_Shuffle> disasm, straight.
[06:41] <Music_Shuffle> That train of upgrades seems like a disaster waiting to happen, increased exponentially odds-wise by multiple machines.
[06:42] <disasm> Music_Shuffle: ok, I'll probly be doing the test run on my machine mid-January or so
[06:42] <thoreauputic> Geoffrey2: heh - yes I just tried the command here too ( to check) and it hangs... Nice work around :)
[06:42] <Music_Shuffle> Should be really easy. :D

[06:42] <apaskit> hi.. iv just got a brand new geforce 6800xt installed the drivers.. and it works.. but when i reboot.. and x are avout to start.. i get a err msg.. that the nvidia kernel module isnt the same version as the linux module kernel... how do i fix this?
[06:43] <tony22> pls.. How do i find the correct description of my graphics card to put in "xorg.conf" .. and what pci-bus.. bla bla?
[06:43] <Lunar_Lamp> tony22, try "lspci" which will list all your pci devices.
[06:43] <Lunar_Lamp> If you don't get enough information from that, try "lspci -v"
[06:44] <apaskit> anyone?
[06:44] <Lunar_Lamp> You'll get information for all your pci devices though, so you will need to wade through a little information.
[06:44] <Geoffrey2> thoreauputic, I presume it's not a problem that the description says it's for the dapper kernel?
[06:44] <Music_Shuffle> apaskit, I installed the same card...
[06:44] <Music_Shuffle> Last night.
[06:44] <Music_Shuffle> Which directions did you follow?
[06:44] <thoreauputic> Geoffrey2: hmm - did you grab the dapper or the edgy version?
[06:45] <apaskit> Music_Shuffle: found a howto on the beryl projects wiki..

[06:46] <Music_Shuffle> The projects wiki...didn't work so hot for me. I ended up with a broken Edgy install.
[06:46] <apaskit> Music_Shuffle: iv already got beryl installed..  and i had a ati card before.. so i just removed the fglrx drivers.. and installed the nvidia drivers..

[07:04] <LazyAce> oh
[07:05] <LazyAce> It update to 2.0 me thinks
[07:05] <DevC> ok question, is there any good music creating software for linux? I used to use Modplug Tracker for windows but want to use one on linux
[07:05] <MarcN> shooters: it may be that the monitor entered power saving mode.  The system comes back when you press a key or move the mouse, right?
[07:05] <Music_Shuffle> Dapper doesn't have FF 2.0.

[07:21] <NevroPus> Hi, I'm completely new to Ubuntu. So I wonder, can you use .rpm files in Ubuntu? and if so, how?
[07:21] <KnowledgEngi> exist a software for linux that rotate an image that contain text while the text line are not horizontal???
[07:21] <philo23> try apt-get install <KDE desktop package name>
[07:22] <philo23> kde-desktop
[07:22] <philo23> i think
[07:22] <KnowledgEngi> the images contain text and music score
[07:22] <dope> i think it's something with my NVIDIA driver
[07:22] <malk> anyone know how to get broadcom working relatively easily?

[07:23] <lumpa> I am having a problem running Edgy on one of my laptops - it intermittently stops responding to keyboard and mouse input. Sometimes the keyboard and mouse movement works fine but mouse clicking doesn't work, other times everything fails.  Most of the time if I do an Alt-Tab to reselect the program I'm working with I regain all input but that sometimes fails and I have to restart X or the computer to get input working again. Could someon
[07:23] <lumpa> e help me with this please?
[07:24] <NevroPus> is there any way to use .rpm packages in ubuntu?
[07:24] <Music_Shuffle> !alien
[07:24] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[07:24] <philo23> NevroPus: try installing alien

[07:28] <humbolto> I am getting "WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!" for packages like ubuntu-keyring!? What is wrong?

[07:29] <tony22> Music_Shuffle, i think my card is working fine since i get it to show up in "nvidia-settings" i tried several howtos but i cant get it to work...

[07:31] <Captain_Redbeard> I need a hand here... I got a 3G phone that has a memory card in it, mounting it works perfectly and so does the transfer of files to it. However I'm not able to "eject" it. when running "eject /dev/sdb" I get: "Error: invalid device /media/PHONE CARD (must be in /dev/)" what's wrong and can I do to fix this?
[07:32] <humbolto> What is wrong? Why are my packages not authenticated?
[07:32] <noelferreira> Music_Shuffle: didn't work or me. change driver fglrx to ati makes graphic card to loose acceleration.
[07:32] <hjmills> Captain_Redbeard: run dmesg in a terminal and look for stuff about your card and find out what sdx it is (i.e. sda, sdb, etc) then run "sudo eject /dev/sdx"
[07:33] <Captain_Redbeard> hjmills: it's sdb...
[07:34] <GhoSt_DoG> how i install irssi ?
[07:34] <hjmills> Captain_Redbeard: then try "sudo eject /dev/sdb"

[07:35] <erichj> if apt-get update has no flags, if i want to update bluefish do i just tell it to install it again?
[07:35] <pike_> GhoSt_DoG: in irssi for basic navigatin use alt-1 through 9

[07:56] <vixus> FirstStrike: Your video player audio settings?

[08:11] <CreativeEmbassy> so
[08:11] <linux_kid> finn: sudo apt-get install [package name] 
[08:11] <vixus> Until I ge an external hard drive or something
[08:11] <foob> it would be pretty bad for apple/microsoft if that stuff ran smoothly on ubuntu
[08:11] <vieirar> Hi could someone point me in the right direction to get DRI working on my ATI xpress 200 video card with the Open Source ATI drivers.
[08:11] <vixus> :D
[08:11] <vixus> foob: That's our job. :0
[08:11] <CreativeEmbassy> only a little director, but I use fireworks, flash, dreamweaver pretty frequently
[08:11] <finn> yes linux_kid but the packet isn't found
[08:11] <linux_kid> vixus: well, if it takes up hdd space, trash it and wait
[08:11] <vixus> linux_kid: Will do. :)
[08:11] <finn> after a fresh install.  do I need to update some sources.list or something?
[08:11] <linux_kid> finn: search synaptic
[08:11] <rocky> anyone have any idea if there is any plan to update edgy eft's python2.4 to python 2.4.4 final ?
[08:12] <vieirar> I believe the experimental radion r300 mesa drivers will work
[08:12] <humbolto> is there a tool available to backup a whole partition?
[08:12] <vixus> CreativeEmbassy: Well, looks like it's goodbye Ubuntu for now
[08:12] <CreativeEmbassy> same with photoshop, image ready, illustrator, premiere, after fx, audition, indesign, etc...
[08:12] <CreativeEmbassy> Yeah
[08:12] <stuporglue_> b0bbi3: Have you tried bringing it down and up via the command line?
[08:12] <craigbass1976> I did an apt-get remove postgresql, then installed postgres 8.1, but when I type psql, I'm in 7.4.  Why didn'tt hat get removed?
[08:12] <CreativeEmbassy> Actually, I'm trying to figure out if I can sell my computer and my girlfriend's old college one, and get a Mac.
[08:12] <CreativeEmbassy> Which is technically running linux now, right? :-D
[08:12] <vixus> CreativeEmbassy: That would be a good choice.
[08:13] <vixus> Sorta
[08:13] <rogue> vixus: one more question...if I join multiple channels, how to I switch between them in irssi?
[08:13] <noelferreira> i just installed new drivers from ati and i got this error: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0".
[08:13] <noelferreira> direct rendering: No
[08:13] <b0bbi3> stuporglue_: Yah, I tried but it didn't help
[08:13] <vixus> rogue: Even I'd like to know that one
[08:13] <finn> linux_kid: that wont help much since it's a graphical package manager and I'm trying to install a window manager...
[08:13] <hemppa> hi, i think that i have found a bug from edgy. what should i do?
[08:13] <linux_kid> CreativeEmbassy: its like running UNIX, not linux
[08:13] <Lunar_Lamp> finn, what are you trying to install?
[08:13] <finn> openbox
[08:13] <stuporglue_> bobbi3: What does 'lspci' say about the card?
[08:13] <linux_kid> finn: good point
[08:14] <linux_kid> finn: whats the package called agian?
[08:14] <finn> I already installed  xserver-xorg and xserver-xorg-core
[08:14] <vixus> CreativeEmbassy: Is Linux a UNIX... derivative?
[08:14] <Lunar_Lamp> Also, finn, whilst I don't like it, there is an ncurses interface for aptitude (just type "aptitude" on the CLI to get it).
[08:14] <finn> openbox  I would think
[08:14] <EdLin> linux_kid: actually, although it has BSD userland, it's like running NeXTStep.
[08:14] <b0bbi3> stuporglue_: Will lspci show the card if it's a PCMCIA card?
[08:14] <tafsen> what's the command for checking what gateway im using?
[08:14] <linux_kid> Linux is NOT a UNIX deragative, it simply copies some of unix's compunents
[08:14] <Lunar_Lamp> finn, I think you have X installed you can just type "startx" to get a basic x-session.
[08:15] <stuporglue_> bobbi3: My firefwire card PCMCIA card shows up in lspci right now
[08:15] <EdLin> vixus: Linux is a "Unix-like" operating system.
[08:15] <vixus> linux_kid: What's the easiest way to take Ubuntu off my HDD? I forgot to put /boot on a seperate partition so grub will die
[08:15] <EdLin> vixus: "derivitive" of course implies that it was made from it, rather it's a clean implementation.
[08:15] <vixus> yeah
[08:15] <vixus> i knew it wasn't made from unix
[08:15] <vixus> I just couldn't think of the right word
[08:15] <linux_kid> vixus: you want to use windows only, right?
[08:15] <rogue> vixus: it's alt + number
[08:16] <vixus> linux_kid: Yeah, for now
[08:16] <b0bbi3> stuporglue_:  I can see the cardbus bridge for the PCMCIA slots but not the card.
[08:16] <rogue> or alt + right or left
[08:16] <vixus> rogue: Nice one
[08:16] <finn> Fatal server error: could not open default font 'fixed'
[08:16] <tafsen> what's the command for checking what gateway im using?
[08:16] <JediSpam> so is it my understanding that the G965 chipset isn't too good for 6.10 on core 2 duo?
[08:16] <vixus> rogue: No, wait, that changes my commandline
[08:16] <finn> brb
[08:16] <kasia> helo
[08:17] <kasia> hello
[08:17] <rogue> vixus: not for me. it might be that I'm using irssi over ssh on a windows computer?
[08:17] <linux_kid> vixus: make your ext# partition(s) free space and same with your swap.  Then resize your NTFS partition
[08:17] <kasia> cze
[08:17] <stuporglue_> bobbi3: Are you sure you have the modules loaded for 1) the PCMCIA itself (ie. do other PCMCIA cards work?) and for 2) The ethernet card?
[08:17] <kasia> jestem nowa
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[08:17] <finn> back
[08:17] <vixus> linux_kid: And then fixmbr with a windows disc?
[08:17] <finn> could not open default font 'fixed'  :(
[08:17] <rogue> vixus: http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq/entries/Irssi_key_overlap.htmlLcfnt
[08:17] <linux_kid> vixus: yes, that should fix the mbr...
[08:18] <vixus> rogue: I won't be using irssi anymore anyway.
[08:18] <vixus> linux_kid: Thanks
[08:18] <linux_kid> welcome :)
[08:18] <b0bbi3> stuporglue_: The card shows up in Device Manager and Network, it also shows up in ifconfig. I also verified that the card works in a Windows laptop.
[08:18] <rogue> I't better than mirc when I have to use my windows box
[08:18] <vixus> Ok, it was a good try but I'll leave Ubuntu off my laptop right now, I have it on my university desktop anyway
[08:18] <vixus> so I'll see it after the holidays XD
[08:19] <b0bbi3> stuporglue_:my only other PCMCIA card is a wireless nic
[08:19] <vixus> I wish there was a distro that emulated an OS X like environment
[08:19] <finn> what could cause this problem?
[08:19] <vixus> no? ok.
[08:20] <rogue> vixus: I wish there was a distro that could emulate windows 100%
[08:20] <vixus> I don't
[08:20] <vixus> I'm bored of windows.
[08:20] <vixus> LD
[08:20] <rogue> so I could play battlefield 2142 and leave windows behind forever
[08:20] <vixus> But for games and stuff, yeah.
[08:20] <rogue> and use dreamweaver, and dragon natrually speaking
[08:20] <vixus> But I just want a distro that pretends to be OS X because it's possible
[08:21] <rogue> vixus: you should make one
[08:21] <vixus> rogue: I wouldn't know where to begin. :)
[08:21] <noelferreira> anyone with the new drievers from ati working fine? i got this error Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0".
[08:21] <noelferreira> direct rendering: No
[08:21] <vixus> rogue: I would if I could though, I think it could be sorta popular
[08:21] <rogue> or get the project started...
[08:21] <hikenboot> hello all---If I want to locate all the config files on a hard drive and copy them to a directory..what would be the quickest way to do that...i assume it would be somthing like locate *.conf | cp but not sure what the syntax would be ...anyone able to help
[08:21] <finn> do I need to install some extra packets for fonts?
[08:21] <rogue> vixus: if I knew how to really program, I'd be all for making that happen
[08:22] <vixus> Creating Linux Distributions for Dummies
[08:22] <vixus> Can someone write that, please? :D
[08:22] <rogue> call it "Open X" or some **** like that
[08:22] <rogue> lol
[08:22] <vixus> Watch the language.
[08:22] <vixus> XD
[08:22] <rogue> I ****ed myself
[08:22] <vixus> I know.
[08:22] <vixus> I may look into it though.
[08:23] <rogue> **** is a coverterm for poop ;)
[08:23] <vixus> :D
[08:23] <stuporglue_> bobbi3: What device does it show up as in infconfig, and what are the settings for that device in /etc/network/interfaces ?
[08:23] <vixus> But it would probably need a custom window manager and such.
[08:23] <finn> anybody have an idea?
[08:23] <derFlo> i need a program to burn a DVD+R DL.
[08:23] <vixus> derFlo: They come with ubuntu, no?

[08:30] <joebaker> faluce:  the command  "free" might give you the results you are looking for.
[08:30] <finn> do I have to change something in the sources.list so that I can install openbox??
[08:30] <Music_Shuffle> paranoia16, Dapper or Edgy?
[08:30] <paranoia16> dapper
[08:30] <finn> I'd really like a WM.. :o
[08:30] <bilss_> Music_Shuffle thanks
[08:30] <Marc1> I'm running 2.6.17-10-386 for the kernel.  Doesn't edgy have a -686 variant?
[08:30] <Music_Shuffle> There's a ubuntuforums thread then paranoia16
[08:30] <Music_Shuffle> Np.
[08:31] <imbrandon> Marc1, -generic is the 686+ variant
[08:31] <Music_Shuffle> Marc1, edgy has a -generic.
[08:31] <Marc1> imbrandon: but why the -386 from uname -a?
[08:31] <paranoia16> does it bog down your system a lot?
[08:31] <imbrandon> Marc1, you need to sudo apt-get install linux-generic , for it to be installed
[08:31] <Music_Shuffle> Beryl?
[08:31] <joebaker> I have a Pentium D 915  (Dual Core, 64 bit machine)  I used the Alternate Desktop install cd.  I'm not getting SMP (multiprocessor) support.  How to I change to a different kernel?  Current kernel is....
[08:31] <Music_Shuffle> Not at all, what sort of GFX setup do yo uhave?
[08:32] <joebaker> Current kernel is 2.6.17-10-generic
[08:32] <paranoia16> i have a geforce 5500fx
[08:32] <Marc1> imbrandon: I do have linux-generic installed.  Does it include both -386 and -686?
[08:32] <imbrandon> joebaker, that is a smp kernel
[08:32] <Music_Shuffle> paranoia16, I get zero slowdown at all with a 6800XT.
[08:32] <Music_Shuffle> YOu should be just fine.
[08:32] <Music_Shuffle> You*
[08:32] <joebaker> imbrandon:   top only shows one cpu.
[08:33] <imbrandon> Marc1, no , but you must choose it on the grub menu when booting
[08:33] <paranoia16> where is the post you mentioned? there are a lot, which is the best?
[08:33] <imbrandon> joebaker, cat /proc/cpuinfo
[08:33] <joebaker> ok
[08:33] <Marc1> imbrandon: Hmm, I see in /boot both a -386 and -generic.
[08:34] <imbrandon> Marc1, exactly, you just dident choose -generic in the grub menu when booting
[08:34] <andrew> I'm compling the linux kernel
[08:34] <joebaker> is there a pastebot for this channel?
[08:34] <andrew> and what is MTD support
[08:34] <andrew> ????
[08:34] <andrew> is it for normal memory
[08:34] <imbrandon> joebaker, paste.ubutnu-nl.org
[08:34] <paranoia16> ok, i found a place to dl some .deb, but, which is the best? there is the plugins, emerald, settings,  mesa, and more. where is all this explained?
[08:34] <andrew> this is my bro and sis's comp and they don't do much of anything

[08:36] <joebaker> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38150/   iimbrandon:  here's the url.
[08:36] <jonathan_> I've been trying Ubuntu for the last few weeks on a laptop (6.10) - very impressed so far
[08:37] <pluma> Does anybody know what's up with this? My system monitor tells me that of my 100 gig /usr partition 50% is used. The sum of all files (hidden included, accessed as root) is only 11.6G -- where does the other 40G come from?
[08:37] <ubitux> pluma you can use baobab if you're running on edgy
[08:37] <joebaker> imbrandon:  that paste sure doesn't look like I have the Pentium D 915 processor in it does it?
[08:38] <pluma> ubitux: I'm on Dapper
[08:38] <imbrandon> joebaker, one sec
[08:38] <Pelo> anyone know where I can get one of those nice transparent analogic desktop clocks like in vista ?
[08:38] <imbrandon> joebaker, yea thats not a pentium d ( i have a pent d also )
[08:38] <pluma> Pelo: tried Desklets?
[08:38] <imbrandon> i have a p-d- 930
[08:39] <Pelo> pluma,  aren'T those for the dashboard ?
[08:39] <ubitux> pluma, you can try with the options of df maybe
[08:39] <ubitux> pluma, have you count hidden files ?
[08:39] <pluma> ubitux: Yes.
[08:40] <joebaker> imbrandon:  Thanks for your help.  Do you run the 64 bit version of Ubuntu.  Would you recommend it as an LTSP server?  Or should I just run a 32 bit smb kernel for simplicity's sake?
[08:41] <ubitux> pluma you can try "sudo apt-get install baobab"...
[08:42] <pluma> ubitux: For some reason it didn't count /usr/local/.tmp, which is worth 40 gigs
[08:42] <imbrandon> joebaker, upto you , but 64bit is fine for me
[08:42] <imbrandon> brb afk a few
[08:44] <pluma> ubitux: Thanks.

[08:45] <sharperguy> where are the .desktop files for the gdm xsession choices?
[08:45] <SiCuTDeUx> i did install php and phpmyadmin throw aptitude

[08:50] <pluma> Oh, btw, here's a not-quite-Ubuntu-related one: After a cold reboot I was greeted with "SYSTEM DRIVE BOOT ERROR" or some such goodness. My primary master (on which Linux is installed) is set up as first drive in the boot sequence, so this was a little bit alarming. I rebooted again and pressed F11 to select the boot drive manually, chose the default (primary master) and then GRUB came up and all was well -- but when it selects the default automa

[08:50] <pluma> tically, it still fails. Is my BIOS wrecked or something?
[08:51] <tafsen> Is it possible to get World of warcraft to work with a Intel Graphic vard?
[08:51] <tafsen> *card
[08:51] <Music_Shuffle> Possible =/= good performance.
[08:51] <pluma> It doesn't bother me much as I don't reboot much, but it's a little odd that I have to select the *defaults* manually for it to work. Automatically, it'll go straight to Boot from CD (although the CD drives come later in the boot sequence than the HDDs) and fail.
[08:51] <jogrev> anyone know where session startup cmds are stored? kinda stuck in a failsafe terminal :/
[08:52] <tafsen> I don't need good performance
[08:52] <tafsen> I just need it to be playable .p
[08:52] <pluma> tafsen: Don't play WoW. It's evil.
[08:53] <redDEADresolve> i just updated my ati driver and everything is working great except the login screen. the resolution is wonky. i can only see about 40 percent of the login screen

[08:54] <tafsen> pluma, I know it's evil :P but it's fun!!

[08:57] <knapp_> I'm trying to make a script that searches my entire system for m4a files and coverts them to mp3 (using ffmpeg). I made a script that converts them, but how can I make it so it does the entire system?
[08:57] <Shaba1> ok by default ubuntu uses gnome
[08:57] <Shaba1> That is at the login screen too.
[08:57] <jrib> knapp_: use find with -exec
[08:57] <pluma> tafsen: I have to agree that that kind of pointless grind CAN be a nice waste of time. The human mind loves having a feeling of accomplishment every now and then, no matter how unproductive it really can be ;)
[08:57] <Rprp> riof

[09:01] <Rprp> Where can i find a SMP kernel? (How to install with apt-get)
[09:01] <pluma> Oh, another problem: When I'm on Gnome, using WINE, GuildWars (in DirectX 8 mode) renders fine, except for the text which is replaced with pixel artifacts (noise from other parts of the screen etc). When I fire up an XGL based GNOME session (for Compiz), the same game renders like shite, half the surfaces are black or missing, the fps can be represented with fractions, BUT the text works fine. Any idea on how I can get the best of both worlds?

[09:03] <D7k> is it very hard to install a graphical environment on ubuntu server?
[09:03] <Vixus> linux_kid: hey again, do you know of a partitioning tool I can use to remove the partitions?
[09:03] <H3g3m0n> D7k: You can probably just apt-get ubuntu-desktop
[09:03] <blue-frog> D7k: no just   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop

[09:04] <Vixus> blue-frog: I'm on Windows and I want to remove my ubuntu partitions.
[09:04] <blue-frog> Vixus: use windows tools then
[09:05] <blue-frog> D7k: xubuntu-desktop
[09:05] <Vixus> blue-frog: Which ones...?

[09:05] <blue-frog> Vixus: windows tools...
[09:06] <ubuntu> anyone can help me with kubuntu installation ?
[09:06] <Vixus> Well, can't I just use the one on the Ubuntu liveCD?
[09:06] <daisuki> list
[09:06] <pluma> What's the best way to resize and move your usr and var partitions if both are on the same physical drive? I'd guess I should boot up with the live CD, resize the usr partition, create a new var partition, move the old var's contents, then delete the old var?
[09:06] <ubuntu> Vixus: YES
[09:06] <blue-frog> vixus also yes
[09:06] <ubuntu> *y
[09:06] <pluma> (in my case usr is hdx1, var is hdx2)
[09:06] <blue-frog> Vixus: but why won't you use windows to rmove the partition is a mystery to me then..
[09:07] <wy> anybody using Ubuntu on an ibm T60?
[09:07] <Vixus> blue-frog: Windows can't see the partition

[09:11] <ubuntu> i can choose to make "/" in hdc1,hdc2,hdc3 and hdd1 (windows,debian,debian swap and stuff disk)
[09:12] <ubuntu> :(
[09:12] <ubuntu> equal swap
[09:12] <tdog> how can i fix , my problem ?
[09:13] <D7k> maybe I should just install ubuntu desktop version instead of the server edition
[09:13] <pozitron> Well, if you are going to dual boot then you don't want to make root (/) on the windows partition.  Make it on the debian partition (if there is no other OS installed on that location)  The /swap should go on the debian swap and the stuff disk could be anything you would like to call it.
=== kalila_ is now known as kalila
[09:15] <ubuntu> on debian partition ? O_o why i can't make an "hdc4" on the same disk ?
[09:15] <tdog> installed linux, now is dual boot .. when i boot linux , i get some number showing and at the end entry saying , can not fix automatilcaly .. i knew there was a file that i could modify so scan disk wont work on window partion but i forgot the name of the file
[09:15] <tony22> how would you go about scanning a book into a searchable ebook w pictures?
[09:15] <joebaker> imbrandon: The Bios of this Dell says it's an Intel Pentium D 2.8 Ghz.  Multiple core capable.
[09:17] <pozitron> If you have space available to make another partition (as hdc4) then that works too.  The only thing to remember is that if you are dual booting, windows wants to be on the first partition on the primary drive.  Otherwise I believe that Linux has no restrictions about the partition it gets installed on.

[09:19] <coolzone> Hi, I am doing some research on opensource software, I need to understand what the difference is between Debian stable packages and Ubuntu stable packages.

[09:19] <D7k> just sometimes my brain slips
[09:20] <D7k> I hit my head one time really hard, ever since, some things are a bit scrambled

[10:11] <joebaker> LinTux, imbrandon, rapid, erUSUL  UPDATE about Pentium D 915:    The Top command will show both CPUs if you type the "1" key to toggle from single CPU to dual cpu mode.  When I did a Cat /proc/cpuinfo  (I RAN IT ON THE WRONG MACHINE!!  -- embarrassed.  )  Ubuntu handles this 915 Pentium D just fine after all.
[10:11] <Music_Shuffle> You ran it..
[10:11] <Music_Shuffle> on the wrong...machine...
[10:11] <Music_Shuffle> How?
[10:12] <joebaker> Music_shuffle:  I'm running the laptop in front of the server....   I'm chatting on the laptop.
[10:12] <rapid> joebaker, glad to hear you found what you need yeah

[10:13] <frafra> hi all, my sound card doesn't work
[10:13] <Finnj> bummer
[10:13] <frafra> i've try to use alsaconf but i haven't found it
[10:13] <frafra> who can help me?
[10:13] <schisms> frafra, what's the problem?  I just came in.
[10:13] <Finnj> Macbook pro - anyone?
[10:14] <frafra> schisms: my sound card doesn't work and i haven't found alsaconf tool
[10:14] <randy> yo mandems

[10:14] <schisms> What kind of sound card is it?
[10:14] <randy> i need help installing flash player
[10:14] <randy> for linuc
[10:14] <randy> linux
[10:15] <frafra> schisms: I don't know, is a "unknown device"
[10:15] <frafra> it could be ati or intel
[10:15] <joebaker> music_shuffle.  Yeah!  Quite funny.  Just glad it wasn't a shutdown command.  Once Jeremy White of Codeweavers/Wine fame shutdown the Wine webserver by mistake because of a similair mistake.  He thought he was rebooting his local laptop.  At least he had the excuse that he was typing between two different console/xterms on the same machine.  I made the mistake on two different keyboards!
[10:15] <Surghi> hi
[10:15] <schisms> if it's intel you're in luck
[10:15] <randy> i need help giys
[10:15] <randy> guys
[10:15] <schisms> did you try sound preferences?
[10:15] <Music_Shuffle> LOL! So awkward >_<!
[10:15] <randy> installing a flash player
[10:15] <frafra> 00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 437b (rev 01)
[10:15] <schisms> randy, try googling flash player 9
[10:15] <Surghi> I think I zip wrong ... the manual says    "zip -r foo foo"  where  the last  "foo" is the zip file and  the first "foo" is the directory to be zipped
[10:15] <randy> i did
[10:15] <Finnj> if you use Firefox, it should get the flash player running pretty much out of the box Randy
[10:15] <randy> but like it wont install
[10:16] <Surghi> root@box:/home/zz# zip -r /home/user/ homeuserzip
[10:16] <Surghi>         zip warning: name not matched: homeuserzip
[10:16] <Surghi> zip error: Nothing to do! (try: zip -r /home/user/ . -i homeuserzip)
[10:16] <Surghi> thats my problem
[10:16] <randy> not really it doesnt work like that for me
[10:16] <schisms> randy, that's a normal problem.
[10:16] <schisms> what happens?
[10:16] <rapid> randy, you just copy the .so file to the /plugin directory of firefox
[10:16] <randy> what happens then
[10:16] <schisms> The window just closes?
[10:16] <randy> wheres the plug in directory
[10:16] <frafra> schisms: fedora 6 works, edgy doesn't work... I've try to run alsaconf but i haven't found it
[10:16] <Adam_eM> is it possible to get a wireless connection directly from a livecd?
[10:16] <rapid> where ever firefox is installed, umm try /usr/firefox/plugins

[10:17] <randy> so i need guidelines
[10:17] <frafra> schisms: where?
[10:17] <Adam_eM> thanks
[10:17] <schisms> system > preferences > sound
[10:17] <Adam_eM> gotta test it out then
[10:17] <randy> ok
[10:17] <randy> then
[10:17] <rapid> randy, might be /usr/bin/firefox/plugins
[10:17] <innu> Hey. I installed opera for testing my webpage. Xchat started to open all links in opera. So i dedicated to remove opera. Now all pages are opened by gnome-terminal. Like, whats wrong with xchat? Prefferred app.. is webbrowser set to firefox.

[10:18] <schisms> See what it says
[10:18] <rapid> randy: do a locate firefox find where its at , then copy the file to the plugin dir.
[10:18] <schisms> Usually it autodetects.
[10:18] <randy> where is locate firefox
[10:18] <randy> i need a more detailed description
[10:18] <rapid> randy: open a terminal, and type locate firefox

[10:22] <Kinhoshi> I have a question. When a computer connects to mine via XDCMP, and the other computer opens a music file I hear it on my computer, and not the one that's connecting to it. Is there a way to make the sound play on the other computer? Sorry if I'm not being clear enough.
[10:22] <Finnj> you need to enable stuff in sources.list so you can access nonfree
[10:22] <jrib> rapid: ~/.mozilla/plugins/  for user plugins

[10:22] <randy> how do i go to that though rapid, please bare with me im learning i just got this program today
[10:22] <randy> i dont know where to type the stuff ur saying though

[10:25] <schisms> Sorry, beryl's still buggy.
[10:25] <virtual-voicu> stop telling me about remote desktop
[10:25] <Finnj> he doesnt answer priv msg, so
[10:25] <virtual-voicu> that for connecting to a windows machine
[10:25] <A-L-P-H-A> anyone know of a app to help with roaming WPA wifi?
[10:25] <cymuHep> i used this
[10:25] <virtual-voicu> i want to connect to a linux one
[10:25] <sushi_> Does anyone know video card temperature? (ATI)
[10:25] <cymuHep>  cp -rf index.html /opt/lampp/htdocs
[10:26] <sushi_> how to check*
[10:26] <rapid> !kismet
[10:26] <ubotu> kismet: Wireless 802.11b monitoring tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 2006.04.R1-1.1 (edgy), package size 964 kB, installed size 2448 kB
[10:26] <H3g3m0n> Kinhoshi: Might be worth looking at using NX instead, it supports sound via esd although i never actually tried it
[10:26] <khaled> hi there, i have kubuntu installed on a partition and /home installed on another partition. can i install another distro on a new partition but at the same time uses /home ?
[10:26] <Kinhoshi> Ok, thanks.
[10:26] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: try starting with man xauth
[10:26] <A-L-P-H-A> rapid, was that for me? the kismet?
[10:26] <innu> Hey. I installed opera for testing my webpage. Xchat started to open all links in opera. So i dedicated to remove opera. Now all pages are opened by gnome-terminal. Like, whats wrong with xchat? Prefferred app.. is webbrowser set to firefox.
[10:26] <rapid> A-L-P-H-A, that should work
[10:26] <MasterLexx> any hints regarding linux, notebooks and acpi? does it work? i have heard of not so good acpi support on linux
[10:26] <sushi_> khaled: yes
[10:27] <cymuHep> i used this command and he didnt copy
[10:27] <cymuHep>  cp -rf index.html /opt/lampp/htdocs
[10:27] <Finnj> Khaled, that smells of trouble though, but possible.. the different distros packages might be configured how to use /home
[10:27] <A-L-P-H-A> rapid, thought kismet was just for detection... not helping me connect to them automatically.  Something like http://gtkwifi.sourceforge.net/
[10:27] <virtual-voicu> btiffin: finally something closer to what i asked
[10:27] <CreativeEmbassy> has anyone had successful experiences running ubuntu on an iMac?
[10:27] <rapid> ah ok
[10:27] <Finnj> differently
[10:27] <rapid> A-L-P-H-A, theres like a WPA-GUI
[10:27] <rapid> !wpa-gui
[10:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wpa-gui - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:27] <rapid> !wpagui
[10:28] <ubotu> wpagui: GUI for wpa_supplicant. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5.4-5 (edgy), package size 96 kB, installed size 224 kB
[10:28] <sushi_> khaled: your .hidden configuration files are configured for the ubuntu distro though so certain files may be out of place for your applications
[10:28] <rapid> A-L-P-H-A, check that out
[10:28] <A-L-P-H-A> racarr-sleep, wicked. thanks.
[10:28] <A-L-P-H-A> rapid.
[10:28] <virtual-voicu> do i need to create some environment variables that tell X where are applications that are running?
[10:28] <A-L-P-H-A> stupid nickcomplete. :)
[10:28] <rapid> cool
[10:28] <Finnj> I would love the person telling me : "I have macbook pro too, and this is how you fix your heating problems: "  (.....)
[10:28] <cymuHep> i used this command on my Terminal with root acc and he didnt copy
[10:28] <cymuHep>  cp -rf index.html /opt/lampp/htdocs
[10:28] <virtual-voicu> because when i select remote connection in kdm there is no error just that nothin appears
[10:28] <cymuHep> help?
[10:28] <rapid> cymuHep, just type cp index.html /opt/lampp/htdocs
[10:29] <CotRo|eR> how can I limit /home/examplefolder to 40GB ?
[10:29] <rapid> cymuHep, -rf are recursive flags say if it was a directory.
[10:29] <Finnj> cymuHep. you need to put sudo in front
[10:29] <dllh> where can one find sources for packages that ubuntu's package manager installs?
[10:29] <dllh> (local sources)
[10:29] <dllh> (to compile other software against)
[10:29] <sushi_> virtual-voicu: the Remote Desktop configuration gui does not appear?
[10:30] <JerryM|> Does anyone know if I can get OpenGL support for my Intel 82845G/GL graphics card?
[10:30] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: umm, I think the path will be set in .basrc (or .profile etc...) upon login to the remote node
[10:30] <innu> Hey. I installed opera for testing my webpage. Xchat started to open all links in opera. So i dedicated to remove opera. Now all pages are opened by gnome-terminal. Like, whats wrong with xchat? Prefferred app.. is webbrowser set to firefox.
[10:30] <sushi_> CotRo|er you are looking for the term disk quota
[10:30] <virtual-voicu> sushi_: i don't want to use a remote desktop (like in windows). i want to use X as a server on my machine and connect it to the other one
[10:30] <cymuHep> sudo?
[10:30] <delta> I've problem with opengl. Someone wanting to help?
[10:30] <sushi_> CotRo|er and im unsure how to install it
[10:30] <cymuHep> it dont copy
[10:30] <khaled> another question, what do u guys think of linux mint 2.1, do u think i should give it a try>
[10:31] <amaia> where can I find the info to add a new place for gnome-weather not included in the default install?
[10:31] <CotRo|eR> sushi_: kk tnx anyway..
[10:31] <PriceChild> !anyone | delta
[10:31] <ubotu> delta: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?

[10:31] <sushi_> virtual-voicu: connect how .... file sharing?  shell?
[10:31] <cymuHep> it didnt work
[10:31] <virtual-voicu> btiffin: ok, but how do i make the script know if i'm connecting remotely or locally?
[10:31] <cymuHep> didnt copy
[10:31] <virtual-voicu> because then it won't work locally, right?
[10:32] <sushi_> Virtual-Voicu: look in the guide for NFS
[10:32] <delta> PriceChild, is there a category where this generally very good advice doesn't apply? :)
[10:32] <virtual-voicu> sushi_, forget it
[10:32] <khaled> guys, was my question inappropiate?
[10:33] <PriceChild> delta, not sure what you mean. If you actually ask the question, someone might know. They may be afraid to help you as your actual question may not be in their area of expertise
[10:33] <Finnj> opengl problems, you should phrase that with keywords "DRI" / "direct rendering" / "GLX" when using google... and your card name.. that usually should get u on the right track
[10:33] <rapid> cymuHep, sudo cp filename directory (its that simple)
[10:33] <sushi_> khaled we use Unbuntu here
[10:33] <Kookykman> Hey, I'm a first time Linux-er that has already burned Ubuntu to disc, etc, and I have the disc in, but whenever I shut down and turn the power back on, it goes back into windows instead of booting from the LiveCD. I'm running XP SP2 on a Dell laptop. Any ideas?
[10:34] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: try looking in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:34] <khaled> sushi_: yea, but mint is based on ubuntu
[10:34] <delta> PriceChild, sorry for my bad english. I meant that, apart giving lot of details, I can't give a better introduction than 'opengl problems'.
[10:34] <rapid> Kookykman, check in your bios to make sure cdrom is first boot device
[10:34] <gouki> just a test - firefox
[10:34] <PriceChild> delta,  well give a few more details :)
[10:34] <Kookykman> Rapid: Thanks.
[10:35] <Finnj> "OpenGL" isnt a good keyword to use in google or forums when looking to get "direct rendering" fixed in X.org
[10:35] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: I remember now.  $DISPLAY
[10:35] <sushi_> Kookykman : When you start your computer it may say to press a certain key to enter boot menu, or setup.   ;
[10:35] <Finnj> when you get "direct rendering" running, OpenGL will work too
[10:35] <sushi_> khaled give it a try and get back to us =] 
[10:35] <schisms> Kookykman, you duel boot correct?
[10:35] <Finnj> getting the right keywords in google is THE way to solve your problems IMO
[10:36] <PriceChild> delta, and your english is fin
[10:36] <PriceChild> e
[10:36] <Kookykman> Schisms: No, I'm running from the CD for the first time
[10:36] <Jocka> I need help with my ethernet connection
[10:36] <schisms> oh
[10:36] <finn_> I got openbox installed, but when I "startx" I get "fatal server error: could not open default font 'fixed'"  do I need to install some font pack?
[10:36] <PriceChild> Jocka, details?
[10:36] <schisms> jocka, what's the problem?
[10:36] <virtual-voicu> be right back, gotta try something
[10:36] <Kookykman> Sushi_: On Dell it's Ctrl+Alt+Enter. I'm going to go try now.
[10:36] <Jerusalem420> can anyone point me to a faq deailing w/ converting .avi files so that they'll play on my mp4 plater?
[10:36] <Jerusalem420> player even
[10:36] <gar-> MY webserver ubuntu run all my php scripts web really low but cgi right and other stuff anyone know what it could be thanks....
[10:36] <PriceChild> Jerusalem420, ipod?
[10:37] <sushi_> Kookykman on my dell it's F2 and F12
[10:37] <delta> PriceChild, it seems that my opengl driver sometimes crashes; it is completly reproducible (by a specific small application); an X error is thrown. The error msg doesn't suggest anything natural.
[10:37] <Jocka> I tried to install a USB adaptor a week ago but it never worked so I ran an ethernet cord to my router instead. It worked up until I restarted my computer and now it won't go online.
[10:37] <finn_> anybody?

[10:37] <schisms> sushi_, that's what it usually is.
[10:37] <Finnj> macbook pro anyone?
[10:37] <dllh> thanks, u
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[10:38] <dllh> u = ubotu
[10:38] <Eldox> how do i get and install new graphic drivers to my nvida geforce 6200 ?
[10:38] <Finnj> get the nvidia (not nv) drivers running in xorg
[10:38] <sushi_> Eldox ubuntuguide.org
[10:39] <sushi_> That is a common question
[10:39] <schisms> You should try the beta driver, eldox
[10:39] <PriceChild> !nvidia | Eldox
[10:39] <ubotu> Eldox: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:39] <Stormx2> Eldox: Do whatever, just DO NOT follow ubuntuguide.org
[10:39] <Jocka> ethernet... ? .. help?
[10:39] <sushi_> Why not?
[10:39] <Jerusalem420> pricechild its an ipod knock off
[10:39] <Stormx2> !ubuntuguide
[10:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntuguide - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:39] <Eldox> tnx guys i'll try :P
[10:39] <Jerusalem420> and the only instructions came in hebrew
[10:39] <Stormx2> Bleh
[10:39] <Jerusalem420> and they got no technical info in them
[10:39] <Stormx2> Basicly its poorly written, outdated, and breaks systems...
[10:40] <sushi_> Oh...works for me =] 
[10:40] <PriceChild> Jerusalem420, ffmpeg will do it... i'm just not sure of the options to use
[10:40] <jbinder> hi
[10:40] <Jocka> a friend said the ip is registering as IPV6
[10:40] <Jocka> if that helps
[10:40] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, so what do put in $DISPLAY?
[10:40] <virtual-voicu> i tried something like "192.168.1.2:0"
[10:41] <LazyAce> What's the general command to format a portable drive in command line?
[10:41] <superkirbyartist> Will more RAM speed up game emulation?
[10:41] <Stormx2`> superkirbyartist: Yeah.
[10:41] <mjr> superkirbyartist, depends if you have enough already :] 
[10:41] <PriceChild> superkirbyartist, if you assign more virtual ram to the vm
[10:41] <schisms> A good processor won't be bad either.
[10:41] <superkirbyartist> 256MB
[10:41] <Jerusalem420> where can i learn about ffmpeg ? just use --help?
[10:41] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: $DISPLAY will be set when you log in by X11
[10:41] <schisms> 2 128s I see.
[10:42] <superkirbyartist> AMD 1.8ghz 256MB RAM N64 Games.
[10:42] <schisms> More ram is what you see.
[10:42] <delta> PriceChild, I need more details :)
[10:42] <superkirbyartist> No, 1 256MB stick.
[10:42] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, then why nothin appears when i login through kdm?
[10:42] <btiffin> vitual-voicu: It'll be :0.0 for a local process
[10:42] <LazyAce> superkirbyartist; more ram would help IMO
[10:42] <virtual-voicu> are they supposed to be the same version?
[10:42] <jbinder> superkirbyartist: your processor isn't that good either
[10:42] <virtual-voicu> that would be dumb
[10:42] <PriceChild> Jerusalem420, not my area p ersonally sorry, hopefully someone else will know
[10:42] <jbinder> superkirbyartist: AMD what...
[10:43] <jbinder> sempron, athlon..?
[10:43] <LazyAce> jbinder, a 1.8GHZ AMD is sufficent for what he's doing lol
[10:43] <Stormx2`> How do I tell LD to look in /usr/local/lib/ ?
[10:43] <Jerusalem420> thanks for your help price
[10:43] <jbinder> LazyAce: meh
[10:43] <Jerusalem420> laters
[10:43] <jbinder> LazyAce: /me hugs 3.4 ghz penitum d
[10:43] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: That I can't say.  I'm going off 15 year old memories...back in X11/R4
[10:43] <gouki> testing - firefox
[10:43] <LazyAce> jbinder, me hugged 2.2 AMD 64bit till mobo died. now I hug p2 455mhz with 512mb of ram lol
[10:43] <LazyAce> and it runs everything just fine in linux
[10:43] <superkirbyartist> LazyAce and Jbinder: They are N64 Games.  It's AMD Sempron 3100+ and one 256MB RAM.
[10:43] <kane77> does restarting the gdm null my uptime?
[10:43] <jbinder> LazyAce: heh
[10:44] <Smotang> Hello, Using open office word processor when it predicts what word you are going to write how do you accept it? IE so that it finishes the word for you?
[10:44] <jbinder> kane77: i don't think so
[10:44] <LazyAce> superkirbyartist, more ram is a necessity man
[10:44] <LazyAce> at least another 256
[10:44] <kane77> Smotang, enter
[10:44] <edd_> i have reinstalled java from source but it still does not work. if i try to start limewire it says it cant load the java runtime environment... :/
[10:44] <jbinder> Smotang: yeah
[10:44] <jbinder> enter
[10:44] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, then what do you use for remote login (if you do)?
[10:44] <Smotang> thanks
[10:44] <Finnj> Stormx2, wait... I know that... anying I dont remember... gimme 2 secs :)
[10:44] <jrib> edd_: why aren't you using the packages?
[10:44] <LazyAce> whats the command to format a drive?
[10:45] <superkirbyartist> LazyAce: Just for N64?  Maybe, the RAM used bar is above 80% (for all my system).  How much is 512MB RAM?
[10:45] <LazyAce> it's been awhile since I've used linux
[10:45] <gouki> firefox
[10:45] <schisms> edd_, try using gnutella
[10:45] <schisms> cfdisk
[10:45] <edd_> jrib: i tried before but it came up with the same error
[10:45] <btiffin> vitual-voicu: I don't...haven't since I left the corporate world, back in the second millennium
[10:45] <jrib> edd_: what error?
[10:45] <LazyAce> superkirbyartist, RAM is very cheap these days pending where you buy it. I'd recomend www.newegg.com
[10:45] <schisms> lazyace, it's either cfdisk or fdisk
[10:45] <BrianSteffens> lazyace i use cfdisk for formatting/playing with partitions.. and mkfs for writing the filesystem
[10:45] <delta> PriceChild, X is your area?
[10:45] <Kesman> do you remember with what command I could get the modeline for my monitor with specific refresh rate?
[10:45] <jrib> edd_: (use pastebin)
[10:45] <edd_> jrib: cant load java runtime environment
[10:45] <PriceChild> delta, i know little about lots
[10:45] <jrib> edd_: pastebin the actual error
[10:46] <superkirbyartist> LazyAce: Is that a quality site with free shipping?  Do I need information other than DDR?
[10:46] <LazyAce> BrianSteffens, it's a portable drive.. will either of those still work?
[10:46] <edd_> its an error box
[10:46] <delta> PriceChild, that's a start. Some may now little about little :)
[10:46] <LazyAce> superkirbyartist, more info the better. I buy all of my hardware from newegg.com. very secure site
[10:46] <jrib> edd_: run it in a terminal
[10:46] <cymuHep> sudo cp filename dir
[10:46] <PriceChild> delta, hehe :)
[10:46] <cymuHep> dont copy
[10:46] <cymuHep> :(
[10:46] <BrianSteffens> lazyace i would think so.. is it a portable hard drive?
[10:46] <PriceChild> delta, personally, i do beryl mostly :P
[10:46] <cymuHep> first time copied but now dont copy
[10:46] <edd_> wine Limewire.exe and then it pops up
[10:47] <jrib> edd_: why are you running it through wine?
[10:47] <jrib> !limewire | edd_
[10:47] <ubotu> edd_: limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[10:47] <btiffin> virual-voicu: But X11 is built for remote display.  'xterm host' should just work.  Then...oh wait.  You're right.  set $DISPLAY to host:0 (for the zeroth screen device)
[10:47] <Kookykma1> YES!
[10:47] <delta> PriceChild, I don't even ask as much. Just a working opengl driver for dapper :)
[10:47] <jrib> edd_: I would recommend frostwire over limewire too
[10:47] <edd_> ok
[10:47] <Kookykma1> It worked out.
[10:47] <Jerry|M> When I try to run "glxgears" I get the error "Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".". I have an intel 82845G/GL using Driver i810.. does anyone know how I can get GL working?
[10:47] <cymuHep> first time copied but now dont copy
[10:47] <edd_> ;) cheers
[10:47] <LazyAce> BrianSteffens, sorry. Yea it's a portable drive. 100gigs
[10:47] <cymuHep> dont copy :(
[10:47] <superkirbyartist> I only have 40fps when I play 4 DKs in congo stage.  Will RAM make the FPS bigger?
[10:47] <PriceChild> delta, as in device drivers?
[10:47] <cymuHep> sudo cp filename dir
[10:47] <BrianSteffens> lazyace then it should work just like any other hard drive
[10:47] <cymuHep> dont copy :(
[10:47] <Finnj> You should get Sun Java imo
[10:47] <Pelo> edd_,  why are you running limewire in ubu,  run  frostwire instead,  made for linux,  same as limewire
[10:47] <edd_> !Frostwire
[10:47] <ubotu> frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[10:48] <b52laptop> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38159/  <-- external HD problem :(
[10:48] <jrib> cymuHep: what are you trying to do?
[10:48] <virtual-voicu> btiffin set="192.168.1.2:0" ?
[10:48] <LazyAce> BrianSteffens, which one again? Fdisk?
[10:48] <wasabi_> i'm compiling a new kernel right now, and in qconf, i'm not sure which options to check and uncheck. is there a guide of which option does what?
[10:48] <superkirbyartist> !limewire
[10:48] <ubotu> limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.
[10:48] <cymuHep> copy file
[10:48] <delta> PriceChild, hmm? I installed different drivers version without any progress.
[10:48] <virtual-voicu> set $DISPLAY=":0.192.168.1.1"
[10:48] <virtual-voicu> ?
[10:48] <jrib> cymuHep: be more specific
[10:48] <Kookykma1> I'm off to fully install Ubuntu. See you all.
[10:48] <BrianSteffens> lazyace fdisk or cfdisk will work.. use mkfs to write the file system afterwards
[10:48] <PriceChild> delta, what graphics card?
[10:48] <cymuHep> sudo cp index.html /opt/lampp/htdocs
[10:48] <cymuHep> dont ccopy
[10:48] <schisms> Anyone here ever use linux from scratch?
[10:48] <btiffin> vitual-voicu: I think so. One sec.
[10:48] <jrib> cymuHep: what does it say?
[10:48] <jbinder> btw, ubotu works in PM
[10:48] <jbinder> :)
[10:48] <schisms> I was wondering what host I should use.
[10:48] <cymuHep> nothing
[10:48] <delta> PriceChild, nVidia GF7600GS256 MB AGP
[10:49] <Kesman> hey what was the command to see the correct modeline for my screen?
[10:49] <gouki> firefox
[10:49] <PriceChild> !nvidia | edgy
[10:49] <ubotu> edgy: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:49] <PriceChild> whoops
[10:49] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, which one, display number after or before host?
[10:49] <PriceChild> !nvidia | delta
[10:49] <ubotu> delta: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:49] <jrib> cymuHep: what does this say:  'ls /opt/lampp/htdocs/index.html'
[10:49] <delta> PriceChild, do you think my opengl driver is bad installed?
[10:49] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: host:dev
[10:49] <cymuHep> ls?
[10:49] <delta> PriceChild, s/bad/badly.
[10:50] <Jerry|M> When I try to run "glxgears" I get the error "Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".". I have an intel 82845G/GL using Driver i810.. does anyone know how I can get GL working?
[10:50] <cymuHep> i need to get from home dir to opt dir
[10:50] <PriceChild> delta, sorry I'm being silly...
[10:50] <Milos_SD> hi all...
[10:50] <PriceChild> delta, right... could you clarify what you mean by the opengl driver? I'm just being silly here
[10:50] <PriceChild> !hi | Milos_SD
[10:50] <ubotu> Milos_SD: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[10:50] <bulio|> I'm having a problem, whenver I try to boot ubuntu to install it, it tries to load and I get:
[10:50] <zigovr> hi all, I'm having a weird problem when connecting through xdmcp : when I log off a remote session, it switch the VT on the server, so it annoys the user of the machine I was logged on
[10:51] <bulio|> Buffer I/O error on hdc, logical block 1-9
[10:51] <schisms> Maybe you should try reinstalling?
[10:51] <bulio|> I have 2 CD-rom drives, and some linux distros get screwey because of them
[10:51] <Finnj> how do I find out what apt source I got a (already installed) package from?
[10:51] <PriceChild> delta, do you mean the proprietory drivers by nvidia?
[10:51] <Milos_SD> can someone tall me with what tool or software I can use to convert my mp3 songs in mp3 with smaller bitrate?
[10:51] <bulio|> is there maybe some way I can fix this?
[10:51] <PriceChild> !soundconvertor | Milos_SD,
[10:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about soundconvertor - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:51] <cymuHep> somebody knows how i can play CS 1.6 on Ubuntu?
[10:51] <PriceChild> !soundconverter | Milos_SD,
[10:52] <ubotu> soundconverter: convert sound files to other formats. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 48 kB, installed size 300 kB
[10:52] <delta> PriceChild, yes.
[10:52] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, how do you set a variable? isn't set DISPLAY="192.168.1.2:0" supposed to work?
[10:52] <Milos_SD> thanks PriceChild
[10:52] <PriceChild> delta, followed that guide i gave you earlier? (!nvidia)
[10:52] <bulio|> anyone?
[10:52] <virtual-voicu> i get "xterm: DISPLAY is not set"
[10:52] <PriceChild> Milos_SD, on a smaller scale, check out audacity
[10:52] <cymuHep> somebody knows how i can play CS 1.6 on Ubuntu?
[10:52] <schisms> cedega
[10:53] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: depends on shell.  bash uses  export var='data'
[10:53] <schisms> But you have to pay for it.
[10:53] <schisms> transgaming.com
[10:53] <virtual-voicu> oh, yeah, thanks
[10:53] <Milos_SD> I tryed audacity... but I didn't find how to save it with smaller bitrate
[10:53] <Boglizk> hda1 recently became root-only, its mounted but i cant access my music on my NTFS, i dont feel like runnig everything thru root
[10:53] <delta> PriceChild, not exactly by I think it's close. Most of the opengl applications work fine apart a few specific ones. And it's odd :)
[10:53] <schisms> boglizk, try chowning
[10:53] <PriceChild> delta like what?
[10:54] <cymuHep> somebody knows how i can play CS 1.6 on Ubuntu?
[10:54] <cymuHep> somebody knows how i can play CS 1.6 on Ubuntu?
[10:54] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: so you want $ export DISPLAY='nn.nn.nn.nn:0'
[10:54] <jrib> !repeat | cymuHep
[10:54] <Finnj> cymyHep: get Cedega
[10:54] <ubotu> cymuHep: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[10:54] <cymuHep> somebody knows how i can play CS 1.6 on Ubuntu?
[10:54] <tdog> any article on how to setup my webcam .. im using amsn .. but no webcam working
[10:54] <schisms> cymuHep
[10:54] <schisms> www.transgaming.com
[10:55] <Boglizk> schisms, chowning?
[10:55] <virtual-voicu> btiffin: i did this: "export DISPLAY=192.168.1.2:0"
[10:55] <jrib> !webcam | tdog
[10:55] <ubotu> tdog: webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[10:55] <btiffin> How many people here don't use  bash  as a shell?
[10:55] <virtual-voicu> xterm works but no window appears
[10:55] <jrib> btiffin: #ubuntu-offtopic for that type of question please
[10:56] <delta> PriceChild, like 1) I know it works fine on others systems (nvidia inside) 2) it worked with my old GF4Ti4200@64 MB 3) it works fine on my actual system on MS Win XP 4) X doesn't crash, only the OGL driver 5) tons of others applications work fine. To name a few oddities ;)
[10:56] <PriceChild> which oddities?
=== lubix is now known as refus3d
[10:56] <delta> PriceChild, 1)--5) :)
[10:57] <iratik> Is sendmail installed by default in ubuntu - is the daemon active by default?
[10:57] <PriceChild> i'm confused... what isn't working?
[10:57] <btiffin> jrib: sorry, it was more for knowing how to explain setting enviroment variables to people.
[10:57] <cge> Is there a way to turn off the notifications that gnome-power-manager gives when the AC to the laptop is turned on and off? They are extremely annoying when the power cord is unreliable.
[10:57] <mc44> iratik: no its not on by default
[10:57] <iratik> thanks
[10:57] <schisms> cge, try power manager
[10:58] <jrib> btiffin: oh, you can usually assume people are using bash since it's default.  Anyone who switches would probably know of any differences.  That's how i think about it
[10:58] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: the export part of the bash setting lets the variable carry through all your subprocesses.
[10:58] <mc44> iratik: nor is it installed by default, at least on desktop installs, server may be different
[10:58] <virtual-voicu> is there a environment variable that reflects wether the user is logged in locally or remotely?
[10:58] <btiffin> jrib: cool. thanks.
[10:58] <delta> PriceChild, ah, sorry. The opengl driver crashes for one of the applications/demos I'm using.
[10:58] <Jerry|M> When I try to run "glxgears" I get the error "Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".". I have an Intel 82845G/GL using Driver i810.. does anyone know how I can get GL working? Intel says that my card supports full OpenGL...
[10:58] <iratik> mc44: does anyone know about on server if sendmail is already installed?
[10:58] <cge> schisms: Ah, removing the icon also removes the notifications, I see. But is there a way to keep the icon and remove the notifications?
[10:58] <PriceChild> delta, what application/demo ?
[10:58] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, that probably happened because xterm gave no error but something still isn't ok
[10:59] <Ppjet6> hi, is there some who know where i can find wine.conf please
[10:59] <Ppjet6> *knows
=== [TO] WaxMan|afk is now known as [TO] WaxMan
[10:59] <virtual-voicu> in bash: is there a environment variable that reflects wether the user is logged in locally or remotely?
[10:59] <Ppjet6> ** know
[10:59] <schisms> I'm looking cge.
[10:59] <delta> PriceChild, the exact name is 'osgimpostor'. It's part of a well-known graphic library called OpenSceneGraph.
[10:59] <PriceChild> Ppjet6, ~/.wine ?
[10:59] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: going man'ing...one sec...there are quite a few issues here to peruse.  firewall, xuathority, and the umpteen other configs
[10:59] <cge> virtual-voicu: Are you interested in just ssh or telnet or something else as well?
[11:00] <PriceChild> delta, is there anything in your logs on crash?
[11:00] <cymuHep> somebody knows how i can play CS 1.6 on Ubuntu?
[11:00] <cymuHep> :(
[11:00] <Ppjet6> PriceChild: I'm looking ;)
[11:00] <RyanTMulligan> Is there a way to do a post similiar to redirect_to ?
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[11:00] <jrib> cymuHep: people already suggested that you use cedega
[11:00] <schisms> cge, I don't actually think there is a solution to this.
[11:00] <schisms> With mine, even if the battery is charged
[11:00] <Ppjet6> PriceChild:  thanks ;)
[11:00] <schisms> It gives a warning that I only have like 4 minutes remaining.
[11:00] <jrib> virtual-voicu: I'm not sure but the 'w' command tells you I think
[11:00] <cymuHep> cedega
[11:00] <cge> schisms: Well, there is, but I'm not annoyed enough to write a patch for it.
[11:00] <cymuHep> its for money...
[11:00] <cymuHep> :(
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[11:01] <cymuHep> that is only way?
[11:01] <cge> virtual-voicu: For SSH, there is $SSH_CLIENT and $SSH_CONNECTION.
[11:01] <schisms> If I was a programmer I'd give it a shot, but I'm not so for now it'll have to do.
[11:01] <khaladan> Anyone know of tools to benchmark disk i/o?
[11:01] <virtual-voicu> cge, ok thanks
[11:01] <schisms> cge, do you have any experience with lfs?
[11:02] <cge> schisms: No, I've always used Debian or a derivative.
[11:02] <delta> PriceChild, aprt the error X throws, nothing interesting. I know the ogl driver works fine ('glrendering: yes') until I run this application. After a few seconds of moving (the mouse controls the camera), it crashes ('glrendering: no').
[11:02] <schisms> Ah, I'm trying to find a good host distro for linux from scratch.
[11:02] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, i have  a feeling that X should be started before login
[11:02] <cge> virtual-voicu: You can also look at the output from who to find the source of the session.
[11:02] <schisms> I tried using ubuntu but there's a lack of initial developer tools.
[11:03] <delta> PriceChild, I wasn't unable to fix this error for 1 month or so.
[11:03] <schisms> And mke2fs just wasn't working.
[11:03] <virtual-voicu> maybe that's why nothing happens
[11:03] <Finnj> schisms: what dev tools are you missing?
[11:03] <PriceChild> delta, I would contact upstream sorry
[11:03] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: yeah.  you will need the servers running.  I'm trying xterm with export DISPLAY='localhost:0' and it doesn't let me in...
[11:03] <schisms> It's not even the dev tools I'm missing, it's the core programs used to create a distro.
[11:03] <killermach> how do I access my Sony Digital Camcorder with Ubuntu, I have the firewire cable plugged in.. just not sure what to do now??
[11:04] <nevron> how can i get a list of channels?
[11:04] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, i am going to try to make .bashrc set DISPLAY to the source hostname so that when kdm starts it's already sending to my server
[11:04] <virtual-voicu> maybe that will work
[11:04] <schisms> If mke2fs doesn't work then it's something else.
[11:04] <schisms> But I've got slack working on my other pc, so that should do for now.
[11:04] <delta> PriceChild, sorry, I don't get the suggestion :-(
[11:05] <virtual-voicu> cge, how do i isolate the ip from the output of who?
[11:05] <PriceChild> delta, as in ask for support from the original source of the software
[11:05] <virtual-voicu> who | grep voicu
[11:05] <virtual-voicu> then what?
[11:05] <delta> PriceChild, yeah, that's a strategy. Not tried yet :)
[11:06] <PriceChild> delta, good luck :)
[11:06] <MuffY|w00t> I've got a HDD problem =(
[11:06] <delta> PriceChild, heh. I'm preparing to upgrade to edgy in the hope something good happens :)
[11:07] <sushi_> Anyone know a program to view video card temperature?
[11:08] <virtual-voicu> whoa, big problem. kdm is run under root, right? then how do i set DISPLAY only for the users that are connectin remotely
[11:08] <ubuntu> Other Support Categories (1337 Viewing)   <- heh
[11:08] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, any ideas ^^ ?
=== ubuntu is now known as Kai_livecd
[11:08] <malikeye> hows it goin ubuntuites ?
[11:09] <MuffY|w00t> I defragmented my HDD, but the MFT kept a few gigs ahead of the ende of my files. I was going to resize the existing partition (150 gig, 60 g used), to 80 g for the windows partition (that was already using 60G, so it would still have 20G free space), and it would leave 70G unallocated, which my Ubuntu instal cd would take care of =)
[11:09] <MuffY|w00t> the problem is, it think i took a bit MFT away  =(
[11:10] <MuffY|w00t> (it starts booting, but after a few secs it will flash blue with a yellow bar and text on it for half a sec or so and then the pc will reboot
[11:10] <cymuHep> can i make my ubuntu user like root?
[11:10] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: me thinks you're in for a learning curve.   Normally you use another box's X server to run apps remote.  Running a window manager will be tricky, but with some effort and security lock downs...
[11:10] <jrib> !root | cymuHep
[11:10] <ubotu> cymuHep: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:11] <MuffY|w00t> (when it starts booting, the windows boorup logo (with the moving bar beneath it) appears)
[11:11] <b52laptop> any experts Hard drive in the neighberhood ?
[11:11] <gouki> Guys, do you like the idea - ubuntustats.homelinux.org - (sorry for the spam)
[11:11] <virtual-voicu> btiffin, so no remote kde... yet
[11:11] <virtual-voicu> well, brb, i'm gonna try remote X for now :D
[11:12] <malikeye> virtual-voicu: not really sure what you are talkin about, just cathin up... up xdcmp should do remote desktops
[11:12] <MuffY|w00t> or can you just give me an IRC channel with HDD expert-like people =p
[11:12] <malikeye> s/cathin/catchin/
[11:12] <btiffin> virtual-voicu: I don't know enough to say...I would guess it can be done.  Lots of config tweaking and permission openings.
[11:12] <gouki> No one interested? :S
[11:13] <cymuHep> it is mirc statistics?
[11:13] <virtual-voicu> malikeye, couldn't find in the repos
[11:13] <gouki> #ubuntu statistics
[11:13] <gouki> #ubuntu statistics | cymuHep
[11:13] <malikeye> xdcmp is part of X
[11:13] <virtual-voicu> what does xdcmp do?
[11:13] <virtual-voicu> !xdcmp
[11:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xdcmp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:13] <cafuego_> xdmcp is a protocol for allowing remove X logins
[11:13] <cafuego_> remote
[11:13] <Shaba1> Guys
[11:13] <Shaba1> Thank you for all of your help
[11:13] <malikeye> sorry
[11:13] <malikeye> !xdmcp
[11:13] <ubotu> xdmcp is the X Display Manger Control Protocol -- look at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/ to find out how to configure it
[11:14] <virtual-voicu> lol
[11:14] <regeya> rofflecopters.
[11:14] <Shaba1> BUT I decided to go with xp if I can get my boss to pay for it.
[11:14] <cafuego_> ie: gdm on your mahcine allows you to login and run an X session on a remote (well,s till on the lan) server
[11:14] <cge> virtual-voicu: Sorry, I was away. You can't isolate it with who, if I recall. You can do so with $SSH_CLIENT, though, if you are using ssh.
[11:14] <Shaba1> It was just too hard to try to get the site that I need to work with either ubuntu or wine
[11:15] <virtual-voicu> cge, yeah, i tried your other suggestion, it works :D
[11:15] <MuffY|w00t> no one here who knows about recovering the Master File Table?
[11:15] <virtual-voicu> cafuego_: ok, thanks a lot
[11:15] <cge> virtual-voicu: I take that back. It is in the parentheses in who.
[11:15] <virtual-voicu> cge, well yeah, but how do you get only the ip out?
[11:15] <malikeye> xargs
[11:16] <malikeye> sorry.... awk
[11:16] <MuffY|w00t> (on windows XP, yes, NTFS partition)
[11:16] <cge> malikeye: It is a bit harder than that, actually.
[11:16] <cafuego_> virtual-voicu: awk is your friend
[11:16] <gouki> Guys, is it possible to add a cron job to run every 10 seconds?
[11:16] <malikeye> cge: yeah I am just catching up... not sure what you guys are talkin about :)
[11:16] <cafuego_> gouki: not with normal cron.
[11:16] <gouki> cafuego_: Any solution?
[11:16] <knowledgEngi> hellp
[11:16] <virtual-voicu> cafuego_, ok got it
[11:16] <knowledgEngi> hello
[11:16] <knowledgEngi> # title         Windows 95/98/NT/2000
[11:16] <knowledgEngi> # root          (hd0,0)
[11:17] <knowledgEngi> ubuntu is in hda2
[11:17] <cafuego_> gouki: See if there is a cron with second granularity
[11:17] <knowledgEngi> what i must to change in this 2 lines^?
[11:17] <malikeye> (hd0,1)
[11:17] <knowledgEngi> nono
[11:17] <wikijeff> How can I use a printer shared on my network from ubuntu?
[11:17] <knowledgEngi> windows is in hda2
[11:17] <knowledgEngi> and ubuntu in hda1
[11:17] <knowledgEngi> (hd0,0) equal hda2 ???
[11:18] <cafuego_> No, hd0,1 is hda2
[11:18] <knowledgEngi> (hd0,1) equal hda2 ???
[11:18] <Reyaht_> wikijeff, System>administration>new printer
[11:18] <malikeye> how bout a real question ?
[11:18] <wikijeff> Reyaht_: ah, thanks
[11:18] <cafuego_> malikeye: 42
[11:18] <knowledgEngi> like an array 0 is the element 1
[11:18] <knowledgEngi> and 1 is the element 2
[11:18] <MuffY|w00t> i have a question ^_^
[11:19] <knowledgEngi> (hd0,numberpartition-1)
[11:19] <malikeye> cafuego_: no, thats the answer :)
[11:19] <cge> malikeye, virtual-voicu: You need to use something to find the current tty or pts, then use that to grep for the correct line in who, then run that through awk to get only the part in parentheses (this could probably be done entirely with grep as well), and then use host to find the ip for the given hostname.
[11:19] <malikeye> knowledgEngi: that isn't necessarily true.....
[11:20] <cafuego_> the current tty you can find via `tty`
[11:20] <MuffY|w00t> te Master File Table on my windows XP disk is half-gone because i reduced he size of the partition (to make available space for Ubuntu)
[11:20] <MuffY|w00t> anyone knows hwo to restore it?
[11:20] <virtual-voicu> thanks cge
[11:20] <cafuego_> malikeye: How are you logging in remotely?
[11:21] <cafuego_> virtual-voicu: Sorry. What app are you using to log in remotely?
[11:21] <malikeye> if you enable it correctly, you can ctrl-alt-f8
[11:22] <virtual-voicu> cafuego_: well, i was using ssh, but i want to log in through X and i'm not sure how to handle that. i wanted to login remotely from kdm
[11:22] <JerryM|> How can I edit a file while in console mode? (as in, X server isn't on..)
[11:22] <gpled> can someone help me get anonymous uploading to work using vsftpd?
[11:23] <virtual-voicu> jerrymj, nano is really simple
[11:23] <cafuego_> virtual-voicu: well, via ssh finding the remote ip is trivial. echo $SSH_CLIENT | cut -d ' ' -f 1
[11:23] <malikeye> this will pull in your tty : who | grep '(:0' | awk {'print $6'}
[11:23] <malikeye> need to cut the ends off though
[11:23] <Reyaht_> hey, is there a particular reason that I can set a hotkey for anything besides terminal?
[11:23] <cafuego_> malikeye: /usr/bin/tty
[11:23] <nevron> can anybody help me install windoze fonts on my kubuntu installation
[11:23] <JerryM|> virtual-voicu: just run nano with the file as parameter?
[11:23] <Reyaht_> nevron, do you have windows on the same computer
[11:23] <nevron> sorry mistyped ubuntu installation
[11:24] <nevron> yes i do
[11:24] <virtual-voicu> jerrymj, yes
[11:24] <Reyaht_> do you know where it's mounted?
[11:24] <Stormx2> Yo. Where is the cups log located?
[11:24] <JerryM|> virtual-voicu: ok, thanks :)
[11:24] <nevron> i copied the fonts taht i need to my ubuntu partiton
[11:24] <virtual-voicu> cafuego_, malikeye thanks
[11:24] <erUSUL> Stormx2: /var/log/cups/
[11:24] <jrib> !fonts | nevron
[11:24] <ubotu> nevron: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". No fonts in MPlayer? see !MPlayer
[11:24] <malikeye> virtual-voicu: still have no idea what you are trying to do though :)
[11:24] <nevron> jrib it doesnt really help
[11:25] <nevron> gksudo doesnt import the fonts
[11:25] <edd_> hey, i installed frostwire, but it wont run...
[11:25] <virtual-voicu> now, how do i set make kdm set the DISPLAY of the user that logs in to point to the host that connects remotely?
[11:25] <jrib> nevron: ? that page explaisn taht you need to copy your fonts to ~/.fonts
[11:26] <nevron> ok but i couldnt do it using gksudo
[11:26] <cge> Hmm... I want to set $TTY to the output of tty | sed 's/\/dev\///;s/\//\\\//g'. Is there some way to do this that doesn't look as frightening as TTY=`tty | sed 's/\\/dev\\///;s/\\//\\\\\\//g'`?
[11:26] <nevron> gksuod nautilus fnts
[11:26] <virtual-voicu> i mean, kdm connects to another computer and then all users that log in remotely need to have their $DISPLAY variable set to the other ip
[11:26] <jrib> nevron: what command are you doing?
[11:26] <jrib> cge: that is A LOT of slashes
[11:26] <nevron> i typed it
[11:26] <wikijeff> Anyone know when Mac OS X shares a printer over the network is it via IPP, SMB, or LPD?
[11:26] <cymuHep> !user id
[11:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about user id - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:26] <jrib> nevron: why are you doing that?  Can you see the fonts now?
[11:26] <nevron> gksudo nautilus fonts?
[11:27] <DevC> how do I find out what sound card I have installed on Ubuntu?
[11:27] <nevron> because i want the system to  work with those fonts
[11:27] <total> speaking of sound cards...
[11:27] <DevC> need to find if ALSA supports it and I can't remember what card I have in it
[11:27] <jw_606> Hello :)
[11:27] <jrib> nevron: join me in #ubuntu-classroom, I'll walk you through it

[11:28] <total> i have a laptop with no firewire port.
[11:28] <MuffY|w00t> anyone cares to help with a problem that's a bit more pressing than fonts? My harddisk gave up (MFT is half gone), i'd like to know how to restore it
[11:28] <total> what can i do to add firewire?
[11:28] <malikeye> cge: what does that sed output look like ?
[11:28] <jw_606> I tryed installing Compiz and now I'm in a recovery console, can I get help please? Ubuntu Dapper
[11:28] <edd_> can nebody help me, i just installed frostwire, but it wont run ??
[11:28] <gpled> keep getting 550 Permission denied. when trying to anonymous upload with vsftpd
[11:28] <gpled> anyone know how to fix this?
[11:28] <cafuego_> malikeye: that's not portable, soem amchioens use /dev/tty/0 and other /dev/tty0
[11:28] <n2diy> I just installed K3B with Synaptic started it up no problem, shut it down, and not it won't re-start, from the menu, or command line?
[11:29] <cge> jrib: sed needs \'s to escape /'s, ` needs \'s to escape \'s, I was escaping the / for grep. So I need \'s to escape the \'s escaping the /'s being used to insert a \ to escape a /.
[11:29] <n2diy> not/now
[11:29] <jrib> cge: lol
[11:29] <malikeye> cafuego_:  I know
[11:29] <cafuego_> malikeye: matbe just use "basename `tty`"
[11:29] <cge> malikeye: Actually, your solution will work.
[11:29] <DevC> Ensoniq ES1371 [AudioPCI-97]  (rev 02)
[11:29] <cge> cafuego_: That drops the pts part though.
[11:29] <cafuego_> cge: yup
[11:29] <jw_606> Can someone help me install Compiz please? It crashed my Xserver when I tryed
[11:29] <malikeye> cge: you are just looking for the target, not the path, correct ?
[11:29] <jrib> cge: at least use something other than a / to delimit the substitute expression
[11:29] <DevC> now to find out if ALSA supports it or not
[11:29] <cge> malikeye: The output looks like pts\/4, but I can actually use pts/4
[11:29] <wasabi_> how long does it take to compile a new kernel? 2-3 hours?
[11:30] <nads> hello????
[11:30] <cge> jrib: I can do that!?
[11:30] <jw_606> Hello nads
[11:30] <cafuego_> cge: Oh, we cna make cut leave more: tty | cut -d / -f3-
[11:30] <jrib> cge: yep, you can doo s#foo#bar# for example
[11:30] <nads> huh?
[11:30] <cge> jrib: That is extremely useful!
[11:30] <nads> lost me

[11:34] <n2diy> Stormx2: I didn't know that, and I've been doing it for six months.
[11:34] <the_rick> I know samba is using the one in /etc so why do I need the other one?
[11:34] <jimbo> I just hit a huge snag.  I have 3000+ files I copied from a windows server to my linux laptop, but I need the files in lowercase, as they're all uppercase.  Is tehre a batch renaming tool available to autorename all these?
[11:34] <malikeye> the_rick: samba is weird... gentoo had 2 smb.confs too... screwed me up for a while

[11:37] <malikeye> nope.... PM is awesome
[11:37] <MuffY|w00t> yes ofc
[11:37] <redback> MuffY|w00t: lol - well you did say
[11:37] <Reyaht_> shouldn't partition manager do the reverse?

[11:38] <Reyaht_> muffy, it should work the other way
[11:38] <Reyaht_> probably safest way to go
[11:38] <MuffY|w00t> problem is, the MFT was a bit "moved further"then the rest of my files, there was a few gigs of free space between my files and the MFT
[11:38] <jrib> edd_: pastebin 'sudo update-alternatives --config java'
[11:38] <n2diy> test

[11:39] <MuffY|w00t> now i repartitioned it, i think a part (oor whole) the MFT is in the uinallocated space
[11:39] <malikeye> what the hell is a MFT :) I've used PM for years and never heard of that :)
[11:39] <MuffY|w00t> my question:
[11:39] <MuffY|w00t> how can i restore it?
[11:39] <MuffY|w00t> Master File Table
[11:39] <cafuego_> MuffY|w00t: I'm not conviced you can.
[11:39] <malikeye> so you have .... Windows -- blank space -- ubuntu ?
[11:39] <MuffY|w00t> no
[11:39] <MuffY|w00t> i ahve now:
[11:39] <cafuego_> malikeye: like a FAT but for NTFS
[11:39] <ruffles> how could i change my keyboard layout on console. i don't even have the question mark :/
[11:39] <mirak> help
[11:40] <malikeye> cafuego_: yeah, but why is s/he screwing with it ? :)
[11:40] <mirak> does anyone knows run levels well ?
[11:40] <jhaitas_> schisms: i'm trying to reclaim my nickname... i disconnected improperly earlier
[11:40] <MuffY|w00t> Windows+data -- bank space -- part of/no Master File Table -- unpartitioned space (WITH SOME mASTER FILE TABLE (I THINK)
[11:40] <schisms> What chat client do you use?
[11:40] <MuffY|w00t> stupid caps
[11:40] <edd_> jrib: dont worry, sorted it now ran sudo update-alternatives --config java and changed the default
[11:40] <jhaitas_> xchat-gnome
[11:40] <MuffY|w00t> NTFS
[11:40] <n2diy> mirak, what's the question?
[11:40] <jrib> !multijava | edd_
[11:40] <ubotu> edd_: To set which java version/implementation is to be used as default, use sudo update-java-alternatives
[11:40] <Rprp> Borland C++ Builder 6. <--- Whats the name of the package?
[11:41] <jrib> edd_: that command will update the other java related stuff too
[11:41] <malikeye> MuffY|w00t: your goal is ?
[11:41] <edd_> ok thanks
[11:41] <schisms> open up xchat > network list
[11:41] <jhaitas_> as a result the underscore has been added after my name
[11:41] <MuffY|w00t> to restore the Masterfile table
[11:41] <schisms> and type your nick in the first box
[11:41] <malikeye> why ?
[11:41] <jhaitas_> and...
[11:41] <schisms> and reconnect
[11:41] <malikeye> not booting ?
[11:41] <MuffY|w00t> to save my win files
[11:41] <MuffY|w00t> there is *some* stuff there i need
[11:41] <MuffY|w00t> i wanted to make a dual boot system
[11:41] <mirak> n2diy: I use vdr vidro disk recorder. it's a service. I need to make it run after lirc started, and also from run level 2 3 4 5
[11:42] <malikeye> why would you need to save the windows stuff? isn't it already there ?
[11:42] <mirak> n2diy: however the nubmers seems to have changed alone
[11:42] <mirak> for the symlinks
[11:42] <MuffY|w00t> no, the Master File Table manages all the files
[11:42] <redback> MuffY|w00t: is the data still there just the MBR so you cant boot to windows
[11:42] <MinceR> hi
[11:42] <MuffY|w00t> no, not the MBR
[11:42] <redback> MuffY|w00t: or the actual table
[11:42] <MuffY|w00t> MBR is something in the boot sector right?
[11:42] <redback> MuffY|w00t: yeah
[11:42] <MinceR> [g] vim misinterprets some accented characters as hotkeys (for example, a-acute becomes alt+a) -- how can i fix this?
[11:42] <cafuego_> MuffY|w00t: yah
[11:42] <MuffY|w00t> the MFT is a windows/NTFS ting
[11:43] <n2diy> mirak, did you look in system/admin/services?
[11:43] <malikeye> sorry, I am still not understanging what you are trying to do... why do you need to restore that ?
[11:43] <MinceR> i'm getting really desperate.
[11:43] <MuffY|w00t> it keeps track of where all the files are
[11:43] <malikeye> you can't see you files at all ?
[11:43] <MuffY|w00t> because it points to the files
[11:43] <MuffY|w00t> i can't boot
[11:43] <malikeye> s/you/your/
[11:43] <malikeye> ok...
[11:43] <cafuego_> MuffY|w00t: I think you may have better luck on a windows channel; to the best of my knowledge there is but one MFT and if it gets destroyed...
[11:43] <malikeye> at all
[11:43] <Pastorn> MinceR: what do you want to do?
[11:43] <jhaitas_> schisms: that didn't work
[11:43] <SmoothOp> is there a .zip package opener
[11:43] <MuffY|w00t> it will start booting (windows logo and all), but it will reboot while booting
[11:43] <jrib> !zip | SmoothOp
[11:43] <ubotu> SmoothOp: Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[11:43] <mirak> n2diy: where is it ?
[11:43] <jhaitas_> jhaitas is still registered on this server even though there is no client connected with the nick jhaitas
[11:43] <LjL> SmoothOp: sure, unzip. command line, but you can use it from FileRoller just fine
[11:44] <redback> MuffY|w00t: message / blue screen
[11:44] <MuffY|w00t> it will flash a blue screen with a yellow bar and some text in the upper left corner for a splot second
[11:44] <mirak> n2diy: what is runlevel 2 ?
[11:44] <Rprp> i did download the source code of WinSCP (http://www.winscp.com/) but, how can i compile it? (Its a windows product but its the source code...)

[11:46] <wasabi_> hey i have a question. so how much of a speed improvement would i see by compiling a new kernel? noticeably different from the current kernel on ubuntu?
[11:46] <MuffY|w00t> i don't want to put ubuntu on the unallocated space if there is a change to save the MFT, which will certainly get destroyed permanently if i change something to the unpartitioned space
[11:46] <n2diy> mirak, I don't understand the question?
[11:46] <redback> itsmabus: on bottom of charger
[11:46] <LjL> cymuHep, i'm not sure i would set up a content management system if i didn't know about file permissions... i mean, that might not end up too secure. i hope you aren't going to put it on an Internet-accessible server?

[11:47] <kohr_> greevous, use the pastbin to paste it
[11:47] <Greevous> bash: /usr/bin/lesspipe: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
[11:47] <malikeye> trev_: you can remove that packages
[11:47] <Eldox> the symethic package program
[11:48] <kohr_> oh
[11:48] <amimusa> -> /list, thanks
[11:48] <trev_> ok
[11:48] <malikeye> trev_: it's just a meta package
[11:48] <trev_> cool, ill do it right now
[11:48] <Bepo> Anyone know how to get keyboard layouts back?
[11:48] <nevron> how do i setup an ftp server on a dynamic ip
[11:48] <LjL> Greevous, /bin/sh should *definitely* exist. are you able to enter a terminal at all?

[11:48] <trev_> malikeye:what exactaly is a meta package?
[11:48] <tony22> Eldox, just run nvidia-xconfig
[11:48] <Greevous> Ljl: yes
[11:48] <malikeye> it would suck if ubuntu-desktop was "the distro"... one file to rule them all :)
[11:48] <LjL> Greevous: then what does "ls -l /bin/sh" show in a terminal?
[11:49] <jhaitas_> anyone know how i can reclaim my nickname???

[11:51] <cymuHep> LjL
[11:51] <Some_Person> surprised apple hasn't sued
[11:51] <redback> Eldox: you mean the brown colour scheme or is the screen messed up
[11:51] <LjL> Greevous: well, the /bin/sh file should come from the 'dash' and/or 'bash' packages i believe, so you could try reinstalling those packages. however, the fact that that file (symlink, actually) is missing could be a symptom of something bigger imho...
[11:51] <Bepo> what do you mean from X?

[12:00] <gpled> does 6.06 still have a 2.4G cap on ftp?
[12:00] <Pixeleet> i dont think ttys even work from the live CD
[12:00] <Pixeleet> they work if i do the non-gui install tho
[12:00] <kane77> math, I wrote thunderbird, but then I realised that mozilla packages have mozilla- in front of them :D
