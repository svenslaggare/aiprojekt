[11:58] <LjL> vgoltser uh you're already well ali's already the second user saying they can't access vts tonight
[11:58] <LjL> vgoltser err there is no etcinittab anymore in edgy
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell vgoltser about upstart
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm -- i just answered
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool the splash screen you see during boot has nothing to do with kdm and gdm
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool to switch to gdm do what i said
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool to change the splashscreen i think it's sudo dpkg-reconfigure usplash or possibly sudo dpkg-reconfigure usplash-theme-ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> hidden-root variant delight cge
[11:58] <LjL> variant i'm unsure whether it's really a kubuntu-only feature actually
[11:58] <LjL> variant though i do use kubuntu so i can't be sure either way
[11:58] <LjL> cge but then also affects gnome
[11:58] <LjL> cge i'm wondering how long the support for this hidden file has been in gnome and kde without it being used by ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> dnite well in case you don't know you can hopefully restart the x server by pressing ctrlaltbackspace then i don't know about your problem
[11:58] <LjL> cge offtopic then if it's been there for that long and never been used since perhaps there's a reason why it's never been usedofftopic
[11:58] <LjL> halpo how do you define built into the os yes the ubuntu cd comes with gnome shipped and it'll install it by default and similarly does the kubuntu cd with kde
[11:58] <LjL> dnite shrugs try uninstalling that adblock thing i don't really know -
[11:58] <LjL> halpo you mean have users select their preferred desktop environment of course
[11:58] <LjL> halpo just have the user click on the options button in the login screen and select kde or gnome before they login it'll stick for next logins
[11:58] <LjL> halpo of course you'll need to have the relevant desktop environments installed
[11:58] <LjL> qtparted lupine
[11:58] <LjL> lupine leofender cfdisk is a bit of a middle ground between the user-unfriendly fdisk and the bells-and-whistles gui programs like qtparted and gparted
[11:58] <LjL> rob reinstall ubuntu or if you don't want to do that use the fixmbr command from the windows restore cd's console mode
[11:58] <LjL> best messi
[11:58] <LjL> leofender why
[11:58] <LjL> leofender no you can't because conioh is not a standard ansi c header and it's basically only supported under ms-dos for all i know
[11:58] <LjL> lupine no there's no such thing as a conioh in standard c -- the closest thing we have in linux is probably curses
[11:58] <LjL> leofender you don't you use different functions
[11:58] <LjL> lupine i said the closest not the same thing
[11:58] <LjL> leofender no they won't
[11:58] <LjL> leofender have a look at here there appears to be a conio - ncurses wrapper lupine too fyi
[11:58] <LjL> leofender though it gives me a but search for linux-conio-tgz on google finds a few
[11:58] <LjL> leofender or search for linux-conio even
[11:58] <LjL> leofender either
[11:58] <LjL> lupine god forbid
[11:58] <LjL> earthian not the right place i think you could possibly ask on the motu channel
[11:58] <LjL> leofender yes you can
[11:58] <LjL> leofender by doing it
[11:58] <LjL> leofender just about every program for gnome is written in c
[11:58] <LjL> and most others as well

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell abo about automatix
[11:58] <LjL> abo which does not surprise me in the least
[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> ukubuntu integrated sure
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca trying as well just for curiosity though i'll turn off the computer during the night and i don't do much background stuff at all so i'm not sure i'll see a difference
[11:58] <LjL> fatlip don't use xgl - seriously go to ubuntu-xgl for xgl help
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca yeah because it'll have less stuff cached so libraries etc will be loaded from disk every time you need to find a balance you like
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca after all if people have been debating over this there was probably a reason oh well no wait this doesn't really mean anything
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool indeed there is no such package do you want to remove kde
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool the package name is kubuntu-desktop
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool for x it's xserver-xorg but i'm not sure removing it will really remove much of x at all unless you installed from the server cd
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca no but if it's edgy and he installed it in edgy he'll be able to apt-get autoremove to remove them i think
[11:58] <LjL> cge exactly
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool then what on earth do you want to remove
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool you realize that removing x will make all your graphical applications unusable don't you well they'll be uninstalled actually
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool kde is made of applications
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool that's quite a different thing
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool the package is xubuntu-desktop
[11:58] <LjL> moolcool but again removing kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop will remove all the kubuntu-specific and xubuntu-specific applications respectively

[11:58] <LjL> de howieson
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell landon about mpe
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell landon about mp
[11:58] <LjL> vidd mp has nothing to do with wincodecs
[11:58] <LjL> mp
[11:58] <LjL> landon specifically
[11:58] <LjL> vidd can't we just try to follow the official howto before finding patches to problems that might not exist -
[11:58] <LjL> musicmannz why su
[11:58] <LjL> landon so try that the howto hasn't been updated for edgy yet but installing gstreamer-plugins-ugly should still work i think
[11:58] <LjL> vidd actually i don't even know how it's done in gnome since i use kde it's just that trying the official documentation before anything else is normally a good idea
[11:58] <LjL> landon of course if you have rythmbox open you need to close it completely and restart it for mp support to start working
[11:58] <LjL> landon see cge too
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca yes ive done that in the past though i don't have that kind of setup now
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca basically you just need to give the two partitions the same priority
[11:58] <LjL> landon it should be under applications -- though that's a stripped-down version in system administration synaptic i think you'll have the full thing
[11:58] <LjL> landon but you can also just use sudo apt-get install packagename from a terminal
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca the procedure roughly is create a swap partition on the other drive using gparted or cfdisk or whatever use mkfs -t swap devpartition to make the filesystem gparted may do that for you i think add the entry in etcfstab and give it the same priority as the other partition reboot or sudo swapon -a
[11:58] <LjL> landon that wasn't what i was suggesting at all converting mp to vorbis loses quality though vorbis itself is fine it's just the conversion from mp
[11:58] <LjL> landon scroll down some more on that page where it says install the package gstreamer-plugins-ugly
[11:58] <LjL> landon then just use your rythmbox to listen to your mp
[11:58] <LjL> sbnblracer first you need to mount it
[11:58] <LjL> mount sbnblracer
[11:58] <LjL> sbnblracer well then the problem is
[11:58] <LjL> caps vidd
[11:58] <LjL> paste vidd
[11:58] <LjL> sbnblracer cd mediahdc should work
[11:58] <LjL> sbnblracer cd in general is the command that lets you move around directories and since mounted drives in linux are simply treated as directories
[11:58] <LjL> maxflax oss has been deprecated from the linux kernel since a few years
[11:58] <LjL> geekchic- gb should do but tight
[11:58] <LjL> geekchic- gb will be enough for the base install but you won't have much space left
[11:58] <LjL> sbnblracer this page and the paragraph that'll be shown by default specifically should have some information for giving users access
[11:58] <LjL> sbnblracer don't know if that's doable through the gnome gui mounter as well
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell swaby about ndiswrapper
[11:58] <LjL> rummik hehe nope
[11:58] <LjL> rmorris i think in gnome you can just click on a bittorrent link and a graphical client will start up
[11:58] <LjL> rmorris as for changing the default kernel look at the bootgrubmenulst file
[11:58] <LjL> samuel on the same page where you download it
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir go into the source directory type sudo make uninstall and hope the programmer was kind
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir you could also use checkinstall for installing next time
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell keyseir about checkinstall
[11:58] <LjL> landon others will be able to help you better since i don't have any video codecs installed the same page i gave you for mp has info about other formats too -- read it
[11:58] <LjL> jdsbluedevl sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

[11:58] <LjL> mcphail ah wrong channel but anyway
[11:58] <LjL> mcphail it does ask about autohinting but i find it a bit cryptic it gives a choice of native autohinter and none the default being native - the explanation says native is suggested if you use mainly bitstream vera or microsoft fonts autohinter for most other truetype fonts i'm giving autohinter a try guess i'll have to restart x though i'll have to find out what these actually mean

[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu yes you can
[11:58] <LjL> jrib is that factoid new
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen linux certainly should not be installed on a fat partition
[11:58] <LjL> jrib well never hit it good to know
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen or ext which is the default choice in ubuntu anyway
[11:58] <LjL> perforator that you have the microphone passthru-switch enabled in your mixer
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen they're two filesystems that are often used with linux
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell chad about paste
[11:58] <LjL> larsg sorry
[11:58] <LjL> larsg i haven't understood what you said
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen i suggest ext since it's robust and the ubuntu default
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen ext is a journalled extension of ext an older filesystem raiserfs is a journalled filesystem made from scratch
[11:58] <LjL> larsg apparently still debian only
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen are we running in circles i suggested ext reiserfs is another choice that other people prefer
[11:58] <LjL> azureal what did you do
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen well must there be only one choice
[11:58] <LjL> rasmussen i'd use ext your mileage may vary if you're unsure use the defaults
[11:58] <LjL> azureal dapper-edgy or what
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell azureal about upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> azureal you should have followed that instead
[11:58] <LjL> azureal that is
[11:58] <LjL> language
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla deb files are really just ar archives you can extract them with the ar command they contain to targz archives which you can extract with tar xf
[11:58] <LjL> azureal i see do you have any third party repositories enabled
[11:58] <LjL> chad devsda
[11:58] <LjL> azureal which repository is it anyway and anyway what point in the dist-upgrade process are you at
[11:58] <LjL> acidt the module you're trying to install appears to be for kernel but i believe if you have edgy your kernel is
[11:58] <LjL> azureal yes it should be safe enough care to pastebin your etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell morgue about paste
[11:58] <LjL> azureal i'm just trying to understand what is going on
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla why'd you want to do that anyway
[11:58] <LjL> alecjw or just sudo apt-get --reinstall install packagename or sudo aptitude reinstall packagename
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla if your bashrc is messed up just restore it from etcskelbashrc
[11:58] <LjL> alecjw i don't think though you could probably pipe the output of dpkg --get-selections to apt-get or aptitude
[11:58] <LjL> azureal well pastebin the error as well anyway maybe not relevant to the problem at hand but you have the universe and multiverse components enabled but don't have them enabled in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repositories that could create problems
[11:58] <LjL> azureal i dunno - paste the actual glibc errors you get
[11:58] <LjL> azureal what program causes this error
[11:58] <LjL> azureal that looks more like a problem with xterm than a problem with libc to me what's the entire error like
[11:58] <LjL> azureal well just type sudo aptitude install mplayer that should make it shut up anyway i'm thinking that - since you haven't enabled edgy-updates and edgy-security for universe and multiverse - you might have some program from one of those components that hasn't been updated to some newer patch of glibc and is making aptitude stick to an older glibc version while xterm doesn't notice and crashes kind of a convoluted hypothesis but i'd
[11:58] <LjL> add universe and multiverse to edgy-security and edgy-updates run a sudo apt-get update and a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade or just upgrade or whatever or with aptitude
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca good
[11:58] <LjL> azureal ah well then aptitude probably isn't realizing you wanted it but still i'd try the apt-getaptitude install mplayer -- just make sure it's going to install your version ie it says i'm not going to touch it because it's already there rather than get the one from the repos
[11:58] <LjL> azureal which one does it want to upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell rockyaway about away
[11:58] <LjL> azureal ok but is it mplayer that it tried to upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> rockyaway then stay in those channels
[11:58] <LjL> azureal removed
[11:58] <LjL> azureal you can try aptitude unmarkauto mplayer as well
[11:58] <LjL> azureal by the way the apt-get that's in edgy has an autoremove feature as well and i've now switched to it from aptitude - not that aptitude's bad just saying
[11:58] <LjL> azureal it isn't saying n packages not upgraded with n is it
[11:58] <LjL> azureal i see well i don't really know about the xterm thing googling didn't help either all i can suggest which will almost certainly not work is aptitude reinstall xterm and failing that possibly aptitude reinstall libc which might be dangerous however for what i know
[11:58] <LjL> azureal you mean glibc i suppose not libglib which is the base for gtk because i believe the libc package is the actual glibc package type apt-cache show libc grep provides
[11:58] <LjL> azureal and yeah i'd do it in a console if i had to

[11:58] <LjL> kevu adding to etcrclocal should do
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell legendre about install
[11:58] <LjL> asc you mean sudo apt-get upgrade i suppose anyway please pastebin the full output -- of dist-upgrade or upgrade doesn't really make a difference and pastebin your etcaptsourceslist file as well
[11:58] <LjL> pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> asc i understand - well just try installing ubuntu-desktop first it should do no harm anyway at worst it'll reinstall packages that were installed by default but which you removed later
[11:58] <LjL> paste icoo
[11:58] <LjL> kevu yes though i would not add a script that's in your home directory as a startup script move that script somewhere else usrlocalbin would be the logical choice and set the permissions so that only root can write to it
[11:58] <LjL> kevu chown rootroot usrlocalbinscriptname chmod o-rwx usrlocalbinscriptname
[11:58] <LjL> kevu that anybody who gets access to your own account could gain root as easily as eating a piece of cake
[11:58] <LjL> nickspam abst
[11:58] <LjL> kevu you'll need to run it with sudo but yeah
[11:58] <LjL> kevu and ubuntu has root as in having a superuser it's just that you can't directly access the root account and you use sudo instead
[11:58] <LjL> kevu i'm not getting you
[11:58] <LjL> kevu you should move the script and run the chown and chmod commands now in etcrclocal you simply run the script
[11:58] <LjL> kevu right
[11:58] <LjL> kevu yes since it'll get executed by root at boot time before you even log in
[11:58] <LjL> info testdisk newbuntie
[11:58] <LjL> newbuntie there are also other programs type apt-cache search undel but i'm afraid they only work on ext
[11:58] <LjL> kevu make sure the script isn't buggy since it's going to have root privileges

[11:58] <LjL> baastrup dunno try something random
[11:58] <LjL> tgpo what's wrong with it
[11:58] <LjL> tgpo it's been done so that drives are referred to by an unique identifier rather than by their device name devwhatever which changes depending on which slot you connect the drive to

[11:58] <LjL> kronoman you should set both swap partitions to the same priority in etcfstab so that they will be load balanced

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell haroldjohnson about wifi
[11:58] <LjL> tgpo ouch that will not might break things
[11:58] <LjL> tgpo one thing is installing a single debian package using dpkg - which as ianmacgregor said is still dangerous -- an entirely different thing is putting the whole debian repository into sourceslist at the first apt-get command all sorts of weird stuff will get installed
[11:58] <LjL> nikin alright anyway if you do that make very sure that apt-get will only install the stuff you want from the debian reps and if you see anything like libc mentioned don't go for it and when you're finished installing remove the debian repository from your sourceslist and issue a sudo apt-get update
[11:58] <LjL> language dby
[11:58] <LjL> dby what
[11:58] <LjL> dby see what you said above
[11:58] <LjL> nikin more than that -- they're signed using pgp keys
[11:58] <LjL> which was the first thing i said minutes ago anyway
[11:58] <LjL> reverseblade xgl support in ubuntu-xgl - anyway i'd try perhaps looking at the etcacpiresumesh script or whateverit'scalled and add a command to restart the wm
[11:58] <LjL> reverseblade dunno how do you restart it by hand

[11:58] <LjL> stephenl what about planner
[11:58] <LjL> aoupi you add the directory to your path export pathdirectorypath - but your programs should be in standard directories anyway if you add your own either usrlocal or opt
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell jmitchj about gpgerr
[11:58] <LjL> josh guess so thanks still the point about standard paths remains
[11:58] <LjL> josh no i meant putting applications in opt or usrlocal rather than changing the path either for the local user or using etcenvironment
[11:58] <LjL> sami bootgrubmenulst - remove the splash kernel parameter
[11:58] <LjL> sami yes possibly quiet as well to get more text output though i'm not sure
[11:58] <LjL> sami where do you see nosplash
[11:58] <LjL> sami if you're afraid of messing up your system then don't touch menulst simply when you boot go into the grub menu type e when you've selected your kernel line edit it to remove splash and type b to boot that way the change will only affect that particular boot and if it goes wrong you can just reboot

[11:58] <LjL> angelo what updates
[11:58] <LjL> angelo indeed there are some updates from edgy-security i could tell you how to install them manually -- i don't know why update-manager wouldn't get them though
[11:58] <LjL> angelo i don't have gnome
[11:58] <LjL> angelo indeed but not having gnome i can't check this out
[11:58] <LjL> indybc man ln

[11:58] <LjL> pastebin mcayland
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland well being just one line you could have pasted it here mine was just preventative action
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland have you installed a third-party version of firefox
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland actually i believe you have enabled universe but not in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repositories so the versions now mismatch
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland pastebin your etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland yes it was probably what i was thinking hold on i'll give you a fixed version
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland here -- remember that when you enable universe andor multiverse you should always also enable them in the -updates and -security repositories
[11:58] <LjL> mcayland now type sudo apt-get update after changing your sourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> atarinox links
[11:58] <LjL> soundray links is graphical though p
[11:58] <LjL> soundray no seriously it's a good browser for x if you want to actually use a graphical and very fast browser try links -g -- without the -g option it's mostly just like elinks
[11:58] <LjL> soundray and additionally it should also work graphically using svgalib or the framebuffer or directfb although here by default it doesn't really
[11:58] <LjL> rausb links is not exactly full featured either yeah i guess dillo is another decent choice
[11:58] <LjL> atarinox well epiphany still uses the firefox rendering engine
[11:58] <LjL> atarinox i'd try in order of preference dillo links -g epiphany i think
[11:58] <LjL> atarinox then the kind of things we've suggested are probably not a good solution for your problem but then i feel you misstated your problem a little
[11:58] <LjL> browsers soundray i've changed the factoid to make it a bit more comprehensive

[11:58] <LjL> soundray xopher definitely agreed when we're talking about shell fiddling

[11:58] <LjL> quintin i still don't know what fdl means if it's an insult though perhaps keep it to yourself next time
[11:58] <LjL> quintin package wtf does not exist
[11:58] <LjL> josh - i'd give you more to the point information if i remembered it
[11:58] <LjL> quintin well yes but i'd guess it's also default isn't it
[11:58] <LjL> quintin -w mount the file system readwrite this is the default a synonym is -o rw
[11:58] <LjL> quintin could be in that case it'd be a documentation bug though

[11:58] <LjL> attilio does your internet connection work normally besides on apt-get
[11:58] <LjL> attilio are you behind a home router what's the contents of your etcresolvconf
[11:58] <LjL> attilio post your etcresolvconf and your etcaptsourceslist to the pastebin please
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell attilio about pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> attilio try changing your resolvconf so that it reads nameserver and then try again the sudo apt-get update by the way perhaps you'll want to change your mirrors from dearchiveubuntucom to itarchiveubuntucom since you appear to be on an italian isp
[11:58] <LjL> attilio just try the resolvconf thing for now switching mirrors can wait
[11:58] <LjL> 'specially when it's firefox and you're installing your own compile into usrbin
[11:58] <LjL> attilio i'm unsure why it tries to connect to localhost and on port should be i think - are you behind a web proxy does echo httpproxy say anything
[11:58] <LjL> dimensions sudo apt-get remove mysql
[11:58] <LjL> attilio ah that's it you have a proxy set -- i wonder why type export httpproxy
[11:58] <LjL> attilio then try again the sudo apt-get update it should work but this is only a temporary patch you need to find out where and why you have a proxy set
[11:58] <LjL> tapas you have a point though he does have it set to localhost in the uppercase version
[11:58] <LjL> attilio no
[11:58] <LjL> attilio try typing echo httpproxy as well
[11:58] <LjL> aaagh sudo bash and sudo su
[11:58] <LjL> please use sudo -i for that
[11:58] <LjL> gottreu good guess
[11:58] <LjL> attilio same errors
[11:58] <LjL> nitalaut just su - shouldn't even work
[11:58] <LjL> root brenlae tapas
[11:58] <LjL> nitalaut that's because you have a root password set you shouldn't have on a normal ubuntu install
[11:58] <LjL> tapas i'm sure but i was seeing blanket advice to use su and set a root password which shouldn't be given without disclaimers and explanations to alternative possibilities ie using sudo like ubuntu intends people to
[11:58] <LjL> tapas no sudo -i is useful for that sudo su doesn't make much sense since you're invoking two essentially similar commands chained with no need for that
[11:58] <LjL> mirak apt-get build-dep package
[11:58] <LjL> tapas no but brenlae did - if you notice the bot factoid was addressed to both of you
[11:58] <LjL> mirak because you were suggesting sudo su and similar
[11:58] <LjL> mirak dpatch libavc-dev libdts-dev libdvb-dev libdvdnav-dev libiec- libiec-dev libimlib-dev libjack-dev liblame-dev liblame liblircclient-dev libmysqlclient-dev libraw-dev libungif-dev libxv-dev libxvmc-dev libxxfvm-dev texihtml xproto-video-dev xproto-xfvidmode-dev
[11:58] <LjL> mirak do you have the source repositories enabled for universe and multiverse as well
[11:58] <LjL> tapas see i'm not arguing for or against sudo i'm just saying that it's the supported default in ubuntu so people should be adviced to use that and the proper sudo -i command to become root for a longer time instead being told to set a root password the sudo factoid is useful since it links to a page that explains it all and
[11:58] <LjL> tapas and also explains how to enable root while making it clear that you should know what you're doing if you do that
[11:58] <LjL> mirak have you run a sudo apt-get update
[11:58] <LjL> attilio sorry i missed your last paste try also export httpproxy
[11:58] <LjL> attilio sorry i missed your last paste try also export httpproxy -- i meant
[11:58] <LjL> mirak shrugh don't know why it says that you have the binary repositories for universe and multiverse enabled as well i suppose i think you could just try running apt-get install list-of-packages-i-gave-you
[11:58] <LjL> attilio yeah now you need to find out where your proxy is set if you're using gnome i can't be of much help since i use kde but there should be something under system preferences or system administration -- see if it's set
[11:58] <LjL> attilio i'd also try a grep --binary-filewithout-match httpproxyhttpproxy
[11:58] <LjL> mirak really like
[11:58] <LjL> attilio i'd also try a grep --binary-filewithout-match httpproxyhttpproxy -- i meant
[11:58] <LjL> mirak hm but isn't that because of a conflict rather than because of the autoremove feature
[11:58] <LjL> attilio not in the second version either the first one was wrong sorry
[11:58] <LjL> mirak here it doesn't try to remove anything there's something strange going on can you pastebin your sourceslist please
[11:58] <LjL> attilio look i don't know where those variables might have been set and i wouldn't know where to look at in gnome assuming it's gnome that set them try going to a real console ie ctrlaltf ctrlaltf to get back and type echo httpproxy and see if it's there too
[11:58] <LjL> attilio oh i see well same thing browse around in your xfce control panel and see if you have any proxy setting and do try the console thing anyway

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell alakazamzr about fixres
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt you have to install it it's not in by default sudo apt-get install wine after enabling universe at least i think it's in universe
[11:58] <LjL> caps cpl-tnt
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt it's easy to use for the applications that work well with it for those that don't it can be harder
[11:58] <LjL> webmin yancho
[11:58] <LjL> tritonx risky
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell cpl-tnt about universe
[11:58] <LjL> yancho look at etcnetworkinterfaces

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dahunger about xgl
[11:58] <LjL> fishing
[11:58] <LjL> dahunger ubuntu-xgl as the bot told you
[11:58] <LjL> yancho that's probably because you have dhcp set look for a dhcp keyword in it
[11:58] <LjL> yancho then if you're using dhcp you probably don't want to set an ip address manually
[11:58] <LjL> info wine earthian
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt yes universe the bot gave you links on how to enabled it
[11:58] <LjL> snoops nothing to do with categories actually main is free stuff mantained by the core devs universe is free stuff maintained by the community restricted is non-free by the core devs multiverse is non-free by the community
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt yes you need to enable universe read the links from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> universe cpl-tnt
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt that's probably because you haven't read them yet
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt yes read those links and you'll know what it is and how to enable it
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt then just type sudo apt-get install wine

[11:58] <LjL> earthian not really

[11:58] <LjL> crimsun tell that to apt not to me -p
[11:58] <LjL> spunout it's a tricky business
[11:58] <LjL> ulwur you need to enable multiverse in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repos as well as in the edgy repo crimsum see also
[11:58] <LjL> spunout yes hunt for the postinst script in vardpkg or wherever it is and hack it so that it returns but that's a horrible idea
[11:58] <LjL> attilio export httpproxy export httpproxy

[11:58] <LjL> jas-nix of course i do
[11:58] <LjL> jas-nix my command worked and for that matter you can just type mode gyrosgeier to address the person directly
[11:58] <LjL> bot jas-nix
[11:58] <LjL> gyrosgeier if the modem is a winmodem it won't be easy to set up
[11:58] <LjL> gyrosgeier if it's a hardware modem it should be
[11:58] <LjL> gyrosgeier i'm really ust guessing because i can't find a relevant document perhaps you could check etcnetworkinterfaces and set the noauto option for ppp since i guess the problem is caused by the connection being set to automatically start as soon as a program requests a non-local url
[11:58] <LjL> bobbyyu etc
[11:58] <LjL> language teclo
[11:58] <LjL> gyrosgeier i haven't used a modem for a long time but i did pon connectionname and poff connectionname i guess the gnome ppp tool would do that too
[11:58] <LjL> gyrosgeier well see if pon and poff work -- if they do you could probably make icons to run them
[11:58] <LjL> teclo quintin what's the issue

[11:58] <LjL> don't start a filesystem war ext is just the default ubuntu filesystem so if you're unsure use it

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell shiv about grub
[11:58] <LjL> humbraro looking at the wine application database i'm not sure i'd classify wordperfect office as a supported application
[11:58] <LjL> rednelb vmware has network support
[11:58] <LjL> jony you didn't even tell us what the problem is how do you expect us to fix it
[11:58] <LjL> donfilipo the wiki guide is definitely broken for edgy but i can't edit it unless i know what's the correct way to do it on edgy and i don't i've mentioned the issue in the documentation channel that's about all i can do
[11:58] <LjL> language josator
[11:58] <LjL> humbraro i don't know you should try to find out what the wordperfect installer is actually checking for -- isn't there anything in the console start the installer from a console that could give a hint
[11:58] <LjL> humbraro try typing export winedebugwarnall - then the wine output should become a lot more verbose

[11:58] <LjL> you're excused
[11:58] <LjL> iopcg i'm not sure you understood you did what

[11:58] <LjL> ua perhaps if i knew what that did
[11:58] <LjL> ua sudo apt-get autoremove
[11:58] <LjL> ua works in edgy doesn't work in dapper
[11:58] <LjL> ronin what does that thing do exactly
[11:58] <LjL> cyzie try pstopnm piped to pnmtopng
[11:58] <LjL> ronin that's built into my kde i suppose gnome would have something similar
[11:58] <LjL> ua if you're using dapper you could use aptitude to obtain a similar result - but you need to use it when installing as well
[11:58] <LjL> cyzie netpbm
[11:58] <LjL> find matplot name
[11:58] <LjL> ronin are you sure you can't print to pdf directly
[11:58] <LjL> firefox let me see
[11:58] <LjL> cyzie pdftopnm filenamepdf pnmtopng filenamepng
[11:58] <LjL> cyzie not tried
[11:58] <LjL> cyzie sorry made confusion just spdfps everywhere in that example
[11:58] <LjL> soundray uh actually i was going to suggest the problem would probably be with pstopnm like not having gs installed or pstopnm not behaving like a normal netpbm command since a ps can have many pages or something
[11:58] <LjL> soundray cyzie yeah pstopnm doesn't output to stdout by default it can be made to since a ps can have many pages that are output to different pnm files
[11:58] <LjL> sethk yes but the problem is that the other command doesn't write to stdout
[11:58] <LjL> sethk true but that's probably what he was really asking about -- if by host he meant a hostname
[11:58] <LjL> daviey that's not a route technically he's quite right
[11:58] <LjL> daviey and routes have nothing to do with dns
[11:58] <LjL> daviey probably because he posed the question in the wrong terms but now stop insisting that you're right because you aren't
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos how did you add the user
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos that's weird it should definitely create a home unless you instruct it not to tried again
[11:58] <LjL> specialbuddy you can install kubuntu-desktop that won't remove gnome though
[11:58] <LjL> specialbuddy not really you can remove libgnome and it'll remove most of the stuff

[11:58] <LjL> kikokos patience i have only fingers
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos uh why did you make the group of home jer
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos wait what is the exact command you used
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos without any parameters
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos ok i'm not understanding why home has group jer did you set this manually
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos well i'm not sure how the problem might have arisen but i'd do sudo chown rootroot home sudo deluser jer sudo adduser jer

[11:58] <LjL> kikokos what does it say
[11:58] <LjL> mandelum automatic updates should be fine
[11:58] <LjL> arrick i don't know perhaps try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from a console if you can get to it otherwise use recovery mode and tinker select vesa driver if nothing else works
[11:58] <LjL> lobosque no
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos another user type as your own user groups are you a member of group jer
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos i said as your own user type groups and see if you are a member of jer
[11:58] <LjL> iopcg i'm sorry but i can't understand your english
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos not as root as your own user
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos i'm afraid it's not just your gnome config that is bad anyway type groups your-username
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos and please paste only the output line don't spam the channel
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos ok type cat etcgroup grep jer and tell me who's a member of this jer group
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos does delgroup jer work
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos cat etcpasswd grep groupname and also cat etcgroup grep groupname -- shows anything
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos you have created a user whose name is groupname i'm not sure what you've been doing but it wasn't too good
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos try deluser groupname
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos now try again deluser jer
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos type delgroup jer
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos type chown rootroot home chown -r jojo homejo assuming your username is jo if i got it correctly
[11:58] <LjL> spanner lsof will give you the node i think
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos now type adduser jer
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos ok now the user should be there and perhaps your own jo user will work again just perhaps the second chown command i've given you might have done the trick try rebooting into multiuser mode
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos the full name of the user the system doesn't care
[11:58] <LjL> spanner - though i'm not sure you'll like the sound of it
[11:58] <LjL> spanner perhaps you want to try debugfs and then issue the command cat inode which will cat the stuff to stdout -- at least if it's a text file
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos with your own jo user
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos yes
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos go on if i can answer
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos quite normal your new jer user isn't a member of the audio group -- or of any groups your old jo user was a member of for that matter
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos type groups jo and give me the output
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos ok type sudo -i and then type these commands adduser jer adm adduser jer dialout adduser jer cdrom adduser jer floppy adduser jer audio adduser jer dip adduser jer video adduser jer plugdev adduser jer lpadmin adduser jer scanner adduser jer admin
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos ah no wait you can't use sudo from jer well log in to jo from a console then do that
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell rappermas about xgl
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell rappermas about fixres
[11:58] <LjL> kikokos type ctrlaltf - when you're finished type ctrlaltf to come back here

[11:58] <LjL> kikokos no i don't think
[11:58] <LjL> soundray will the vga option work with usplash

[11:58] <LjL> though i guess i'll update that edgy has more
[11:58] <LjL> automatix papalion
[11:58] <LjL> calvarez on edgy counting all official repositories
[11:58] <LjL> karl do you have any third-party repositories enabled do you have the ubuntu-desktop package installed
[11:58] <LjL> karl i'd make sure you have ubuntu-desktop installed apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop otherwise install it
[11:58] <LjL> sethk jprieur soundray perhaps etcusplashconf as well or will that just decide the size of the picture and not the actual resolution used
[11:58] <LjL> jordan you'd want to try - make sure it's not already reported
[11:58] <LjL> jordan possibly already reported as
[11:58] <LjL> jordan hold on a second have you clicked on other installation options in the page
[11:58] <LjL> jordan i mean - choose a continent choose a nation choose a mirror and other installation options
[11:58] <LjL> jordan though that's possibly not the best way to advertize the torrent
[11:58] <LjL> jordan shrug the bug is reported anyway
[11:58] <LjL> jprieur could you give a try to setting something like x or x in etcusplashconf
[11:58] <LjL> jprieur with or without
[11:58] <LjL> easyubuntu ixian
[11:58] <LjL> dextorion successful
[11:58] <LjL> corpsefeeder no it's not
[11:58] <LjL> sethk well some of them do take up space
[11:58] <LjL> jprieur offset i must have missed some part i was left at monitor-says-mode-is-not-supported
[11:58] <LjL> jprieur uhm then try with x in usplashconf but without the vga option perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> jprieur then i don't know

[11:58] <LjL> msg the bot
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca what
[11:58] <LjL> ryanakca it was for yancho actually
[11:58] <LjL> yancho the fact that the bot lists it which it doesn't actually doesn't mean you have it installed
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell yancho about apt-file
[11:58] <LjL> yancho i think your best bet is libncurses-dev
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell yancho about packages
[11:58] <LjL> yancho those are other possibilities packagesubuntucom is handy

[11:58] <LjL> cpk apt-cache search keywords grep dpkg --get-selections awk ' print '

[11:58] <LjL> br helvio
[11:58] <LjL> beagleisevil no
[11:58] <LjL> cpk hm i haven't understood what worked
[11:58] <LjL> beagleisevil rmdir -rf isn't a valid command
[11:58] <LjL> no no read the man page
[11:58] <LjL> cpk i didn't know that thanks
[11:58] <LjL> moreon and be careful when you use that command
[11:58] <LjL> rmd apt-get autoremove if you're on edgy
[11:58] <LjL> sethk actually most pop clients i've used do have that feature
[11:58] <LjL> toma- gig is kind of small
[11:58] <LjL> language kronoman
[11:58] <LjL> sethk well you can't is probably excessive though
[11:58] <LjL> pudland if you don't have any user who's an admin yes
[11:58] <LjL> jogn sethk
[11:58] <LjL> john sethk
[11:58] <LjL> sethk and recovers passwords
[11:58] <LjL> kuonsama what does the kind of hash have to do with it
[11:58] <LjL> sethk alright then it outputs a set of strings among which there is your password
[11:58] <LjL> sethk care to give me your etcshadow p
[11:58] <LjL> sethk i wouldn't seriously we're just arguing semantics - something like john gives you a set of strings among which there is your original password it can't tell you which of the strings is the password and it may certainly have to run for a long time and no it doesn't reverse the hash function directly for sure whether that can be called recovering passwords i'll leave to you or to a dictionary to decide
[11:58] <LjL> sethk hm sure
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell eseong about root
[11:58] <LjL> kuonsama sethk ok i'll take your word on that though you'll grant me that while that'll be valid for passwords it won't be valid in general for an md or sha or whatever hash of an arbitrary-length text
[11:58] <LjL> apt defbyte
[11:58] <LjL> why don't you two join ubuntu-classroom - that's a good channel for that sort of things
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell rblongus about fixres
[11:58] <LjL> rblongus low refresh rate
[11:58] <LjL> rblongus then it's not the refresh rate
[11:58] <LjL> eseong
[11:58] <LjL> rblongus you could try i haven't a clue about flickering on an lcd
[11:58] <LjL> root eseong
[11:58] <LjL> eseong have you read that page already
[11:58] <LjL> eseong not necessarily you can use gksudo nautilus to start your file browser in root mode
[11:58] <LjL> eseong no just gksudo nautilus
[11:58] <LjL> rogerthebum no
[11:58] <LjL> eseong to run a program using sudo that normally is run as the user such as gedit press altf and enter gksudo gedit - from that page
[11:58] <LjL> rabbit sudo etcinitddm restart from a console or ctrlaltbksp
[11:58] <LjL> eseong could you just try doing what that page says -- ie altf then gksudo nautilus then enter
[11:58] <LjL> can't execute
[11:58] <LjL> rabbit it'll just close your x session abruptely whether you want that or not is your choice
[11:58] <LjL> eseong no the rootsudo page is next time read it fully
[11:58] <LjL> eseong and don't make it a habit of running nautilus as root
[11:58] <LjL> kronoman file a wishlist
[11:58] <LjL> muffinresearch the splash screen you mean
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell kronoman about bugs
[11:58] <LjL> muffinresearch edit bootgrubmenulst and remove the splash parameter from your kernel parameters
[11:58] <LjL> language rappermas
[11:58] <LjL> muffinresearch wait you on dapper or edgy
[11:58] <LjL> eseong yes you should only be root when you really need it and make sure that you do really need it
[11:58] <LjL> muffinresearch look there are at least three possible setups slash screen without text splash screen with concise text no splash screen full test - which one is it that you want
[11:58] <LjL> eseong that's because the root account is locked but when you use sudo or gksudo you effectively become root
[11:58] <LjL> sudo -i even
[11:58] <LjL> muffinresearch no but the two options concerned are quiet and splash - they're both kernel parameters
[11:58] <LjL> kuonsama it effectively does the same thing basically but by using sudo su you're chaining two commands that can do the same thing it'd be a bit like typing cat blahtxt cat grep blah works but it's awkward
[11:58] <LjL> muffinresearch dunno use kde
[11:58] <LjL> kuonsama true but the argument stands
[11:58] <LjL> offtopic
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell cloretz about customlivec
[11:58] <LjL> rename bluefox
[11:58] <LjL> uh wasn't there a package called that
[11:58] <LjL> bruenig -p i was convinced that package existed
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell david about root
[11:58] <LjL> bluefox try just man rename i think you've got it installed
[11:58] <LjL> scamboy why
[11:58] <LjL> scamboy you can do that too just don't abuse it
[11:58] <LjL> kuonsama you can use search keyword in a query with the bot to find a factoid
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell maxflax about boot
[11:58] <LjL> webmin kuonsama tony
[11:58] <LjL> kuonsama don't ask me i just know it's deprecated and out of the repos
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo honestly i don't think you can get it
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo perhaps with acls but not with the standard unix permission system i'm afraid
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo you can make files in a directory inherit the group of the directory by setting suid group on the directory
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo still if the default umask doesn't have grwx that won't gain you much
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo - search for inherit
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo well as i said if you set suid group to the directory the group should become that of the directory give it a group that the needed users belong to and you'll be fine no
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo well with acls you should be able to do that anyway but i'm not familiar with that at all
[11:58] <LjL> pazemlsqdfmo umask blah in your shell
[11:58] <LjL> language rbelongus
[11:58] <LjL> does so the winedb says
[11:58] <LjL> hi
[11:58] <LjL> cntb dunno i never had it installed in the first place
[11:58] <LjL> anyone
[11:58] <LjL> language fran
[11:58] <LjL> info nepenthes this is the only hit i get for malware in the repos no entries for spyware at all
[11:58] <LjL> salome it does if i'm here
[11:58] <LjL> why would it be different than the correctly spelled word anyway
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft that's probably dselect google for that
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft yes i think it's still dselect
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft i'm not saying you should run dselect i'm simply saying that i think the select and install software step is using dselect
[11:58] <LjL> not much info on the wiki about the alternate cd unfortunately
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft tried safe graphics mode
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft have you verified the burn
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado can you confirm that your computer has a boot from cd function older computers may not have it
[11:58] <LjL> classroom
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado you can craft a boot floppy
[11:58] <LjL> bootfloppy bruteado
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell bruteado about install
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado i would try this one specifically
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft i think it might
[11:58] <LjL> zerokarmaleft that's what it usually does anyway you should be able to get to a console with altfx and try looking at varlog
[11:58] <LjL> yancho varwww will contain the website data normally
[11:58] <LjL> bchunk g-netgilnim
[11:58] <LjL> hellomoto what are you thinking of specifically clearly linux won't run windows programs well it can sometimes just like windows won't run linux programs but your question is kind of generic
[11:58] <LjL> yancho make a symlink in varwww
[11:58] <LjL> yancho and set permissions appropriately
[11:58] <LjL> testdisk lattyware
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware short answer yeah you can recreate the partition in theory cross your fingers
[11:58] <LjL> hellomoto perhaps to start with you could have used ubuntu if you've never touched linux before rather than xubuntu or kubuntu which can do doubt be nice but also a tad more complicated
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware reboot
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware partitions are not always read on the fly
[11:58] <LjL> hellomoto what are the specs
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware let me know
[11:58] <LjL> hellomoto well yes the ram is a bit limiting
[11:58] <LjL> hellomoto you should upgrade to at least mb imho
[11:58] <LjL> skel yes you can
[11:58] <LjL> skel they'll be installed to temporary storage and they clearly won't survive reboots
[11:58] <LjL> atomiku that's way too little ram unfortunately
[11:58] <LjL> atomiku yes mb is what my informal experiments found to be the minimum amount of memory to get ubuntu working decently
[11:58] <LjL> paste lord
[11:58] <LjL> g-netgilnim
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware have you set the partition type to the appropriate type ext whatever in fdisk
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware can you be sure that really only the partition table was damaged and not part of the actual partition as well
[11:58] <LjL> ayaa i think kde has a kiosk mode
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware it what what actually happened
[11:58] <LjL> lord sorry
[11:58] <LjL> ayaa let me look
[11:58] <LjL> info kiosktool ayaa
[11:58] <LjL> ayaa i'd give the kubuntu cd a try
[11:58] <LjL> ayaa just look abov the bot spat out the info -
[11:58] <LjL> ayaa
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware doesn't necessarily have to take time just overwrite the right parts of the drive and your partition is gone
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell trentster about boot
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware err did you save p
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware weird 'nuff happen to have virus checking or something enabled in the bios might prevent the boot record from being overwritten
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt how could we know what header should i install doesn't sound like a question that makes sense - unless we can read your mind which we can't -p
[11:58] <LjL> fishing
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware i'd give it another try perhaps gparted overwrote your changes though i doubt it but i have no better ideas
[11:58] <LjL> xroach gparted in system administration
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware do you have smart on that drive
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt no nobody can help you with that becausee the question doesn't make any sense
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware sudo apt-get install smartmontools - then smartctl -h devwhatever and smartctl -a devwhatever
[11:58] <LjL> pm scamboy
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt could we know what you're trying to do in the first place and what is failing
[11:58] <LjL> xroach i can guarantee it's there i could be mistaken on the exact location in the menu since i use kde normally
[11:58] <LjL> scamboy an exe is a windows program normally not a linux program
[11:58] <LjL> scamboy as for debs you mostly shouldn't install them manually what are you trying to install
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell kubu about ndiswrapper
[11:58] <LjL> scamboy bluez as in the bluetooth stack
[11:58] <LjL> scamboy ubuntu comes with bluetooth support built in

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell xroach about mount
[11:58] <LjL> lord what
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware not particularly try smartctl -t short devblah to make smart execute a short self-test and then try again with -a
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware with -h you mean
[11:58] <LjL> pm lord
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell lord about install
[11:58] <LjL> caps lord
[11:58] <LjL> lord the bot has given you links to installation instructions for ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware well smart is not infallible but still i'm not sure it's a physical problem on the hd if smart parameters look ok
[11:58] <LjL> gpart lattyware
[11:58] <LjL> lord of course
[11:58] <LjL> lord download the desktop cd and install from it
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware well that probably means the partition table is messed up but we knew that
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware have you tried doing o create new partition table in fdisk before actually setting up the partition
[11:58] <LjL> doesn't work bruteado
[11:58] <LjL> lord i haven't the slightest idea probably around gb don't know what you mean with the root admin
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt cpl-tnt could we know what you're trying to do in the first place and what is failing
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell lord about root
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt and you need the kernel headers right
[11:58] <LjL> caps pder
[11:58] <LjL> offtopic pder
[11:58] <LjL> lord the ubuntu desktop cd has a permanent installer just boot from it and click on install as for root no you don't need it use sudo
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado yes windows whatever click start run type cmd and type it there
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware how can you tell it doesn't work you w then quit then run fdisk again and p shows nothing
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware i'm still unsure whether you should reboot after an fdisk run afaik the kernel doesn't sync the partition table at least if you have anything mounted on the drive which i hope you don't but anyway

[11:58] <LjL> lord not the right channel to ask about that
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado you must find the rawwritewinexe file in the ubuntu cd at least i think it's there and then type the stuff in parenthesis ie rawwritewinexe smbbin
[11:58] <LjL> lattyware uuids serve two purposes mainly let you move drives around without well in theory worrying about devnames changing and breaking your boot smooth the transition to the new ide drivers which will use devsdx names instead of devhdx names

[11:58] <LjL> bruteado try typing sudo apt-cdrom add with your ubuntu cd in the drive and see if you can then fetch them
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado in a terminal same place you write sudo apt-get

[11:58] <LjL> bruteado and again please don't enclose my nickname in -- i won't see it
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado where have you put the rawwriteexe file
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado then save it somewhere like in c
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado after that type cd c in your command line and then you should be able to type the command
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt i'm not sure if the linux headers are on the cd if they are you can get them even without an internet connection - try typing sudo apt-cdrom add with your ubuntu cd in the drive and see if you can then fetch them
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt i typed that before but i was typing to the wrong nickname
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado i told you - now type cd c if c is the place you saved it in then you can type the command that's on the web page
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado actually follow me step by step type cd c then type dir exe does it mention rawwriteexe
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado ok is you cd drive called d in windows
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado ok then type rawwritewinexe ginstallsbmbin
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado same place you typed the rest
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado where did you type dir exe and all the rest same place

[11:58] <LjL> zyclop the support is there
[11:58] <LjL> bruteado then you could have said that

[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight well the password of course is asterisk but i suppose that you can see that the user name is input correctly well actually perhaps you have the username pre-typed by default in that case tried erasing it an typing it in again
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight i don't know but if you don't mind a temporary workaround try installing xdm
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight a display manager ie a login screen like gdm
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight because xdm is not quite nice to look at
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight and we aren't finding the root of the problem anyway
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight well if it works you can use that indefinitely but that would sound far from optimal to me of course it's your computer so if you're ok with that
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight try install xdm and then do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xdm
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight you've got nothing to lose at any rate
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight in any case pastebin your current xorgconf i'll see if i can find a clue
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight no
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight it's just a different display manager hopefully if the problem is with gdm xdm will work for that matter you could install kdm but that would take a huge lot of kde libraries with it
[11:58] <LjL> sometimes it even works

[11:58] <LjL> jas-nix
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya use apt-get autoremove if you're on edgy
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya no because that would imply removing everything
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya i understand your reasoning but the problem is that as soon as you remove any package ubuntu-desktop will be removed -- now if ubuntu-desktop's dependencies as installed by the ubuntu cd installer were marked as automatically installed removing ubuntu-desktop would mean removing them all as soon as an apt-get autoremove is issued
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya the only real way to fix this would be to have real metapackages ie distinguish metapackages from normal packages in some way currently metapackages like ubuntu-desktop are just normal packages that are empty and have lots of dependencies
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya well you can't you can be clever and remove some packages that will wipe out of a lot of stuff that depends on them -- like for isntance libgnome
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya i'm not sure since i haven't used the alternate cd since breezy when it wasn't alternate anyway but that might be or the server cd for that matter
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya or just somehow get a list of everything that a fresh ubuntu has installed and mark them as autoremovables
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya oh yes that's an idea as well debfoster works by asking you which packages you want to keep -- so if you tell it that the only package you want is say ubuntu-minimal it should remove anything that's not depended upon by it
[11:58] <LjL> pt filipescrooff
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya actually doing an apt-get rdepends linux and the various kernel image packages seems to show that nothing depends on linux
[11:58] <LjL> i mean apt-cache
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus but i checked against more specific packages such as linux-image-generic and linux-image---generic as well
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya well yeah though you can probably just keep that one in mind and keep linux as a manually installed package
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya what are you trying to accomplish anyway if you want a server perhaps it'd be easier to just reinstall using the server edition
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya never made one but i suppose in that case you'd want to make your own nolimitsoya-desktop metapackage
[11:58] <LjL> fr lecroatcurde

[11:58] <LjL> kjoo typing klear ubuntu gave a valid result as the second hit on google for me it's a dapper package though
[11:58] <LjL> cntb yeah except you need to escape spaces in filenames in unix
[11:58] <LjL> cntb so wine mediasdaprogram filesinternet exploreriexploreexe or wine mediasdaprogram filesinternet exploreriexploreexe
[11:58] <LjL> well program files has to be escaped as well of course
[11:58] <LjL> cntb and i'm not quite sure you
[11:58] <LjL> cntb and i'm not quite sure you'll be able to launch an ie that was installed on a windows partition without doing anything special anyway
[11:58] <LjL> cntb it won't find the needed libraries
[11:58] <LjL> rnz- erm
[11:58] <LjL> cntb ie probably works just not that way what standard programs works in windows if you just run the executable from an external hard drive without having them installed first
[11:58] <LjL> almost none
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell ixian about windowsdrives
[11:58] <LjL> vladuz lsof
[11:58] <LjL> cntb that will work but then the regeditexe that comes with wine is a specific wine version
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell sidewalk about locale
[11:58] <LjL> cntb i'm not sure why you're reaching that conclusion actually
[11:58] <LjL> cntb i just said that to use programs on wine you have to install them same goes for windows and for windows on xen and for windows on vmware and for windows on qemu
[11:58] <LjL> cntb sure wine will run fewer programs than xen or qemu that's true but it doesn't mean you should ditch it - depends on what you need
[11:58] <LjL> cntb wine won't run all windows programs that's for sure but if you use vmware or xen or something it'll be like having a screen in the screen that runs windows you won't just have to install programs you'll have to install a complete copy of windows they're just emulators
[11:58] <LjL> cntb wine instead lets you run some windows programs inside of your gnomekdewhatever desktop
[11:58] <LjL> cntb for example office and photoshop should work inside wine just examples -- go to their site they have a database of applications
[11:58] <LjL> compilerwriter i don't even know what palmdesk is
[11:58] <LjL> equivalents cntb if you're trying to give users alternatives to their windows applications you should also see this
[11:58] <LjL> compilerwriter i believed ubuntu had some facilities for connecting to palms without using windows programs
[11:58] <LjL> err windows
[11:58] <LjL> err because the windows installer overwrites the mbr

[11:58] <LjL> carlfk usually yes
[11:58] <LjL> kronoman i'm using one
[11:58] <LjL> kronoman you'll need the binary-only drivers for full d acceleration
[11:58] <LjL> markelhas make it a little more than gb to make sure you have space for hibernation if you ever need it
[11:58] <LjL> flannel well not strictly true if you have swap space available then the linux kernel may decide to swap out executable pages in favor of data file caching if you don't have the space in the first place it won't -- however i agree that's not a valid reason to choose swap size you have other means to control that
[11:58] <LjL> sidewalk if it's a bitmapped font you need to enable bitmapped fonts i believe that's done by running sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config

[11:58] <LjL> iter there are a few ones around actually
[11:58] <LjL> that's not the only one
[11:58] <LjL> iter if you want to share it with linux and like to have data uncorrupted yes it's bad
[11:58] <LjL> iter i'm sure you realize the issue with most people is dual boot
[11:58] <LjL> iter doesn't mean everybody does the same as you and uses computers the same way you do
[11:58] <LjL> iter the issue is that if people dual boot and want to share a filesystem it's going to be either ntfs fat or ext generally ntfs is unsafe for writing on linux fat is a weak filesystem generally speaking and ext as far as i gather is relatively safe to write on windows
[11:58] <LjL> and filesystems run inside the kernel on linux as we ll for that matter
[11:58] <LjL> works for me
[11:58] <LjL> iter i completely agree that you should just use ext on linux and ntfs on windows but in many cases people simply start from the assumption that they're going to have a shared partition and fat might have been around for as long as you like but it's still as weak a filesystem as it can get
[11:58] <LjL> iter err hold on a second what is the linux ext driver if you a non-ms kernel mode driver from the oss world

[11:58] <LjL> kyynara are you sure you don't need the nvidia-glx-legacy driver rather than nvidia-glx if you're sure then are you sure that you have universe multiverse and restricted enabled in all repositories

[11:58] <LjL> sol also are you aware that breezy is a bit dated though still supported for months
[11:58] <LjL> sol - i've also enabled universe and multiverse and removed the cd repository
[11:58] <LjL> sol type sudo apt-get update after changing the sourceslist file
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell jdaosh about upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> jdaosh your applications will still be there after an upgrade

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dado about bot
[11:58] <LjL> nuked yes i'd find it a cause of concern personally
[11:58] <LjL> tsole i don't think windows provides any way to share a scanner
[11:58] <LjL> ubuntu-desktop nuked that package being removed is not a cause of concern - other packages being removed might be
[11:58] <LjL> nuked i can't tell either way i'd just keep installing something like that is never quite safe
[11:58] <LjL> ubuntu-desktop nuked
[11:58] <LjL> verboxx don't
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell verboxx about root
[11:58] <LjL> verboxx why

[11:58] <LjL> nuked i'm implying it's not terribly easy yes
[11:58] <LjL> timo tell me more about the setup you have
[11:58] <LjL> timo iptables is a command you don't edit it
[11:58] <LjL> timo i was asking about your network setup anyway you're saying it worked great previously how exactly
[11:58] <LjL> timo as i just said iptables is a command

[11:58] <LjL> shwag not necessarily in main
[11:58] <LjL> best zirjoker
[11:58] <LjL> but yes shwag it contains applications that were requested to be ported back from the development version
[11:58] <LjL> shwag well actually i think you can get new packages as well
[11:58] <LjL> shwag you don't get new packages or even new versions of existing packages in universe at all
[11:58] <LjL> shwag besides universe is a component backports is a repository which has main restricted universe and multiverse sections
[11:58] <LjL> shwag we have several repositories x x-updates x-security x-backports x-proposed with x being a distribution like edgy and each of them is divided into components
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell shwag about repos
[11:58] <LjL> shwag in short main is free stuff mantained by the core devs universe is free stuff mantained by the community restricted is non-free by the core devs multiverse is non-free by the community
[11:58] <LjL> shwag i'll have the bot give you a few more pointers as well
[11:58] <LjL> shwag the basic structure is dpkg does the hard work of installing and removing deb packages a deb is an 'ar' archive containing two 'targz' archives - apt is the thing that knows about repositories and how to solve dependencies and then calls dpkg to do the installs repositories are http or ftp servers with a special directory structure and each repository can have a number of components - apt-get aptitude synaptic adept etc are
[11:58] <LjL> front-ends to apt - aptitude is a bit special in that it does a bit of dependency-managing work itself
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell lahey about packages
[11:58] <LjL> lahey well it's called desktop cd and it's actually the main cd that you use to install ubuntu - but it also acts as a live cd yes
[11:58] <LjL> xpprg you use the apt system to install packages on ubuntu there are a few frontends available synaptic gnome adept kde apt-get command line and aptitude command line text interface are probably the most used ones
[11:58] <LjL> lahey you should think whether you want dapper or edgy edgy is the newest version but dapper is lts long time support
[11:58] <LjL> botxj if you mean that you won't be able to play drm protected content probably yes
[11:58] <LjL> lts inglor

[11:58] <LjL> harusari they're all qt though except for planfacile which doesn't list any dependencies
[11:58] <LjL> harusari find them

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell chewy about xgl
[11:58] <LjL> inglor can you ping
[11:58] <LjL> inglor then i guess your dns settings are wrong can you ping other sites or reach them in the browser
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell hyperion about install
[11:58] <LjL> inglor check the nameserver entry if any in etcresolvconf and make sure it's the actual dns server
[11:58] <LjL> emptymind no
[11:58] <LjL> emptymind you can possibly get the source package and compile it
[11:58] <LjL> inglor what are they
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell languid about raid
[11:58] <LjL> inglor is possibly the address of your modem
[11:58] <LjL> inglor fix your modem's built-in dns proxy if it's broken or set your dns manually to something else - like the dns servers from your isp which you should find somewhere in your isp's site
[11:58] <LjL> inglor is a dns server that should work though very slowly
[11:58] <LjL> inglor what is not working the welcome page anyway try putting as your first nameserver in etcresolvconf and see

[11:58] <LjL> trixsey there is samba included by default with graphical frontends
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey and you want to
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey there are a few advanced calculators for linux
[11:58] <LjL> wine trixsey
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey well wine means wine is not an emulator
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey when people say emulator they usually mean something that simulates a computer architecture wine on the other hand just executes windows binary files and has a mostly windows-compatible api that's different
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey wine is free dc doesn't run at all on ubuntu afaik but there are alternatives
[11:58] <LjL> info dcgui trixsey
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey the current kde one is called valknut actually but anyway there are at least three or four different clients in the repos
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey uh
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey exe if that's what you mean is just the extension windows and other operating systems not ubuntu use for executable programs
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey no
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey the fact that it's open source doesn't mean you can take it and compile it unmodified on any system
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey the linux and windows apis are totally different you'd have to rewrite it to work on ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey anyway why don't you just try out the other clients we have
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell genon about fixres
[11:58] <LjL> bjornolai if it has detected your soundcard it has detected your microphone
[11:58] <LjL> info kgrellm igor
[11:58] <LjL> err gkrellm
[11:58] <LjL> ifireball dunno i've used neither but superkaramba has shiny applets for the desktop and gkrellm has shiny applets for the desktop
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey i ruled out anything that didn't use apt since i was already so used to it on debian and liked it ubuntu was the most obious choice for a desktop computer anyway i think this is not a support question and should be taken to ubuntu-offtopic instead
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey a release comes out every months meanwhile packages are not updated ie you won't get new versions the only updates you get are fixes to security vulnerabilities and to very serious bugs
[11:58] <LjL> trixsey then there is an unsupported backports repository where some packages from the next development version are ported back to the current version but only a few packages end up there
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and take care to select the right monitor parameters
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr and you used the sync ranges are reported on your monitor's manual
[11:58] <LjL> hastesaver uh don't know i joined a few minutes ago
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell xgm about upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> hastesaver trolls abound yes
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr so you only have x in your xorgconf for all depths
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr that's quite weird because i believed x wouldn't boot at all if none of the graphics modes set were available
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr how did you restart x after changing the settings last time
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr the latter should more than suff
[11:58] <LjL> ice
[11:58] <LjL> synflood yeah but restarting gdm should be fne as well
[11:58] <LjL> xgm if you have the edgy alternate install cd not the desktop cd you can save bandwidth by using gksu sh cdromcdromupgrade
[11:58] <LjL> synflood not really
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell abes about divx
[11:58] <LjL> thijs why do you want to remove it
[11:58] <LjL> leafw that's xserver-xorg and it won't remove much i'm afraid
[11:58] <LjL> thijs perhaps if you want a server install you could use the server version
[11:58] <LjL> leafw i'm not going to try that but i doubt it removing ubuntu-desktop won't make autoremove remove anything else
[11:58] <LjL> the packages that are installed by default aren't marked as autoremovable otherwise it'd be a mess
[11:58] <LjL> alakazamzr i think so too and i'm not sure what to try
[11:58] <LjL> language
[11:58] <LjL> de kaktuspalme
[11:58] <LjL> caps jewslolwtclol
[11:58] <LjL> jewslolwtclol ircubuntucom is an irc server well an alias to one
[11:58] <LjL> jewslolwtclol and httpd config is probably the configuration file for an http web server
[11:58] <LjL> srfc linux-headers then it isn't the one from the repositories
[11:58] <LjL> srfc i don't think you need nvidia-kernel-source just install nvidia-glx
[11:58] <LjL> godstand use lowercase what's the problem
[11:58] <LjL> anyway now it's full of room monitors watching what's the problem godstand
[11:58] <LjL> ask khale
[11:58] <LjL> khale you don't have a root password so it's not the same as your normal user's - it's just that your normal user is a member of the admin group and as such can use sudo which gives it root privileges
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell khale about root
[11:58] <LjL> khale don't know why this would have happened but perhaps you're not a member of admin anymore try typing groups and see if admin is listed
[11:58] <LjL> khale then i guess lupine is right and sudo is broken what happens when you try sudo true
[11:58] <LjL> runpain do your experiments in the status window not in the channel now by typing the wrong command you needed a slash in the channel we all saw your password
[11:58] <LjL> runpain definitely
[11:58] <LjL> khale i don't even know what winlux is honestly and couldn't find many references to it but anyway you should be able to start ubuntu in recovery mode and get root from there you can check what's going wrong with sudo not sure what it could be honestly
[11:58] <LjL> allen perhaps not enough have you installed xine's extra codecs
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell allen about multiverse

[11:58] <LjL> allen
[11:58] <LjL> gnomefreak yes though it does it a bit differently but the result really should be the same see above
[11:58] <LjL> allen while typing what
[11:58] <LjL> mumrah what does grep cdrom etcfstab say
[11:58] <LjL> allen your system has a copy-and-paste function use it p
[11:58] <LjL> allen you need the one by sun
[11:58] <LjL> mumrah try typing manually sudo mount mediacdrom with a cd inserted
[11:58] <LjL> hm
[11:58] <LjL> mumrah i suppose it makes sense that your cd drive is devhdc ie secondary master
[11:58] <LjL> dash
[11:58] <LjL> mumrah in the same drive
[11:58] <LjL> pm allen
[11:58] <LjL> allen change the first line of runlimesh from binsh if that's what it says to binbash
[11:58] <LjL> gnomefreak i'm not sure in certain situation you really have better options
[11:58] <LjL> msg the bot
[11:58] <LjL> allen i did check what i said in the channel
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell allen about pm
[11:58] <LjL> and allen change the first line of runlimesh from binsh if that's what it says to binbash
[11:58] <LjL> yes i gave you an answer try that perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> allen use runlimesh to invoke it rather than sh runlimesh -- if that doesn't work try chmod x runlimesh first
[11:58] <LjL> offtopic good or bad automatix is not recommended here you can discuss the merits of it somewhere else
[11:58] <LjL> ohmy

[11:58] <LjL> pelo sudo checkinstall
[11:58] <LjL> linuxfanstar definitely an ubuntu-offtopic question
[11:58] <LjL> grodius etcx
[11:58] <LjL> grodius you might want to consider using sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg instead of tinkering with xorgconf directly though
[11:58] <LjL> linuxfanstar no
[11:58] <LjL> pppoedude i'm not sure it can detect when the guest is not doing anything
[11:58] <LjL> it could catch halt instructions if they're issued but i don't know if it does that
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell adam about java
[11:58] <LjL> thomas well another difference is that vmware is proprietary
[11:58] <LjL> skreet really
[11:58] <LjL> pppoedude
[11:58] <LjL> skreet well that's the definition of proprietary that the fsf uses though you might disagree but that's different from saying it's the wrong word
[11:58] <LjL> downgrade grodius
[11:58] <LjL> riddlebox grep
[11:58] <LjL> tale guess the username is ubuntu and the password's blank
[11:58] <LjL> grodius if you want to reinstall just take the cd wipe it out and reinstall it doesn't make much sense in another sense
[11:58] <LjL> grodius no you can reinstall single packages -- you can probably go and reinstall all of them i don't see how that'd help though

[11:58] <LjL> abhinay choose copy original to backup that's assuming your hd is working correctly in general
[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> abhinay there are two copies and they normally should be identical apparently for some reason they aren't now by choosing that option you copy the main one to the backup
[11:58] <LjL> abhinay stop i don't know what that one means and i did not get it

[11:58] <LjL> if it's buggy why do we have it in the topic
[11:58] <LjL> pelo did you have any non-official packages installed when you upgraded
[11:58] <LjL> or third-party repositories enabled
[11:58] <LjL> pelo i mean having things that are not from the ubuntu repositories
[11:58] <LjL> it does then really why do we have that in the topic
[11:58] <LjL> kitche pointer
[11:58] <LjL> pelo that's a bit like looking for trouble though
[11:58] <LjL> pelo we don't even recommend automatix much less so recommend to have it installed have its repository enabled while upgrading
[11:58] <LjL> kitche you mean
[11:58] <LjL> kitche i can't find that if it's true we need to inform people about it i'm googling for update-manager at ubuntucom but can't really find the right page

[11:58] <LjL> martyyyr if there are drivers for it somewhere it can't be impossible - but without a working internet connection in the first place yeah it can be quite annoying to do

[11:58] <LjL> helpme
[11:58] <LjL> coho nano is a text editor typing nano filename in a terminal will open a text file for editing in nano
[11:58] <LjL> coho it has to do with the fact that the line etcaptsourceslist is not a valid command and does not make sense
[11:58] <LjL> coho etcaptsourceslist is a text file in particular it's a configuration file for the apt system your shell expects that you type a command on it possibly followed by a filename - and etcaptsourceslist is not a command nano etcaptsourceslist on the other hand is because nano is a command ie a file that is executable and contains a program
[11:58] <LjL> shwouchk if they have physical access to the machine they always can
[11:58] <LjL> shwouchk they won't be able to login as root no but then you shouldn't allow ssh to root even if you're on a system where the root account is accessible

[11:58] <LjL> shwouchk uh no i never said that
[11:58] <LjL> shwouchk in ubuntu root cannot login directly at all by default in other distributions it can -- but what i'm saying is that you should never have root enabled for remote access anyway
[11:58] <LjL> ademan pwd
[11:58] <LjL> bit i doubt it well there are commercial ones
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell anthonykid about apt
[11:58] <LjL> bit i said - i doubt it
[11:58] <LjL> bit there's ocrad and tesseract that i can think of but i'd say gocr is better than either you could try though
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell ademan about checkinstall
[11:58] <LjL> ademan in theory it should
[11:58] <LjL> ademan personally i wouldn't trust it but then i wouldn't trust a run or bin installer in the first place
[11:58] <LjL> hst
[11:58] <LjL> ademan then you don't have many options another package you might want to keep in mind is
[11:58] <LjL> cruft
[11:58] <LjL> paste br-
[11:58] <LjL> br- it's annoying enough on a channel with people on it anyway what is your question
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell zipzo about sudo
[11:58] <LjL> zipzo that page also explains what you asked read it
[11:58] <LjL> nkayhan not quite you're not supposed to use sudo for gui apps
[11:58] <LjL> br- because you don't have the development package of glib installed perhaps that's what the error seems to say
[11:58] <LjL> nkayhan doesn't mean it's the correct way to do it and it doesn't work fine with all apps and on all systems
[11:58] <LjL> works for em
[11:58] <LjL> works for me
[11:58] <LjL> br- try installing libglib-dev
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell fantasticfoo about upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> nkayhan if you're on gnome yup
[11:58] <LjL> zipzo read that page
[11:58] <LjL> izm could try altf or altf
[11:58] <LjL> sudo zipzo this page
[11:58] <LjL> izm or you can remove the splash screen completely by messing with menulst or add some text to the splash in the same manner
[11:58] <LjL> izm you could even do that temporarily by pressing e while in grub and setting or removing the relevant options which are splash and quiet
[11:58] <LjL> jikanter i think that's enabled by default at least in edgy though
[11:58] <LjL> jikanter and i guess you forgot a
[11:58] <LjL> zipzo press altf and type gksudo nautilus
[11:58] <LjL> if it makes caps lock stay disabled then i'm sure it's a feature and not a bug p
[11:58] <LjL> anthonykid is dapper is edgy
[11:58] <LjL> anthonykid it's anyway not - it's a date
[11:58] <LjL> br- paste more of it
[11:58] <LjL> br- what program is that anyway
[11:58] <LjL> gennmx depends on how long it sits there it's supposed to take some time since it's checking more than mb of data
[11:58] <LjL> gennmx though i'm not sure that's the right syntax
[11:58] <LjL> gennmx i'm not sure about the -c option i usually just run mdsum blahiso and then check it against the correct md
[11:58] <LjL> br- and why do you have to compile it
[11:58] <LjL> help me
[11:58] <LjL> helpme
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell twotone about windowsdrives
[11:58] <LjL> gennmx i don't type in anything at all normally i just type mdsum blahiso wait and then check the md that it outputs against the correct one by eye
[11:58] <LjL> gennmx and yes it sits there
[11:58] <LjL> robod remove quiet from menulst to get back the terse status info on the splash screen or remove splash to get the splash screen away completely
[11:58] <LjL> nel could you make a sentence
[11:58] <LjL> robod paste your menulst on the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> or not
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dale about upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> edget yes i had it tell it to you as well since your suggestion was wrong
[11:58] <LjL> it nel
[11:58] <LjL> edget without an apt-get update and without changing dapper to edgy in the sourceslist i highly doubt it anyway

[11:58] <LjL> jstarcher doesn't sound like a good idea to me
[11:58] <LjL> izm uhm i believed it did not ask for one
[11:58] <LjL> gaiax it then proceeds to tell you how to enable it also it says that method of upgrading is not recommended
[11:58] <LjL> jstarcher recovery mode
[11:58] <LjL> izm it's weird because if you look at it actually seems to imply that no password should be asked in recovery mode
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell twotone about windows
[11:58] <LjL> twotone didn't the windowsdrives page answer that one
[11:58] <LjL> helpme
[11:58] <LjL> javajake hehe both point to the same factoid

[11:58] <LjL> james try setting the correct sync ranges for your monitor in xorgconf
[11:58] <LjL> james nope those are just names the system doesn't care about them the important thing is that you select the correct settings for driver resolution and sync ranges
[11:58] <LjL> enter prestosd
[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> or not
[11:58] <LjL> xamox if it's not a gui app that's a possibility
[11:58] <LjL> ukmatt interpreters and compilers mostly
[11:58] <LjL> xamox another option is adding a proper script in etcinitd and using update-rcd to register it
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell xamox about boot
[11:58] <LjL> ukmatt of course
[11:58] <LjL> ukmatt programs on linux are just files as they are in windows they use a different format though it's called elf at least that's what's normally used while the windows format is called pe
[11:58] <LjL> ukmatt and linux doesn't use extensions much so most executable files don't have an extension
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell ukmatt about compile
[11:58] <LjL> ukmatt then you can compile c and c
[11:58] <LjL> ukmatt for java you can install gcj if it's not already installed
[11:58] <LjL> ademan probably
[11:58] <LjL> ademan as for being possibly it's most probably possible - as for being easy i doubt it
[11:58] <LjL> ademan and you'll need to write install scripts if that run files does anything besides copying files
[11:58] <LjL> ademan personally i wouldn't know how to approach that and i'm not sure it's worth the effort honestly
[11:58] <LjL> clin you need to read about iptables
[11:58] <LjL> clin i could give you a ready-made recipe possibly though it's not the best idea you should really read before trying this sort of thing but now right now i'm in a hurry ping me next time you see me here perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> dylan no but you can say vesasomething iirc
[11:58] <LjL> dylan it's an option in the live cd

[11:58] <LjL> info rhythmbox slinky uh
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy master boot record
[11:58] <LjL> niksoron perhaps etcacpisuspendsh
[11:58] <LjL> slinky that makes me support you're on dapper
[11:58] <LjL> slinky if you really need the newer version perhaps you could get the edgy source package not the binary package it might be easier to get it working
[11:58] <LjL> slinky sudo apt-get build-dep rhythmbox should help you by installing the dependencies that are needed to compile it
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy you've just said nonsense - the desktop cd aka the live cd is the main cd used for installing ubuntu as well as for trying it out then i don't know where downloading enters the picture but sethk is right in that perhaps if you're looking for help you should not assume you already know what to do
[11:58] <LjL> slinky from i'd guess
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell slinky about packages
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy honestly i don't even know what the problem is i was following other discussions
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun do you have a clue what mixer controls labelled via dxs would be i've got four of them and they clearly control the volume somehow but i'm not entirely sure precisely how
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy could you restate your problem perhaps i guess i don't even have the original questions in my history
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy can you reach grub
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun ie multiple pcm streams going to the soundcard concurrently and being mixed in hardware
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy it's the boot loader do you have a menu when the system starts
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun guess you're right though the term multiplexing together with sound and linux somehow gives me the creeps - must be due to each of the various enginesdrivers trying to do it by itself
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy yes i mean the esc one have you no windows option there
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy does your ubuntu boot
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy do you know which drive and partition your windows installation resides in
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy ok boot ubuntu please and type sudo fdisk -l devhda and put the output into the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy take care to type that command correctly as written it can be dangerous otherwise
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy no no quotes
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun how's that hardware multiplexing handled by alsa if at all and is there a reason why the levels are set to rather than by default
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy if the output is just one line ie an error paste it here directly
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy ok type this and tell me what the output is df grep head -
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy it's strange just type df and pastebin the output
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun well i guess that even when there is hardware multiplexing being limited to at most streams wouldn't be great at any rate so using software still makes sense
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy could you just give me the url please i cannot find it by name
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun distorsion at does sound like something's broken in the hardware -
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy ok type carefully sudo fdisk -l devsda
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun and horrible dc offset in the microphone in my case i'd be very glad to use my isa sb awe but no isa slots anymore here
[11:58] <LjL> bruenig wasn't his fault - i asked him to use devhda earlier instead of devsda
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy uhm no
[11:58] <LjL> one
[11:58] <LjL> sudospace fdiskspace -lspace devsda
[11:58] <LjL> info gcc apollo
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy uh that seems weird try sudo sfdisk -l devsda
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy pastebin the output
[11:58] <LjL> crimsun well right now i'm hoping to get my hands on a pci sb live hopefully that's not going to be too bad
[11:58] <LjL> adamkili xserver-xorg-dev might do it
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy yes do you have another hard drive that drive doesn't appear to have any windows partitions on it
[11:58] <LjL> gennmx x if it can i think
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy well the ubuntu partitions only seem to take about gb indeed but there still are no windows partitions mentioned try sudo cfdisk devsda and be very careful with what you touch
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy calm down i have ten fingers and one brain
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy tell me if cfdisk shows anything that looks like a windows partition or an extended partition
[11:58] <LjL> adamkili try xlibs-dev then
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy and then hit q
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy i don't know it lets me copy it fine here but i'm in kubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy just tell me if there's anything else mentioned other than sda and sda if you can't get it to copy
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy i couldn't swear on it but i'd say that either your partition table is corrupted or your windows partition doesn't exist anymore or both
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight is that bad clearly i tend to avoid giving gnome-specific help
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy if you had no important data on the previous windows partition then yes reinstalling is what i'd do if you have important data well perhaps try testdisk
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy to start with try this - run sudo fdisk devsda and then hit v and then enter and tell me what it says
[11:58] <LjL> testdisk
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy hm and that's all it says
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy type q to exit honestly i don't know what has happened to your windows - you could try testdisk as i said but you're alone there because i never used it myself
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy use the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy try sudo gparted devsda as a last attempt see if that shows any windows partitions
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy err well admittedly the syntax was horrible look just run it from if i recall correctly system administration disk editor or-something-likethat
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy how many partitions do you see graphed
[11:58] <LjL> sethk i know though in that case it's quite a big number of cylinders not surprising since most of the hd seems to be empty
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy which take like of the drive the rest being empty
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy the graph
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy there is a graph with coloured bars how many do you see and what are the colors
[11:58] <LjL> sethk well at any rate he said the drive is gb so there definitely appears to be a lot of free space
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy install the gparted partition editing program guess doesn't have it by default
[11:58] <LjL> jordanu well yes i believed the disk editor in the system menu was gparted
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy type what jordanu said
[11:58] <LjL> adamkili i'd make it just kdelibs-dev for starters
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy now type gksudo gparted
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy ah wait y
[11:58] <LjL> language
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy it is installing it
[11:58] <LjL> slinky gparted
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy gparted sorry slinky that wasn't meant for you
[11:58] <LjL> slinky actually i don't see a libatk- neither in dapper nor in edgy -
[11:58] <LjL> slinky true it's just the bot that says it doesn't exist well you probably need a newer version for rhythmbox
[11:58] <LjL> slinky you could get that from edgy as well but i wouldn't recommend that
[11:58] <LjL> br- no but somehow i feel they're built in
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy yes have you started gparted yet
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy so how many partitions does it show how many names how many bars which colors
[11:58] <LjL> derek sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy and they take up the whole bar
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy because the other partitioning programs seem to imply otherwise - ie that your linux partitions do not take up the entire hard drive
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy i doubt it honestly anyway look at the top right where it says devsda - what's the number it mentions and what are the numbers mentioned on the two bars
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy that's the box on the top right
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy then your hard drive is gb not
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy and i don't think you have windows installed
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy that's not what gparted is saying though apparently maybe it's wrong but then if it's wrong i don't know how to fix that
[11:58] <LjL> caps
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy probably
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy we can't access your local files
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell clin about paste
[11:58] <LjL> clin enable universe
[11:58] <LjL> clin yes

[11:58] <LjL> there's no golden three lines rule flood is flood either use one line or use the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy i think there's a site called imageshack that allows you to post screenshots
[11:58] <LjL> clin yes enabled universe

[11:58] <LjL> saleh see you want to see the binary code
[11:58] <LjL> clin perhaps i don't know what's on your last lines - the website does mention that using the gui is the recommended method anyway
[11:58] <LjL> clin at any rate if you have enabled it succesfully type sudo apt-get update and then you should be able to install it
[11:58] <LjL> saleh you'll want to execute it i guess it's an executable program file
[11:58] <LjL> saleh aout
[11:58] <LjL> pm
[11:58] <LjL> clin and no you need to enable it for dapper and dapper-updates not just for dapper-security
[11:58] <LjL> topyli sure i was under the impression the cd is mounted with a unionfs or something
[11:58] <LjL> popel i'm not kde but my guess is right click on the trash and restore or something close just replying you since nobody else has
[11:58] <LjL> topyli i don't have an idea i'm just saying i think the fs can be modified even on the cd
[11:58] <LjL> popel some googling seems to tell me that on gnome you must move files away from the trash manually - but that might be wrong or outdated
[11:58] <LjL> popel yes i right click on a file in the trash and there is a restore menu entry
[11:58] <LjL> sctty read that page there is a reason why you were pointed to it and it's not that you don't know what root is
[11:58] <LjL> khale if you haven't set a root password manually which is not recommended you should never be asked for a root password but just for your own user's password what is asking this password anyway
[11:58] <LjL> khale but where are you being asked for the password while using sudo something or what
[11:58] <LjL> khale so when you type sudo true what is output exactly
[11:58] <LjL> khale well it will not give you an output if it's working but then if sudo isn't working it should ask you for a password or something
[11:58] <LjL> khale try sudo uname do you get output
[11:58] <LjL> khale i think you should disable the root password if there's any set passwd -l root then make very sure that your user is in the admin group the admin group is mentioned in the etcsudoers file
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy i just finished typing a message so i guess i'm here
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy problem is that i really don't know what you could try did you paste that screenshot somewhere after i logged off yesterday
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy yes do it just so i can confirm what i think the situation is a site where you could post it is make sure you select optimize without resizing
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy gparted
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy or gksudo gparted if that fails
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dsoft about permissions
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy good give me the url when it's up
[11:58] <LjL> diiba the file won't stay there because dev mounts a virtual filesystem i think
[11:58] <LjL> khale perhaps can be of help
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy well give me one that shows the screenshot at full size
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy argh that's totally different from what you described the two colored bars don't take up the whole space there is a huge gray bar at the beginning and the box on the top right does not say gb
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy i guess that what shows up as unallocated is really your windows partition except it's not recognized anymore
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy we could try and reset it but i cannot guarantee you anything - actually we might end up with both a broken windows and a broken ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy well it involves using fdisk and recreating the partition information tgpo or anybody who knows about the issue from yesterday any better idea
[11:58] <LjL> firestarter superkirbyartist
[11:58] <LjL> superkirbyartist i don't know try openoffice impress for that perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell superkirbyartist about alternatives
[11:58] <LjL> superkirbyartist disregard the first message i mixed up alternatives and equivalents
[11:58] <LjL> tgpo actually that's not what i was thinking even if you restore the mbr the windows partition still isn't there - or at least neither gparter nor sfdisk seem to see it so actually what i was thinking is open fdisk tell it to create a fat or ntfs and hope he knows which is the right one partition that starts at the beginning of the disk and ends just before the ubuntu partition and then hope well and then yes recreate the mbr if
[11:58] <LjL> necessary but perhaps grub will even just boot it at that point
[11:58] <LjL> tgpo of course though if the partition table is already corrupted modifying it could corrupt it further which would mean neither ubuntu nor windows would start
[11:58] <LjL> superkirbyartist you don't but on the bright side ext suffers from fragmentation much less than fat and ntfs do
[11:58] <LjL> superkirbyartist not necessarily but ubuntu does by default
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy if you don't mind yes do keep in mind that it's a keep-your-fingers-crossed thing more than anything else
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy hold on a minute though i need a cigarette right now
[11:58] <LjL> djbryy now i am

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell mads- about multiverse
[11:58] <LjL> mads- there is a cli procedure described
[11:58] <LjL> roryy you don't have to
[11:58] <LjL> dkr how to search for what
[11:58] <LjL> dkr that's a bit generic search for books in a library search for stars in the sky p
[11:58] <LjL> dkr man grep
[11:58] <LjL> dkr locate and find search for filenames - grep searches for expressions inside given files
[11:58] <LjL> jerp no it's asking for which package causes the problem
[11:58] <LjL> dkr indeed there is
[11:58] <LjL> laibsch he meant installing from scratch
[11:58] <LjL> laibsch i've just rephrased what he said don't kill the messenger but i hear that update-manager does easily break if you have any non-official repositories enabled or non-official packages installed
[11:58] <LjL> chetic never is such a strong word x starts fine for me
[11:58] <LjL> laibsch when you start enabling third party repositories or installing stuff in weird ways you need to be aware that things are likely to break now i don't even know if this really is the case for you - it might just be that update-manager does have a bug
[11:58] <LjL> jtf that's untrue dapper has longer support but edgy is not meant to be experimental by any stretch of imagination it was released last month it was experimental before that
[11:58] <LjL> angrylinuxgeek once you have samba installed i think it should start by default
[11:58] <LjL> angrylinuxgeek perhaps look in etcdefault if there's a file about samba that disables it by default just a guess though i've never used samba on ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> jtf it might not be very stable it might have problems and whatnot but this is the official support channel and edgy wasn't released and as such it's not experimental anymore and saying otherwise is simply wrong saying it's unstable for some people is different from saying it's meant to be experimental
[11:58] <LjL> besides you get everyone chirping in and saying whether it's stable or not for them as you can see

[11:58] <LjL> segosa not that i know of
[11:58] <LjL> mikem i guess you'd need an algebra system for that
[11:58] <LjL> mikem qalculate has some limited algebra system features built in and it can graph so perhaps try that
[11:58] <LjL> mikem get qalculate-gtk or qalculate-kde not just qalculate
[11:58] <LjL> mikem well doesn't seem to work here actually
[11:58] <LjL> qalculate is still a fine calculator though
[11:58] <LjL> mikem if there's nothing simpler around perhaps just try a full-blown algebra system with graphing support like maxima
[11:58] <LjL> houton the google earth package that's in plf worked for me although i'm not sure of the current status of plf

[11:58] <LjL> zach never tried that and i'm not sure where apt-cdrom actually looks for perhaps try mounting it at mediacdrom

[11:58] <LjL> uh i know my joins look so very cool but p
[11:58] <LjL> murrlin no can do or at least no should do although setting timedate seems like a trivial operation it really can have serious effects on the system and that's why only root can do it
[11:58] <LjL> murrlin why not consider synchronizing time from an internet ntp server
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus ntpdate is just intended to be run manually correct
[11:58] <LjL> pt rrfang
[11:58] <LjL> rrfang s respuestas automaticas no son nunca una buena idea por que pueden ser utilizadas por ataques a tu ordenador
[11:58] <LjL> no oslonorway
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus though i guess ntpd by default also opens a service for other clients to connect to which might be a security risk not sure if that's enabled in the ubuntu default configuration though
[11:58] <LjL> zach well he spoke portuguese actually but while i can guess a bit of spanish i don't feel confident enough to venture into portuguese
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus also edgy both on gnome and kde perhaps dapper as well dunno has a net time sync option in the clock's preferences - not sure what it uses though
[11:58] <LjL> doow preferred by whom
[11:58] <LjL> dunno my own preference for easy to start with is a gui text editor an gcc from the command line -
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell needhel about fixres
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell doow about bot
[11:58] <LjL> doow i don't know really but i think it was just left out from the bot's list by mistake unintentionally
[11:58] <LjL> needhel you might have your sync ranges set wrong
[11:58] <LjL> needhel look at them and compare them with what's on your monitor's spec or failing that try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choosing the intermediate option for monitor set up
[11:58] <LjL> girocoll please use english here
[11:58] <LjL> needhel haven't found your monitor's correct specs yet
[11:58] <LjL> needhel those seem right see
[11:58] <LjL> needhel try perhaps removing all video modes from the list except the one you want and then restarting x
[11:58] <LjL> needhel warning could leave you with a text console and no x

[11:58] <LjL> blind yes it does
[11:58] <LjL> easytiger why did you type that
[11:58] <LjL> easytiger i haven't seen anyone asking that at any rate you should give big huge warnings before typing something like that where was it asked anyway
[11:58] <LjL> mc brighteyes another option is to use the nice friendly ubuntu-offtopic channel where there are people ready to discuss all kinds of architectures
[11:58] <LjL> miojo dunno if it's the best possible idea but something like lsof grep username wc -l should probably work

[11:58] <LjL> awesomepetter using kdm

[11:58] <LjL> shadowmil uh the cd comes with a gui
[11:58] <LjL> awesomepetter i understood your problem i just haven't the slightest idea and i'm googling
[11:58] <LjL> shadowmil use the alternate cd then
[11:58] <LjL> awesomepetter oh that could possibly explain it but can you use sudo now anyway
[11:58] <LjL> awesomepetter so now sudoers lists the admin group as the group with access and you're a member of that group
[11:58] <LjL> regaleagle a member of the admin group yes
[11:58] <LjL> awesomepetter i don't seem to find anything

[11:58] <LjL> lordnelson maybe it would help if you described what this plaguing problem is
[11:58] <LjL> sally i doubt it what does du -s etc say
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell tempted about beryl
[11:58] <LjL> sally if etc is gb there's something seriously wrong
[11:58] <LjL> sally type du etc sort -n and find out where the space is used
[11:58] <LjL> tempted what ubotu just told you
[11:58] <LjL> sally that megabytes
[11:58] <LjL> akuma add it to bashrc
[11:58] <LjL> akuma bashrc even
[11:58] <LjL> sally i suggest you use du from the console man du for more info or baobab if you're on gnome to find out where the space is used and in any case never remove stuff from manually
[11:58] <LjL> sally perhaps sudo apt-get clean will free you some space that will delete all the packages you've downloaded and installed from the cache - the packages will stay installed just the file they were installed from will be deleted
[11:58] <LjL> sally and if there's something going bad in your system perhaps some file in var has become huge you could check that as well using du or something if all else fails
[11:58] <LjL> perhaps that should be set in etcnetworkinterfaces noelferreira
[11:58] <LjL> lupine i see
[11:58] <LjL> lupine well there's the up command in etcnetworkinterfaces that iirc is executed after the interface is brought up
[11:58] <LjL> akuma bashrc
[11:58] <LjL> tag which is the ubuntu default so yes
[11:58] <LjL> geokok i suspect that might be because windows uses utf- while linux uses utf- for character encoding
[11:58] <LjL> language tag
[11:58] <LjL> stefan i don't really really know but i'm quite sure it doesn't normally use utf-
[11:58] <LjL> stefan perhaps it's just using the iso-whatever table for greek
[11:58] <LjL> lupine sure nls is the right one i only saw it in relation with smbfs instead for iso i've google a iocharsetblah option and also a strange thing that goes like iso charset
[11:58] <LjL> lupine
[11:58] <LjL> geokok greek iso table should be iso -
[11:58] <LjL> ailean to get the source code apt-get source packagename to change it well just change it to build it look at dpkg-buildpackage as for submitting it perhaps ask in ubuntu-motu
[11:58] <LjL> ailean in the directory you type that apt-get command in
[11:58] <LjL> geokok yeah there's certainly no spaces in the codepage name
[11:58] <LjL> geokok try sudo mount devcdrom mediacdrom -o nlsiso- or something like that perhaps a hyphen after the iso
[11:58] <LjL> geokok or sudo mount devcdrom mediacdrom -o charsetiso- again with or without a hyphen
[11:58] <LjL> geokok sorry that last one should have been sudo mount devcdrom mediacdrom -o iocharsetiso- anyway
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell nuts about fonts
[11:58] <LjL> geokok unmount and try again with the hyphen as well or try with utf instead of isowhatever
[11:58] <LjL> nuts i haven't the slightest idea
[11:58] <LjL> geokok hm look try just the utf option perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> geokok without any other charset option
[11:58] <LjL> geokok no sudo mount devcdrom mediacdrom -o utf
[11:58] <LjL> geokok cool
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell gyop about repos
[11:58] <LjL> babo yes ports below are supposed to be only used by listening services and yes you normally need root

[11:58] <LjL> dooglus it's up to

[11:58] <LjL> rambo and it appears to have a version number
[11:58] <LjL> rambo why not give every package there's around a name that includes the version number then
[11:58] <LjL> paradizelost that was my point
[11:58] <LjL> slavik no otherwise i'd have told you i'm googling though
[11:58] <LjL> and i'm a kde user so perhaps i'm not the best person to find out about this
[11:58] <LjL> slavik no we've got kdesu
[11:58] <LjL> slavik can't find much there is but i'm not sure it sounds very relevant
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell poulap about paste
[11:58] <LjL> de arnducky
[11:58] <LjL> info nsis dooglus not sure but maybe this does the job
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus all that i found out is that those packages use standard compression algorithms see so you could possibly identify the header of the actual archive and strip the rest
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus an example of such a file
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus well i guess winamp perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus i'll see i was trying with winamp now but didn't find any obvious header
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus yes but no i meant a gzip or bzip or lzma or whatever header inside the file
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus if the actual compression format is standard we could find out where the compressed data begins
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus nice find but probably not a problem i can see the upx stuff in the repos
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus nah it can extract too
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus i got upx-ucl now and the manpage says it can expand
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus firefoxexe ms-dos executable pe for ms windows gui intel -bit - worked
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus perhaps not since file doesn't mention that what's that other example where it does
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus well it does for winamp lite anyway
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus hehe well nevermind winamp should do find as an example anyway
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus yup
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus i knew about that one but i don't think though i haven't tried it cab's are compressed with neither gzip bzip or lzma as far as i know
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus anyway no at best orange is what we'd need which uses cabextract
[11:58] <LjL> well i'll give orange a try then
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus but orange's description doesn't mention nullsoft installers
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus i looked didn't look like it could i didn't really read the man pages if any though
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus perhaps - just perhaps - i found something ie the header of an lzma archive
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus wait a moment though 'cause i'm writing a short c program to strip that out not knowing any better like how to do that with a shell script
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus i haven't used that used khexedit but i got lzma to apparently decompress the stuff now though i'm left with stuff that again i don't know how to extract no it's not a tar archive
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus nevermind lzma didn't decompress a thing it just gave no error but spat out the same still compressed file
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus i have to go for a while - anyway lzma files appear to begin with d and that string is found in the winamp lite installation file and it's shortly after an ascii string that says inst

[11:58] <LjL> jiegun probably best not to type that command
[11:58] <LjL> jonah i said umount
[11:58] <LjL> jonah i told you - i don't know umount is just to unmount the device
[11:58] <LjL> xchat merc
[11:58] <LjL> merc what
[11:58] <LjL> merc yeah xchat is xchat and xchat-gnome is xchat-gnome install xchat
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus uhm so it's probably all the files joined together you should find a way to split them correctly now
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus couldn't you just use wine in the end anyway
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus shrug who cares create an ad-hoc user
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus if the files are not glued together in a standard format like tar and your file output seems to imply they aren't i suspect it's going to be far from easy to extract them
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus ok but then where are the other files
[11:58] <LjL> dooglus and that it plays in mplayer doesn't mean it doesn't also contain the other files mplayer plays just about anything whether it's corrupted or not
[11:58] <LjL> it just means it's the first file in the archive
[11:58] <LjL> khatahn same for me it used to use the other theme in dapper but iirc gave the same errors not entirely sure though
[11:58] <LjL> bean digicam
[11:58] <LjL> bean what works weird anyway
[11:58] <LjL> bean what program do you have running on the terminal
[11:58] <LjL> bean for me it's as easy as it can get - drag from top left corner to bottom right corner and then middle button to paste
[11:58] <LjL> bean then i don't see why you should get strange behavior perhaps try shutting down x restarting gpm sudo etcinitdgpm restart and see
[11:58] <LjL> warlocks man ipconfig man interfaces
[11:58] <LjL> warlocks sorry man ifconfig not ipconfig that's the windows equivalent ouch
[11:58] <LjL> bean the cursor only appears when you move the mouse here
[11:58] <LjL> bean no it definitely won't paste in gedit you need to paste in another virtual terminal
[11:58] <LjL> bean you can use nano as a terminal editor
[11:58] <LjL> bean which you'll probably then find in varlog
[11:58] <LjL> emxba it's just a codename it means nothing
[11:58] <LjL> emxba in the context of ubuntu it's just a codename
[11:58] <LjL> emxba of course it means something in edgy but then that's offtopic here you can ask a dictionary - as you've just done i guess
[11:58] <LjL> err in english i mean
[11:58] <LjL> emxba ask a dictionary in the context of ubuntu no they're just words shuttleworth chose
[11:58] <LjL> bean type nano
[11:58] <LjL> bean and it definitely has a manpage anyway man nano you probably don't really need it anyway it's intuitive enough
[11:58] <LjL> bean no nano doesn't do that it's just an editor that runs in the terminal so that you can paste the gpm clipboard into it
[11:58] <LjL> bean gedit doesn't work because the x clipboard and the gpm clipboard are not the same
[11:58] <LjL> bean you need to run nano in a virtual terminal not inside x for gpm pasting to work
[11:58] <LjL> bean have you tried shutting down x and restarting gpm yet
[11:58] <LjL> bean if they're very early boot messages they might not be in the logs
[11:58] <LjL> emxba no i said gpm and meant it
[11:58] <LjL> emxba gpm is the program you just installed to use the mouse in vts
[11:58] <LjL> emxba and you can find out what the acronym means by just typing apt-cache show gpm
[11:58] <LjL> fuller installing packages intended for debian can break systems
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell elriah about downgrade
[11:58] <LjL> bean sure
[11:58] <LjL> vegaobscura you thought wrong it uses deb packages that's true but it's not compatible for packages made for debian
[11:58] <LjL> marillat as an example
[11:58] <LjL> bean haven't a clue i've found though
[11:58] <LjL> bean shrug i know
[11:58] <LjL> bean and i doubt it would help for that matter
[11:58] <LjL> bean take a look at the reports at
[11:58] <LjL> bean if there's that many bug reports that mention that error message my sense of smell says it's a software problem
[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> slavik sure
[11:58] <LjL> vega really

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell gyop about gaim
[11:58] <LjL> gyop look for a deb package of the latest version or use the one the bot pointed you too don't use an rpm
[11:58] <LjL> and i mean a deb made for ubuntu of course
[11:58] <LjL> offtopic

[11:58] <LjL> john i don't think i do hate it when my carefully-chosen regexp highlights to make me get a sense from the channel and have an idea of what's going on at a glance become useless because someone types a sentence in all capitals thus shouting it over everybody else's
[11:58] <LjL> john i'd get over it if the channel rules didn't say i'm right

[11:58] <LjL> henna no this channel is strictly for ubuntu support
[11:58] <LjL> henna ask your ubuntu support questions here ubuntu-offtopic for everything else

[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> pip enable multiverse and install unrar
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell pip about multiverse
[11:58] <LjL> unrar
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell pip about unrar
[11:58] <LjL> what about ubuntuguide
[11:58] <LjL> dvd
[11:58] <LjL> thevenin so would the documentation i just pointed him to
[11:58] <LjL> which is the documentation from ubuntucom
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell pip about multiverse
[11:58] <LjL> info php-mysql
[11:58] <LjL> or perhaps you could use pear
[11:58] <LjL> pm pip
[11:58] <LjL> pip no it's a bot factoid
[11:58] <LjL> dvd
[11:58] <LjL> look just above pip
[11:58] <LjL> johnm if i have to take a wild guess type eclipse
[11:58] <LjL> pip no
[11:58] <LjL> read the guide on that link instead
[11:58] <LjL> thevenin one part of my brain is devoted to simulating a parallel universe where i kill all their computers and then them
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt homelisa
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt but no
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt the command you need is adduser not useradd
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt delete the user and try again with adduser
[11:58] <LjL> user deluser to delete
[11:58] <LjL> suseruse
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt then those books will also explain that useradd doesn't create a home directory by default anyway on ubuntu use adduser
[11:58] <LjL> no it's not it's not supposed to
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt if you read the manpage man useradd it'll tell you there is an option that you have to explicitly invoke to create a home directory
[11:58] <LjL> but anyway don't and just use adduser instead
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt unimportant to the system
[11:58] <LjL> your choice you can leave them blank as well
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt hm
[11:58] <LjL> exactly
[11:58] <LjL> motin they will
[11:58] <LjL> also be sure you read
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell motin about upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> motin just cancel the download as long as it's still just downloading never interrupt if it's installing
[11:58] <LjL> sidewalk install openssh-server
[11:58] <LjL> no
[11:58] <LjL> motin uhm perhaps there's some black magic that the updater does but i am close to sure that the downloaded packages will stay cached
[11:58] <LjL> ekimus i'm not familiar with portsentry but that iptables command looks like it would drop any incoming packet that's not already part of a connection without a second thought
[11:58] <LjL> so i guess portsentry wouldn't even ever get to see them
[11:58] <LjL> ekimus i see
[11:58] <LjL> jamey i think the issue is that he's got two interfaces running - the wireless and an ethernet
[11:58] <LjL> why can't you just disconnect the ethernet zntneo
[11:58] <LjL> zntneo well disabling it will have the same effect you could set a route
[11:58] <LjL> like route add ip-address-of-your-router dev name-of-your-wifi-interface
[11:58] <LjL> eg route add dev wlan
[11:58] <LjL> though i'd still just try with the ethernet disconnected tbh
[11:58] <LjL> zntneo if you're fast enough chances are your irc client or the server won't even notice a disconnection
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt not sure you can
[11:58] <LjL> jamey that should be the point when it's trying dhcp
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt very bad idea to keep plaintext passwords in a file anyway
[11:58] <LjL> jamey tried ctrlc
[11:58] <LjL> maggotin apt-get moo
[11:58] <LjL> no clue have no wireless here
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt doesn't matter the data is still written to the disk and deleting the file doesn't remove that
[11:58] <LjL> jamey is it configuring network or configuring network interfaces and is it usplash or a text-mode boot guess the latter
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt precisely if you do it the standard way there are just hashes if you put them in a plaintext file they're there unencrypted
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt so you want to give all users the same password
[11:58] <LjL> jamey i don't know try booting in single user and checking the logs
[11:58] <LjL> thevenin nope it can only be used to show user information not to change it
[11:58] <LjL> jamey either recovery mode of if that's not there on minimalserver boot with initbinsh
[11:58] <LjL> h even
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt then just boot with initbinsh
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt apt-cache show makepasswd
[11:58] <LjL> jamey then just boot with initbinsh sorry already said that but addressed to the wrong guy
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt sorry the binsh bit was for jamey not you though the apt-cache bit was for you
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt here the description also says it can also encrypt plaintext passwords given in a temporary file
[11:58] <LjL> patience hate
[11:58] <LjL> slavi haha nope fortunately my small home network has no active whateverness in it p
[11:58] <LjL> slavi the gksudo thing is strange you could probably try making a support ticket as well as a bug i'm not sure it'll have much fortune as long as nobody else can confirm it
[11:58] <LjL> info pzip-full
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp do you really need as opposed to
[11:58] <LjL> unfo apt-get remove package and apt-get autoremove to remove the rest
[11:58] <LjL> unfo that will also remove other packages that are not needed anymore that were installed by other removed programs if any
[11:58] <LjL> sjbrown or gksudo synaptic even
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell hamdinp about paste
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp it's apt-get install pzip-full
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp read about apt a little you don't manually download and then install - the apt-get command downloads and installs
[11:58] <LjL> unfo yes it does
[11:58] <LjL> unfo with you have a tough luck unless you used aptitude to install the program
[11:58] <LjL> unfo deborphan andor debfoster can be of some help but don't really do what you asked for
[11:58] <LjL> hate
[11:58] <LjL> hate evidently you clicked on the wrong link there's links to both
[11:58] <LjL> hate dapper is supported for longer i don't recommend anything
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt su - username but not from the root account
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt from any other account you could use su - thataccount first to move to it without closing the shell
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt to go back just type exit
[11:58] <LjL> hate
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell hate about install
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight it works by black magic you need a computer
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight try vmware-player
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight contrary to the other versions it can't create new virtual machines but you can use for that
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight i'd say at the very least mb of ram much preferred
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight but never say never
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight then just sudo apt-get install vmware-player and have fun
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight that's no problem vmware doesn't support it anyway
[11:58] <LjL> well it does very experimentally though
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight qemu is free software contrary to vmware but it's slower to be honest it emulates the cpu i think while vmware uses the host cpu directly there's kqemu that speeds it up but then it's not free software
[11:58] <LjL> slavi yeah somewhere on launchpad don't remember exactly
[11:58] <LjL> info wine munim
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell minum about universe
[11:58] <LjL> info vmware-player livingdaylight
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight generally things that don't work in ubuntu aren't put into the repositories you know p
[11:58] <LjL> no sudo apt-get install vmware-player
[11:58] <LjL> cpl-tnt i forgot to say use shred to erase the contents of the plaintext passwords file when you're finished
[11:58] <LjL> tag yes i've got a pointer to null right here
[11:58] <LjL> tag null isn't a pointer it's a value anyway i don't use gnome so i don't really know but how did that happen did you do anything that might have caused that can you right click on the desktop and get a create panel option or somesuch
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp no you need to type sudo apt-get install pzip-full after enabling universe not the file name you don't need to download any file manually at least unless you've got a very compelling reason to use version instead of
[11:58] <LjL> doow source repositories are generally enabled by default at least the ones corresponding to binary repositories you have enabled
[11:58] <LjL> msg the bot acke
[11:58] <LjL> aimtrainer are you on ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> aimtrainer yes then it's kdesu
[11:58] <LjL> aimtrainer not really but you should specify as most of use assume you're on ubuntu ie gnome
[11:58] <LjL> repeat admin
[11:58] <LjL> cc even if they did that'd guarantee nothing you need ubuntu packages and for the right version of ubuntu - other packages even if they're deb might break your system or at least not work
[11:58] <LjL> info vmware-player cc
[11:58] <LjL> bot
[11:58] <LjL> cc that means its page is being visited often
[11:58] <LjL> can be missing libraries as well iirc
[11:58] <LjL> he meant what architecture they're for zach
[11:58] <LjL> zach do type file filename and tell us
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell chetic about java
[11:58] <LjL> info dcfldd mitchm
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm lullabud that program claims to do that
[11:58] <LjL> no
[11:58] <LjL> you can strip the useless cat command though
[11:58] <LjL> anyway why not have a look at that program it probably does it more efficiently
[11:58] <LjL> lullabud i was talking about dcfldd
[11:58] <LjL> lullabud hm doesn't here
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm why if it's an ubuntu cd you can
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm no and why are you using cat anyway
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm so can't you just use dd itself instead of that redundant cat
[11:58] <LjL> shy yes
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm ah so that's multiple files
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm i'd consider dcfldd really
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm no
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm why
[11:58] <LjL> de year
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm and
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm for the tenth or so time - no it won't
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm what about tee
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm well i'm not really sure how well or badly it'd interact with device nodes
[11:58] <LjL> mitchm but cat source tee devsda devsdb devnull is what i had in mind
[11:58] <LjL> apt-file doow
[11:58] <LjL> doow when i know the answer
[11:58] <LjL> pip i don't know about what if i am please try searching on helpubuntucom
[11:58] <LjL> doow i use apt-get but then i also use kubuntu so no synaptic here and yes all in all it is easier to give commands that explain where to click also considered that my short-term memory is sorely lacking
[11:58] <LjL> allz that's your decision not many viruses in the wild around for linux though
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp uh no
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp are you still trying to install pzip
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp you haven't given me a valid reason yet why you should use that hand-downloaded package rather than the official one
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp which
[11:58] <LjL> info dict-freedict-tur-eng what about this hamdinp
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp well the bot isn't working but there is that package in universe
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp you did what
[11:58] <LjL> vorbote since when
[11:58] <LjL> themachine sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp that is
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp is that repository ubuntu-specific
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp ok and the problem is though - answer my question is that an ubuntu repository
[11:58] <LjL> allz bhspitmonkey what happened
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp yes because that is not an ubuntu package use the official ubuntu package just type sudo apt-get install pzip-full after enabling universe
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp and this is the foruth time i tell you
[11:58] <LjL> zach i think you saw what your joke resulted in it goes by itself that if i see anything like this again it's a ban
[11:58] <LjL> discerer perhaps dhclient wlan
[11:58] <LjL> allz what did you lose in the end
[11:58] <LjL> allz if you lost important files you should probably shut down your machine right now before the data is overwritten
[11:58] <LjL> allz well it must be said that you should never blindly type commands without knowing what they do man command gives you a page of information about any command - use that
[11:58] <LjL> allz the ubuntu desktop cd is a live cd boot from that
[11:58] <LjL> allz unless you used the alternate cd yes
[11:58] <LjL> allz yes reboot into the live cd
[11:58] <LjL> zach well you just learned that people can take things literally
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp yes as you have to enable universe first
[11:58] <LjL> universe hamdinp
[11:58] <LjL> ah nevermind the bot
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp the packages in ubuntu are divided into several sections see
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp there is also source-o-matic at
[11:58] <LjL> hamdinp the short answer is you enable universe by adding universe after main and restricted in your etcaptsourceslist on the edgy edgy-updates and edgy-security lines but you better read the guide
[11:58] <LjL> weepy perhaps it means the display manager - gdm on ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> weepy dpkg -l gdm
[11:58] <LjL> weepy what is the problem anyway
[11:58] <LjL> weepy yes i think it means the display manager at your login screen look at the options button on the bottom left
[11:58] <LjL> e no it doesn't
[11:58] <LjL> e no
[11:58] <LjL> allz no just boot from it
[11:58] <LjL> e i'd give you a pointer if the bot weren't acting up
[11:58] <LjL> e kernel is the core of the ubuntu operating system named 'linux' - see you shouldn't have to compile one but if you're convinced you do see
[11:58] <LjL> i doubt you can easily put your kernel into an iso though e
[11:58] <LjL> allz then we see what can be rescued
[11:58] <LjL> stop playing
[11:58] <LjL> bimberi
[11:58] <LjL> ru evgenb
[11:58] <LjL> sigh
[11:58] <LjL> it comes automatic evgenb there is ubuntu-ru
[11:58] <LjL> evgenb by the way could you do me a favor and type this in cyrillic characters please pozhalujsta vojdite v ubuntu-ru dlq pomoshchi na russkom qzyke
[11:58] <LjL> this is a test
[11:58] <LjL> well i don't care who does it i've just been trying to get that factoid in cyrillic chars for like months unsuccesfully p
[11:58] <LjL> e except for the url i gave you no
[11:58] <LjL> slavi i didn't i just guessed i don't know what eto means but it sounds like a form of the verb to be and test wasn't very hard to guess
[11:58] <LjL> allz first option start or install
[11:58] <LjL> click no you don't even have a mouse pointer i think
[11:58] <LjL> just hit whatever key it is - enter or f or whatever it is
[11:58] <LjL> slavi no idea i can't even transliterate the first letter the rest being tvoi papa i think
[11:58] <LjL> allz get ubuntu uh
[11:58] <LjL> allz just start the cd
[11:58] <LjL> allz just like you did when installing it
[11:58] <LjL> slavi you don't because the bot is absent in the first place if you give it to me i'll add it
[11:58] <LjL> slavi thanks will be added as soon as the bot is back

[11:58] <LjL> idan yes

[11:58] <LjL> wine
[11:58] <LjL> idan no clue

[11:58] <LjL> it's a question allz

[11:58] <LjL> snwyvern there's something wrong with using the word gay as a pejorative
[11:58] <LjL> pelo or perhaps it's underrespected
[11:58] <LjL> feisty itrebal
[11:58] <LjL> snwyvern there's a config file option don't remember it though or you can use aptitude that does that by default

[11:58] <LjL> ndlovu click on options on your login screen if you're using gdm
[11:58] <LjL> allz no if it says the codename is dapper it means you're using feisty
[11:58] <LjL> yes you are
[11:58] <LjL> allz pick what corresponds to your distribution
[11:58] <LjL> allz yeees
[11:58] <LjL> if it says dapper it's probably dapper you know

[11:58] <LjL> screechingcat i just checked
[11:58] <LjL> perhaps it hasn't reached my mirrors yet if it's very new
[11:58] <LjL> i know how it's done screechingcat
[11:58] <LjL> ok i'll try changing mirrors and see
[11:58] <LjL> oh - well then yeah i definitely have it
[11:58] <LjL> it was an update from security iirc i normally install those
[11:58] <LjL> screechingcat i recall it did give me problems but that was really because my apt was broken to start with
[11:58] <LjL> screechingcat i was talking about the xorg update
[11:58] <LjL> dous i guess etclogrotateconf
[11:58] <LjL> dous then try etccronweeklysysklogd
[11:58] <LjL> dous well then just make another cron script that backs up the logs you want incrementally to somewhere else p
[11:58] <LjL> hey at least that's as safe as it gets
[11:58] <LjL> javiolo dpkg -l openssh-client or dpkg -l openssh-server depending which one you want
[11:58] <LjL> javiolo maybe the local user's configuration is
[11:58] <LjL> javiolo what i told you points to the system-global configuration
[11:58] <LjL> javiolo i have sshknownhosts
[11:58] <LjL> javiolo well do you have any known host p
[11:58] <LjL> dous i know i'm talking hacks but you could try setting up dnotify and have it append the logs that were just rotated to some backup location when it detects a change

[11:58] <LjL> starkruzr i don't know but you have universe and multiverse enabled in the edgy repository but not in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repositories which doesn't sound good at all
[11:58] <LjL> starkruzr
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo targz is just a compression format
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell rodietze about compile
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo then it depends on the program
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo i meant it depends on the specific contents of the archive it's like a zip archive you can get on windows -- there isn't a standard procedure for installing whatever is contained in it
[11:58] <LjL> starkruzr have you run a sudo apt-get update after fixing that
[11:58] <LjL> starkruzr
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo make is a command install is a parameter for the command you might consider checkinstall as well
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell jimbo about checkinstall
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo it will just run the makefile file that it finds in the current directory
[11:58] <LjL> pm tupc
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo it will just run the makefile file that it finds in the current directory which of course means that you must be in the right directory
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo make is a command install is a parameter for the command you might consider checkinstall as well
[11:58] <LjL> tupc what do you mean remove hda destroy the partition
[11:58] <LjL> starkruzr usrinclude
[11:58] <LjL> and since he can't he wants to destroy the partition
[11:58] <LjL> sounds logical
[11:58] <LjL> tupc either go into it as root or mount it with user permissions
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell tupc about windowsdrives
[11:58] <LjL> tupc that makes no sense i'm not giving you a command that deletes a hard drive partition just because you can't read from it
[11:58] <LjL> tupc what do you think you'll obtain by wiping your windows partition
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo usually in a directory called like the targz file except for the extension
[11:58] <LjL> info msttcorefonts
[11:58] <LjL> tupc you don't have multiverse enabled
[11:58] <LjL> msnider it should be possible but i never tried couldn't you consider a dual boot as well
[11:58] <LjL> tupc i can't help you with synaptic because i don't have it put please pastebin your etcaptsourceslist file
[11:58] <LjL> soundray msnider if it were me i'd just try firing up the cd with a usb drive plugged in and see if it's recognized by the installer if it is install if it doesn't boot follor the boot from usb howto
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell tupc about pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> tupc you can ask things to the bot in a private query with it
[11:58] <LjL> msnider i'd say at least gigs but then you could install the server version perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> tupc that is a breezy that was upgraded to dapper later isn't it
[11:58] <LjL> tupc try changing it like this
[11:58] <LjL> tupc and then issue a sudo apt-get update
[11:58] <LjL> tupc sorry try this one
[11:58] <LjL> root the x server stops
[11:58] <LjL> root by the way you should never do irc as root
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell root about nvidia
[11:58] <LjL> root just follow the documentation it boils down to installing nvidia-glx and then enabling it
[11:58] <LjL> root i'll give you the url again when you're from gnome
[11:58] <LjL> tupc now just install the msttcorefonts package
[11:58] <LjL> tupc yes that was sent by mistake
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell darkod about windowsdrives
[11:58] <LjL> tupc no
[11:58] <LjL> tupc same problem as in package not found
[11:58] <LjL> tupc ouch i also forgot to add dapper-updates for universe and multiverse but that's not the reason why msttcorefonts isn't working
[11:58] <LjL> tupc hm please pastebin the full output of it

[11:58] <LjL> wipster i have and a separate home partition
[11:58] <LjL> treitter so you mean until gdm has finished loading not x well no
[11:58] <LjL> dunno treitter
[11:58] <LjL> but treitter when x starts up it just takes over the screen
[11:58] <LjL> wipster i use gigs
[11:58] <LjL> treitter i remember there is an option to make x start in the background i don't remember which option it is though and i do remember that i didn't get it to work if you somehow do you could then perhaps use chvt to switch to x after gdm is finished

[11:58] <LjL> i just told you to use the pastebin minutes ago
[11:58] <LjL> reyson use the pastebin next time
[11:58] <LjL> allz give me the error you get if any when you try sudo apt-get install wxvlc
[11:58] <LjL> allz type that and then pastebin the output
[11:58] <LjL> fuse
[11:58] <LjL> allz had you tried installing vlc from a deb file earlier
[11:58] <LjL> allz what's the output of apt-cache policy vlc and of apt-cache policy wxvlc and of apt-cache policy libdc-
[11:58] <LjL> twopeak you don't you can upgrade to edgy if for some reason you need firefox
[11:58] <LjL> hi
[11:58] <LjL> allz gee it really seems like i cannot read a sourceslist -
[11:58] <LjL> allz though i do wonder how you got it into that messy state p
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell mobal about xgl
[11:58] <LjL> allz that what i pasted it and use it as your sourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> allz that is basically add the line deb dapper main restricted at the beginning of it
[11:58] <LjL> allz that what take what
[11:58] <LjL> allz -- use this as your sourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> allz yeah it's precisely what i said except that i typoed and said that instead of take
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell skyrail about cedega

[11:58] <LjL> language legion
[11:58] <LjL> glx no
[11:58] <LjL> then i don't know do it you can always restore it i'm not a gamer
[11:58] <LjL> yohan not directly you can grep for the contents though
[11:58] <LjL> admiralchicago not with rm
[11:58] <LjL> yohan i'd try something like grep -a -b blahblah devhda recovered where blahblah is a word or expression case sensitive that you know is contained in the file and devhda is your hd partition change it if needed the two 's are the number of lines before and after the blahblah that you want to recover change at will and the contents should be recovered into a file named recovered
[11:58] <LjL> se skenliv
[11:58] <LjL> yohan actually add a -a option as well
[11:58] <LjL> yohan also you should do that from a live cd possibly to avoid overwriting it
[11:58] <LjL> yohan no it simply might trash the file completely
[11:58] <LjL> actually anything you do now might trash it
[11:58] <LjL> so just reboot and use a live cd
[11:58] <LjL> yohan not with ext that i know of
[11:58] <LjL> yohan having alias rmrm -i is a good idea imho
[11:58] <LjL> yohan you can make an alias or script for that too if you like
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla no
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla echo text to put on filename
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla cat reads from standard input not from the command line
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla echo expects a parameter echo foobar prints foobar on the screen because you passed it as a parameter
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla cat instead reads from standard input -- ie you type cat press enter and it sits there waiting for you to type things and prints them
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla depends on what terminal you're using inside x most terminal respect the select-to-copy and middle-click-to-paste convention
[11:58] <LjL> ashzilla but that ends up in the middle-click clipboard which is separate from the clipboard that ctrlc and ctrlv use so if you want to copy tofrom a terminal tofrom another program you need to do the same thing in the other program

[11:58] <LjL> jimbo yes if you want to use auto-apt to help configuring but then auto-apt will ask a lot of questions about packages to install many of which you should answer no to
[11:58] <LjL> jimbo perhaps it would be better if you just went through the configure normally and used auto-apt or apt-file as a help when you're stuck
[11:58] <LjL> jts same purpose yes but it's a partition and not a file linux can use a file as well though that's not generally done
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco first of all consider that you will lose quality in the conversion and if you do want to convert then why not convert to ogg
[11:58] <LjL> info soundkonverter cientificoloco
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco kde application but it really just uses a few backends to do the conversion just need to find out which one is used to read wma
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco fancy term to say a program that is used by another program which is the frontend without you seeing the former program
[11:58] <LjL> prestosd no
[11:58] <LjL> kill them
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco have you installed the recommends ffmpeg specifically
[11:58] <LjL> there's also a bunch of suggests
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco just install it sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell neewbie about install
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco then close and reopen soundkonverter and try again if that still doesn't work i'd start looking at the suggests lame and mplayer
[11:58] <LjL> pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> dxdemetriou eh from dapper you just said you're on edgy
[11:58] <LjL> dxdemetriou no you won't likely be able to upgrade from dapper to feisty directly without going through edgy
[11:58] <LjL> nick you must set it as executable
[11:58] <LjL> nick chmod x filename from the console or right click properties and something in gnome
[11:58] <LjL> info nvidia-glx edgy glombool
[11:58] <LjL> no need to type it again glombool just look above
[11:58] <LjL> unfun lsbrelease -a
[11:58] <LjL> glombool
[11:58] <LjL> it won't install it automatically if you just keep typing that it's just saying that it's present and it's in restricted
[11:58] <LjL> glombool that one what
[11:58] <LjL> glombool pastebin your etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> nick no my guess is that program is intended to be run from a shell type filename in a shell to run it
[11:58] <LjL> nick if that desktop there is in the path is the standard desktop directory then it's got a capital d no at the beginning of the path
[11:58] <LjL> nick anyway don't run it that way
[11:58] <LjL> nick cd homeshaitandesktop and then run it with hldslfullbin
[11:58] <LjL> glombool url please
[11:58] <LjL> glombool looks scary do you know that having debian repositories enabled may break your system
[11:58] <LjL> glombool try this
[11:58] <LjL> glombool run a sudo apt-get update after changing it
[11:58] <LjL> nick my guess is you didn't finish the download or it is corrupted
[11:58] <LjL> yes no need to repeat it three times just address it to me the first time
[11:58] <LjL> nick also you might need to be root to run it which i advice against but
[11:58] <LjL> nick is that a question
[11:58] <LjL> yes it is
[11:58] <LjL> slavik no i believe the automounting this is done in completely different ways in gnome and kde but then i don't even know how it's done on kde
[11:58] <LjL> slavik because i don't want to steal google's job p
[11:58] <LjL> glombool try an upgrade sudo apt-get upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> glombool that's strange since you didn't have -security and -updates enabled before are you sure you ran sudo apt-get update after changing the sourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> alternate itrebal
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell deema about fonts
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell zoetrope about webcam
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny forward it to another computer
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell matju about flash
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny no it's your router's settings to blame
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny ubuntu doesn't come with any ports firewalled by default
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny you might have to open the port for udp as well as tcp perhaps though i'm not familiar with bittorrent
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny perhaps try another program isn't utorrent a windows program anyway
[11:58] <LjL> dxdemetriou you can set up a greek keyboard what else
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny shrug maybe
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell cryptonic about beryl
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny no i use kde
[11:58] <LjL> dxdemetriou i don't know - you mean filenames maybe it's old programs that have no clue about utf- like gtk programs
[11:58] <LjL> dxdemetriou i'm not sure that's achievable
[11:58] <LjL> dxdemetriou try typing locale in a shell you could probably try playing with those variables and then starting those non-working programs from the same shell
[11:58] <LjL> borja because it's preset in the irc client that comes shipped with ubuntu you can remove it
[11:58] <LjL> borja what
[11:58] <LjL> borja the operators of the ubuntu channel you mean
[11:58] <LjL> and with it do you mean i
[11:58] <LjL> borja in other words what the heck are you talking about
[11:58] <LjL> borja there is no one single administrator there is a lot of people involved
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell seyen about fixres
[11:58] <LjL> borja and i'm telling you there is no such person
[11:58] <LjL> borja no such person
[11:58] <LjL> deema mark even
[11:58] <LjL> alecjw or something
[11:58] <LjL> utopiate the ram that is used for caching is freed automatically when programs require it you don't need to worry about it

[11:58] <LjL> alecjw he was just clueless
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell doow about beryl
[11:58] <LjL> arigato one is used by ubuntu gnome and the other by kubuntu kde
[11:58] <LjL> doow read the ubuntu-xgl channel topic
[11:58] <LjL> eetfunk you need the update-rcd command
[11:58] <LjL> jowi no need to to it manually
[11:58] <LjL> icc if it's the standard kernel it does
[11:58] <LjL> jowi there are defaults if desired the update-rcd manpage explains it all anyway
[11:58] <LjL> barrydlunch it's still there
[11:58] <LjL> barrydlunch at least when you venture out of the safe realm of packages which many people seem to be doing even when they don't need to
[11:58] <LjL> barryd if you want to make your life more complicated you're perfectly free to the tools are available
[11:58] <LjL> knowledgengi are they in this channel
[11:58] <LjL> knowledgengi hardly if that's the same ip address use ignore
[11:58] <LjL> knowledgengi well how could a plugin solve the issue since it would have no way of knowing it's the same person
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell darkbuda about paste
[11:58] <LjL> lam ps aux lists kill kills
[11:58] <LjL> paste yes

[11:58] <LjL> jdahm no
[11:58] <LjL> jdahm can't you just burn a cd
[11:58] <LjL> jdahm then use a rewritable
[11:58] <LjL> dromer we aren't concerned with helping you do illegal things here
[11:58] <LjL> ameyer that won't change the fact that it's an upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> downgrade rafaguap
[11:58] <LjL> guys use the bot's ops trigger when there is an emergency and only when there is an emergency
[11:58] <LjL> orkie doesn't that mean you've tried to update to feisty
[11:58] <LjL> anyone
[11:58] <LjL> e this is no place to discuss that
[11:58] <LjL> no to ubuntu-ops if he really wants
[11:58] <LjL> that's why messages to nickserv should always be typed in the status window
[11:58] <LjL> lifepositive you should be more worried about side attacks - like your machine being trojaned and the passphrase sniffed characters in a strong passphrase itself should be good although you shouldn't have told us it's chars that's an important information to start with
[11:58] <LjL> lifepositive if they don't get to the secret keyring your password is useless and they can't break it since they can't check it against something
[11:58] <LjL> lifepositive you stay up with security updates avoid running untrusted executables like stuff not from the repos and perhaps periodically check with programs like rkhunter or chkrootkit
[11:58] <LjL> i saw
[11:58] <LjL> but onfortunately my client gets very lagged when i recieve version requests
[11:58] <LjL> mez yeah except my client is well
[11:58] <LjL> traffic
[11:58] <LjL> lgkeiz calm down perhaps a mistake
[11:58] <LjL> traffic
[11:58] <LjL> language grimboy
[11:58] <LjL> people - no need to increase the traffic just ignore them as much as possible
[11:58] <LjL> pagingmrherman technical difficulties as the topic said - everything's fine now
[11:58] <LjL> br chash
[11:58] <LjL> anyone
[11:58] <LjL> alecjw no it's a netsplit
[11:58] <LjL> jrib no there's no bot
[11:58] <LjL> jrib true
[11:58] <LjL> agent you do need to use ar since a deb is an ar archive
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell ashika about compile
[11:58] <LjL> netsplit
[11:58] <LjL> agent i don't know honestly i doubt it somehow
[11:58] <LjL> agent the package debootstrap has binutils as a dependency and binutils is the package that provides usrbinar
[11:58] <LjL> agent what're you trying to do can't you for instance just obtain a binary copy of ar
[11:58] <LjL> agent well from the opposite perspective - what do you have
[11:58] <LjL> ashika yes they'll just install the bunch of kde libraries
[11:58] <LjL> ashika you don't have to worry - kde dependencies will just be installed automatically when you install the packages
[11:58] <LjL> root unearth
[11:58] <LjL> ashika sudo not su
[11:58] <LjL> finalbeta there's no random password afaik it's just locked
[11:58] <LjL> ashika no but it's got sudo rights
[11:58] <LjL> ashika and when using sudo you effectively are root
[11:58] <LjL> ashika no you need to do it every time you want to run something as root
[11:58] <LjL> clin
[11:58] <LjL> ashika yes sudo -i
[11:58] <LjL> ashika keeps you root until you type exit
[11:58] <LjL> ashika yes
[11:58] <LjL> clin what goes on in your private queries is not really ubuntu's business
[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> automatix florent m
[11:58] <LjL> attah the ones you want - it's your home dir
[11:58] <LjL> ashika it will you need to be root
[11:58] <LjL> attah try sudo chown -r yourusernameyourusername homeyourusername for a start
[11:58] <LjL> jamesrose i guess qemu -cdrom pathtothecd where the path is either devhd whatever your cd drive is or an iso image
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell eduhat about install
[11:58] <LjL> mirak normal
[11:58] <LjL> mirak just say no to the useless things
[11:58] <LjL> jamesrose you need the device not the place where it's mounted devcdrom or something
[11:58] <LjL> mirak then just don't use auto-apt and install the stuff by hand instead
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell eduhat about software
[11:58] <LjL> jamesrose uhm sure devhda is usually your hard drive
[11:58] <LjL> mirak make no you should use auto-apt with configure generally not with make
[11:58] <LjL> eduhat no
[11:58] <LjL> attah it's totally up to you configuration files should generally be writable and readable by youself though at least
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell attah about permissions
[11:58] <LjL> mirak well auto-apt is just going to fail miserably just do it by hand
[11:58] <LjL> depending on the client of course
[11:58] <LjL> attah no standard ones they can be different for each file you could try chmod -r urw homeyouruser to make everything readable and writable to you
[11:58] <LjL> attah -r just means the changes will be applied recursively ie to all files inside the directory
[11:58] <LjL> puller it was a suggestion - you can ask about any kind of ubuntu here just in kubuntu they might know more about it
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell mabus about compile
[11:58] <LjL> -s
[11:58] <LjL> mabus then you have a problem because you can't know in advance which dependencies you already have and which ones you need to get
[11:58] <LjL> helpme
[11:58] <LjL> jerrcs the fact that errors are given in the include file doesn't necessarily mean the actual problems are in the include file
[11:58] <LjL> name does that anything do do with ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> have anything to do
[11:58] <LjL> name well the frame was interlaced you need to set some sort of de-interlacing algorithm
[11:58] <LjL> nothlit ubuntu releases only get security fixes and fixes to serious bugs they don't get new releases of programs
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dravas about compiz
[11:58] <LjL> nothlit yes unless you're particularly lucky trying to install an edgy package on dapper will result in some broken dependencies
[11:58] <LjL> automatix dimitris
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dimitris about flash
[11:58] <LjL> mantice apt-cache search mp web type that and if you get no or very few results enable universe
[11:58] <LjL> mantice it might be gnumpd that you're looking for anyway
[11:58] <LjL> well i don't call that a problem
[11:58] <LjL> doesn't work
[11:58] <LjL> dibblego unionfs perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> asdfasdfdd it's at the first sectors of the disk
[11:58] <LjL> kitche apt-file sometimes fools you
[11:58] <LjL> kitche whichever the point is that package gives you a tiny unix for diskless terminals that's probably why it contains an etchosts but the actual etchosts one normally has comes from somewhere else i bet
[11:58] <LjL> kitche post-installation scripts can create files as well
[11:58] <LjL> ashika it's not a random password it's a locked account
[11:58] <LjL> no
[11:58] <LjL> bang yes many people probably have
[11:58] <LjL> info testdisk doesn't rebuild the mbr i think but it does claim to try and rebuild the partition table
[11:58] <LjL> fuse bang
[11:58] <LjL> info linux-source- steveb
[11:58] <LjL> paste waspems
[11:58] <LjL> steveb well the ubuntu kernel packages get patched kernelorg if you want a fresh kernel tarball
[11:58] <LjL> steveb the version of the package is - if then versionh or whatever says otherwise my guess is that it's because of patches from the ubuntu team which should then also exist in the binary version
[11:58] <LjL> steveb could be but i doubt it i think it's just - with some stuff backported from - admittedly though i don't really know
[11:58] <LjL> steveb if you're sure about that then it's worth filing a bug
[11:58] <LjL> noobie have you changed your hostname
[11:58] <LjL> modem
[11:58] <LjL> dope because winmodems are so called because they are mostly just a dsp chip and an interface to the phoneline and all the rest is done by proprietary and sometimes patented windows software and the interfaces are not disclosed that's why
[11:58] <LjL> cosmonaut look at your private messages
[11:58] <LjL> offtopic
[11:58] <LjL> info vamps intelligitimate
[11:58] <LjL> seveas i know well enough but that way i still get the attention of the person in question without wasting one more line
[11:58] <LjL> that too
[11:58] <LjL> waspems add a at the end of the line
[11:58] <LjL> geforce pastebin your etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> language seveas
[11:58] <LjL> geforce to start with you have the dapper instead of the edgy updates repository enabled for universe that can't be good
[11:58] <LjL> i meant security actually
[11:58] <LjL> well actually no it's all a mess geforce find all instances of dapper and change them to edgy for starters
[11:58] <LjL> geforce apparently it didn't fully
[11:58] <LjL> geforce basically you're using dapper's universe
[11:58] <LjL> seveas daylighter couldn't it be some idiotic laptop hardware that uses keycodes as a sort of interrupt
[11:58] <LjL> geforce that's possibly yeah
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell axa-axa about kde
[11:58] <LjL> axa-axa well the link does mention other possibilities
[11:58] <LjL> slavik no but then i didn't ask p i just tried compiz very briefly once but honestly i won't bother until it's standard stuff
[11:58] <LjL> uuid mooky
[11:58] <LjL> mooky that is to ease the transition to new ide drivers which will use devsd names instead of devhd as well as to make things easier when you move drives around ide slots
[11:58] <LjL> mooky it's not pointless although those long uuids can be sort of annoying - drives being referenced uniquely rather than by their physical location is a good idea
[11:58] <LjL> mooky it's an ubuntu change afaik
[11:58] <LjL> mooky
[11:58] <LjL> mooky honestly i think it was about time we stopped referring to drives based on what end of a cable they happened to be found at uuids don't look that cute but at least
[11:58] <LjL> mooky well skimming through google's hits for kernel lists it seems to me they're likely to be including that in the mainstream kernel sooner than later anyway
[11:58] <LjL> kingsqueak yes that's the way i think it should have been done from the very beginning though right new you seldom even remember that such things as labels exist -
[11:58] <LjL> mooky well time will tell but anyway i agree with what someone's seems to be saying ie that any app that relies on whether something is called hda vs sda is a broken app - then in this view the bold move doesn't look too bold anymore
[11:58] <LjL> kingsqueak always referenced volumes by volume name in amigaos worked fine on pcs windows and linux somehow everybody always seemed to like to give meaningless names such as c or hda based on whether your ide cable was long enough to reach a slave drive without getting another cable and using the secondary slot
[11:58] <LjL> pastebin dalik
[11:58] <LjL> aymnmz because this is an english-speaking channel there are national channels as well like ubuntu-fr
[11:58] <LjL> de testi
[11:58] <LjL> livecda vgaask kernel parameter later you can replace ask with the right number which you'll find out from the menu that you should then see at boot
[11:58] <LjL> livecda or you can use a framebuffer driver but i don't remember the parameter for that
[11:58] <LjL> livecda i'm not sure vgawhatever will allow x though i don't think
[11:58] <LjL> livecda well no you can set it in bootgrubmenulst and make it stay you can set a framebuffer after boot by loading a framebuffer module and then using the fbset command
[11:58] <LjL> livecda if you can get your card's framebuffer driver to work
[11:58] <LjL> livecda oh check out also the svgatextmode package
[11:58] <LjL> fr rivera
[11:58] <LjL> raginghog if they were installed - as they should - out of the way of usr there shouldn't be a problem
[11:58] <LjL> raginghog that is in usrlocal or opt
[11:58] <LjL> raginghog then you should be fine - except of course that they might stop working if they require specific versions of stuff that changed in edgy
[11:58] <LjL> kingsqueak sure it works correctly on ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> i think gnome's and kde's hibernate routines call different things
[11:58] <LjL> well yeah won't hurt to try it i suppose
[11:58] <LjL> leafw sort of the opposite for me
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin it's php
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin have you set the php files as executable
[11:58] <LjL> neoncode sudo passwd username
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin have you done whatever the docs usrsharesomething says to do to enable php i think you need to make a symlink or two in etcapachemods-enabled
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin no i don't have php or apache installed right now
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin have you read
[11:58] <LjL> then do might help
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin just use the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin it's made for that and that way other users can see the error as well
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin you need to sudo that
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin by the way having a user named admin is probably not a good idea since there is an admin group as well
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin hard to do that
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin just change your password
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin we could guess
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin passwd
[11:58] <LjL> dm q
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin hm
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin just passwd from the user you want to change the password of
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell shadowmil about mp
[11:58] <LjL> shadowmil page has specific instructions for amarok
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin uhm did you have php installed in the past
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin try sudo apt-get install libapache-mod-php
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin then if apache works try sudo apt-get --purge remove libapache-mod-php
[11:58] <LjL> xxanaxx cat etcpasswd to see which username it was
[11:58] <LjL> xxanaxx it'll be the user with number most likely
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin try reloading apache again
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin ok then try sudo apt-get --purge remove libapache-mod-php
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin where is it asking that
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin dunno try sudo apt-get --reinstall install libapache-mod-php
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin after purging that php package that is and then restart apache again
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin hm wait just something what's the url you're using in firefox
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin if you type ls etcapachemods-enabled grep php do you get any output
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin ah yeah that's worth a try as well hitting refresh should do it though
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin ok hold on i'll try a quite apachephp installation on my own machine i have one on debian but that might be different
[11:58] <LjL> root xxanaxx you can't do that
[11:58] <LjL> xxanaxx by hacking a bit you can login as root directly it's explained on that page that's very very very much recommended against though
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin look when installing the php modules phpload and phpconf should be added to etcapachemods-enabled let's make a few more attempts to try and have that done automatically as it should
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin try sudo apt-get --purge remove php sudo apt-get --purge remove libapache-mod-php sudo etcinitdapache stop sudo apt-get install php sudo etcinitdapache start
[11:58] <LjL> rivera type join ubuntu-fr
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin well first make sure that the files are there do ls etcapachemods-enabled grep php again
[11:58] <LjL> xxanaxx no because there's no way for the system to know in advance whether a program will need root or not
[11:58] <LjL> xxanaxx but the most common programs like synaptic are already added to the menu with options that ask you for a root password when needed
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin yeah i hoped for output
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin you're on edgy anyway aren't you
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin hmm that might be it - i seem to recall but i'm not sure that dapper required manual creation of the links
[11:58] <LjL> what the
[11:58] <LjL> bah
[11:58] <LjL> info evince alecjw this is the standard one in gnome i think
[11:58] <LjL> kingsqueak just less etcresolvconf should be fine as well unless the permissions have been messed up with manually
[11:58] <LjL> midi probins
[11:58] <LjL> probins hardware midi is often a bit of a nuisance on linux unfortunately
[11:58] <LjL> with today's fast processors though timidity can be a reasonable fallback
[11:58] <LjL> yeah modprobe some random hopefully-midi-related modules until you hear something probins
[11:58] <LjL> probins hm try sudo modprobe snd-usb-audio
[11:58] <LjL> weird enough it works fine here even though i have no usb audio
[11:58] <LjL> probins you on edgy
[11:58] <LjL> probins well then perhaps it's not there or has a different name in dapper's kernel dunno try find lib grep usb grep audio
[11:58] <LjL> or something
[11:58] <LjL> hm then i do wonder why it doesn't load
[11:58] <LjL> probins what does uname -r say
[11:58] <LjL> blanky did you still have ccgcc- set when you typed make install
[11:58] <LjL> blanky i have no idea but i'd try again without it
[11:58] <LjL> blanky hold on i'll look at the tar
[11:58] <LjL> blanky since there's people have started using tell x about y less
[11:58] <LjL> blanky hehe
[11:58] <LjL> blanky let's sidestep the issue for a minute mostly because i don't have the kernel source installed and would rather not have it - if you type apt-cache show sl-modem you'll see there are already slmodem packages in ubuntu perhaps those will work better than the tarball
[11:58] <LjL> blanky yeah
[11:58] <LjL> blanky read the howto as well though it's a bit convoluted
[11:58] <LjL> modem
[11:58] <LjL> i know blanky
[11:58] <LjL> icepack i don't think vmware-player is opensource at all
[11:58] <LjL> blanky there is also sl-modem-modules
[11:58] <LjL> blanky actually no there isn't nevermind it was just shown by my shell's autocompletion for some reason of its own
[11:58] <LjL> blanky i guess you will yeah but then you probably need them for the tarball as well it's the same stuff after all
[11:58] <LjL> blanky yes probably yes
[11:58] <LjL> blanky you should have those already
[11:58] <LjL> blanky i'd get module-assistant and debhelper rather
[11:58] <LjL> icepack i don't know what that is but it's certainly not vmware player just look at the ridiculous size you can also try apt-get source vmware-player you'll see it's binary stuff
[11:58] <LjL> blanky i know someone should make a windows tool for that
[11:58] <LjL> blanky i don't think i'm sure the only one i'm not sure is libasound that's why i said yes probably yes but i'm sure
[11:58] <LjL> blanky yeah you're right
[11:58] <LjL> blanky though debhelper and module-assistant probably do need a few dependencies that you don't have
[11:58] <LjL> blanky by the way you may want to look at apt-zip too for getting packages on a non-networked box a bit more easily i've never used it though
[11:58] <LjL> pastebin saxofoner
[11:58] <LjL> saxofoner the idea is never paste on the channel like you just did
[11:58] <LjL> cntb doesn't look like
[11:58] <LjL> pradeep not surprising since saxofoner is not registered
[11:58] <LjL> saxofoner just use the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> register anyway saxofoner
[11:58] <LjL> vigofusion no but if you don't register you can't send private messages to user unless they explicitely set an option to accept them
[11:58] <LjL> vigofusion hehe - well registering one's nick is a good idea anyway
[11:58] <LjL> seamus your root is always in its own partition - what did you mean perhaps it's home that you have in its own partition
[11:58] <LjL> seamus ok now that makes sense backing up etc is probably a good idea it's only going to be megs or so uncompressed anyway though don't restore it - as you said just use it for reference you might also want to do a dpkg --get-selections and redirect it to some file to backup the list of packages that you currently have installed if you installed a lot of stuff that wasn't there by default and want to restore it
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell jrs about sound
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell allz about nvidiabeta
[11:58] <LjL> kyral the factoid's name is that though
[11:58] <LjL> allz if you want the new drivers yes
[11:58] <LjL> allz yes
[11:58] <LjL> allz then update and upgrade
[11:58] <LjL> allz either sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade or the equivalent in synaptic i guess
[11:58] <LjL> allz etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> allz
[11:58] <LjL> it tommy
[11:58] <LjL> allz well but amaranth's ones are even newer than that
[11:58] <LjL> allz i haven't the slightest idea why's it now you were saying one minute ago
[11:58] <LjL> build-essential dtygel
[11:58] <LjL> spokkerjones make but just install build-essential
[11:58] <LjL> allz ok - so you want why is amaranth's package bad since it's newer than that
[11:58] <LjL> manmadha why do that
[11:58] <LjL> manmadha you're aware that installing security updates can be important to the safety of your system
[11:58] <LjL> allz why does he whoever he is think it's not going to work
[11:58] <LjL> manmadha anyway the package is update-notifier
[11:58] <LjL> manmadha sudo apt-get remove update-notifier like any other package
[11:58] <LjL> or from synaptic or whatever
[11:58] <LjL> anyone
[11:58] <LjL> allz first update then upgrade if you did it correctly these packages should have been updated linux-restricted-modules---generic linux-restricted-modules-common you now have version of the nvidia drivers installed you probably need to reboot though
[11:58] <LjL> allz try restarting x first yeah but i'm guessing you'll have to reboot the computer since kernel modules have been updated
[11:58] <LjL> vigofusion i don't think java's open source just yet
[11:58] <LjL> allz apt-cache policy nvidia-glx look if the candidate and installed versions match and what they are
[11:58] <LjL> probins yes
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell afka about wine
[11:58] <LjL> allz try restarting x first yeah but i'm guessing you'll have to reboot the computer since kernel modules have been updated
[11:58] <LjL> allz yeah wrong paste
[11:58] <LjL> allz apt-cache policy nvidia-glx look if the candidate and installed versions match and what they are
[11:58] <LjL> allz it looks installed to me not sure why glxinfo says otherwise
[11:58] <LjL> allz i told you - i have no clue what the right page on the nvidia site is
[11:58] <LjL> allz look try typing nvidia-settings see what version it says there
[11:58] <LjL> lemurphant you can get realplayer packaged no need to download a bin
[11:58] <LjL> lemurphant i think it's in dapper-commercial
[11:58] <LjL> lemurphant
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco uh
[11:58] <LjL> lifepositive hi
[11:58] <LjL> cientificoloco ah - none of them
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb-admin i haven't the slightest idea
[11:58] <LjL> huxflux you shouldn't even have a root password to begin with - and what about using the passwd command since it's made for that
[11:58] <LjL> generic vardis vixus
[11:58] <LjL> vixus uh yes
[11:58] <LjL> vixus look i'm not sure what you're saying i is the architecture - clearly few of use actually have a processor since it's sort of old you know but the distribution works with newer ones well enough d
[11:58] <LjL> vixus if you have a -bit processor you may decide to install the -bit version but i think most people use the -bit version for compatibility purposes
[11:58] <LjL> vixus well that's not processor related where does it hang
[11:58] <LjL> vixus have you verified it
[11:58] <LjL> vixus try adding the acpioff andor the noapic kernel parameter
[11:58] <LjL> vixus disable acpi the former something i don't really know the latter they're known to enable booting on systems where ubuntu doesn't boot so they're just a standard suggestion we give when the cd fails to boot
[11:58] <LjL> windowsdrives slipttees
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes there is as i told you ident not nickname but you don't seem to even listen
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb type whois cmweb
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb i am there's probably a facility for changing that in your irc client at any rate i also told you that having admin as a username is probably a bad idea since there is an admin group already
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb nonsense you don't reinstall in order to change a username
[11:58] <LjL> yes bz
[11:58] <LjL> vixus i think you might be removing the other kernel parameters that are already there in the process of adding those acpi options now i don't really remember how the cd's boot loader works in that respect
[11:58] <LjL> vixus don't - the other options that are already present should stay
[11:58] <LjL> vixus there's acpioff and there's noapic not sure if there's also a noacpi
[11:58] <LjL> vixus
[11:58] <LjL> vixus and in general
[11:58] <LjL> and then there's kde facilities of course
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell cmweb about mount
[11:58] <LjL> hp what are you doing
[11:58] <LjL> hp skriv join ubuntu-se om du vill joina den svenska kanalen
[11:58] <LjL> vixus cool note however that some things such as flash wine win codecs etc are hardimpossible to use on -bit
[11:58] <LjL> ph i haven't the slightest idea most of the stuff that doesn't work is proprietary so i guess you mostly have to wait and hope -bit versions are released hack around
[11:58] <LjL> vixus during install dunno you can modify it later
[11:58] <LjL> petro unanswerable question sorry
[11:58] <LjL> info manpages-dev schuyler
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb what is the problem the script seems to have them mounted
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees parse error in your sentence
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb type ls media what is the output use pastebin if it's longer than one line
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb does ls mediahda andor ls mediasdf list anything like your files
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then you have them mounted open your file browser make it go to media and enjoy
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb i haven't a clue i use kde
[11:58] <LjL> mikeym don't know which mirror
[11:58] <LjL> mikeym yes packagesubuntucom definitely has problems
[11:58] <LjL> vixus wrong gb seems really really little
[11:58] <LjL> vixus i usually make gb but then i have a separate home partition
[11:58] <LjL> vixus what kind of setup are you thinking about
[11:58] <LjL> vixus yes but what kind of partitioning setup are you thinking of for linux
[11:58] <LjL> vixus well if you only keep one partition then just make it gigs if you want and home i agree with jowi on the approximate size for if you make an usr partition as well then dunno
[11:58] <LjL> vixus well if you fill up home and it's a separate partition your system won't go all crazy also if becomes corrupted there's a chance home doesnt and then reinstalls yeah
[11:58] <LjL> vixus anyway if you are not going to have a separate home partition then i really don't understand your rationale for thinking of making a tiny gb partition
[11:58] <LjL> vixus gb swap seems a bit excessive imho
[11:58] <LjL> vixus how much ram do you have make your swap at least as big as your ram
[11:58] <LjL> vixus i think little in excess of gb of ram will be fine make it gb or so
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell ineedhelp about wifi
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes i was going to tell you but you quit weren't you in the process of upgrading to edgy anyway
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then i suggest you want until you have edgy running
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb chances are that in edgy you won't have to do anything manually for php to work and on the other hand if you change stuff manually now while in dapper it could complicate matters later in edgy

[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy grub
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy and the fact that you don't have it installed by default or that you can't see it using apt-cacheapt-get means nothing good imho
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy pastebin your etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy how do you boot your system anyway if you have no grub
[11:58] <LjL> i think you're wasting your time anyway mc i skimmed through the packagesgz for -proposed and didn't notice eclipse
[11:58] <LjL> gnomefreak nope but i just had a look at the packagesgz for main
[11:58] <LjL> pupeno yes but it was down until some minutes ago
[11:58] <LjL> onofrio works
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy uhm i see some issues with that sourceslist but nothing that should prevent grub from showing up does sudo apt-get update give any errors
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy good though it's still extremely weird that it wasn't installed by default
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy i would make your sourceslist look like this anyway you didn't have security and updates enabled for universe and multiverse
[11:58] <LjL> falstius i think you probably have it already in your etcaptsourceslist just commented out
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy grub-install i think
[11:58] <LjL> falstius anyway it's empty and i think it'll be for a while
[11:58] <LjL> falstius yeah it's dapper-backports edgy-backports is from backports to edgy from feisty thus empty dapper-backports shouldn't be empty i think
[11:58] <LjL> falstius sfromfor
[11:58] <LjL> sky if it's a windows xp machine or xp sp or something i think it's quite normal they refuse pings by default
[11:58] <LjL> falstius no i don't think there will ever be a firefox package for dapper
[11:58] <LjL> sky i'm not sure whether it's since sp or what i know i can't ping my xp machines
[11:58] <LjL> sky well the xp built-in firewall
[11:58] <LjL> the default setting in a freshly installed and updated windows xp installation has the built-in firewall configured such that the computer does not answer icmp echo request also called pings
[11:58] <LjL> jean the files are in varcacheaptarchives
[11:58] <LjL> grub ironfroggy i don't know might find something here
[11:58] <LjL> jean yes
[11:58] <LjL> jean that is for backing up your downloaded packages which i think is what you asked then of course you may want to backup more than that
[11:58] <LjL> jean should work yes
[11:58] <LjL> jean not when i last tried that
[11:58] <LjL> jean just make sure when you restore the files that they get the right permissions they need to be owned by rootroot and be urwgror
[11:58] <LjL> restricted user-land

[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny this is linux there is no directd
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny opengl perhaps
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny no honestly i don't is that a native linux or a windows game run under emulation
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny then you should just need an accelerated driver for your video card which supports hardware acceleration with opengl
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees sudo mount -t hfsplus devwhatever mediawhatever
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny what card
[11:58] <LjL> nvidia bunnythebunny
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny follow the howto
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny you see an nvidia logo when you start
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees no writer doesn't mean a thing to me
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees you mean with write access
[11:58] <LjL> bunnythebunny then you have hardware acceleration for what i know
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees have you used options userautofileumaskdirumask
[11:58] <LjL> automatix newpz
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees is the homemac directory itself rw for the user you need
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees hmm is the partition mounted right now
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees unmount it and see what the permissions are anyway i'm guessing that ubuntu is respecting your mac's permissions - ie it allows access to the users that macos allows access to but you don't have the same users
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees read especially the second posting on the second page
[11:58] <LjL> slipttees hmm i think you could try adding these mount options as well uidgid
[11:58] <LjL> zackr no it wouldn't be helpful there are nearly people here and if everybody said no or i don't know to every question that gets asked it would be a hell
[11:58] <LjL> beryl misterroboto
[11:58] <LjL> misterroboto i don't know but some of the people in ubuntu-xgl probably have
[11:58] <LjL> misterroboto not the point - ubuntu-xgl is the channel for xgl aiglx compiz and beryl questions the name just comes from the fact that xgl came first
[11:58] <LjL> misterroboto so it's the channel you should care about if you're interested in either xgl aiglx compiz or beryl
[11:58] <LjL> klamsd either you don't or you fetch it and all its various dependencies manually
[11:58] <LjL> info apt-zip klamsd this might come useful as well
[11:58] <LjL> but you need the internet to get it itself
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy i don't know about grub but honestly my advice is reinstall that you didn't have grub installed in the first place means that something was seriously messed up during installation
[11:58] <LjL> ironfroggy which cd did you use by the way out of curiosity
[11:58] <LjL> jean hm not sure what you mean can you make a specific example there is a cache that you can clean but i'm not sure it's what you're talking about
[11:58] <LjL> jean man apt-get look at the clean and autoclean commands
[11:58] <LjL> wifi rick
[11:58] <LjL> jean it removes them all
[11:58] <LjL> jean autoclean removes packages that aren't useful anymore obsoleted etc but there's no option that i know of that only removes uninstalled packages
[11:58] <LjL> tohellwithga it's perfectly possible but you'll just purge the metapackage not the dependent packages and i doubt you'd want to purge ubuntu-desktop anyway

[11:58] <LjL> ubd what was your question given i only joined while the discussion was already in progress
[11:58] <LjL> ubd did you verify the cd
[11:58] <LjL> ubd then it might be that your hd is broken no
[11:58] <LjL> ubd how do you know it's not broken
[11:58] <LjL> ubd doesn't mean a thing do you have smart enabled in the bios
[11:58] <LjL> ubd then boot from the live cd but don't start the installer - install the smartmontools package instead and then run sudo smartctl -a devhda assuming hda is your drive
[11:58] <LjL> info smartmontools ubd
[11:58] <LjL> ubd smart in the bios doesn't report all possible problems
[11:58] <LjL> ubd and you don't have any suspect ie lower than or than values for things like reallocated sectors count or similar
[11:58] <LjL> ubd did you select quick or full format in the cd installer assuming there's such an option i don't quite remember
[11:58] <LjL> ubd i'd try formatting manually using mkfs -c -v and seeing if it reports any problem
[11:58] <LjL> ubd with the -c option
[11:58] <LjL> ubd -c checks for bad blocks vanilla mkfs doesn't check of anything

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell someperson about packages someperson you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> someperson because dapper is lts so they chose to ship that instead
[11:58] <LjL> snype no it's not
[11:58] <LjL> edgy
[11:58] <LjL> someperson do you pay by time
[11:58] <LjL> someperson then why don't you just download it it'll take long but if it's for free
[11:58] <LjL> someperson what about during the night
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb that's an ip address not a port
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then what on earth makes you ask whether is a good low port an ip address isn't good and it makes no sense to call it low
[11:58] <LjL> harry stop spamming the channel as i see you've been doing and no swearing thank you
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell harry about register harry you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb why do you need to
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then your installation has a problem and as for the sudoing everything thing just type sudo -i and you'll be root permanently
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb chown rootroot varrunsudo from recovery mode to restore that
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb we're hard because you're making the wrong questions if you get an error say i get this error don't jump to some conclusions of your own and decide that somehow you need to enable the root account
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb i said from recovery mode
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb when you boot you get a menu for some seconds right or if you don't just press esc a couple of time between the bios and the boot process and you will
[11:58] <LjL> select recovery mode there
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb and of course the fact that varrunsudo has the wrong permissions means you did something as root that you shouldn't even have thought about doing
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb all you did that's crazy of course you will break you freaking system by chowning var
[11:58] <LjL> blah i give up
[11:58] <LjL> pity cmweb will have to wait to know that chowning varrunsudo will not fix it if he chowned -r var
[11:58] <LjL> iter yeah not for long if he keeps that attitude
[11:58] <LjL> exploit iter
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb sudo etcinitdapache start unless you chowned it to godknowswhat
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb it should start automatically when you boot
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb ps aux grep apache to see if it's running
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then you have it running
[11:58] <LjL> tvout
[11:58] <LjL> ozoneco nope you should be fine
[11:58] <LjL> you're welcome
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell thegrinch about ntfs thegrinch you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell paradox-ubuntu about ntfs paradox-ubuntu you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> khamael i have usrbinssh-agent usrbindbus-launch --exit-with-session usrbinstartkde
[11:58] <LjL> kuds invalid command anyway
[11:58] <LjL> soundray i often use that kind of half-broken hds for mass storage of unimportant stuff like to download the ubuntu cds to hm wait that doesn't sound good
[11:58] <LjL> soundray also depends how it's broken i just joined so i didn't follow this but if for instance you have bad blocks concentrated at the endbeginning of the drive it's often relatively safe hey safe from the unimportant data point of view to just create one partition that's far from those blocks
[11:58] <LjL> gordonjcp
[11:58] <LjL> soundray have you googled that asking 'cause the first hits seem to hint that it might not be a drive problem
[11:58] <LjL> gordonjcp that link describes your problem i think
[11:58] <LjL> soundray well i'm pretty sure it can be a symptom of broken drive as well anyway what does smart have to say
[11:58] <LjL> gordonjcp true it doesn't bring you to the right paragraph just and click on known issues
[11:58] <LjL> soundray meaning it says healthy or meaning the actual values from a smartctl -a are all way above the limit
[11:58] <LjL> soundray you can also smartctl -t short or longer versions of it if you want to wait and see if you get any warnings in the log smartctl -l error and smartctl -l selftest
[11:58] <LjL> tjoels statistics of what kind
[11:58] <LjL> soundray you can install it it's in main
[11:58] <LjL> tjoels df
[11:58] <LjL> info megahal atmiku why compile
[11:58] <LjL> indeed
[11:58] <LjL> tjoels just type df
[11:58] <LjL> atmiku uhm depends how it's implemented i guess
[11:58] <LjL> tjoels i'm not a gnome user there's baobab for drive usage statistics though i'm sure it's overkill for what you asked
[11:58] <LjL> atmiku if it just uses the megahal executable once it's compiled then i don't see why it shouldn't work
[11:58] <LjL> it fvlgnn
[11:58] <LjL> laosboyme no
[11:58] <LjL> pm laosboyme
[11:58] <LjL> laosboyme you receive security updates because security bugs have been found i'd assume
[11:58] <LjL> that's why security updates exist
[11:58] <LjL> laosboyme no
[11:58] <LjL> laosboyme i'm quite confident you'll never get it in dapper
[11:58] <LjL> firefox
[11:58] <LjL> noika targz files are simply archives like zip files
[11:58] <LjL> laosboyme if by desktop manager you mean desktop environment i guess gnome
[11:58] <LjL> pm laosboyme
[11:58] <LjL> ferentes
[11:58] <LjL> soundray it really depends on your drive what values are shown and what they mean but most values should be either or look at those that aren't
[11:58] <LjL> soundray even if some aren't that doesn't mean much - it depends on which values they are if the limit is they're probably not too important but if they're very close to well - if the limit is not and you're somewhat close to the limit that could be an issue
[11:58] <LjL> soundray or in other words if you want my opinion pastebin the output but i'm far from a smart guru as well
[11:58] <LjL> soundray yes but that just means that no value has reached the limit threshold yet still a value that's too low can indicate trouble even if it hasn't passed the limit
[11:58] <LjL> soundray that's basically just the same thing that your bios does at boot well if you've selected that option which you should useful sometimes but not exceptionally meaningful
[11:58] <LjL> trappist i've got quite a few of those
[11:58] <LjL> well to start with you have some reallocated sectors i see
[11:58] <LjL> hm and offlineuncorrectable as well doesn't sound good imho
[11:58] <LjL> soundray yes and iirc offlineuncorrectable means it hasn't managed to restore some of the sectors using the crc
[11:58] <LjL> currentpendingsector is also related
[11:58] <LjL> all in all soundray i'd say your drive is in trouble
[11:58] <LjL> what bothers me the most is that i have udmacrcerrorcount always fluctuating and reaching zero
[11:58] <LjL> i'm unsure that's very meaningful though since my drive is reported as unrecognized by smartmontools so it could be giving attributes the wrong labels
[11:58] <LjL> soundray your drive's attribute list looks very similar if not identical to mine by the way is it a maxtor and which one smartctl -i
[11:58] <LjL> soundray plus as well here but maxtor lp
[11:58] <LjL> soundray good luck
[11:58] <LjL> no
[11:58] <LjL> se
[11:58] <LjL> fraiddo ubuntu-desktop possibly
[11:58] <LjL> duck
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos gparted
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos if you want to mount it yes
[11:58] <LjL> mount or perhaps you can do it graphically
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos well i can only trust the bot since i'm not a gnome user
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck that's ugly but it doesn't mean you're not getting the right packages
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck pastebin your etcaptsourceslist - but i don't think
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck remove edgy-proposed from the repository list
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck also edgy-backports might give you unstable packages but not right now since it's empty and will be for a while
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos i'd guess so but then again i don't use gnome
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck however now you'll have those proposed updates already installed
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck no at least not easily
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck you can remove them and reinstall them but i have a feeling most of them are quite core packages like x-common and such so you'd be left with a half-broken system if you remove them
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos yes they're packages that are proposed for addition to -updates but haven't landed there yet
[11:58] <LjL> schierbeck but you're right if you wait they should end up in -updates or -security eventually
[11:58] <LjL> protocol it's in dapper-commercial
[11:58] <LjL> opera poromenos
[11:58] <LjL> no browser wars please
[11:58] <LjL> vigofuse it's another distribution it uses some parts of ubuntu a bit like ubuntu uses parts of debian
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos which invariably end up in wars
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos they're new versions of packages from the next experimental ubuntu version they're made on request of users though requests can be denied mostly only packages that are easy and troublesome to port are ported
[11:58] <LjL> backports
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos shrug depends on you they're not guaranteed to work or be stable
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos the new official backports currently do not receive testing unlike the old unofficial backports the stability of the packages should be the same as that of the ubuntu unstable distribution currently feisty fawn
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos right now edgy's backports is empty anyway
[11:58] <LjL> poromenos no since feisty is in such an early stage
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell mpguy about tvout mpguy you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> mpguy i haven't the slightest idea
[11:58] <LjL> lamvda aren't img simply renamed iso files
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell lamvda about burn lamvda you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell active about beryl active you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> kmaynard yes i do
[11:58] <LjL> crescendo we have java already for that matter it's in multiverse
[11:58] <LjL> crescendo and we have unofficial flash packages
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya perhaps add a command to that effect to etcrclocal
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell nolimitsoya about boot nolimitsoya you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> zidoo the standard linux kernel requires hardware memory protection
[11:58] <LjL> zidoo you'd have to run the entire os under emulation
[11:58] <LjL> somehow i guessed that
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya etcrclocal doesn't exist weird it should if not just try creating it
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya you on edgy
[11:58] <LjL> ntfs euphidime have you followed this
[11:58] <LjL> euphidime it has tips for correctly displaying international charsets
[11:58] <LjL> euphidime unmount and remount the partition
[11:58] <LjL> trappist why
[11:58] <LjL> hi
[11:58] <LjL> trappist why don't you want kernel preemption on a server
[11:58] <LjL> destiny how did you install them
[11:58] <LjL> destiny so they weren't deb's i assume
[11:58] <LjL> destiny can't you just let it upgrade them if you did it right they should end up in different places anyway
[11:58] <LjL> destiny you probably want to put those packages on hold i don't remember how though
[11:58] <LjL> it worms
[11:58] <LjL> trappist cat bootconfig---generic grep preempt i guess
[11:58] <LjL> worms not here
[11:58] <LjL> trappist same here as to what exactly that means
[11:58] <LjL> trappist blah you may or may not find this thread interesting -
[11:58] <LjL> boink wow that's useful
[11:58] <LjL> info unrar gasten
[11:58] <LjL> boink 'cept that's for compressing not for extracting
[11:58] <LjL> boink yes the point is that he was already pointed to the appropriate page and then later i did info unrar so no need to apt-cache much
[11:58] <LjL> mtlife if you want to see what packages where installedremoved try varlogdpkglog
[11:58] <LjL> and varlogboot for the terse messages that you'd get if you had them enabled in the splash screen
[11:58] <LjL> it pango
[11:58] <LjL> volumeid jinkguns
[11:58] <LjL> linuxvampire openoffice
[11:58] <LjL> linuxvampire that's definitely too little for most purposes tried apt-get clean
[11:58] <LjL> linuxvampire - look at finding packages to remove
[11:58] <LjL> globe
[11:58] <LjL> mouarf
[11:58] <LjL> players stoft
[11:58] <LjL> graft dnite yes if you're on edgy apt-get autoremove will do the trick on dapper you can use aptitude but you have to use it when installing packages as well for the automatic removal to work or things like deborphan and debfoster not quite automatic
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb you've been told already what's it that you need the root user for
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes you were here anyway what do you need it for
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb why on earth would you need to enable root to change a mysql password
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell linuxfanstar about automatix linuxfanstar you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell indygunfreak about utomatix indygunfreak you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> linuxfanstar no you shouldn't install automatix at all
[11:58] <LjL> pinkfloyd probably it's a good idea if you have that an alias for rm imho
[11:58] <LjL> pinkfloyd an alias type help alias in a shell
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell cmweb about sudo cmweb you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> pinkfloyd if you type alias rmrm -i then when you later type rm what will really be executed is rm -i
[11:58] <LjL> pinkfloyd it's neither right nor wrong type man rm to know what it does
[11:58] <LjL> caps pgtturbo
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb how did you install mysql
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb type sudo etcinitdmysql restart do you get errors
[11:58] <LjL> sycho well you need to install it first
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb unless you messed up with the mysql config files i suspect that it's still a problem with your chowning of var what command did you execute exacttly
[11:58] <LjL> kitche yesterday cmweb chowned var and as a result couldn't run sudo anymore which was yesterday's reason for asking how to enable root
[11:58] <LjL> sycho that's because it's --config with two dashes
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb no i mean what command did you type to chown var
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb no that's probably how you restored it perhaps not fully but you broke it before by changing the ownership to your own user
[11:58] <LjL> savvas don't give suggestions
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb possibly but you'll just waste your time if after you reinstall you start again messing with ownerships root and all those things
[11:58] <LjL> works for me
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb can you just answer my question anyway - what command did you initially use to change var's ownership so that you broke sudo
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb and you always do something completely idiotic
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb why not change the ownership of varwww instead every though not don't even do that you just need to be a member of www-data that's all
[11:58] <LjL> chowning var is just stupid
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb so now what command exactly did you use to chown it
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb finally why did it take minutes
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb ok so your var directory is completely screwed up
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes or you could change the permissions for all the various directories inside var manually a daunting task imho
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb adduser your-user-name www-data just like you make any user a member of any group
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb if i guessed correctly you're trying to set up a web hosting service given that you apparently don't even have the slightest idea about any kind of security matters on unix are you sure that's a good idea
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb if you expose your server on the internet by giving a hosting service and you get hacked into and you will get hacked into and you end up hosting illegal contents or doing other illegal things without knowing because you've been hacked you may end up in trouble just saying
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb that's not the point the point is that you're clearly quite clueless about unix and unix security -- which is fine everybody's got to learn but you shouldn't be setting up a public web host in those conditions i can guarantee you that you'll be hacked into
[11:58] <LjL> compengi yeah meaning i have it set up on my server i set it up some two years ago and never touched it again though
[11:58] <LjL> iwkse they've got nothing to do with each other ubuntu-xgl for support
[11:58] <LjL> iwkse with either xgl or aiglx
[11:58] <LjL> iwkse and you use either compiz or beryl as a window manager
[11:58] <LjL> iwkse i think with ati you're stuck with xgl
[11:58] <LjL> iwkse anyway join ubuntu-xgl - that's the channel for that stuff even if nobody's hanging around just read the topic there are complete howto's
[11:58] <LjL> iwkse no 'cause of some missing hardware acceleration feature
[11:58] <LjL> weby under kde kontact
[11:58] <LjL> info sylpheed-claws-gtk-feeds-reader weby sylpheed-claws being a mail client
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns volumeid didn't help
[11:58] <LjL> tannerld launch them from the terminal and see what the error is
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns i don't know it just came from an apt search if that fails what i'd do is use hd devwhatever or some more advanced hex viewereditor perhaps and see if there's some string that can give you a clue about the filesystem
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns anyway the usage should simply be sudo volid devblah
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell jovans about away jovans you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns you have no idea what sort of computer that drive was being used in
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns that's a drive - filesystems resides on partitions on a drive so devsdb or similar
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns if there's no partition table well tough luck
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns look at the partitions type sfdisk --list devsdb
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns then it was a mac drive i guess
[11:58] <LjL> jinkguns perhaps this one will work as well when you mount the partition and not attempt to mount the drive itself
[11:58] <LjL> well apparently this one was partitioned
[11:58] <LjL> uhm no p
[11:58] <LjL> tom or just xdpyinfo grep bitsperpixel
[11:58] <LjL> itrebal why gtk isn't it wxgtk perhaps that you want since that one is a version
[11:58] <LjL> even
[11:58] <LjL> itrebal sudo apt-get install libgtk-dev
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell shingalated about beryl shingalated you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> unfo tekton well we do have vmware player packages
[11:58] <LjL> info vmware-player unfo
[11:58] <LjL> info vmware-player tekton i just said
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dope about themes dope you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> unfo tekton anyway while the player has some limitation i always found it quite adequate to my own needs
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell poquedoraqu about windows poquedoraqu you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> tekton it definitely should
[11:58] <LjL> tekton you just need a way to create a virtual machine first but you can do that at
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu like we can't be expected to know what a haldll or a system directory is
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu so anyway you have the ubuntu cd but you can't boot it because you can only boot from floppies is that it
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu well what command prompt should you have
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu this will allow you to boot the ubuntu cd using a floppy disk
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu so you only have network
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu then netboot it is but you need another computer
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu what about a usb key
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu doesn't matter you can still boot from a floppy
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu use to boot from a floppy and then follow the installing from usb howto for the rest
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu or use netinstall but somehow i think that's harder
[11:58] <LjL> never messed with fonts manually iter
[11:58] <LjL> fonts
[11:58] <LjL> odin on a laptop
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu this is the usb howto - i guess you just need to skip the parts about making it bootable and use the smart boot manager on a floppy instead
[11:58] <LjL> poquedoraqu oh there's also this one that tells you how to boot from usb when usb is not bootable using a cd however but i guess it would work with a floppy as well with little changes but i'd try the smart boot manager route first
[11:58] <LjL> totall dpkg --get-selections
[11:58] <LjL> mwe that one renders in a nasty way though namely it cuts out long package names
[11:58] <LjL> soundray boo
[11:58] <LjL> soundray recovery took a while didn't it p
[11:58] <LjL> soundray i was going to tell you some hours ago since the drive is under warranty perhaps you want to make sure that some smart parameter is actually below the threshold so they'll have no excuses
[11:58] <LjL> bonnie soundray or perhaps just a few runs of shred or some other stress-testing software
[11:58] <LjL> soundray hm well no matter what the bot says that package is in main
[11:58] <LjL> soundray it isn't
[11:58] <LjL> heh
[11:58] <LjL> soundray well seveas just reminded me that there are no open bugs for his bots right now time to change that
[11:58] <LjL> language ubunta
[11:58] <LjL> es gay
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb good but i'm not always around what's important is that you consult someone - and that you make the right questions ie what you need not what you think you need
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb not necessarily ubuntu comes with almost no ports open for listening by default so unless you install services such as a web server firewalling rules are not needed
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb but then if you do install a service and want it to be publicly accessible you don't want to firewall that service either
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb nothing special just follow standard procedures for installing and setting up services ie apt-get and read the man and if they fail ask don't start using random root commands such as chmod and chown do frequent security updates and learn how the unix permissions system works
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell cmweb about permissions cmweb you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb for example - the problem you had earlier that brought you to chown var by default varwww has www-data as the group group for a file means that any user who is part of the group can do some operations on the file read write and execute depending on what group permissions are set so if you want to modify files in varwww you should ask your administrator in this case yourself to make you a member of the www-data group
[11:58] <LjL> the administrator does it by doing adduser you www-data
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb type groups as your user you'll see you're already a member of several groups - for instance admin which gives you the right to use sudo audio which allows you to use your soundcard
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb the system's security is based on permissions yes
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb there is one special user which has id known as superuser or root who can always do anything to the system - and as such should really really know what he's doing
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb other users can do things on the system depending on what permissions have been set on files since almost everything on unix is a file permissions regulate just about everything
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb every file can be marked as readable r writable w and executable x for each file these three permissions are assigned to three different classes of users the owner of the file the group of the file and the others you use the command chown to change the owner and the group and chmod to change the specific permissions for each of them
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb but whenever you're tempted to use those command ask yourself first is it the right way does changing these permissions create site-effects does it give somebody more privileges than they should have
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb and generally speaking you should never change the permissions of anything outside your home directory anyway var is a bit of an exception since you can put files manually there for example in varwww but still much care should be taken
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes and about restores - there is no such thing most commands are just executed without a way of rolling back so think thrice always
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb sure - are you on edgy now
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell pianoboy about midi pianoboy you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb that's ok dapper will be fine just slightly different
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb if you can't get php to work automatically i should be able to tell you what to do
[11:58] <LjL> recon basename if often used for that but you have to specify which extension
[11:58] <LjL> recon a stupid shell command could be echo whateverfilename rev cut -f rev
[11:58] <LjL> recon well no actually that does the opposite -
[11:58] <LjL> recon basename should be fine for that
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb update it compared to what
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb source-o-matic perhaps but it's not on ubuntucom but just pastebin your etcaptsourceslist and let me see if it looks decent
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb here i have enabled universe and multiverse and their respective updates and security repositories
[11:58] <LjL> mirak no
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb that looks fine as well
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb whichever the one from easysource is probably a bit more tidy
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb they really are the same anyway
[11:58] <LjL> mirak edgy is considered stable if it's that broken there's something wrong with edgy not with the release system
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb use gksudo gedit etcaptsourceslist
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb you should use gksudo not sudo for graphical programs
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb now by the way since you're on dapper you might want to consider using aptitude rather than apt-get that way when you remove a package it'll know which other packages are not needed anymore orphaned dependencies and remove them as well this is built-in in edgy's apt-get but not in dapper's
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb the syntax to use aptitude is basically the same as for apt-get aptitude update aptitude dist-upgrade aptitude install aptitude remove aptitude purge this one's different aptitude reinstall
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell tekton about build-essential tekton you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> rsavu don't think so
[11:58] <LjL> mirak shrug i bet they've thought about that when they decided the releasing scheme - after all it all came from debian which does come in three flavors
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb synaptic will behave like apt-get in that respect ie not remove unused dependencies
[11:58] <LjL> nukez probably editing the wrong file it's etcxxorgconf - and case matters
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell phluffy about apt-get phluffy you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb either apt-cache search or aptitude search - both have advantages i use apt-cache normally
[11:58] <LjL> carcase don't spam like that thanks
[11:58] <LjL> xamox recovery mode press esc before grub starts booting
[11:58] <LjL> xamox then remove gdm or disable it
[11:58] <LjL> xamox what wastrel said
[11:58] <LjL> attitude glz
[11:58] <LjL> glz he's probably misunderstood your question but he said something relatively innocuous while describing what it would do precisely -- if you treat people like that you'll end up with no help or banned
[11:58] <LjL> eugman i can't see many
[11:58] <LjL> or any
[11:58] <LjL> eugman actually one of the things sudo is handy for is facilitating work on single-user machines
[11:58] <LjL> stalefries use a server password if you can that's the easiest way to auto-identify
[11:58] <LjL> stalefries it's the same password as your nickserv password
[11:58] <LjL> stalefries logging in to the server with your nickserv password will have the same effect as identifying
[11:58] <LjL> stalefries
[11:58] <LjL> automatix britt
[11:58] <LjL> best
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell jrib about hidden jrib you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell johnny about backup johnny you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> jrib afaik it's used in kubuntu and not in ubuntu by default but ubuntu ie gnome also supports it and if you install kubuntu-desktop on an ubuntu installation you'll get your files hidden even in gnome
[11:58] <LjL> sethk that's dot files but that's not what we're talking about
[11:58] <LjL> sethk yeah we're talking about the file hidden which itself is a dot file but that's not the point
[11:58] <LjL> hidden sethk
[11:58] <LjL> sethk basically hidden is a plaintext list of filesdirectories well normally directories that should not be shown in gui file browsers by default in kubuntu the only two directories that are not listed there are media and home
[11:58] <LjL> sethk whether it's ubuntu-specific or not i didn't know but i do know that it's not used by default in dapper or in ubuntu edgy while it's used in kubuntu edgy
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell shaneperu about paste shaneperu you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> sethk well and straight gnome as well it appears since gnome dialogs and i suppose nautilus respect that too
[11:58] <LjL> automatix
[11:58] <LjL> phxheat ask in automatix or stop the installation if you can guess not
[11:58] <LjL> phxheat i don't know ask in automatix
[11:58] <LjL> phxheat did you mention that you were in ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> phxheat anyway i suggest reinstalling without automatix
[11:58] <LjL> works for me indygunfreak
[11:58] <LjL> indygunfreak if it floats your boat - just don't recommend it here
[11:58] <LjL> or follow the instructions on the restrictedformats page the kde ones aren't that hard
[11:58] <LjL> i guess the gnome ones can't be so terrible either
[11:58] <LjL> indygunfreak the main problem is that you can't track problems it messes with sourceslist install stuff weirdly and you have no real logs of what it did to file bug reports you need a gmail account their repositories' directories are forbidden it's broken many a system
[11:58] <LjL> best
[11:58] <LjL> you just asked what's the best pp program anyway make your own opinion - try them
[11:58] <LjL> pp
[11:58] <LjL> i'd also mention amule dcgui and gift
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell disabledduck about frostwire disabledduck you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> kitche regexp autoreplaces
[11:58] <LjL> kitche i just type factoid someone with a real exclamation mark of course

[11:58] <LjL> info zenity cmweb
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb i don't really know i'm not going to install it because it requires too many gnome libraries that i don't have look at its man page no
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb i'm reading the manpage on the web - looks pretty simple
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb at the end of the manpage there are complete examples as well
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb don't need an extension
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb sometimes they're given an sh extension but that's entirely optional actually most of the times extensions are entirely optional in unix
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb what you do need is to make them executable and put binsh as the first line
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb what is notify
[11:58] <LjL> patrickking make them a member of group admin
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb oh well no you need to type notify to run it unless you put it in a directory that's in your path
[11:58] <LjL> patrickking adduser username admin
[11:58] <LjL> quik no need sudoers is already setup to give admin privileges to every member of admin
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb yes but no - i wasn't talking about the path of the file but about the path variable
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb the reason why you can just type things like say apt-get reboot etc just random examples is that those commands are found in directories that are listed in your path
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb type echo path you'll see which directories are part of your standard search path
[11:58] <LjL> patrickking uh of course you need to use sudo
[11:58] <LjL> patrickking that's what you asked - adding a user to the sudo list ie the list of people who can use sudo
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb probably
[11:58] <LjL> quik if you want to execute them by default yes - use update-rcd
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb it's that i don't have zenity
[11:58] <LjL> vigofusion only the first user created is an admin by default
[11:58] <LjL> quik might mean many things scripts in etcinitd are supposed to give you some output like starting xyz ok so if you get no output there probably is something wrong which script is that
[11:58] <LjL> quik on edgy
[11:58] <LjL> quik the lighttpd package is broken apparently i can't get it to install without failing to launch the startup script
[11:58] <LjL> quik wait nevermind that was my fault
[11:58] <LjL> quik it will be installed automatically since i'm not installed from source
[11:58] <LjL> quik my problem was simply that i had apache running
[11:58] <LjL> quik now the initd script works fine here why can't you just install lighttpd from the repositories
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb are you sure you really executed the command mv tmpno-ipconf usrlocaletcno-ipconf it doesn't seem like it was executed
[11:58] <LjL> quik well by installing it from the repos it seems to work fine here the initd script works and i get to a welcome page if i type
[11:58] <LjL> quik make uninstall from the source directory if the makefile supports that
[11:58] <LjL> quik you could also consider using checkinstall when installing stuff compiled from source too late now though
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell quik about checkinstall quik you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb well try typing it manually now
[11:58] <LjL> es murgi
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell k about dvd k you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> quik you sure you're typing it from the source directory ie the directory where the makefile resides
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb
[11:58] <LjL> quik then tough luck well try using checkinstall now run a sudo checkinstall has the same effect of sudo make install except it uses checkinstall
[11:58] <LjL> quik do not interrupt it for any reason and when it's finished installing you should hopefully be able to uninstall though i'm not entirely sure since the files are already there by now
[11:58] <LjL> quik wait a minute you did use make install when first installing lighttpd didn't you
[11:58] <LjL> quik yeah as in yes i did
[11:58] <LjL> quik probably you need to be in the directory where you built it
[11:58] <LjL> quik that is the directory that you can run configure from
[11:58] <LjL> cmwe sure stuff in usrlocal should normally belong to root
[11:58] <LjL> traffic

[11:58] <LjL> javajake express them in lowercase
[11:58] <LjL> javajake because it is annoying just like we don't allow people spamming by repeating something multiple times - it's annoying it concentrates attention on them
[11:58] <LjL> javajake does it matter and what is the admin
[11:58] <LjL> javajake i didn't decide that rule
[11:58] <LjL> javajake you can't

[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then just type find -iname cmweb-adminconf

[11:58] <LjL> dyzlex well you said you're doing it in photoshop
[11:58] <LjL> dyzlex anyway try typing who channelname then
[11:58] <LjL> uksprout no need to download them manually you can get them automatically from the repositories

[11:58] <LjL> generic thebelgain
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell uksprout about nvidia uksprout you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> thebelgain try sudo apt-get install linux- then
[11:58] <LjL> thebelgain don't think so but removing the other kernel should or just use grub-set-default
[11:58] <LjL> kyawzin ubuntu-desktop not ubuntu desktop
[11:58] <LjL> kyawzin anyway run sudo apt-get update as well
[11:58] <LjL> anyone

[11:58] <LjL> cmweb the folder
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb restart the bot
[11:58] <LjL> uksprout got no idea i don't have tv-out
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb then type load pluginname
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb in a query with the bot
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb there is a supybot channel by the way
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb no i said it just to give my fingers some movement
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell f about software f you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid with a text editor
[11:58] <LjL> or man rename even
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid rename can do that man rename
[11:58] <LjL> adx grep -r some-regexp pathtoyourfiles
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid no not really it can take any regular expression
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid there is man regex and man sed are there also
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid rename sdscpngdsc might work though no guarantees - test it in a backup directory first
[11:58] <LjL> msg the bot protolnx
[11:58] <LjL> jramsey probably
[11:58] <LjL> mat i never used beryl and ubuntu-xgl is the channel for berylcompizxglaiglx help
[11:58] <LjL> do i look like an information point
[11:58] <LjL> sound
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid nice
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid oh right i forgot the png thing i was just trying a random extension
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid uhm you still want to make a script
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid you don't need to rename it you need to put binsh on the first line and to chmod x
[11:58] <LjL> surfnkid generally speaking if the first line of a file we call it a begins with followed by a filename call this b the shell tries to run b as a command passing a as an argument so for shell scripts you want b to be a shell binsh
[11:58] <LjL> graham you were already told to use the pastebin for long pastes you're on mute for minutes now
[11:58] <LjL> lucin it's not like he wasn't warned
[11:58] <LjL> hikenboot that's correct but it's not a problem of packaging formats rpms tend to not work andor break things even after you convert them with alien
[11:58] <LjL> hikenboot you shouldn't use debian packages because they normally require different versions of dependencies etc
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell qwell about kernel qwell you have a private message from ubotu

[11:58] <LjL> zircx you can
[11:58] <LjL> zircx is just one way to create virtual machines for vmware
[11:58] <LjL> lovloss no it's because of patents and it's not linux it's ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> paradox mkdir
[11:58] <LjL> gertoly yes i guess most of them today do though everybody's scared of being sued
[11:58] <LjL> lovloss no linux is just a kernel it doesn't concern itself in the least with what is distributed and in which repositories etc
[11:58] <LjL> ht can't you use dpkg --get-selections and grep
[11:58] <LjL> ht like dpkg --get-selections grep somepackagename
[11:58] <LjL> anyway i'm sure dpkg has some option for that
[11:58] <LjL> ht iwkse stop now
[11:58] <LjL> resolve your personal issues in a query please
[11:58] <LjL> this is not the place for that
[11:58] <LjL> gunfus i'm not sure honestly hold on
[11:58] <LjL> gunfus have you installed build-essential yet the library you need seems to be in there
[11:58] <LjL> gunfus it's the most important thing that it says
[11:58] <LjL> heh not always
[11:58] <LjL> gunfus np
[11:58] <LjL> zircx then try compiling qemu from scratch and getting the kqemu module to work intstead
[11:58] <LjL> zircx i was sarcastic
[11:58] <LjL> zircx it's slow because it emulates the cpu while vmware uses it natively

[11:58] <LjL> automatix keyseir
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir by the way the browser is called epiphany-browser epiphany is a game
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir it can be - you have the automatix repo in your sourceslist so it can do interesting new things every time you update your system
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir what's your version of libc apt-cache policy libc
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir that's the right version anyway this means that apt-cache policy works without segfaulting right have you found other programs that segfault besides apt-get and firefox
[11:58] <LjL> gimmulf ca
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir nah don't remove it just yet that won't fix it anyway
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir rather try running firefox and apt-get under gdb and pastebin what happens
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir yes then when at the gdb prompt type run and run install somepackage respectively
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir a word of warning though i'm already thinking that your best bet will be reinstalling which doesn't mean we shouldn't try to find out what the problem is - just that i think we won't be able to really solve it a segmentation fault like that isn't good
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir when gdb bails out due to the segfault type where also - that will dump the function call stack we want to find what librarywhatever is causing the segfault

[11:58] <LjL> keyseir type file usrbinfirefox
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir ok just paste the output from the file command
[11:58] <LjL> assuming it doesn't segfault
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir oh right type file usrlibfirefoxfirefox-bin
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir matches with mine unfortunately you won't easily be able to gdb that because it won't start without the usrlibfirefoxfirefox wrapper script
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir just try using gdb on apt-get for now
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir usrliblibapt-pkg-libc-so seems my initial guess about lib being messed up by automatix might still be a possibility
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir try another thing i want to see what's going on with firefox strace firefox grep firefox-bin
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir i want to know whether the wrapper script is actually reaching the point where it starts the firefox binary or it fails before that
[11:58] <LjL> keyseir join ubuntu-classroom
[11:58] <LjL> atomikulinux don't ever do that again ever
[11:58] <LjL> linuxcrazy i'll ask you the same question
[11:58] <LjL> linuxcrazy please respect the guidelines and don't have that attitude thank you
[11:58] <LjL> linuxcrazy you're muted for minutes please spend this time reading the guidelines and the coc
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb depends what you mean with that probably something like i or k
[11:58] <LjL> es hola
[11:58] <LjL> linuxcwazy there wasn't a need to dodge my mute it expired way before you rejoined as asdfasd and dodging bans is hardly regarded as nice
[11:58] <LjL> linuxcwazy there were multiple reasons you were attacking you were using caps you were using enter as punctuation oh and i forgot
[11:58] <LjL> noob
[11:58] <LjL> linuxcwazy now if you still haven't read the guidelines as i asked you to and if you don't care what is nice to this channel and what is not
[11:58] <LjL> atomikulinu i believe firestarter has provisions for that have you tried it
[11:58] <LjL> necronz what the heck are you doing
[11:58] <LjL> necronz homework
[11:58] <LjL> necronz does your homework include doing random me's on irc channels
[11:58] <LjL> wifi
[11:58] <LjL> necronz well then please do your homework somewhere else
[11:58] <LjL> sethk would you mind explaining what's up with that to me in -offtopic
[11:58] <LjL> pitti the sudo is either useless or ineffective there
[11:58] <LjL> pitti the redirection is done by the shell which is not running as root
[11:58] <LjL> pitti sudo sh -c echo foo procblah does the trick or sudo -i and then do it from there
[11:58] <LjL> milaks tried restarting kopete
[11:58] <LjL> adamthecamper is it actually a local ntfs drive or a samba share
[11:58] <LjL> adamthecamper couldn't your hd be broken
[11:58] <LjL> pitti ok i see
[11:58] <LjL> adamthecamper look at varlogmessages and varlogsyslog and perhaps other logs for any hint a trick is assuming your drive is devhda something like grep -i hda varlog
[11:58] <LjL> adamthecamper i think you should also install smartmontools and run smartctl -h and smartctl -a on your drive to see if there might be anything suspicious
[11:58] <LjL> adamthecamper uhm i haven't the slightest idea because i never dealt with sata however i did sometimes hear things to the effect that sata support for some chips might not be quite fine

[11:58] <LjL> cmweb that explains how to create a symbolic link
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb anything that starts with the man command is just a manual page you should know that by now
[11:58] <LjL> dabar how could i
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb the -s option as someone has mentioned is what you want
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb what dabar said but didn't we go through this already
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb perhaps you want to write this stuff down
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb no
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb sudo adduser clint www-data
[11:58] <LjL> cmweb make sure www-data is the right group though ls -l varwww will tell you
[11:58] <LjL> dabar oh whops

[11:58] <LjL> maghat actually i have to tell you that you really should not recommend automatix in here i'm sorry but there's been too many automatix-broken systems to deal with
[11:58] <LjL> enter helgedk
[11:58] <LjL> iturk specifically
[11:58] <LjL> iturk you normally want to use adduser on an ubuntu system it is more complete anyway i'm not sure system users are supposed to have a password set
[11:58] <LjL> iturk and i normally use passwd to set passwords
[11:58] <LjL> iturk su - ateos from another user
[11:58] <LjL> iturk if you actually want to login and use it as a normal user i don't think you should create a system user
[11:58] <LjL> iturk create a regular user instead
[11:58] <LjL> iturk what's wrong with using sudo
[11:58] <LjL> iturk that's just because you must add yourself as a member of group admin i think
[11:58] <LjL> iturk only members of admin can use sudo to get root by default so adduser username admin

[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
[11:58] <LjL> selinuxium amsn
[11:58] <LjL> omkar afraid not perhaps using wine
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina and read ubotu's factoid
[11:58] <LjL> and the link it contains that is
[11:58] <LjL> hm no on the alternate cd it is not
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin no
[11:58] <LjL> yes but the question was about the alternate cd
[11:58] <LjL> alternate
[11:58] <LjL> fishing
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin well with mb even the desktop cd should run well so with the alternate cd memory is certainly not a problem
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin i honestly doubt that either failed because of ram shortage did you verify the cds
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin what kind of miserable failure do you get on the desktop cd
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin weeks if you let it run
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin the longer you let it run the higher probability it has of finding a failure
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin minutes rules out obvious failures stuck bits things like hours can rules out intermittent but fairly constant failures for subtler stuff at least hours i'd say
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin it's almost always a good idea to run a memtest
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin and yeah when you're convinced enough that your ram is ok just reset the computer
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin yes it writes stuff to ram then reads it back and check that it matches what it had written it uses smart bit patterns to make possible failure more evident but keep in mind that ram can fail very subtly -- you can have a bit stay set correctly for a day and then suddenly change state
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin but for the really broken ram modules memtest will tell you within minutes usually
[11:58] <LjL> pumpkinpie
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin what do you mean you had no graphical user interface there's something i'm missing here the alternate cd has a text-mode only interface it's got dialogs and all but it all runs in text-mode is that what you mean there with graphical user interface
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell protocol about tar protocol you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin in other words if you have a gnome desktop when you load your alternate cd then it's not the alternate cd -d
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin that looks like the desktop cd not the alternate cd the alternate will just process to a text-mode install
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin i don't know about oem
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin - if it looks like this it's the desktop cd not the alternate cd
[11:58] <LjL> botabuse nox-hand
[11:58] <LjL> nox-hand using the bot randomly without knowing if a factoid you ask about actually exists is abuse you can find out about the bot in a private query with it
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin that doesn't tell me much i'm afraid
[11:58] <LjL> bot nox-hand
[11:58] <LjL> nox-hand ok - that's why i pointed you to the botabuse factoid in the first place it tells you to please investigate with me only in msg or in ubuntu-bots
[11:58] <LjL> ragamuffin this is a standard i alternate cd and this is a desktop cd
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina not from the repos since they seem to have only up to which for what i'm concerned means i would not even attempt to install
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina why not make life simpler and use the packaged version of amsn
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina let me give it a crack
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina nice messing up
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina uhm here the configure seems to be happy with tcl - don't know about the actual make yet
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina i just typed sudo apt-get build-dep amsn
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina don't know i'm not going to try an autopackage not really
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina for the record i compiled amsn successfully and it runs
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina yes
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina wget tar xf amsn-tarbz cd amsn- sudo apt-get build-dep amsn configure make amsn
[11:58] <LjL> mamonassassina this procedure works fine here not sure exactly how you've tried to complicate your life
[11:58] <LjL> hopping export httpproxywhatever
[11:58] <LjL> hopping also to be sure export httpproxywhatever
[11:58] <LjL> hopping unable to resolve that seems like a dns problem does nslookup work
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell spiekey about packages spiekey you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> hopping i see but i'm afraid apt-get will still try to use dns for resolving even if it's going through a proxy
[11:58] <LjL> spiekey well for a package like that searching for zaptel can hardly fail if it isn't there when you search at it probably just means it isn't there
[11:58] <LjL> find zaptel
[11:58] <LjL> spiekey could those above be it
[11:58] <LjL> hopping yes but i guess you'll have the same problem
[11:58] <LjL> hopping are you sure there isn't some local dns server that you can connect to
[11:58] <LjL> spiekey then that file's not packaged
[11:58] <LjL> spiekey look at this however - - it's there as source
[11:58] <LjL> in warty
[11:58] <LjL> hopping can you pastebin the full output of sudo apt-get update please
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell hopping about paste hopping you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> iter add the line gateway to the appropriate entry in etcnetworkinterfaces - weird gateway by the way
[11:58] <LjL> hopping url please
[11:58] <LjL> hopping uhm no doesn't seem page not found
[11:58] <LjL> hopping ok try nslookup
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dad about firefox dad you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> hopping nah just tell me if it's finding an address for google or not
[11:58] <LjL> hopping in firefox you have auto-detect proxy settings for this network or automatix proxy configuration url
[11:58] <LjL> hopping sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[11:58] <LjL> dv apt-cache search find wireless
[11:58] <LjL> info netdiscover dv
[11:58] <LjL> hopping you could try adding a line like acquirehttpproxy to the apt configuration file i'm not sure which file it is in ubuntu however normally it would be etcaptaptconf but ubuntu has an etcaptaptconfd directory
[11:58] <LjL> maybe you can add it to etcaptaptconfdubuntu but i don't really know if that's a good idea
[11:58] <LjL> ubuntu-desktop nilson
[11:58] <LjL> nilson same reasoning i suppose
[11:58] <LjL> grout mkfs -t ext
[11:58] <LjL> rossdokta ubuntu server or perhaps xubuntu if you're lucky
[11:58] <LjL> indeed
[11:58] <LjL> nilson reinstalling it will result in removing the package that you're now trying to install which package is it anyway
[11:58] <LjL> nilson which package
[11:58] <LjL> grout that would depend on the drive i suppose
[11:58] <LjL> rossdokta use the alternate cd
[11:58] <LjL> sdparm grout perhaps this but i bet it really depends on which specific drive
[11:58] <LjL> nilson i asked you which specific package you are installing
[11:58] <LjL> info nfs-kernel nilson
[11:58] <LjL> nilson i suppose it's nfs-kernel-server that you mean
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell phuzion about firefox phuzion you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> nilson do you have either knfs or nfs-server installed type apt-cache policy knfs and apt-cache policy nfs-server to know
[11:58] <LjL> kishan to read yes to write not at all
[11:58] <LjL> ext kishan
[11:58] <LjL> sn that was a convincing argument
[11:58] <LjL> sn wrong
[11:58] <LjL> sn not causing problems to you or not causing problems in general
[11:58] <LjL> lir you should be able to do that without problems yes
[11:58] <LjL> lir wait not linux-headers-
[11:58] <LjL> lir i'd start by removing linux-image--
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell dovk about beryl dovk you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> lir first i'd make sure linux- is installed the whole package then remove all the linux-image packages that end with - -- the rest i guess will be removed automatically
[11:58] <LjL> lir think it'll be removed automatically when you remove the images
[11:58] <LjL> lir well at least one backup is probably a good idea
[11:58] <LjL> justin mat there is a fine ram tested on the ubuntu cd memtest - it can be started by booting the cd and selecting the memory testing option
[11:58] <LjL> just mentioning
[11:58] <LjL> memtest is probably among the best ones around
[11:58] <LjL> well don't do the full test if you're using memtest because that will probably take days - just let it run for a while
[11:58] <LjL> stojance one question mark is enough thanks

[11:58] <LjL> sethk well i'm not sure you typed the right thing
[11:58] <LjL> sethk the sudo apt-get reconfigure xserver-xorg -- i guess this would be sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[11:58] <LjL> anyone
[11:58] <LjL> es arturo
[11:58] <LjL> caps arturo
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee possibly i do
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee hold on a second let me find the bug report
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee - see my comments
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee search for bios
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee so basically try disabling shutdown when cpu fan fail if you have it enabled in the bios
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee hmm
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee is it not awardbios
[11:58] <LjL> anyone thinh
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee well i don't know then try disabling anything that seems related to temperature checking or fan speed checking
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee and whether you fail or succeed please add a comment to that bug report stating that you're using phoenixbios and which version which motherboard etc like i did
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee you could try noapic too
[11:58] <LjL> elko should be safe unless you have stuff that you installed manually ie not from the repos or from debs that relies on apt-installed dependencies
[11:58] <LjL> repeat thinh stop i already gave you a hint twice
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx put the full output of that on the pastebin
[11:58] <LjL> mythtv thinh might be of some help
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx err there must be something else i think
[11:58] <LjL> regin
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx see if you have a file named varlibdpkginfojoomlapostinst or similar and if you do pastebin it
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell stoop about sound stoop you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> schasi ok for reading still potentially dangerous for writing
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx hm kay do you also have varlibdpkginfojoomlapostrm
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx this could be kind of dangerous but you can try executing that script manually and see why it's failing
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx would be sh -v varlibdpkginfojoomlapostrm
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx would be sh -v varlibdpkginfojoomlapostrm purge actually
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx pastebin what it output to stdout
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx i know it output the script itself but i want to check out if it output all of it
[11:58] <LjL> mabus sudo apt-cdrom add with the cd inserted
[11:58] <LjL> mabus then sudo apt-get update
[11:58] <LjL> mabus i don't know i don't have gnome so i don't know what the repositories menu accomplishes
[11:58] <LjL> mabus well gnome or xfce - whatever it's kde that i use
[11:58] <LjL> sundried ifconfig o
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx ok i'm out of ideas i can probably tell you how to make apt-get happy but the package will risk not being fully removed
[11:58] <LjL> fallhell just boot from it and follow the instructions
[11:58] <LjL> weby no
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx i saw the paste but i have no clue unfortunately i can probably tell you how to make apt believe that the package is fully removed but you'll probably be left with a package that's not fully removed
[11:58] <LjL> mrspinx just edit varlibdpkginfojoomlapostrm and add a line exit right after the first line if you want that

[11:58] <LjL> delano nothing logging in as root graphically is just very bad and it's disabled

[11:58] <LjL> ubotu please tell delano about root delano you have a private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> delano why can't you use sudo for that
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee yes
[11:58] <LjL> delano don't know why that would be but i find it very hard to relate it to sudo vs real root do what afterdeath said
[11:58] <LjL> delano and read the bot's link about sudo
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee hmm well but with acpioff i believe that thermal zone support shouldn't even be present
[11:58] <LjL> delano uh
[11:58] <LjL> delano the page explains that if you really want to do it which you shouldn't
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee doesn't start because it gives the same problem or doesn't start because of something else
[11:58] <LjL> delano then do it by following the instructions on that page
[11:58] <LjL> delano you certainly aren't expecting us to spoonfeed you on something that is not supported do you that page has all the information that you asked for
[11:58] <LjL> lir i'm a kde user
[11:58] <LjL> crayzee uhm perhaps try also pcinoacpi

[11:58] <LjL> zaehlas i think that with journaling filesystems you can have space that shows up as allocated while it's really been freed but the garbage collector hasn't kicked in yet did you remove many very large files just recently
[11:58] <LjL> zaehlas try running an fsck
[11:58] <LjL> ubuntu-desktop tle
[11:58] <LjL> zaehlas you shouldn't fsck a mounted filesystem at least you should only ever do that with fsck in check-only mode no writes

[11:58] <LjL> zipzo wine and vmware are completely different applications qemu will run your windows apps fine too but slow

[11:58] <LjL> expdwark note that there are duplicates for that bug so you probably also want to look at those

[11:58] <LjL> tonyyarusso yeah that
[11:58] <LjL> and users who should compile will have no trouble installing build-essential
[11:58] <LjL> tonyyarusso well full installed size of a package is very hard to know in advance since it depends on which packages you already have installed p
[11:58] <LjL> tonyyarusso even if you did such a script it would either show the installed size with all the dependencies which is totally useless since for instance it'll include libc or use the standard set of packages that get installed in ubuntu by default as a reference - which sounds better but hard to implement and then typing apt-get install blah is way easier

[11:58] <LjL> nope i don't think

[11:58] <LjL> but no i'm not willing to speak about them and yes black art p
[11:58] <LjL> metatecque
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg i know i tried to tidy it up a bit but didn't really manage much and also i could only make the form better the substance well only someone who actually uses winmodems can help making the howto better
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg no i just changed it around a bit seeing what a mess it was but then the way it is right now is not even from my edits it was edited again later and splitted into multiple pages
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg what about you just find some cheap hardware modem on ebay or something
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg because softmodems are horriblehardimpossible to set up
[11:58] <LjL> somian this might help though not precisely the answer to your question -
[11:58] <LjL> eilker me
[11:58] <LjL> dabar their wiki specifically
[11:58] <LjL> heh
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg hmm if i'm not mistaken it's the same one i've got though no i never got it to work never tried very hard either
[11:58] <LjL> offtopic daemon
[11:58] <LjL> dheerajk as i told you - this kind of questions belongs to ubuntu-offtopic

[11:58] <LjL> warty learninglinux
[11:58] <LjL> learninglinux and since ubuntu versions are dates october
[11:58] <LjL> smiy there isn't a universal way what kind of connection do you have
[11:58] <LjL> smiy then i don't think your ubuntu even has a way of knowing the connection speed you need to ask the router
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu tell sey about beryl sey see the private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> sey yes - your problem is that you're asking in the wrong channel
[11:58] <LjL> smiy sounds plausible
[11:58] <LjL> fobia have you ever booted from cds on that computer before
[11:58] <LjL> smiy then you need something like the site that you've been pointed to
[11:58] <LjL> smiy if you don't want to use a web browser you could just use wget to download something big from a site that you know is fast
[11:58] <LjL> fobia have you verified the cd
[11:58] <LjL> fobia well for some reason my cd drive is a bit lunatic with booting from cds i burn including the ubuntu cd sometimes i've had to try up to times or so before i could get it to boot perhaps you're having a similar problem
[11:58] <LjL> fobia does your computer completely ignore the presence of the cd ie just goes on booting windows or does it try and fail
[11:58] <LjL> kde killown

[11:58] <LjL> torrent
[11:58] <LjL> killown what isn't clear from the kubuntuorg link i gave you
[11:58] <LjL> killown - just read the link
[11:58] <LjL> anyone
[11:58] <LjL> killown where exactly does it say that you need to download kubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> killown i don't see that on the kde page
[11:58] <LjL> killown are you kidding me
[11:58] <LjL>
[11:58] <LjL> third time i give this

[11:58] <LjL> rsl hm what do you mean storage-wise it doesn't really make a big difference to most filesystems it's mostly a matter of how you want to organize your files
[11:58] <LjL> fr jiraiya
[11:58] <LjL> rsl traversing the directory will take a little longer unless you're talking literally thousands of files though i doubt it'd make any practical difference
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent isn't varwww assigned to the www-data group by default
[11:58] <LjL> minty by doing it and seeing if it does
[11:58] <LjL> rsl going through each filename yes - that or something a bit smarter must be done by the system everytime you refer to a file by name i think ext really does just go through each filename but i'm not really sure how many files are we talking about anyway
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent well i don't have apache installed right now i'll install it and tell you
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent heh well my varwww is owned by www-datawww-data - however it was owned by those even before reinstalling apache but i don't think i've ever touched the ownership manually so i guess it was apache's installation that set it like that in the first place
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent is it apache that you're using
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent hm let me check this one out
[11:58] <LjL> rsl this might be of some interest ls-on-a-cleared-fatty-ext-directory-on-fc--thtml -- it would look like the dirindex feature of ext being turned on vs off would make a big difference in flat-directory-with-tons-of-files scenarios
[11:58] <LjL> rsl well if it really does hold five million files then yes i'd not be surprised indexing is slow
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent uh wait didn't you say it was owned by root for you
[11:58] <LjL> xaralx perhaps masterninja
[11:58] <LjL> br
[11:58] <LjL> ninanba stop
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent i'd like to find out why it wasn't owned by www-data in the first place though but anyway you should make yourself a member of www-data now if you want to work with the files in there
[11:58] <LjL> dummie no
[11:58] <LjL> pastebin marcn
[11:58] <LjL> miles burn another cd and check the md on the iso before burning it as well to avoid wasting another cd
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu tell miles about md miles see the private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent dapper or edgy
[11:58] <LjL> rsl if you have enough ram yes the directory would basically stay cached in ram all the time so you'd hardly notice a performance impact i think
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent i see well anyway sudo adduser your-username www-data will allow you to edit varwww without using sudo now
[11:58] <LjL> gravyface err yeah precisely what you said well almost use date something instead of that echo command
[11:58] <LjL> gravyface look at the date manpage to know what format the something is in so you can decide precisely what format the timestamp will have
[11:58] <LjL> gravyface also you should use instead of since the latter is deprecated doesn't really make a difference right now though but the former is also more readable
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight unless you're compelled to do otherwise use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg rather than editing it directly
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight can do that through dpkg-reconfigure
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight that dpkg-reconfigure will result in modifying xorgconf - you're just not doing that directly
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight because if you modify it manually the next time you run dpkg-reconfigure on it your modifications will be overwritten and the questions aren't really difficult since you don't need to answer any of them - just press enter the defaults are what you already have in your current xorgconf unless you changed it manually previously maybe
[11:58] <LjL> livingdaylight works in both yes
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent you need to use newgrp man it to set your primary group to www-data at least i think that's the best approach
[11:58] <LjL> gbrent i don't think admin lets you use sudo that's all basically normally your primary group is your user's group you know normally each user has a group with the same name as the user

[11:58] <LjL> adamg that's been asked more than once i don't know and i can't check because i don't have gnome perhaps try this start a non-gnome x session like the failsafe session and launch gnome-panel manually using strace -e tracefile gnome-panel that should spew a lot of information about files that gnome-panel is accessing - see what it access when you hit quitsuspend
[11:58] <LjL> adamg sorry i've had to reboot - any luck

[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya mine does out of the box well don't know about firefox i'm on kubuntu but
[11:58] <LjL> cn nolimitsoya see this
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya i was asking if you could see the characters
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya ok for starters do you have the dejavu sans font available
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya if you type locale in a console do you see that you're using utf-
[11:58] <LjL> adamg -
[11:58] <LjL> adamg hm try with strace -e traceprocess instead of file or just try strace with no option though that'll really produce a lot of output probably
[11:58] <LjL> adamg tracefile i suppose doesn't trace fork and exec calls
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya i dunno
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya i can't seem to find any packages that i have installed that are specifically unicode-related
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya does apt-cache policy ttf-dejavu show it as installed though i guess it would
[11:58] <LjL> yola not by default
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu tell yola about xgl yola see the private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya installed lostirc and here the ideograms render fine
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya are you using the dejavu sans as your default font anyway many other fonts probably don't have most unicode characters
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya well default font for something like for lostirc though i haven't seen an option for setting the font in lostirc
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya ok but leave firefox alone for a minute - that could be firefox being stupid with encoding detection
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya hmm do you have libicu installed
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya do you have xfonts-encodings
[11:58] <LjL> nolimitsoya i'm at a loss

[11:58] <LjL> wwallacelap the sources
[11:58] <LjL> wwallacelap short answer yes but the page should explain it all
[11:58] <LjL> wwallacelap ubuntu is synced with debian unstable at releases
[11:58] <LjL> wwallacelap not the kind of question to ask on an ubuntu channel really anyway you're better off in ubuntu-offtopic for that kind of question i guess
[11:58] <LjL> wwallacelap ok but it's offtopic and there's more than people here you wouldn't want all of them to give you an opinion besides since we're an ubuntu channel it's pretty clear that most of us like ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> ich no there is a program that can use the babylon dictionaries though as well as other dictionary programs most based on a common dictionary protocol
[11:58] <LjL> find wordtrans ich this is it
[11:58] <LjL> ich the stuff that babylon does in order to recognize text on the screen is actually pretty refined and complicated - it's a screen-based ocr really one could probably hack something together using gocr or something but i doubt it'd work very well
[11:58] <LjL> ich wordtrans can translate from the contents of the clipboard however andor you can have a dictionary textbox in your panel
[11:58] <LjL> ich note there is no gtkgnome client for wordtrans however only qtkde not that you can't use that of course the gnome searchbar right click on the panel add applet can give you a dictionary as well and i think there's also another specialized applet just going by memory i use kde myself
[11:58] <LjL> ivx i'd say
[11:58] <LjL> ivx if you use gnome or kde on it that is
[11:58] <LjL> ivx no i don't think not with gnomekde it would work but it would be a pain and you couldn't install it from the desktop cd you'd have to use the alternate

[11:58] <LjL> pwner i'm not sure installing new versions of alsa is an easy task anyway you'd probably have to recompile the kernel i suppose
[11:58] <LjL> pwner i wouldn't know where to start but if you're green with command line i can quite safely tell you don't

[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg i think that's about the carrier line of the rs interface ie the serial port rather than about the carrier checking of the phoneline performed by the modem
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg there is a solution which probably involves adding the appropriate command to the initialization at sequence for the modem i just don't remember the command

[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg i haven't found out anything more about that i've read but didn't help much
[11:58] <LjL> stvnry ok now let me tell you something whoever told you that sudo -l rt -s was a valid command was making fun of you -l is a sudo option that lists privileges and rt is just a slang term for root ie administrator
[11:58] <LjL> lullabud sudo -i is shorter and less redundant - why chain together two different commands sudo and su that can do the same thing ie switch user
[11:58] <LjL> lullabud i see well in ubuntu's sudo there definitely is a -i switch
[11:58] <LjL> dredhammer read about tcpdump
[11:58] <LjL> jordanu assuming he's root
[11:58] <LjL> it is indeed but it's not packaged in ubuntu
[11:58] <LjL> rbil it's free software
[11:58] <LjL> jordanu it's stvnry
[11:58] <LjL> rt your realname field does say root though
[11:58] <LjL> rt to bind to ports lower than programs need to be run as root
[11:58] <LjL> rt the correct way to start apache is sudo invoke-rcd apache start
[11:58] <LjL> rt you shouldn't have to apache should start automatically how did you install it through apt i suppose
[11:58] <LjL> rt do you have php symlinks in etcapachemods-enabled
[11:58] <LjL> rt indeed look inside that directory ls etcapachemods-enabled
[11:58] <LjL> rt so you don't have php enabled do you have libapache-mod-php installed apt-cache policy libapache-mod-php
[11:58] <LjL> rt and is that edgy or dapper
[11:58] <LjL> rt yes was about having it installed

[11:58] <LjL> blacjktongue - look at the end of the page
[11:58] <LjL> wy unrelated tip - you can use sudo -s rather than sudo su and sudo -i rather than sudo su -
[11:58] <LjL> wy i don't think if you can use sudo su you can use sudo you need to be in the admin group to use sudo type groups to check but i bet you are

[11:58] <LjL> rt i'm pretty sure just reading ubotu's link will help you anyway
[11:58] <LjL> rt too bad it's still not supported on here though
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid i mean pass that as a kernel parameter in the grub menu hit e and you'll be able to edit the kernel command line if there's an init parameter already change it to say initbinsh otherwise just add it
[11:58] <LjL> rt perhaps you should actually read what it says there
[11:58] <LjL> rt specifically the replace key with the key id
[11:58] <LjL> rt with the appropriate key for the repository which i'm guessing is jonathan riddel's key -- which is listed later on the same page
[11:58] <LjL> levander man update-rcd -- i guess the script involved is etcinitdpcmciautils
[11:58] <LjL> levander i see in that case you ugh perhaps you could try killing the process for etcinitdpcmciautils are you upgrading from dapper to edgy
[11:58] <LjL> levander i assume you know that you should be using update-manager rather than apt-get - anyway third paragraph
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu tell wsmith about build-essential wsmith see the private message from ubotu
[11:58] <LjL> wsmith well a trick if you need something like this again in the future could be apt-cache rdepends gcc
[11:58] <LjL> thoreauputic anthonyg binutils is depended upon by gcc which is depended upon by build-essential
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid hmm perhaps it has just started by the splash screen isn't going away try altf and if it doesn't work try again altf - or remove the splash parameter and add nosplash
[11:58] <LjL> anthonyg i bet you do anyway apt-cache policy binutils will tell you
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid you can fix it you're just passing the wrong parameters i don't really remember them by heart without rebooting on my machine the kernel linux is bootvmlinuz---generic rootdevhda ro quiet splash -- i guess i should make it bootvmlinuz---generic rootdevhda ro initbinsh to boot like that
[11:58] <LjL> daidungsi come again
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid or take the ro away even
[11:58] <LjL> easytag lam
[11:58] <LjL> lam apt-cache show easytag - check a package's description before assuming it doesn't do something -
[11:58] <LjL> lam specifically ability to rename files from the tag using masks or by loading a text file
[11:58] <LjL> idren lam if you prefer console-based
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid yes you're in as root with only a bash console running
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid well if you're on edgy that'll be dash rather than bash i suppose shouldn't be too different at all though
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid i'll pastebin my etcpasswd a fairly default one so you can check what might be wrong in yours
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid you can see that normally the first user the one ubuntu was installed with has uid and gid gid being the group that's named as the user itself - check etcgroup also in order to use sudo that user must be a member of the group admin - check that it exists in etcgroup and make sure the user's a member of it
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid it's read only i suppose try mount -o remountrw if that's even the right syntax
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid wait the command is mount remount is an option what's it saying exactly
[11:58] <LjL> battlesquid you're welcome
[11:58] <LjL> illution apt-get --download-only install xchat i think it is
[11:58] <LjL> thoreauputic no problem though imho you shouldn't spoil the fun of having people type the -characters-long version of options -p
[11:58] <LjL> anno command line interface
[11:58] <LjL> rt no automatix support here
[11:58] <LjL> rt am i mistaken or did i already kick you yesterday for please help me spamming
[11:58] <LjL> etiquette rt
[11:58] <LjL> stalthy click on the installation icon
[11:58] <LjL> ubotu tell stalthy about install stalthy see the private message from ubotu
