[12:01] <Chris_Sutcliff> webmaren have you tried installing build-essentials
[12:02] <lee2> if i wanted to program a game in linux, should i use opengl ?
[12:02] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: there is no directx, so i guess so
[12:02] <webmaren> chris_sutcliff: yes, and gcc, and g++
[12:02] <Chris_Sutcliff> webmaren: no idea then, there's a precompiled version in the reposiories
[12:02] <webmaren> not for amd64
[12:03] <lee2> whats the alturnitive to opengl ?
[12:03] <Chris_Sutcliff> lee2: but opengl is INCREDIBLY slow for me :P
[12:03] <SGersho1> psusi, tormod, if I just use recovery mode, will it load everything else it needs to work properly (network, HW, drivers...)?
[12:03] <lee2> its a 2d game. alot of movement though.
[12:03] <tormod> SGersho1: yes
[12:03] <Chris_Sutcliff> webmarren: oh, well is there a pre-packaged version for amd64 from any other distro?
[12:03] <bimberi> webmaren: try install build-essential, it brings in a couple of other goodies
[12:03] <hkais> anyone here who knows how the ubuntu forum is embedded with the mailinglist, and possibly with a nntp?
[12:03] <webmaren> bimberi: I already have build-essential
[12:03] <Chris_Sutcliff> webmarren: because at a push you could convert that to a .deb using alien
[12:04] <tormod> SGersho1: it's not really "recovery" if you ask me, it's single user.
[12:04] <bimberi> webmaren: k
[12:04] <Kludgy> lee2: If it hasn't been mentioned, I'd suggest http://www.libsdl.org/.  it may give you a big jumpstart
[12:05] <SGersho1> tormod, psusi: Ok. Yes, I see in menu.lst that recovery is "simple", instead of "quiet splash".
[12:05] <SGersho1> So it should work fine, as you say.
[12:06] <psusi> SGersho1: it's single, not simple
[12:06] <SGersho1> psusi: :P Right, my typo. menu.lst is fine :P

[12:07] <SGersho1> psusi: If I eventually want to exit the 'recovery terminal only mode' and want to get GUI, then i just have to run X? Or its complicate dthan that?
[12:07] <TC`> how to set that?
[12:08] <psusi> SGersho1: no... recover mode will give you a root shell... if you exit from that shell, it then boots up normally
[12:08] <kitche> SGersho1: you would have to reboot since X won't run in init 1

[01:06] <BleSS> i would install ubuntu about crypto volume, using cd alternate, is possible install truecrypt, configure partitions and follow with the instalation?

[01:07] <compir99> is there a way to auto connect to my local vmware server when i start vmware (linux)?
[01:07] <RaMoNeS>  somebody has a version gnu of the solitaire
[01:07] <ryanakca> Seveas: is there a way to set it up with "setupcon" ?

[01:08] <RaMoNeS> only find for win32 :(
[01:08] <Seveas> (eg: vga=791)
[01:08] <Serenity> is anyone familiar with the simple password protection javascript
[01:08] <Serenity>  var password = prompt("Password required:", "");
[01:08] <Serenity>    if (password) { this.location.href = password + ".html"; }}
[01:08] <Seveas> RaMoNeS, it's installed by default
[01:08] <ryanakca> Seveas: *built his own kernel*
[01:08] <Seveas> applications -> games
[01:08] <RaMoNeS> i dont have only the minesweeper
[01:08] <Seveas> ryanakca, that probably includes support for it ;)
[01:08] <compir99> how can i auto boot the guest os when i start vmware?
[01:08] <Serenity> i cant figure out how i would make it return if a bad 'pass' was entered
[01:09] <Seveas> Serenity, that's no protection and javascript questions are offtopic here
[01:09] <ArrenLex> Serenity: I bet that's how NASA protects their computers. *sage nod*
[01:09] <Serenity> sorry, for being off topic
[01:09] <ryanakca> lol :)
[01:09] <Serenity> its not for password protection, im using it as a keyword thing on my site, so you enter the keyword for what you want and it takes you to it
[01:09] <Seveas> compir99, afaik you can only choose 'start when booting' and 'start with a button', not 'start together with the vmware monitor'
[01:09] <ryanakca> Serenity: ask in #javascript maybe?

[01:16] <Valmarko> not now.,,
[01:16] <ArrenLex> Valmarko: This is true, because it uses open-source drivers. You can install the official drivers if you want to do better, but be warned they were coded in Notepad by a blindfolded intern and are likely to cause problems.

[01:46] <Myria> i guess nobody has heard of my problem before...  guess i'll go use fedora core
[01:47] <Corporal_Dirge> Hello everyone.
[01:47] <cmt^^> gnomefreak - the profile-settings where in ~/.bash_profile
[01:47] <jrib> Myria: what is the problem exactly?
[01:47] <kybuz> hiya
[01:47] <n3ldan> anyone know how to tell what ALSA devices are named?  aqualung needs one, I tried using "default" but playback was at like 4x
[01:47] <Myria> jrib: the x86-64 installer acts extremely differently from x86-32.  it doesn't install X.
[01:47] <Ruffles> Myria, maybe 'cuz they're made for different architectures
[01:47] <cmt^^> gnomefreak - but i still didn't find what i was looking for, namely a way to reset the "show menu bar" setting
[01:48] <jrib> Myria: it should unless you have a server install disk.  Check that 'ubuntu-desktop' package got installed
[01:48] <Corporal_Dirge> Something interesting is happening to me. A DVD I just rented is encrypted and won't play on my computer.. I have no choice but to download it. Way to go RIAA.
[01:48] <n3ldan> almost all DVDs are encrypted
[01:48] <cmt^^> Corporal_Dirge - sure you rented it.

[01:48] <ubotu> Corporal_Dirge: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[01:48] <gnomefreak> cmt^^: click on edit than profile there might be something in there i cant remember if it is or not
[01:48] <Myria> jrib: can i apt-get that?
[01:48] <gnomefreak> make that current profiles
[01:48] <cmt^^> gnomefreak - I did, and there wasn't
[01:48] <jrib> Myria: yes
=== bob-UCR is now known as bobG-UCR
[01:48] <Corporal_Dirge> I tried atp-get install libdvdcss but it's not available.
[01:49] <ChocoCid> is there any program that can find all the words in a specific set of characters?
[01:49] <Myria> will that make X start automatically and all?
[01:49] <jrib> Corporal_Dirge: please see the link ubotu mentioned

[01:49] <turbomatic> hi
[01:49] <ChocoCid> Corporal_Dirge you need to go to set up the seveas repo
[01:49] <Corporal_Dirge> jrib, I really don't need the basics of DVD playing. I have a new encryption that's unreadable.
[01:49] <jrib> Corporal_Dirge: (the second link)
[01:49] <turbomatic> howcome can I still hear my laptop's speakers pretty clearly even though the volume is supposedly muted?
[01:49] <bimberi> LjL: ran 'shutdown -F -r now' on an Edgy PC.  Rebooted and ran fsck.  Must be an omission from the manpage (note the author, it's related to upstart).
[01:49] <ChocoCid> good question , turbomatic, i'd like to know that one too :(
[01:50] <Danniel> hello
[01:50] <Corporal_Dirge> Basically, VLC, M-Player, and Movie Player all have issues with it.
[01:50] <gnomefreak> cmt^^: i found the profile file but its XML not sure you can or want to edit that let me keep looking
[01:50] <Danniel> how to change refresh rate?
[01:50] <mcphail> bimberi: ljl is fsck'ing as we speak
[01:51] <turbomatic> it looks like lowering the volume to the lowest setting doesn't mute it contrary to the red X icon. I used alsamixer to mute Master (MM) and now there is no sound
[01:51] <bimberi> mcphail: yep, just realised.  I had pre-typed his nick so didn't catch that.  Thanks :)
[01:51] <jrib> !xconfig | Danniel
[01:51] <ubotu> Danniel: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[01:51] <ChocoCid> turbomatic: how'd you do that?
[01:51] <ChocoCid> mine shows mute on master :(
[01:51] <tovella> Corporal_Dirge: i used automatix http://www.getautomatix.com/wiki/index.php?title=Installation
[01:51] <turbomatic> ChocoCid: open alsamixer and press m
[01:51] <ChocoCid> !automatix
[01:51] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[01:51] <tonyyarusso> !automatix
[01:51] <tonyyarusso> doh
[01:52] <ChocoCid> ah, ty

[01:53] <Danniel> jrib: yes :)
[01:53] <a52x3> jrib: I meant to put it in another channel
[01:53] <jrib> a52x3: np, just letting you know there is a -offtopic that you can talk about that stuff as well
[01:54] <cmt^^> gnomefreak - gconf-editor did the trick
[01:54] <cmt^^> thanks anyways
[01:54] <cmt^^> maybe you could help me with another problem? :>
[01:54] <ChocoCid> a52x3: that guy seems full of nonsense
[01:55] <Corporal_Dirge> What's the path to sources.list again?
[01:55] <jrib> Corporal_Dirge: /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:55] <ChocoCid> /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:55] <gnomefreak> ok cool cmt^^  ill look at it in a bit
[01:55] <Corporal_Dirge> Thanks
[01:56] <mcphail> LjL: success?
[01:56] <LjL> mcphail: that option might have been removed from the manpage for a reason, since it doesn't appear to work here (it doesn't cause a shutdown, and i have some "rc1 process killed" message on the log terminal)
[01:57] <mcphail> LjL: worked for bimberi...
[01:57] <bimberi> LjL: ran 'shutdown -F -r now' on an Edgy PC.  Rebooted and ran fsck.  Must be an omission from the manpage (note the author, it's related to upstart).
[01:57] <LjL> mcphail: though perhaps it might be because i am executing it with my own (sudo'ed) user (since i don't have root), while /home is unmounted..
[01:58] <LjL> why the manpage regression from Dapper though? seems weird
[01:58] <cmt^^> gnomefreak - maybe you could help me with another problem? :> i can't get sound working
[01:58] <mcphail> LjL: you might need to add the -h or -r flag
=== BobG-UCR is now known as BobG
[01:59] <LjL> i'll try that
[01:59] <bimberi> LjL: I reckon it's an unintended omission

[02:06] <skiline2000> in know you get this a lot and i apologize, but I've tried everything and it still doesn't work and i was hoping someone could help me: I have a Nvidia GeForce 6600 AGP and i have gone to the website and tried to download Linux AMD64/EM64T
[02:06] <skiline2000> Latest Version: 1.0-9631
[02:06] <skiline2000> and it wont install
[02:07] <ChocoCid> the Nvidia has nothing to do with whether you should get the AMD64 or x86 version
[02:07] <skiline2000> sorry i have a AMD 64bit 3200
[02:07] <ChocoCid> hrm
[02:08] <ChocoCid> how does it mess up when installing?
[02:08] <cck> skiline2000: well if you want help try to be more precise, like what's the error message for example :)
[02:08] <valarians> how do you set usr/pwd for swat?
[02:08] <eegore> Are there 64 bit codecs to replace the 32bit ones?

[02:19] <cmt^^> (ubuntu 6.10/ff)
[02:19] <seraphim__> cmt^^: to get true transparency you have to get beryl or compiz running
[02:20] <lubix> cmt your flash player doesnt not dowload movies
[02:20] <cmt^^> seraphim__ - i installed compiz, but the system crashed when i ran it
[02:20] <ChocoCid> try beryl

[02:41] <ebooa> hi there
[02:41] <Ralith> np
[02:41] <ebooa> anyone can help me out with the rt2500 drivers install
[02:41] <kuroishi> what do ya'll think about automatix?
[02:41] <Ralith> kuroishi, so, ideas about the network thing?
[02:41] <phoenix87ta> greetings.  having a problem burning CDs under Ubuntu Edgy.  works okay up until the actual burn phase, then tells me to insert a blank disc.  I have one inserted, it's the proper type, it's definitely blank.  any ideas?
[02:42] <bray> I need to know how to format my drive to get rid of the partition that ubuntu is on, but keep my Windows installation... or how to make the ubuntu partition smaller
[02:42] <Ralith> as it is now I have to keep a ping going and reconfigure the connection with ifconfig and iproute every time I see it going down -_-
[02:42] <ebooa> anyone can help me out with rt2500 driver install
[02:42] <stepanstas> tovella: i am glad i started now, and sad i didnt earlier
[02:42] <kingace> hello, when i try to update beryl, the update-manager says "Some updates require the removal of further software.." etc.. but in apt-get it doesnt update anything and the apply button is disabled in synaptic when i click mark all upgrades. any ideas?
[02:42] <Vich> what's the problem ebooa?
[02:42] <stepanstas> tovella: anyway, thanks again, i will try it now
[02:42] <Vich> ubuntu version?
[02:42] <ebooa> thanks
[02:42] <tovella> ace0174: ohh, you must have one of those new high end graphics cards.  i had a similar problem when my graphics manufacturer would not release some of the details about their hardware.
[02:42] <Eroick> I distuprgaded to Edgy and now my network card won't work. It uses ndiswrapper. I can't modprobe ndiswrapper. Ndiswrapper utility says that driver and hardware are present for my network card. I have tried dpkg-reconfigure but it throws an error. Ndiswrapper error is Invalid Argument.

[02:42] <paul928> I've been using Ubuntu for almost 2 years. My first Linux distro. Had a spare partition on my hd so I installed Debian Sarge. Sure am glad I started with Ubuntu. Still don't have a desktop after I installed Gnome-desktop.
[02:42] <kuroishi> Ralith, not the same issue, mine goes down and won't reassociate without a reboot
[02:43] <jevangelo_> my sun 17 inch crt monitor is showing it can only go up to 60Hz
[02:43] <ace0174> tovella its a 7800GT nvidia
[02:43] <stepanstas> thanks all
[02:43] <ebooa> i used synaptic but it still doesn't recognize my card
[02:43] <Myria> is it possible in x86-64 ubuntu to install the x86-32 compiler?
[02:43] <ace0174> i guess drivers are avaliable
[02:43] <Madpilot> kuroishi, automatix is best avoided. It doesn't do anything you can't do on your own, and it breaks Ubuntu installs...
[02:43] <Vich> ebooa, there are native drivers by serialmonkey available
[02:43] <Vich> but they don't work on edgy
[02:43] <kuroishi> Madpilot, I figured, thats why I asked.  I can d
[02:43] <Vich> you are using dapper, so you should be fine
[02:43] <bray> Can anyone help me with my partition question?
[02:43] <kuroishi> i can DIY, but i like user-friendliness anyway.
[02:43] <jevangelo_> i was on a windows box with this same monitor and it was able to do the same resolution, but it was able to do 80 hz
[02:44] <Ralith> kuroishi, it doesn't lose association
[02:44] <tovella> ace0174: i believe there are drivers for that card - in fact it should be auto-detected.
[02:44] <Ralith> kuroishi, it loses its ip and default route
[02:44] <gribelu> cck, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager
[02:44] <Madpilot> kuroishi, user-friendliness is good, but breaking an install in the name of 'user friendliness' is not, in fact, user friendly.
[02:44] <ace0174> tovella my mouse moves correctly
[02:44] <kuroishi> Madpilot, i suppose your right.
[02:44] <Vich> ebooa, http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads
[02:44] <jevangelo_> i was going to go into xorg.conf and change the horizontal and vertical refresh rate, but how can you tell what to change it to by just knowing it needs to be 80hz
[02:44] <ace0174> the screen is not frozen just corrupted
[02:44] <ebooa> yep but it just so happens that it still doesn't work
[02:44] <cck> thks gribelu
[02:44] <tovella> ace0174: another possibility is that the refresh rates for the monitor are incorrect.
[02:44] <Ralith> kuroishi, nothing else
[02:44] <kuroishi> Madpilot, so it effectively turns ubuntu into say.... fedora =P
[02:45] <ebooa> yesterday i could recognize the ap channes
[02:45] <Vich> ebooa, you mean those drivers?
[02:45] <ebooa> channels
[02:45] <ebooa> yeap
[02:45] <gribelu> cck, actually.. seems that it might support AIGLX http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Beryl.2FAIGLX_.28Nvidia.29
[02:45] <ace0174> tovella if they were it wouldnt show the image... its LCD
[02:45] <ebooa> but now i can't even acess my own network
[02:45] <gribelu> cck, try the forums too.. they will help
[02:46] <tovella> ace0174: LCDs have refresh rates that are specific to each type - just like regular CRT displays.  give me a second.
[02:46] <cck> gribelu, i've fooloowed the officiel howto, i guess something's wrong somewhere .. maybe the latest release ?
[02:46] <jevangelo_> what would the horizontal and vertical refresh rates be for 80 hz
[02:46] <Vich> ebooa, what does ifconfig show?
[02:46] <ebooa> i got the packages that says therejust a sec
[02:46] <ace0174> tovella my sisplay shows a message when rates are not correct...
[02:47] <ace0174> thats souldnt be it
[02:47] <ebooa> eth0, eth1 lo
[02:47] <Vich> ah
[02:47] <tovella> ace0174: YOU'RE probably going to have to reconfigure your settings.
[02:47] <Vich> so it's not in the list
[02:48] <ebooa> it should be ra0 instead of eth1
[02:48] <Vich> what do you mean instead of?
[02:48] <FreeNet> anyone is free now.. to help me with SAMBA?
[02:48] <Vich> you don't have 2 ethernet devices?
[02:48] <cck> gribelu: i restart X with a new option in xorg, let's hope :p
[02:48] <Vich> eek
[02:48] <ebooa> yesterday i had ra0 instead of eth1 and i could see the networks in my range
[02:48] <tovella> ace0174: this command "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" can be used AFTER you press "CTRL-ALT-F1" and login from a shell prompt.
[02:49] <Vich> yeah ebooa
[02:49] <Vich> so you installed the serialmonkey drivers?
[02:49] <Vich> or the ralink ones?
[02:49] <ebooa> today instead of ra0 showed up eth1 in my wireless and i can't even see the networks
[02:49] <ebooa> yes
[02:49] <Vich> yeah
[02:49] <ebooa> sorry if it takes sometime to answer
[02:50] <Vich> that is odd
[02:50] <Eroick> So, my computer doesn't even see my wireless network dongle (according to lspci)
[02:50] <ebooa> i have to translate it from portuguese
[02:50] <ebooa> yea
[02:50] <ebooa> i know
[02:50] <gribelu> cck, dunno about nvidia but there's nothing (pretty much) wrong on the ATI side.. and trust me, you're on the good side
[02:50] <ebooa> i tried to reinstall the serailmonkey rt2500 package with synaptic
[02:50] <Myria> can ubuntu x86-64 run x86-32 linux programs?
[02:50] <Vich> portuguese?
[02:51] <ebooa> and it still crashes
[02:51] <ebooa> yea
[02:51] <ebooa> portuguese channel is off
[02:51] <ebooa> no one answers so...
[02:51] <Vich> ah
[02:51] <ozoneco> anyone read vbs csript?
[02:51] <ozoneco> script*
[02:51] <Vich> does your router use wpa?
[02:51] <ebooa> wpa??
[02:52] <ebooa> thats security key right?
=== DARKGuy_ is now known as DARKGuy
[02:52] <Vich> yeah
[02:52] <skiline2000> ebooa: yes
[02:52] <ebooa> like wep key
[02:52] <Vich> well
[02:52] <ebooa> right now its deactivated
[02:52] <Vich> ubuntu supports wep
[02:52] <Vich> but not wpa
[02:52] <Vich> ah ok, don't worry then
[02:52] <Vich> ebooa, did you follow a guide like: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241565&highlight=rt2500
[02:52] <Vich> ?
[02:52] <cck> gribelu: still crashing with 3 options in the xorg.conf :/
[02:53] <JavaDeveloper> hello, question for Gnome init.  For shell, I know I modify .bashrc for export $JAVA_HOME, but for Gnome, where do I modify? for example, I am creating a launcher in Gnome's panel and I tried using the Java that I specified in $JAVA_HOME in my .bashrc but it doesn't find it, it seems like it has its down environment variable scope, any idea?
[02:53] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: http://pastebin.ca/268849
[02:53] <Vich> because it's hard to remedy your problem without knowing what steps you took
[02:53] <Vich> I'd recommend reinstalling the driver
[02:53] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: just trying to determine its role
[02:53] <Myria> can ubuntu x86-64 run x86-32 programs?
[02:53] <ebooa> what i did was
[02:53] <ebooa> use the synaptic package manager
[02:53] <bruenig> Myria, not by default, you can do some things to make it possible. Takes some hacking around
[02:53] <tonyyarusso> Myria: Yes, but I'm not sure how it's done.
[02:53] <Myria> >_<
[02:54] <Myria> it should be a default option1
[02:54] <ebooa> to install rt2500 source and the other rt2500 package
[02:54] <bruenig> Myria, easier said than done
[02:54] <gribelu> cck, no clues... sorry... i'm new to linux and i spent my last few weeks fixing ati hardware... so i don't think i can help
[02:54] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: It looks like a "ctsrvr" or WMI service stopper thing
[02:54] <gribelu> cck, all i can say is that the nice forums will get you there
[02:54] <cck> if someone wants a fast pastebin, i made a fork in french here : http//paste.dryades.org
[02:54] <ebooa> after that i enter /etc/network/interfaces and added "auto ra0 ifacera0 inet dhcp"
[02:54] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: a prep utility is supposed to return a 1 0r a 0, will this detect that?
[02:54] <cck> gribelu: thanks anyway ;)
[02:54] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: for the current computer where the .vbs is run on (thus, the "." in strComputer)
[02:55] <ozoneco> k
[02:55] <ebooa> entered the /rt2500 direcotry and ran make
[02:55] <ebooa> after that i couldn't access any network
[02:55] <ebooa> i could see them but i couldn't acess them
[02:55] <ebooa> now i can't even see them
[02:55] <bitflip> ebooa: do you see an rt driver listed:  lsmod | grep rt
[02:56] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: Mmm I haven't used StopService() nor I even knew it existed, but that might be translated to a True, False, or maybe an error string *shrugs* some googling on StopService might help to know what does it return
[02:57] <ebooa> yes
[02:57] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: if StopService returns some bool variable, then yes, it's 1 or 0
[02:57] <ebooa> rt2500 175076 1
[02:57] <scane__> Hi :-) I start with an Ubuntu 6.10 AMD64 CD. I have only 800x600 screen. When I click Install I get windows in the install process where the ok-buttons are invisible because they are too low. The windows are just a little too big for 800x600. What can I do?
[02:57] <bitflip> ebooa: do you see an ra0 device listed with command:  ifconfig ra0
[02:57] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: there's a start and a stop script..but it all fails
[02:57] <bucky> Myria, here's the basic idea https://alioth.debian.org/docman/view.php/30192/21/debian-amd64-howto.html#id292437
[02:57] <DARKGuy> scane__: press the ALT key and drag the window with the left mouse button :)
[02:57] <bitflip> Vich: you too, eh?  :)
[02:57] <skiline2000> Question about installing the Nvidia 6600 driver.. I installed nvidia GLX and ran the "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" command and it gave me a message saying that the X file had been altered and it couldnt write to it but if i believed it was an error to type this command (cant remember the command nor can i get it to come up again) then i did the ctrl+alt backspace and i got a flash screen but when i reviewed the x11 i saw that the
[02:57] <ebooa> device not found
[02:58] <scane__> DARKGuy, cool thanks :-)
[02:58] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: i inherited the server, trying to decide if someone wrote this by scratch, or if the company provided it
[02:58] <bucky> Myria, there's prolly a ubuntu wiki for it somewhere
[02:58] <Vich> yeah, but I had no problems, bitflip ;)
[02:58] <ebooa> lol
[02:59] <bitflip> ebooa: sudo ifconfig ra0 down (this is redundant since ifconfig showed nothing BUT you have something tying up the device)
[02:59] <purem> can anyone tell me how to make shift+backspace not log me out?
[02:59] <purem> i do it about 40 times a day
[02:59] <Vich> hmm
[02:59] <purem> and curse each time
[02:59] <Vich> lol purem
[02:59] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: I wouldn't know what to tell you, but from the looks of it, I'd say it's just some vbs to stop services rather than starting them, and personally it doesn't look very "corporate" @.@
[02:59] <purem> :)
[02:59] <ebooa> no such device
[02:59] <purem> it's agonizing
[02:59] <Vich> purem, is it in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts?
[02:59] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: then again, "ctsrvr" might not be the real service name in the windows platform you're running that
[02:59] <ebooa> it couldn't get the interface marker

[03:03] <ace0174> i tried doing ctrl alt f1 before
[03:03] <DARKGuy> rowdy: Ah, nope :( I guess the issue is with the XP box though, since I connected another XP box and it didn't connect :/
[03:03] <rubix_> wooooooo
[03:03] <pagefault> I run it under a UML so I don't have a lot of control over what kernel is used and apparently 2.4 is no good

[03:04] <ebooa> but i installed wireless assistant
[03:04] <ebooa> and it says
[03:04] <nrdb> I think I might have damaged my modem, can I force it to dial even if it doesn't sense a dial tone ?
[03:04] <rubix_> man did I have some difficulties getting it running on this old laptop...but now i can write a howto so i can make someone else's life a little easier
[03:04] <DARKGuy> pydx100pre: bueno, aca hablan ingles asi que no puedo ayudarte mucho tampoco con impresoras y dudo que te entiendan aca, en el canal #ubuntu-es pueden entenderte porque hablan espaol, escribe /join #ubuntu-es :)
[03:04] <ebooa> radio of your wireless card is off
[03:04] <rowdy> has anybody Installed/configured twiki??
[03:04] <ace0174> i may try to kill gnome before it starts
[03:05] <rubix_> nrdb, your modem should dial wether or not it gets a dialtone
[03:05] <rubix_> nrdb, weather or not it gets a response depends
[03:05] <bitflip> ebooa: is this a laptop?
[03:05] <minerale> I just edited the menus, I added a new entry, I do not see the new entry, how can I "refresh" the menu ?
[03:05] <ebooa> i tried to turn it on but yep
[03:05] <pydx100pre> ya pero eso dond elo escribo
[03:05] <ebooa> it is a laptop
[03:05] <agonoruci> how come the sound on ubuntu sounds worse than on xp
[03:06] <rowdy> has anybody Installed/configured twiki, please. Have been stuck with a problem for over an hour??
[03:06] <bitflip> ebooa: and not to be insulting but you do have it on hardware wise before loading the module?
[03:06] <ebooa> yes
[03:06] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: Are you in the Services thing that's in the control panel? like, the window where you start and stop them ?
[03:06] <ebooa> it is an external card
[03:06] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: ya
[03:06] <Myria> is there a gcc with a 32 bit target i can use?
[03:06] <ebooa> i have in here for a long tima
[03:06] <agonoruci> the sound is not very good, its choppy and unclear coming out, I tested the same mp3 in windows and it works fine, im on ubuntu 6310
[03:06] <ebooa> and it still doesn't get anything
[03:07] <agonoruci> ubuntu 6.10
[03:07] <Myria> or do i need to install gcc source?
[03:07] <necrodrako> can some one ghelp me install myth tv
[03:07] <necrodrako> help*
[03:07] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: If I recall correctly, I think you might need to use the service's full name (I used to stop C-Dilla (some 3DSMAX service) using "net stop C-Dilla" instead of "CDLAC.EXE" (or something like that) so I think you have to use the name of the service
[03:07] <ace0174> tovella thx for your help, tomorrow ill try to work that out again
[03:07] <pydx100pre> alooo
[03:07] <tovella> ace0174: in that case, you may have to reboot.  when the grub boot loader is loading, you should be able to press "ESC" to get to the boot menu options. select the one that says Ubuntu....( recovery mode ).  This will take you to a shell prompt where you can type the comman.
[03:07] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: then again, I'm not really sure, but it's a good try
[03:08] <pydx100pre> diganme como entro a una pagina en espaol
[03:08] <Ralith> so, one of my interfaces keeps dropping its IP and routes at random intervals.
[03:08] <DARKGuy> pydx100pre: escribe /join #ubuntu-es y pregunta alla
[03:08] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: there's a start.bat and a start.vbs, also the same for stop......the contents of the bat is just "net start Faircom"
[03:08] <ace0174> tovella, you should have in mind that i didnt install it yet
[03:08] <ebooa> i think i might have found something...
[03:08] <ebooa> :S
[03:08] <tovella> ace0174: oh.
[03:08] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: does the bat work?
[03:08] <pydx100pre> donde escribo esa direccion?
[03:08] <DARKGuy> pydx100pre: ahi mismo donde estas escribiendo ahorita
[03:08] <ebooa> i have the same app of rt2500 installed twice
[03:08] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: Faircom is the name of the service that runs the ctsrvr.exe
[03:09] <ebooa> one on /usr and another on /home
[03:09] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: gotcha!
[03:09] <necrodrako> HEY
[03:09] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: then try to change ctsrvr in the vbs for Faircom and test ?
[03:09] <necrodrako> will some on ehelp me install myth tv please
[03:09] <ace0174> tovella thats what i'm trying to do... but its harder than i thought
[03:09] <Rug> Howdy all
[03:09] <tovella> ace0174: do the text based install, then use the command "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[03:09] <minerale> what is the default sound deamon on the latest stable ubuntu, is it Alsa ? Ess ?
[03:09] <Rug> How do I play .mkv video files?
[03:09] <ace0174> how do I do the text based install?
[03:09] <GaiaX11> pydx100pre: go to /join #ubuntu-es
[03:10] <ckarini>  how to enable direct rendering on your intel 82810
[03:10] <tovella> ace0174: it's really not hard - it's just that there are 1000 ways to skin a cat.  GNU/Linux offers a great deal of flexibility/freedom.
[03:10] <ckarini> i need help on  how to enable direct rendering on your intel 82810
[03:10] <Pelo> ace0174,  via the terminal
[03:11] <paueas> what could i do to troubleshoot if my system is failing on every other web page saying that the server had dropped the connection or that the connection has timed out?
[03:11] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: the start and stop bats work, as far as starting and stopping the service....the readme says "use a script to check for a 1 or a 0 after running bkupprep". this is what i dont see happening, do the scripts run when the bat is called?
[03:11] <Pelo> ckarini,   specifics would be helpfull
[03:11] <ace0174> whats the command to start the installation script?
[03:11] <Rug> paueas: check DNS
[03:11] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: i.e, what runs the scripts?
[03:11] <Pelo> ace0174, http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[03:12] <paueas> rug where?
[03:12] <ace0174> thx Pelo
[03:12] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: the scripts must be run by some interpreter, vbs is short for Visual Basic Script, there must be a program that can run that
[03:12] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: I don't think they run standalone
[03:12] <Rug> paueas: do you know what your DNS server settings are supposed to be?
[03:13] <ace0174> well tomorrow i'll work more on that. Thanks folks
[03:13] <ace0174> thx tovella
[03:13] <paueas> rug i do not, i am  actually troubleshooting to figure out what is going on with my girlfriends computer who is currently at a different campus
[03:13] <tovella> ace0174: no problem.
[03:14] <paueas> rug it happens with every browser i install on the system so i know its not the browser's fault
[03:14] <Rug> paueas: find out.  to see what the computer is using type this at a command prompt:  sudo cat /etc/resolv.conf
[03:14] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: what happens is the backupprep is ran, somewhere that leaves a marker as whether it failed or not. but nothing mentions where the result can be found
[03:15] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: the function returns the result, actually
[03:15] <ckarini>  im trying to install step mania, and jrib says i can do it if i enable direct rendering
[03:15] <ckarini> how do i do it?
[03:15] <paueas> rug so you think its the dns server that keeps timing out on her school's network?
[03:15] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: i dont understand programming, so i'm picturing the info in a text file or a reg key
[03:15] <jishin_> I got "! Font C70/song/m/n/10/30=cyberb30 at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file no
[03:15] <jishin_> t found.
[03:15] <jishin_> " when trying to compile TeX file
[03:16] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: ah no, you won't get it that way
[03:16] <Rug> paueas: my first guess is that the PC inst' setup right
[03:16] <jishin_> I used CJK package to make Japanese TeX document
[03:16] <Rug> is not setpu right
[03:16] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: http://pastebin.ca/268863
[03:16] <ozoneco> theres the start one
[03:17] <slew> hi, sometimes i get this: the xine engine failed to start. no demuxer found - stream format not recognised. how do i make streaming video work? the options on the Restricted Format page dont seem to work.
[03:17] <paueas> so if i edit her /etc/resolv.conf and put a different name server assuming hers is wrong this solves the problem?
[03:17] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: that should be checking for current state? btw.....thanks for the help, already further than i had hoped
[03:19] <homero> hola?
[03:19] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: heh, it's okay, I'm sorry I can't really clear it all up though :( - well... the start script doesn't check if the service is already stopped though

[03:21] <necrodrako> how do i enable the universe repository?
[03:21] <Pelo> necrodrako,   system > admin > update sources ( or what ever the repos gui is called in english)  ,  and just check all the boxes
[03:21] <Pelo> necrodrako,  patience
[03:22] <paueas> rug if i am simply correcting the name server.. i don't see why that would cause her system to not time out all the time?
[03:23] <ajcates> i have a bunch of packages that say that they have been kept back, how do i force apt to upgrade them?
[03:23] <Rug> paueas: if it cannot lookup IP's then it will timeout.
[03:23] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: is the query asking as to whether the sevice is currently stopped?
[03:23] <asgilder> Can anyone tell me what "UUID library (libuuid) not found" means and how to fix it?
[03:23] <Rug> paueas: check IP, gateway, DNS.
[03:23] <necrodrako> ok
[03:24] <necrodrako> so is it enabled now
[03:24] <paueas> rug ok i will look into that first, thank you
[03:24] <glick> anyone know how i can get the latest flightgear on ubuntu?
[03:25] <ajcates> can some one tell me whyi have a bunch of packages that say that they have been kept back and how do i force apt to upgrade them?

[03:27] <Surghi> hi
[03:27] <Megaqwerty> tovella: what is AFIAK?
[03:27] <tovella> As Far As I Know
[03:27] <Megaqwerty> oh, ok. thanks
[03:27] <tovella> should be AFAIK
[03:27] <Surghi> How does it come, that I get 100 private messages on DAL.net  but none on freenode?  How can one IRC net be so clean and the other one can't?
[03:28] <lumpki> Surghi, you have to register to pm here, i believe
[03:29] <Surghi> so if I register there will come annoying private messages
[03:29] <Surghi> good to know
[03:29] <lumpki> i dont get bothered  =/
[03:29] <MannyLNJ08753> I need some help. I'm running DSL linux and want to install Ununtu but the cd drive does not support booting and there is no floppy. Is there a **simple** way to do an install from insaide the other distro
[03:29] <tonyyarusso> I get maybe 2 unsolicited pms a week.
[03:30] <slew> nah none of those websites give any info on getting streams to work.
[03:30] <Surghi> tonyyarusso: so thats what I wonder about.  Why is freenode so clean?
[03:30] <Pelo> Surghi,  the other way around, if you register you can send annoying private messages,
[03:30] <tonyyarusso> Surghi: General atmosphere I guess.  #ubuntu-offtopic to continue?
[03:30] <Surghi> I don't wanna send private messages
[03:31] <Surghi> ok
[03:31] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: well, much appreciated, i understood enough about it to figure out it was just a password change now that i see the path it was on...thanks

[03:32] <ChocoCid> ah, clever

[03:33] <cck> someone has beryl on his edgy ? with an nvidia card ?
[03:33] <lumpki> asgilder, an error on ./configure?
[03:33] <Pelo> asgilder,   error msg while /config usualy refer to missing  dependencies,  you need to install the dependency befor continuing further,  then you run ./configure again , when you have gone throug ./configure without a hitch you are ready to make and then make install
[03:33] <Meshyf> Hey everyone.
[03:33] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: from the dates in the scheduler the backup hadn't ran for almost a year, they've been switching tapes everyday, not knowing any different
[03:34] <Pelo> !beryl  |cck
[03:34] <ubotu> cck: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:34] <slew> so there is no way to make streaming video work on firefox 2.0? i just get blank pages or frames where video is on the windows machine.
[03:34] <asgilder> Pelo, what dependency would the uuidlib package be in?
[03:34] <cck> thks pelo
[03:34] <Meshyf> I am having a problem with getting online using ubuntu on meh laptop.
[03:34] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: @_@ wow, gotta do backups every now and then ;)
[03:34] <Pelo> asgilder,  you look those up in synaptic
[03:35] <lumpki> apt-cache search uuid
[03:35] <Meshyf> Anyone think they could possibly help, with my internets on Ubuntu?
[03:35] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: we recently picked them up as clients, jumping the hoops trying to take care of them...figured a backup might be nice...its the local library
[03:35] <Pelo> Meshyf,   wireless router ?
[03:35] <MannyLNJ08753> mesha 1) How do you connect to the internet 2) Do you get an IP?
[03:36] <ummagumma> 1
[03:36] <Pelo> Meshyf,   MannyLNJ08753  means you
[03:36] <nata1> is there a way to change the resolution in shell/bash?
[03:36] <Meshyf> 1) Hoping to get the Wireless card working, but I have wired as well, just doesn't work. 2) I will check to see if I do or not.
[03:36] <Ralith> so, one of my interfaces keeps dropping its IP and routes at random intervals. Nothing in dmesg. Help?
[03:36] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: I see, pretty nice idea, good luck making the backups :)
[03:36] <budluva> hey can someone help me out here? im trying to install a Java game called 'Lux' and it comes in a .jar format, the install tells me to run java -jar Lux-install.jar, so i do that and get this ugly error message, does anyone know what im missing? Exception in thread "main" java.awt.AWTError: Cannot load AWT toolkit: gnu.java.awt.peer.gtk.GtkToolkit
[03:36] <MannyLNJ08753> Meshyf With the wired adapter attached do you get a light on the router/hub/swicth it is plugged into
[03:37] <Meshyf> Manny: Yes I do.
[03:37] <budluva> is there a gtktoolkit package im missing or something?
[03:37] <ozoneco> DARKGuy: it ran, but i'm remote, and it says it needs new media...so done tonight
[03:37] <Meshyf> Manny: No I'm not getting an IP addy. Its detecting my cards but not letting me connect :(
[03:37] <Pelo> Meshyf,  assuming you have a dsl connection (wired) just run ppp0econf from the terminal and answer the questions,  when in doubt go with  default
[03:37] <MannyLNJ08753> Meshyf good. Are you using a router?
[03:37] <Meshyf> Manny: Yes I am.
[03:38] <DARKGuy> ozoneco: Yay, gotta love when there's no more space @.@ hopefully youll get more for 'em tomorrow =)
[03:38] <MannyLNJ08753> Meshyf ok then do you know what IP the routher ues for the intrenal netowkr
[03:38] <php-freak> Any one know of a better irc client then xchat?
[03:38] <php-freak> like something similar to mirc
[03:38] <Meshyf> Manny: Yeah I can do that stuff.
[03:38] <station> wena
[03:39] <CVirus> php-freak: Konversation
[03:39] <nrdb> I think I might have damaged my modem, can I force it to dial even if it doesn't sense a dial tone ?
[03:39] <Meshyf> Manny: I'm pretty versed in Windows, just trying out Ubuntu on my laptop.
[03:39] <php-freak> Cvirus: konversation
[03:39] <MannyLNJ08753> Meshyf can you assign yourself a static IP in the same range and ping the internal port on the router
[03:39] <CVirus> php-freak: ?
[03:39] <Meshyf> Manny: Yeah give me a second. I'll give it a shot.
[03:39] <tonyyarusso> php-freak: irssi for cli
[03:40] <php-freak> I'm looking for something simliar to mirc, something better then xchat
[03:40] <MannyLNJ08753> Ok. I'm pretty new to linux also Meshyf but I help where I can. Right now I can't figure out how to install Ubuntu on one of my PC's so while I wait for help I'm helping others
[03:40] <Meshyf> Manny: Thanks :D
[03:40] <Pelo> php-freak,   mIRC is hardly better then xchat
[03:40] <ajcates> Pelo, i opened up the update manger, and it shows the updates i need, but there gray and it still won't let me upgrade them
[03:41] <nata1> is there a apt-get extension out there so that brings up alternatives on my own keywoards?
[03:41] <php-freak> Its a lot better
[03:41] <nata1> say, apt-search weather
[03:41] <php-freak> Whats so much better about xchat then mirc?
[03:41] <nata1> and it gives me the kde weather desktop thing?
[03:41] <nata1> php-freak: nothing at all.
[03:41] <Pelo> ajcates,  does the update manager give you a reason why the updates will not be made ?
[03:41] <Meshyf> Manny: Ok nevermind I have no idea how to do that lol

[04:12] <minerale> how can I edit the "menu" manually  -- ie where are the files for the menu stored ?
[04:12] <ChocoCid> try Qcad maybe?
[04:12] <Pelo> ChocoCid,  not up to scratch ,
[04:12] <ChocoCid> figured :\
[04:13] <ChocoCid> (i've used autocad for several years myself)
[04:13] <ChocoCid> minerale, you mean by editing a config file instead of using alacarte?
[04:13] <minerale> chococid: correct
[04:13] <Pelo> and there realy isn'T mucht aht I need to do on acad that can'T be done on 14,   2000 and up are mostly windows updates and eye candy
[04:13] <ChocoCid> hrm
[04:14] <ChocoCid> 2004 had some MAJOR updates for layer editing

[04:14] <fnf> minerale: /etc/xdg/menus/applications.menu
[04:14] <ChocoCid> laytrans is so amazingly amazing it's ridiculous, and refedit is awesome too
[04:14] <MannyLNJ08753> Meshyf sorry I can't be more help. I know very little about wireless and linux
[04:14] <lumpki> ChocoCid, on a 1.3 ghz machine with 256 mb ram, kde or gnome will run fine
[04:15] <Pelo> ChocoCid,  haven'T had much chance to work with those yet, I realy ahven'T drawn in about 2 years,
[04:15] <ChocoCid> yeah, that sounds more or less right, lumpki
[04:15] <minerale> fnf: I have a question, why is the debian-menu separate and not integrated with the main menu -- is it possible to join those together ?
[04:15] <lumpki> mored ram would be better, but still would be fine
[04:16] <pudland> is anyone using 32 bit ubuntu on a amd 64?
[04:16] <ChocoCid> i wouldn't mind the debian-menu being separate if it was an entirely DIFFERENT menu, not a submenu, but w/e
[04:16] <fnf> minerale: I'm on Ubuntu Edgy server with gnome installed, I haven't seen Debian menu anywhere, that's possibly added after you installed some Debian apps.
[04:16] <ChocoCid> alt-f2 ftw, i don't use the menu much at all :p
[04:16] <gopp> is thier a bsd version of ubuntu
[04:16] <gopp> freebsd
[04:16] <gopp> !bsd
[04:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bsd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:17] <ChocoCid> no, the debian menu is a menu you install that arranges stuff differently and has more stuff
[04:17] <ChocoCid> no ub(sd)untu
[04:17] <kitche> gopp: no why would there be BSD is a complete different OS
[04:17] <gopp> well I love thier kernel  hmm not sure
[04:17] <ChocoCid> there may be a debian variant on BSD like they have for Hurd
[04:17] <gopp> so thier no advantge of ubuntu on bsd
[04:17] <rubix_> has anyone here had problems using the ubuntu live install graphical install partition manager, i've read some things about it hanging and just had some problems, but i was wondering if it would be worth the time documenting how i worked around my problem

[04:17] <pudland> is anyone using 32 bit ubuntu on a amd 64?
[04:18] <xzk> rubix_:   yes i did
[04:18] <JVH> Newbie (idiot) requesting some assistance
[04:18] <ChocoCid> !ask
[04:18] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:18] <rubix_> xzk, what was the problem and what kinda system were you running, you may PM me the info if you would like
[04:18] <Pelo> JVH,   asking your question would be better
[04:18] <gopp> !hurd
[04:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hurd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:18] <asdasd_> Manny: Sorry about that the internet went out for a minute there.
[04:18] <kitche> gopp: hurd is gnu's OS
[04:18] <ChocoCid> no
[04:18] <ChocoCid> hurd is the kernel
[04:18] <kitche> goop: well gnu's kernel
[04:19] <ChocoCid> GNU is the same os on linux or hurd
[04:19] <fnf> rubix_: I haven't, but I prefer installing the light-weight server edition then install IceWM/gnome afterward.
[04:19] <ChocoCid> gNewSense is a Debian-based Hurd distro
[04:19] <lumpki> gopp, there is a debian/hurd project if you feel experimental
[04:19] <MannyLNJ08753> Anyone know how to start the Ubunto intaller while running another linux distro?
[04:19] <ChocoCid> it's still in unstable status
[04:19] <xzk> rubix_:   i couldn't get it to resize the winxp partition and when it would - it would say that there was insufficient space or something along those lines.. which wasn't true
[04:19] <gopp> nope just wonder why
[04:19] <JVH> I have installed ubuntu lamp server. I need to access the web based controls for a router. I can't find a browers anywhere in the system.
[04:19] <xzk> rubix_:   i'm using a compaq presario laptop v5000
[04:19] <kitche> ChocoCid: anyways gNewSense is linux not hurd
[04:19] <ChocoCid> oh, it is?
[04:19] <asdasd_> MannyLNJ09753: Sorry about that, my internet just went out for a second there.
[04:19] <ChocoCid> hrm
[04:19] <rubix_> fnf, well i had no internet connectivity and this laptop has a "Designed for Windows 98" logo sticker on it, 196 ram and 500 mhz p3, 12 gig hdd, so the live cd was really really slow
[04:20] <gopp> I got one last question is thier a project like wine, but that allows one to use osx apps in ubuntu osx x86 apps
[04:20] <ChocoCid> what is the debian hurd one called?
[04:20] <rubix_> xzk, i am using a presario laptop 1600
[04:20] <kitche> ChocoCid: the hurd kernel isn't really usuable
[04:20] <Iceman_B> uh, if any is using xchat, how does the nick completion work?
[04:20] <ChocoCid> Iceman_B : type "choc" and hit tab
[04:20] <Iceman_B> hitting tab floods my windows with nicks
[04:20] <rubix_> Iceman_B, you type a part of thier name and hit tab
[04:20] <fnf> rubix_: If you used Partition Magic or a kind of Partition Manager then it probably messed up your HDD.
[04:20] <Iceman_B> oh
[04:20] <JJones0207> Hello
[04:20] <Iceman_B> wth
[04:20] <ChocoCid> that's because you're doing like "C" and there's like 30 names that match it :P

[04:20] <fnf> rubix_: Did you try the alternate installation CD ?
[04:21] <JJones0207> May someone help me when I try to burn the alt installation cd Im getting a error
[04:21] <Iceman_B> ah, I see
[04:21] <Iceman_B> thanks :)
[04:21] <gopp> lumpki,  oh
[04:21] <xzk> rubix_:   does your laptop have a recovery partition built into it by HP.. instead of giving you recovery CDs they put the OS and other reinstall software on a hidden partition.. and thats what was messing mine up i think
[04:21] <rubix_> fnf, i had no way to get it other then go to my friend's house, download it, then burn it and go back to my house and try to install...i found it much easier to just do a workaround
[04:21] <MannyLNJ08753> JJones0207 did you check the md checksup is correct and whta burning app did you try?
[04:21] <JJones0207> I have tried different brands, Ive burned ubuntu before.
[04:21] <JJones0207> Nero
[04:21] <JJones0207> md checksup whats that
[04:21] <ChocoCid> possible you just got a bad download
[04:21] <diskus> kitche: it's not hurd kernel :P
[04:21] <ChocoCid> !checksum
[04:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about checksum - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:21] <ChocoCid> er
[04:21] <ChocoCid> there's a page for it somewhere :\
[04:21] <rubix_> xzk, so my hdd might actually be bigger?
[04:22] <JJones0207> So what should Ido?
[04:22] <xzk> rubix_:   i ordered my recovery CDs from HP, and then i erased the recovery partition they installed so that i could use that space.. and after i did that - linux let me resize the partitions just fine
[04:22] <Myria> how do i download source code to a package?
[04:22] <ChocoCid> !packagin
[04:22] <ChocoCid> !packaging
[04:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about packagin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:22] <rubix_> xzk, i know my laptop had a corrupted recovery partition...i had a few problems....but i just used fdisk to clear my hdd and then set new partitions
[04:22] <ubotu> The packaging guide is at http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/index.html - Other developer resources are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperResources
[04:22] <ChocoCid> silly typo on my part >_<
[04:22] <JJones0207> I might of got a bad download your saying?
[04:22] <ajcates> does any one know the command to fix broken packages?
[04:22] <xzk> rubix_:   i guess that 'recovery' partition was protecting itself from being touched when i was resizing winxp the first time around
[04:22] <jrib> Myria: apt-get source package   assuming you have the deb-src line in your sources.list
[04:23] <jrib> ajcates: sudo apt-get install -f
[04:23] <fnf> rubix_: Repairing boot sectors for a correct partition layout is not so peaceful, part of the reason is most Partition Managers are very forgiving and just want to build an usable partition layout, which often leave it non-standard.
[04:23] <jrib> ajcates: _tries_ to fix
[04:23] <binary2k2> hi, i'm having a problem with firefox 2.0 on edgy, it won't open, just show's this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35514/
[04:23] <JJones0207> ChocoCid so what should I do at this point?
[04:23] <rubix_> fnf, right, but how about ghkdisk, or something similar
[04:23] <ChocoCid> JJones0207: i dunno, i never did it
[04:23] <rubix_> fnf, if you write zero's to the drive that would definately do the trick
[04:23] <ChocoCid> i just downloaded, burned, and if it was bad just planned on reburning it :P
[04:23] <ChocoCid> hey, a use for /dev/zero !
[04:24] <rubix_> fnf, its a DOS utility i have on my gateway oem disks from back in the day, but it definately does the trick
[04:24] <fnf> rubix_: I never heard about ghkdisk though. cfdisk is the most partition editor outthere that conforms to the standard.
[04:24] <rubix_> the gateway tech support tried to have me do that when my mouse wouldn't work
[04:24] <JJones0207> I tried reburning 6 times lol
[04:25] <rubix_> fnf, ghkdisk isn't a program, but a command i guess you could say
[04:25] <Iceman_B> bed, nite o/
[04:25] <jrib> JJones0207: what speed are you burning at?
[04:25] <rubix_> its similar to scandisk in structure and user interface....but way more dangerous
[04:25] <kdm__> /leave
[04:25] <rubix_> i just got the net back after a year so i'm way behind on all the new technology
[04:25] <Myria> choco: i thought that allocating memory in linux was done by calling mmap() on /dev/zero
[04:25] <JJones0207> Im going to try to reburn and paste the log to u
[04:26] <rubix_> however DOS and linux both recognize my total disk space as 12 gigs...so im pretty sure thats what i got
[04:26] <JVH> as I was saying I can't access any of the web config screens because there does not appear to be any brower. No GUI shell ether just bash. How are you suppose to configure attached routers and access points?
[04:26] <JJones0207> 4x 600
[04:26] <fnf> rubix_: I have no idea about it, sorry. If you don't prefer to mess with the part table manually (fdisk would do the trick), I'd suggest backup and delete the window partition to see if it works, not guaranteed though.
[04:26] <rubix_> fnf, i don't have a windows partition
[04:26] <Myria> jrib: where does it get installed?
[04:27] <xzk> anybody know of a 'GOOD' radio station.. for linux that would be equivalent to Yahoo's Music Engine / Jukebox / LaunchCast Radio ?... I love me some LaunchCast Radio :(
[04:27] <jrib> JVH: lynx?
[04:27] <jrib> Myria: current working directory
[04:27] <Myria> k thanks
[04:27] <JVH> isn't lynx text only?
[04:27] <djsmacedo> anybody speak portuguese?
[04:27] <jrib> JVH: yes
[04:27] <jrib> djsmacedo: yes
[04:27] <xzk> me too
[04:27] <fnf> rubix_: That was from someone else, sorry.
[04:28] <xzk> i speak african american
[04:28] <Cade> lol @ xzk
[04:28] <djsmacedo> timo! :)
[04:28] <djsmacedo> facilita mais a minha vida
[04:28] <JVH> I don't think that will work with a linksys router config page.
[04:28] <djsmacedo> :)
[04:28] <jrib> djsmacedo: vomos ao #ubuntu-pt
[04:28] <xzk> i also speak um.. caucasian american
[04:28] <fnf> rubix_: Can you try the alternate CD ?
[04:28] <Cade> I speak Yankee American >_>
[04:28] <JJones0207> Ok ChocoCid
[04:29] <Cade> which apparently is a bad thing down South
[04:29] <xzk> both of my parents are from south africa.. so that makes me an african american
[04:29] <JJones0207> It says Focus or tracking error
[04:29] <binary2k2> anyone able to help with a firefox error?
[04:29] <JJones0207> Could not preform end track
[04:29] <rubix_> fnf, na, i don't have a burner on here and my other comp out in my storage shed....small house so this laptop is perfect, its old but not ancient, and i got it and a NICE pair of 10 inch subwoofers for a car for 50 bucks
[04:29] <Cade> xzk, one of the few actual ones then, eh?
[04:29] <JJones0207> invalid write state
[04:29] <rubix_> fnf, sometimes its nice to know junkies :-)
[04:29] <xzk> i'm white
[04:29] <JJones0207> So whats wrong?
[04:29] <fnf> rubix_: Definitely :)
[04:29] <Cade> I figured. ;)
[04:30] <rubix_> so i sold the subs for 50 bucks and got a free laptop
[04:30] <jrib> JVH: no idea, did you try?
[04:30] <Manse> what does the /usr/src/rpm folder use for in ubuntu?
[04:30] <Cade> Not many black people here in the US would ever say "caucasian"
[04:30] <JVH> 2 hours.
[04:30] <rubix_> Manse, is that folder even exist in ubuntu?
[04:30] <Cade> :P
[04:30] <fnf> rubix_: Either way, the LiveCD isn't as stable as server or alternate CD, there have been quite a few bug reports.
[04:30] <Manse> yes
[04:30] <Cade> let alone pronounce it correctly
[04:30] <jrib> JVH: well you can always install X
[04:30] <xzk> that was kind of racist
[04:30] <kitche> Manse: that's probably the source directory for rpm which used to be called red hat package manager
[04:31] <Cade> I don't mean it in a racist way... just a factual one.
[04:31] <Manse> well
[04:31] <Cade> I come from up North.
[04:31] <fnf> Manse: It doesn't exist in my installation.
[04:31] <Cade> So this "aks"ing I get all the time
[04:31] <rubix_> fnf, but i got it running....so i figured i would write somewhat of a howto on using it for low-level systems and seeing what kinda feedback i would get....mabye the official ubuntu forums would be a good place to put it?
[04:31] <Cade> is rather... eh... unsettling at best
[04:31] <ozoneco> so if i installed to harddrive from Live cd, its not right?
[04:31] <xzk> white people talk like that too
[04:31] <okn> hey
[04:31] <Manse> fnf:Is your distribution ubuntu?
[04:31] <fnf> rubix_: That's definitely worth it :) may have someone else.
[04:31] <JJones0207> Can someone help me
[04:31] <Cade> xzk, quite
[04:31] <JJones0207> Please
[04:32] <fnf> Manse: Mine is Ubuntu Edgy server.
[04:32] <JVolt> Hello
[04:32] <okn> just installed ubuntu but my console looks like shit..very very large fonts..how can i make this more beautiful ? :P ?
[04:32] <Cade> however, one creates the stereotype based upon the majority - or at least a parody of the majority
[04:32] <kitche> ozoneco: that's how ubuntu installs if you used the desktop-install
[04:32] <Manse> well,mine is Ubuntu desktop
[04:32] <xzk> anybody know of a 'GOOD' radio station.. for linux that would be equivalent to Yahoo's Music Engine / Jukebox / LaunchCast Radio ?... I love me some LaunchCast Radio :(
[04:32] <rubix_> fnf, the problem was i havn't really used a computer for the net at all in the last 2 years....really even a computer at all, and on top of that no linux system....i still got warty warthog on my comp in the shed imma hook up...but its so unstable i'm probably going to wipe it
[04:32] <JVolt> Do anyone know how can i set a new password to root? i has installed ubuntu now but i don't know the password
[04:32] <JJones0207> Can you help me Manse
[04:33] <ozoneco> kitche: someone mentioned an alternate cd?
[04:33] <kitche> !root|JVolt
[04:33] <ubotu> JVolt: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:33] <fnf> rubix_: It's funny that after those couple of dialogs I still hadn't known what your problem was :)
[04:33] <Manse> what can i do for you?
[04:33] <rubix_> JVolt, first of all, google is your friend, and second system-->administration-->users and groups
[04:33] <kitche> ozoneco: yes there is one from releases.ubuntu.com
[04:33] <Manse> <JJones0207>what can i do for you?
[04:34] <JJones0207> Umm when I try to burn the CD it gives me a error
[04:34] <xzk> I need a LaunchCast Radio equivalent for Linux :(
[04:34] <fnf> rubix_: What does you have there ? an Edgy LiveCD ?
[04:34] <rubix_> fnf, when i ran the livecd it was incredibly so, and on top of that the installer crashed when i tried to run it, then the custom disk partitioner wouldn't work, so i did a full wipe and it worked
[04:34] <JVolt> Thanks very much :)
[04:34] <rubix_> fnf, yes
[04:34] <wastrel> how do i input non-ascii chars (accented characters) in gnome?  US keyboard layout.
[04:34] <ChocoCid> !rootsudo
[04:34] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[04:34] <ozoneco> kitche: ok, i'm good then, same iso name
[04:34] <kitche> xzk: there isn't really one all you have to do is install the codecs and select WMP and it might work
[04:35] <rubix_> JVolt, your welcome
[04:35] <Cade> Having fun, ChocoCid?
[04:35] <Manse> Sorry ,I didn't burn cd in ubuntu ,maybe someone else can help you
[04:35] <JJones0207> When I try to burn it it says Could not prefom end track
[04:35] <xzk> kitche:   wmp?
[04:35] <ChocoCid> heh
[04:35] <kitche> xzk: windows media player
[04:35] <JJones0207> ChocoCid
[04:35] <xzk> kitche:   i know that, but LaunchCast Radio is setup to only work with IE
[04:35] <fnf> rubix_: parted isn't really happy with some partition layout, in your case the incorrect partitions might be the cause for this. Glad that it worked anyway.
[04:35] <ChocoCid> JJones0207: i've never had a bad download so i dunno :\
[04:35] <dabaR> xzk: you can search google for internet radio...
[04:35] <JJones0207> I downloaded it off torrent
[04:36] <kitche> xzk: shoutcast.com and use xmms or another player that you like
[04:36] <Cade> BTW, guys, the Feisty forums just _CRACK_ me up... I felt so bad... One guy came home drunk and -apparently- ran "sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/dpkg"
[04:36] <Cade> funniest thread title _ever_, btw
[04:36] <xzk> kitche:   it doesn't work with Firefox in winXP... so instead of listening to LaunchCast with IE in winxp I downloaded Yahoo Music Engine hehe.. to keep from using IE :)
[04:36] <fnf> rubix_: To ensure there will be no hassle in the future, you may want to use cfdisk, as parted isn't fully standard conformant
[04:36] <rubix_> cfdisk, i havn't heard of it
[04:37] <kitche> xzk: well yahoo is friends with microsoft so I m not surprised
[04:37] <dabaR> wastrel: apps>accessories>char map
[04:37] <fnf> rubix_: The LiveCD includes one, it's very easy to use (easier than parted I expect, which gparted bases on)
[04:37] <xzk> companies are so evil
[04:37] <rubix_> i think im going to try to play a DVD, think that works right out of the box?

[04:38] <JJones0207> I dont want to spend another hour downloading it
[04:38] <rubix_> fnf, and i'm also running a social experiment of sorts...i have 2 female roomates with only nominal computer knowledge, and i set up linux on this laptop for them to use for school and only told them how to login and logout to see how well they could actually use it
[04:38] <JJones0207> Whats a bad download when its the same size as the other ones on the site
[04:39] <Cade> rubix_, open Synaptic and install libdvdread3 and then run "sudo  /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh"
[04:39] <rubix_> fnf, that and i didn't want to worry about spyware and viruses and such that come with windows, practically on the cd
[04:39] <kitche> JJones0207: run a md5sum on the iso
[04:39] <gansinho> please someone could please help me to configurate my palm with ubuntu?
[04:39] <tonyyarusso> rubix_: Interesting.  Keep us posted?
[04:39] <oc15> I am trying to get FreeNas working but I can't get pass the install
[04:39] <fnf> rubix_: I have installed Ubuntu for a few friends on mine also, they're currently really happy, surely I set them up the installed everything beforehand.

[04:40] <rubix_> tonyyarusso, sure, maybe that would be another good thread to post, ima sign up for an ubuntu forums accout, or could anyone suggest a good community
[04:40] <gansinho> dabaR, thanks!
[04:40] <tonyyarusso> rubix_: On the forums would be great, or the sounder mailing list
[04:40] <rubix_> Cade, could i just sudo apt-get install? that will do the same right?
[04:40] <dabaR> rubix_: wiki is another option, wiki.ubuntu.com
[04:41] <rubix_> Cade, im a bit rusty
[04:41] <Cade> rubix_,  for installing libdvdread3, yes
[04:41] <gansinho> !palm > gansinho
[04:41] <fnf> rubix_: Synaptic is a front-end of apt-get, so yes.
[04:41] <Cade> but the other command still has to be run as-is from terminal :)
[04:41] <rubix_> Cade, for some reason i prefer command line, when i used windows i spent alot of time booting into dos
[04:41] <dabaR> gansinho: read private message from ubotu
[04:41] <Cade> so the following would work: "sudo apt-get install libdvdread3 && sudo  /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh"
[04:42] <gansinho> dabaR, I readed but my fx crashed, sorry

[04:43] <fnf> kitche: Probably, that was my guest :)
[04:43] <coz_> JVolt, what do you want to install?
[04:43] <rubix_> JVolt, give me one second
[04:43] <fnf> JVolt: What do you want to install ?
[04:43] <tonyyarusso> ubuntu: You might consider changing your nick to something more personal (since it's default it can get confusing)
[04:43] <kitche> read he said php5 :)
[04:43] <ubuntu> anyone here know what this means "No Xll!" "install X-windows development headers/libraries " ?
[04:43] <JVolt> PHP 5

[04:45] <ubotu> murali: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:46] <Pelo> murali,  we will not help you if you don'T get into soem specifics
[04:46] <diabolix> i just installed beryl, and when i run it, my screen goes white.. anyone expiriece this?
[04:46] <Cade> diabolix, graphics card?
[04:46] <kitche> JVolt: that's why your still on ubuntu 5.05 you need to update to dapper then edgy
[04:46] <diabolix> geforce 6200
[04:46] <murali> sorry..it seems i'm already losin it..k i'll directly post the question then
[04:46] <Cade> you installed the nvidia drivers that support AIGLX?
[04:46] <diabolix> did the same thing in arch-linux.
[04:46] <dabaR> kitche: ya, still on ubuntu 5.05...
[04:46] <rubix_> JVolt, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_add_extra_repositories
[04:46] <fnf> JVolt: 5.05 is really old now, I'd suggest upgrade to 6.06, that's probably what is misssing in your edition.
[04:46] <diabolix> Cade: yep.
[04:47] <murali> i jus installed ubuntu..
[04:47] <Cade> hmm... you're using beryl-manager to start beryl?
[04:47] <diabolix> yep.
[04:47] <JVolt> i see but i has done a dist-upgrade
[04:47] <rubix_> follow the instructions there and do a "sudo apt-get update-install
[04:47] <Cade> restart X after installing beryl?
[04:47] <diabolix> yep
[04:47] <Cade> perhaps it's a bad xorg option?
[04:47] <murali> i wanted to do programming in c..then  i realised tht theres no compiler..hence i did apt-get install gcc
[04:47] <kitche> JVolt: well dist-upgrade will not update your distro if you don't edit your source.list

[04:48] <Ubuntu-addict> one*
[04:48] <diabolix> kitche: inside kde.
[04:48] <Myria> "apt-get source gcc" didn't give me the source to GCC, just to some 4.0 to 4.0.3 patch

[04:49] <dabaR> JVolt: send /exec -o cat /etc/issue as a message to the channel
[04:49] <diabolix> Cade: i followed a guide... how can i tell?
[04:49] <Cade> rubix_, I'd assume... it SHOULD automount on insert iirc
[04:49] <JVolt> i prefer the 32 bits one
[04:49] <Cade> ah... kk hold on one sec
[04:49] <murali> i also have problems with my screen resolution
[04:49] <JVolt> send /exec -o cat /etc/issue
[04:49] <dabaR> no send
[04:49] <rubix_> my /mnt directory is empty :-(
[04:50] <murali> it jus gives me one option:640/480
[04:50] <Cade> diabolix, was it from beryl wiki?
[04:50] <JVolt> Ubuntu 5.04 "Hoary Hedgehog" \n \l
[04:50] <diabolix> Cade: yes
[04:50] <dabaR> JVolt: so you have hoary.
[04:50] <Myria> how do i download the source to GCC?
[04:50] <diabolix> i think...
[04:50] <Pelo> rubix_,  in ubuntu media is mounted in /media/
[04:50] <Cade> rubix_, "sudo mount /dev/floppy"
[04:50] <dabaR> !info php5 hoary
[04:50] <ubotu> Package php5 does not exist in hoary
[04:50] <ArrenLex> Myria: What would you use to compile it?
[04:50] <dabaR> !upgrade > JVolt
[04:50] <JVolt> can i upgrade it to edgy without need reinstall?
[04:50] <kitche> JVolt: you have to update to breezy then dapper then edgy
[04:50] <rubix_> didn't work
[04:50] <xzk> what is CrossOver ? Is it still around or is it a dead Linux App?
[04:51] <Pelo> murail,  you can edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf manualy to add the resolutions you need/want
[04:51] <kitche> xzk: it's a commerical app
[04:51] <dabaR> JVolt: follow instructions in the upgrade page ubotu sent you.
[04:51] <Myria> ArrenLex: itself.  i want to build a x86-32 cross compiler for my x86-64 ubuntu machine
[04:51] <ArrenLex> xzk: Crossover is basically a version of Wine that's configured for you, and you have to pay for it.
[04:51] <Myria> ArrenLex: got binutils working already
[04:51] <ArrenLex> Myria: I'm pretty sure you can just... do that. o_O
[04:51] <JVolt> ok thanks :)
[04:51] <rubix_> /dev/ is not a block device
[04:51] <ArrenLex> Myria: by passing GCC architecture switches.
[04:51] <murali> when i try to change my screen resolution from the gui,i see tht theres only one option:640/480..there are no other options.. wat should i do,cuz the window sizes are too big this way..
[04:51] <xzk> ah nvm that
[04:52] <dabaR> Myria: apt-get src is the command for getting source of packages.
[04:52] <xzk> i installed linux to be free of paying money for software
[04:52] <Pelo> murali,  before editing xorg.conf you want might to   do  dkpg reconfigure xserver.xorg   ,  just to make sure
[04:52] <fnf> murali: Take a look at the /etc/X11/xorg.conf, or invoke 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[04:52] <haary> xzk: then try wine
[04:52] <Myria> ArrenLex: "gcc -march=i686 -c asdf.c" gives "asdf.c:1: error: CPU you selected does not support x86-64 instruction set"
[04:52] <murali> pelo:thanks
[04:52] <xzk> i think I'm going to test out vmware for launchcast - i read that it works pretty well
[04:53] <Myria> dabar: when i did apt-get source gcc, it only gave me a small patch
[04:53] <murali> fnf:thanks
[04:53] <JVolt> dabaR, so i need upgrade it to 5.10 and later upgrade to 6.06 and later to 6.10? or can i upgrade 5.04 to 6.10?
[04:53] <dabaR> JVolt: No.1.
[04:53] <kitche> Myria: well that does i686 doesn't support x86-64 it would be x86-64 or x86_64
[04:53] <fnf> JVolt: It's safer (and faster) to do a new installation I supposed.
[04:54] <Myria> kitche: i'm trying to cross-compile
[04:54] <Ubuntu-addict> how do i get motif headers ? an idea which package to get ?
[04:54] <JVolt> i see
[04:54] <fnf> JVolt: ince you've got Hoary, after upgrading the OS, you also have to upgrade all the old packages anyway.
[04:54] <kitche> Myria: you trying to compile on a pure x86_64?
[04:54] <oc15> Trying to get FreeNas in place but getting problem after installing it
[04:54] <JVolt> i thought that the apt-get dist-update could make it 6.10
[04:54] <dabaR> libmotif-dev likely, Ubuntu-addict
[04:54] <Myria> kitche: i guess...  /usr/lib32 has the 32 bit libraries, and /usr/include seems to be capable of doing both modes
[04:55] <Ubuntu-addict> o, ok, thx
[04:55] <oc15> Anyone here know FreeNAS?
[04:55] <kitche> JVolt: well it would if you edit source.list but you will have breakages
[04:55] <Cade> diabolix, I'd review this stuff:
[04:55] <fnf> JVolt: Not that I know of, I can imagine it would take a few days to upgrade to 6.10 though :)
[04:55] <JVolt> :(
[04:55] <dabaR> oc15: knowing what error you get might help us fix the error.
[04:55] <Myria> apt-get source gcc actually gave the full source, just tar'd, and there were a bunch of patches that i don't think it applied...
[04:55] <murali> pelo,fnf:when i do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg,its askin me as to hou much memory to be used by the video card... wat will be the correct or optimum value???
[04:55] <kitche> Myria: try -mcpu=i686 -march=i686
[04:55] <dabaR> fnf: don't say that. It would obviously depend on the Internet connection.
[04:55] <ArrenLex> Myria: pass -m32
[04:56] <dabaR> JVolt: if you upgrade, make sure you read all the instructions for each upgrade.
[04:56] <JVolt> ok i will try get a 6.10 cd with any friend, else i will download it tomorow and install
[04:56] <Pelo> murali,  what do you have it set to in your bios ? use that
[04:56] <oc15> dabaR: after i install it, i cant connect to it in the browser
[04:56] <Cade> diabolix,  http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA#Post-install_configuration
[04:56] <fnf> dabaR: I see, but installing by apt-get is pretty slow compared to using a download manager.
[04:56] <Pelo> murali,  and for the rest , when in doubt , use the default answers
[04:57] <diabolix> sweet.. beryl is working, i just had to disable blurs.
[04:57] <diabolix> but it isn't decorating windows...
[04:57] <diabolix> how do i do that?
[04:57] <kitche> diabolix: well you have to choose a window border theme in emerald
[04:57] <JVolt> thanks guys :) i gtg to sleep. Maybe tomorow i back . Cya :)
[04:57] <fnf> !bye
[04:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bye - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[04:57] <Myria> ArrenLex: heh i figured out on my own just now alt-tabbed.  works great, lol.  thanks for your help though
[04:57] <Cade> is Emerald selected under the windec option?
[04:57] <fnf> *shrug* okay ubotu
[04:58] <Pelo> diabolix,  curtains, drapes, blinds, your choice realy
[04:58] <murali> pelo:do they have any optimum or default values..as in this much would atleast be necessary??
[04:58] <kitche> Cade: emerald is a seperate program that does window border decorations
[04:58] <Cade> kitche - right
[04:58] <Pelo> murali,  probably not,,  how much memory do you have dedicated to your video right now ?
[04:58] <Cade> it's usually pulled in with beryl
[04:59] <JVolt> many peoples is using ubuntu 64 bits version?
[04:59] <Cade> as a dependency >_>
[04:59] <diabolix> how do i spin the cube around?
[04:59] <Cade> lol
[04:59] <rubix_> hmmm....for some reason i can't mount floppy, mabye a permission issue?
[04:59] <diabolix> other than changing desktops?
[04:59] <Cade> either Ctrl+alt+left or right arrow
[04:59] <Pelo> diabolix,  #xgl
[04:59] <Cade> OR
[04:59] <JVolt> i tried it but things as flash player don't work
[04:59] <Cade> ctrl+alt+left click
[04:59] <coz_> diabolix, hold down ctrl+alt
[04:59] <JVolt> so i gave up and back to 32 bits version
[04:59] <rubix_> well the floppy is a fat32 volume, will that make a difference
[04:59] <coz_> diabolix, then either use the arrow buttons or you mouse to move the cube
[05:00] <diabolix> awsome!!

[05:04] <ArrenLex> ChocoCid: If less is more, then it stands to reason that the less effort I put into my job, the more money I will make.

[05:08] <ChocoCid> heh, slashdot's current headline is rather funny

[05:11] <fnf> ct12am: Doing a symlink or modifying /etc/passwd would do the trick.
[05:11] <ct12am> Can you install perl modules with apt instead?
[05:11] <ct12am> ah, fnf, thank you much
[05:12] <rance> yes, I can, but I dont think ALL perl modules are available with apt are they?

[05:16] <KanRiNiN_> Hi guys.  I'm replacing the Intel2100 in my laptop with another miniPCi card.  Which chipsets do you recommend that are well-supported in Ubuntu?  RALINK?  Atheros?  VIA?  Also has anybody used a pre-N chipset?
[05:16] <rance> make test says that it cant without a successful make
[05:16] <ct12am> ah of course...
[05:17] <fnf> rubix_: No, as /dev is not qualify to anything that's a directory consists of other devices.
[05:17] <nomasteryoda> Kanafani, i'm using an Intel chip i bought for $22 ... think its a 2200
[05:17] <nomasteryoda> works very nicely in Ubuntu
[05:18] <rubix_> fnf, what would be a good line, i'm pretty sure my floppy is listed as fd0
[05:18] <rance> I have more than a few custom perl scripts that I am gonna have to rewrite if I can't get the modules installed they were written for

[05:18] <VonGuard> i shall never understand wireless. i am perpetually stuck in a wireless miasma
[05:18] <VonGuard> a non-functional one
[05:19] <fnf> rubix_: 'mount -v /dev/fd0 <mount-point>' would work (I'm not sure it's the right way though), another way is to 'mkdir /media/fd0' then do 'pmount /dev/fd0'
[05:19] <Pelo> VonGuard,  you might find something helpufll here  http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84
[05:20] <VonGuard> thanks
[05:20] <VonGuard> but i have a specific problem
[05:20] <fnf> rubix_: mount requires root permission, while pmount is for regular user, pomount needs the appropriate directory in media
[05:20] <VonGuard> i can't see any networiks, aside from my primary one
[05:20] <rubix_> fnf, could you elaborate a bit, you kinda confused me
[05:20] <VonGuard> even in a wireless rich environment, nothing comes up in preference
[05:21] <rubix_> fnf, thanks, there it goes...should i change my line in fstab?
[05:21] <VonGuard> i am screwed
[05:21] <fnf> rubix_: In Ubuntu mount and pmount packages are usually installed. To mount any device you need root permission, to avoid the situation, there's pmount package that can mount removable devices which doesn't requires root permission
[05:22] <VonGuard> my laptop is essentially useless to me because of this issue
[05:22] <Pelo> VonGuard,  just get your own connection instead of leaching off other ppl's
[05:22] <VonGuard> i have one pelo
[05:22] <VonGuard> at home

[05:23] <rubix_> fnf, i have root priveledges but there is no way in hell i'm giving it to the girls
[05:23] <VonGuard> anyway, thanks for the help
[05:23] <fnf> rubix_: You can configure GNOME to automount using pmount, that's the default though, in System--> Preferences--> Removable Devices..
[05:24] <fnf> rubix_: As far as I can remember, you'd need the appropriate entry in /etc/fstab and a directory with the same name: With CDs, you need /dev/cdrom entry in fstab and /media/cdrom direcotry
[05:25] <tonyyarusso> rubix_, fnf: Add user to the options to allow non-root mounting

[05:28] <crass> when I have a removable device with multiple partitions, if I eject one, they are all ejected.  Can this behaviour be changed?
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> wylde, mplayer is good and the plugin works well with firefox

[05:39] <astx813> MrKeuner: yeah, but then what about all the files owned by said user?
[05:39] <interskh> PecisDarbs, i have installed libgcc
[05:40] <chewy> h08817, cause my bud uses windows and needs to read the data on this cd?
[05:40] <Pelo> interskh,  just search for libgcc  , not for *_s.lso  etc
[05:40] <rubix_> i know it isn't necessary to compile my own kernel, but i was wondering if it would help out at all...i would like device manager to have specific info on all my hardware
[05:40] <MrKeuner> astx813: that's a different thing, if you want that too, chown user:group *.filesyoulike -R
[05:40] <Pelo> interskh,  and reinstall ,
[05:40] <h08817> and windows doesn't acknowledge the cd?
[05:40] <chewy> crass: jouliet has been enabled all along
[05:40] <h08817> all the files are not windows type
[05:40] <chewy> h0817 yes
[05:41] <regeya> f8 people like my parents don't want to see it happen (and it's my last OT message for now) partially b/c having ms die would affect them they way enron dying affected other people.
[05:41] <h08817> does his cdrom drive even work?
[05:41] <astx813> MrKeuner: so I basically have to manually track down the abandoned files...
[05:41] <crass> chewy: well could be a number of things, like it being a bad cd (see if linux reads it)
[05:41] <interskh> Pelo, i'll have a try, thx
[05:41] <MrKeuner> astx813: what do you mean abandoned files?
[05:41] <h08817> i just want linux on one hd and windows on the other i had windows and linux on the same hd  but i want em split up any ideas?
[05:41] <chewy> crass: it does, i check them before sending them over to him, plus k3b verifies them good
[05:41] <h08817> i tried it before and it didn't work right
[05:42] <astx813> Changing the uid for mythtv's login, so there are videos and crap all over my hd that belong to that user
[05:42] <f8> regeya: they aren't going to disappear overnight. The world is just changing and they are not.
[05:42] <chewy> will enabled Rock Ridge hurt?
[05:42] <f8> unless they act fast it will change them out of a monopoly
[05:42] <crass> chewy: no
[05:42] <JJones0207> Hey
[05:42] <MrKeuner> you can easily find files belong to a UID or GID by using find
[05:42] <regeya> chewy, shoudn't
[05:43] <h08817> is installing on another hd differnet from the same hd? i can just switch hds back and forth in bios and its ok right?
[05:43] <JJones0207> Im back now my problem is it cant mount the CD
[05:43] <MrKeuner> astx813: find / -uid 6666 -exec chown otheruser:othergroup {} \;
[05:43] <regeya> MKeuner: 'man find' tells me that -user and -group work, and you can specify uid/gid
[05:44] <orion2012> h08817: yea, you can switch the BIOS to boot from one or the other, I used to do that
[05:44] <orion2012> h08817: grub makes things easier though, less rebooting
[05:44] <h08817> orion2012, yeah i used to have it like that but i don't want to reinstall windows
[05:44] <wylde> is there a common DVD-RAM format between linux and windose?
[05:44] <MrKeuner> astx813: is that what you need? why do you want to change UIDs?
[05:45] <h08817> orion2012, so i want it on separate hd. so it will work alright like that tho? all i do is just run the setup like usual?
[05:45] <bcstv>  What happened to the amaranth repos?
[05:45] <h08817> but with the hd engaged that i want it on?
[05:45] <novo> Hi all
[05:45] <orion2012> bcstv: bandwidth got too high, there's a post in the forums
[05:45] <orion2012> h08817: should work fine
=== jwall is now known as MethodOne
[05:45] <h08817> ok thought so thx
[05:45] <novo> anyone know why I wouldn't be able to see other clients packets on my wireless network using ethereal?  I can see my packets and packets from my ap.
[05:46] <bruenig> wylde, it should work on both
[05:46] <crass> novo: the card needs to be in monitor mode
[05:46] <bcstv> orion2012: Is there an alternative? I will check forum
[05:46] <f8> http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35890
[05:46] <f8> bwahaahha
[05:46] <JJones0207> Can someone help me why during the installation it will not mount the CD
[05:46] <orion2012> bcstv: yes, one sec
[05:46] <astx813> The UID for mythtv is low (116) and I'm learning that's causing some issues since now interactive users should be 1000+
[05:46] <wylde> bruenig: what format should? I thought that there were several
[05:47] <bruenig> wylde, what are you trying to burn, just data?
[05:47] <orion2012> bcstv: http://SeerOfSouls.com
[05:47] <wylde> yeah
[05:47] <MrKeuner> astx813: oh i see, than my recommendation will definitely work
[05:47] <bruenig> wylde, just click burn dvd, and go
[05:47] <astx813> excellent, thanks
[05:47] <bruenig> wylde, or rather click burn data dvd and go
[05:47] <wylde> ok
[05:47] <JJones0207> MrKeuner
[05:47] <wylde> ok
[05:47] <orion2012> bcstv: edgy contrib
[05:47] <wylde> bruenig: thanks
[05:47] <bcstv> orion2012: Thx I will check it out
[05:47] <creede> Hi all, is there a good channel for python support in U?
[05:47] <MrKeuner> astx813: but, change uid in /etc/passwd first
[05:47] <MrKeuner> JJones0207: ?
[05:47] <wylde> bruenig: can you make a bootable dvd on a dvdram?
[05:48] <astx813> definitely
[05:48] <crass> creede: just go to #python
[05:48] <JJones0207> Umm Can you tell me what to do because during the installation it says can not mount cd
[05:48] <creede> thankx
[05:48] <bruenig> wylde, if you go into k3b and then just go to the iso in the file manager thing and then click on it. It will burn it as an image. So bootable dvds can be burned that way
[05:48] <MrKeuner> JJones0207: ask your question in the channel and wait for an answer, somebody who knows the answer will answer
[05:49] <JJones0207> Ok thank you
[05:49] <wylde> bruenig: thanks
[05:49] <Pelo> JJones0207,  or you can try looking up the error msg in the forum, chances are you'll find an answerthere
[05:49] <JJones0207> ok
[05:49] <Jordan_U> What application / settings would you suggest for playing a .flv file? Mplayer and Totem-xine won't play the audio and VLC won't let me jump foreward or rewind.
=== |ns|nR8 is now known as conic
[05:51] <MrKeuner> Jordan_U: is that flash video?
[05:51] <Ralith> Jordan_U, tried installing win32 codecs?
=== scrumptious is now known as numist
[05:53] <aztek> how do i permanently assign my wifi card using ipw driver to eth2 it keeps flip flopping between that and eth1
[05:54] <Jordan_U> Ralith: MrKeuner: Yes it is a flash video, No I thought I had win32 codecs installed but I guess I don't, I'll try that.
[05:54] <MrKeuner> Jordan_U: try flash player that comes with flash beta version 9
[05:54] <MrKeuner> Jordan_U: that is not the plugin
[05:54] <Ralith> yeah
[05:54] <Ralith> that would work
[05:54] <burepe> where would I find an explanation on how to set up  /etc/hosts ?
[05:54] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: OK, i didn't know there was a standalone player.
[05:55] <MrKeuner> Jordan_U: there is a beta version yes
[05:55] <conic> budgie setup as in how ?
[05:55] <JJones0207> Dont think I can find a thead on it so far
[05:55] <conic> \you want to block access to some domains ?
[05:55] <jose> h
[05:56] <MrKeuner> burepe: man hosts
[05:57] <conic> anyone used aptoncd ?
[05:57] <conic> thing is giving me the shits
[05:57] <JJones0207> Can you tell me what to do because during the installation it says can not mount cd.
[05:57] <pieman> ubuntu sucks. please stop supporting it. its hurting t3h linux community. you guys don't even give back to debian. please, move to debian its self, archlinux, or gentoo.
[05:57] <bcstv> orio2012: do I need key as well?
[05:58] <JJones0207> lol
[05:58] <regeya> wow, what a jerk.
[05:58] <orion2012> bcstv: you should import the key, yes
[05:58] <orion2012> bcstv: technically, you don't need it, but for verification purposes, it's useful
[05:58] <JJones0207> Im like the only person who has had this problem
[05:58] <regeya> I wonder how ubuntu doesn't give back to debian...heh.
[05:59] <conic> what do they want for nothing
[05:59] <mitchbones> for some reason him saying "t3h" made me disregard his entire statment.
[05:59] <Ralith> heh
[06:00] <conic> i find some people dont like ubuntu because its easy and stuff works
[06:00] <conic> go figure
[06:00] <Ralith> yep
[06:00] <ChocoCid> haha
[06:00] <minerale> Is there a command line based gnutella client (like limewire?)
[06:00] <Ralith> conic, hehe
[06:00] <JJones0207> ChocoCid
[06:00] <Ralith> minerale, telnet! :D
[06:00] <ChocoCid> telnet rofl
[06:00] <orion2012> !giftcurs
[06:00] <ubotu> giftcurs: text-based interface to the giFT file-sharing system. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.6.2-5 (edgy), package size 107 kB, installed size 472 kB
[06:01] <mitchbones> I can say that ubuntu has helped my switch to linux immensly.
[06:02] <ArrenLex> mitchbones: Distributions of Linux tend to do that.
[06:02] <regeya> minerale, don't know if it's available, but mutella also works...though gift would be better.
[06:02] <conic> i used slackware for years....then switched to ubuntu and no way would i go back
[06:03] <regeya> w00t, I started with t3h slack
[06:03] <f8> many of us started on slack
[06:03] <ArrenLex> conic: I think you're looking for #apple-switch
[06:03] <JJones0207>  Umm Can you tell me what to do because during the installation it says can not mount cd
[06:03] <JJones0207> PLEASE SOMEONE lol
[06:03] <conic> nah stuff apple
[06:03] <conic> i aintr jumping on that bandwagon either
[06:03] <ski-worklap> how can i tell ubuntu to not use totem, but instead mplayer as my default media player when i double click an mp4 or so?
[06:04] <crass> JJones0207: I think I had that issue when my cdrom drive was bad
[06:04] <regeya> years ago, mainly 'coz I had an ancient pc with no cd-rom drive, and it would have been non-trivial to add one :-)  people used to accuse me of being a late-comer 'coz I didn't start with slack until kernel 2.0.36 was out
[06:04] <JJones0207> drive?
[06:04] <mamonassassina> ski-worklap: right-click on the mp4 file...
[06:04] <orion2012> ski-worklap: right click on an mp4 files, hilight the open with tab and select your desired application
[06:04] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: I just get "starting flashparser" from swfplayer but no window opens and I don't get any other output
[06:04] <ski-worklap> mamonassassina, that lets me start it with mplayer one time. i want to set mplayer as the *default* for all mp4s
[06:04] <mamonassassina> ski-worklap: properties,then "open with" or something like that.
[06:04] <regeya> nowadays ubuntu is my friend...I'd rather use my computer than admin my computer
[06:04] <conic> thats it hey regeya
[06:04] <ski-worklap> oh
[06:04] <mamonassassina> ski-worklap: and select mplayer.
[06:04] <ski-worklap> i see it :)
[06:04] <f8> regeya: agreed
[06:04] <ski-worklap> i am blind - thanks all
[06:05] <f8> and still admin it a little if I want to
[06:05] <regeya> conic
[06:05] <f8> :-)
[06:05] <mamonassassina> and my problem is. i try to open a file with wine,this is what i get:
[06:05] <mamonassassina> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35524/
[06:05] <conic> nevermind my slang
[06:06] <regeya> tonight I'm doing ab it of the the adminning thing (not really) 'coz I rebuilt a svn repo at work using the darwinports current version, and edgy's svn client is positively crusty
[06:06] <mamonassassina> what can i do to get all those strange files?
[06:07] <ozoneco> i got a gb of RAM, the autoinstall picks the swap file at 1gb, would it be better at 1.5 or 2gb?
[06:07] <conic> get them from windows
[06:07] <mamonassassina> conic: i don't have "a windows" to get it from
[06:07] <mamonassassina> and probably there is a way to install them all on ubuntu.
[06:07] <conic> then ya stuck
[06:07] <mamonassassina> conic: no i'm not.
[06:07] <regeya> meh.
[06:08] <mamonassassina> conic: you can't help me,thats different.
[06:08] <ablyss> unless you plan on running 50 apps all at the same time.. 500 MB of ram or lower will do
[06:08] <Ralith> ozoneco, 1gb should be more than enough
[06:08] <ablyss> er, 500mb of swap
[06:08] <Ralith> what's the ibm jdk package?
[06:08] <pungie> I just got a WD external hard drive, I plug it in, but not sure how to mount it.. I am a linux newbie... I did dmesg and do see it correctly attached, but how do I get to it?
[06:09] <Jordan_U> Ralith: It contains programs for developing Java applications
[06:09] <JJones0207> Well this sucks because I got ubuntu to install on that computer bfore
[06:09] <JJones0207> before
[06:09] <Jordan_U> Ralith: Java Developement Kit
[06:09] <Ralith> Jordan_U, ...I would hope so. But what is it?
[06:09] <Ralith> what's it called?
[06:09] <Ralith> by what name does dpkg refer to it?
[06:09] <Jordan_U> Ralith: Oh, sorry, let me check
[06:09] <Ralith> :P
[06:10] <nomasteryoda> apt-cache search jdk

[06:20] <Vlet> ubuntuguide describes one way to install nvidia drivers, and (tseliot from) ubuntuforums describes another... what is the 'correct' way to install them?
[06:20] <conic> tried using mount command ?
[06:20] <orion2012> craigbass1976: is the scanner supported by sane? I have a 5200c which is.
[06:21] <cafilubu> I have already install ubuntu 6.10 but dont have network!
[06:21] <craigbass1976> pungie, reading back to see what's the deal
[06:21] <kishan> i donnot see the network manager icon in menu lubix
[06:21] <craigbass1976> orion2012, no.  sane says there's no device.
[06:21] <pungie> I tried mount, but how do i know the mount pount... if I mount to say /dev/sdb1 or /dev/sda1 says no such device

[06:25] <interskh> bimberi, thx
[06:25] <cafilubu> is it a way to compile a kernel in ubuntu 6.10 with the tools it came in the cd
[06:25] <kishan> bimberi: it is one the enteries can u help me please
[06:25] <bimberi> kishan: ok, it might only be disabled for the current session.  try running "nm-applet --sm-disable &" in a terminal
[06:25] <cafilubu> or I have to download extra tools?
[06:26] <Jordan_U> Ralith: No, to be honest I've stopped looking.
[06:26] <orion2012> cafilubu: I'm guessing you'll need at _least_ build-essential
[06:26] <h08817> orion2012, what is the major plus to upgrading?
[06:26] <orion2012> h08817: upstart, I suppose
[06:26] <orion2012> h08817: newer GNOME is nice too
[06:26] <pungie> so dmesg says mine is atcahed, but can't get to it =(
[06:26] <h08817> orion2012, upstart?
[06:26] <kishan> bimberi: it shows x error
[06:27] <Ralith> does anyone know the package name of the ibm jdk?

[06:28] <crimsun> cafilubu: build-essential is on the 6.10 cd

[06:28] <cafilubu> and with the kernel

[06:29] <pungie> one last time: mount external hard drive, how?
[06:30] <Lovloss> could hosting a website on a linux machine possibly make it unaccessible to windows machines? because for some reason only me and my mozilla are picking up this embedded video I made
[06:30] <Lovloss> http://vasilisagames.com is the addy
[06:30] <lubix> lovLoss: that is an absurd idea
[06:30] <Lovloss> Well i can find no other explanation why everyone else's computer cant load it
[06:30] <Lovloss> it loads the quicktime symbol, then that turns into a question mark :/
[06:30] <kishan> bimberi; i started getting this problem when i tried to install the kiba-dock
[06:31] <JJones0207> How long does it take to Start or Install Ubuntu
[06:31] <[_miT_] > May i ask a PPC distro question here?
[06:31] <Lovloss> jjones0207 I found it to be quicker than windows
[06:31] <JJones0207> I mean im trying to boot it form the cd
[06:31] <Lovloss> jjones0207  doing it right in one try may take a little prep time though. i had to reformat like 4 times because i do things manually
[06:32] <JJones0207> and its been like 5 minutes
[06:32] <Lovloss> thats very fast, but not lightning fo course
[06:32] <JJones0207> Yeah Ive tried it before
[06:32] <JJones0207> Im trying to install it now
[06:32] <JJones0207> You know when you try to install the Desktop it says Start or Install ubuntu
[06:32] <Lovloss> so does anyone know why my video isnt embedding in such a way that it is accessible to other computers? I dont like that it tries to load through quicktime.
[06:32] <kishan> bimberi: the thing is i now can see the icon of network manager but how to solve the x-error i will be great ful if u can help me out
[06:32] <Lovloss> jjones yes i know what you mean. the boot disk always works for me
[06:33] <[_miT_] > When i boot Ubuntu PPC Live CD on my iMac it loads fine, but the screen goes black when i hear the intro music and never returns.
[06:33] <Lovloss> try unzipping the .iso onto a usb
[06:33] <bimberi> kishan: sorry, the error is beyond me, I'd only be googling and you'd miss out on all the learning :)
[06:33] <JJones0207> I dont have anything that holds anything that big
[06:33] <JJones0207> just 512
[06:33] <Lovloss> ah i see... hmm
[06:33] <JJones0207> altho I could use my psp mem stick
[06:33] <JJones0207> lol
[06:34] <Lovloss> maybe burn a new cd? could be messed up

[06:37] <Ralith> francis, same way you install anything else
[06:37] <Lovloss> Guys, does anyone know HTML or a chat room for it
[06:37] <Ralith> francis, there's not much need for a firewall in ubuntu, though
[06:37] <Ralith> Lovloss, try #html >_>
[06:37] <JJones0207> well ill go take a shower thats 15 mintes

[06:37] <Lovloss> er,,, k lol
[06:38] <kishan> hey bimberi: the problem started after me experimenting to install kiba dock is this anything to do with that

[06:40] <francis> Ralith: i just wonder if im still vulnerable using gaim in ubuntu box
[06:40] <Ralith> vulnerable to what?
[06:40] <Ralith> and a firewall won't help you with any IM exploit anyway
[06:41] <francis> Ralith: to boot attacks in yahoo rooms...coz i experience that a few times and i got frezzed and need to restart
[06:41] <Ralith> francis, and a boot attack is...?
[06:41] <[_miT_] > When i boot Ubuntu PPC Live CD on my iMac it loads fine, but the screen goes black when i hear the intro music and never returns.
[06:41] <[_miT_] > any ideas?
[06:41] <francis> Ralith: boot attack is like flooding in IRC..
[06:42] <interskh> error "libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_cancel to work", i have installed libgcc1
[06:42] <francis> Ralith: they can even hack your account using windows..thats why im asking if using game makes me invincible
[06:43] <francis> Ralith: gaim* i mean
[06:43] <Ralith> francis, you're probably still vulnerable to flooding, but the only way to protect against that anywhere is by auto-ignoring anything that spams too fast
[06:43] <Ralith> gaim may do that.
[06:43] <Ralith> and you're safe from 'hacking'
[06:44] <francis> Ralith: is ther a way to configure that in gaim?
[06:44] <tim_> hi ubuntu, why is some software "not" what it actualy is. For instance, Lame aint an mp3 encoder, and wine is not an emulator. But excuse me if im wrong, isnt lame actually and mp3 encoder, and wine actually an emulator? Whats up with this ambuguity?

[06:44] <Ralith> francis, if it does it, it will already do it. However, most IM protocols don't allow such spamming. I'd advise you use something sane like aim or gtalk

[06:47] <tim_> compatibility layer? an emulator is something that models another system. are we saying that thats NOT what wine does?
[06:48] <Jordan_U> tim_: in Computer Science Emulator more often refers to an emulated architecture than a set of libraries, thus calling it an emulator leads to misconceptions.

I get "pikapika" and then "localhost.localdomain" So I am trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. Any suggestions?
[06:50] <lubix> you need the codec then dude!! lovloss

[07:59] <^tiNee^> i cant get it to run this game i have
[07:59] <timfrost> cyber: 'sudo cp ~/vsftp.conf /etc/vsftp.conf' to get the file there.  In future, use 'sudo nano /etc/vsftp.conf' to edit it (use another editor instead of nano if you want).
[08:00] <AnotherDude> awesome. thanks ubotu and jbroome
[08:00] <wylde> cadega
[08:00] <cyber> yea
[08:00] <timfrost> kuzmaster: Yes you should be OK
[08:00] <^tiNee^> u have to pay for that right?
[08:00] <rubix_> whats the package name for gmplayer
[08:00] <cyber> i didnt open it through console tho :P so no sudo :/
[08:00] <cyber> was using g-edit
[08:00] <cyber> but thanks alot
[08:00] <wylde> ^tiNee^: i dunno
[08:00] <kuzmaster> timfrost: thanx!
[08:01] <^tiNee^> ok
[08:01] <wylde> ubuntu read from ntfs just fine, right?
[08:01] <bimberi> wylde: yes, undersood, and from what I can tell what you're doing should work (although I haven't used samba in 6.10 personally) so i'm at a loss sorry :(
[08:01] <cdew4545> anyone know where to find the source code for ps?
[08:01] <bimberi> wylde: yes (to ntfs read)
[08:01] <jbroome> wylde: read yes, write not so much
[08:01] <wylde> bimberi: ok
[08:02] <wylde> thanks
[08:02] <wylde> you too j broom
[08:02] <wylde> e
[08:02] <timfrost> cyber: You either need to open a terminal, or to have a menu or panel icon that runs 'gksu gedit /etc/vsftp.conf'
[08:02] <wylde> bimberi: samba looks the same in both, do you think that it could be radically different in distros so close to eachother?
[08:03] <wylde> bimberi: and i know looks are not everything
[08:03] <nevermind> hi all!, let me ask you something
[08:03] <wylde> no
[08:03] <wylde> haha
[08:03] <nevermind> hoy do i create a multi parted zip or rar file?
[08:04] <cyber> thanks timfrost
[08:04] <timfrost> cdew4545: The sources are available via 'apt-get source procps'. That command can be run as you, and will fetch the source to your current directory, unpack it and patch it with the Ubuntu patches
[08:04] <anchor> Is anyone else having trouble installing msttcorefonts undery Edgy?
[08:04] <nevermind> i've tried file-roller and also ark, but none of them have the option
[08:04] <anchor> under*
[08:05] <nevermind> anchor: i used automatix jsut for that
[08:05] <bimberi> wylde: i doubt it
[08:06] <anchor> i've been trying, but automatix keeps complaining about having no installation candidate
[08:06] <nevermind> anchor: are you using last automatix version (2)?
[08:06] <anchor> ye
[08:06] <anchor> yep
[08:06] <anchor> i'm assuming its a problem with the repos.
[08:07] <nevermind> dun know then... it worked for me
[08:07] <nothlit> Then don't use automatix?
[08:07] <bimberi> nevermind: the "zipsplit" command looks promising
[08:07] <nevermind> anyonw knows hot to create a spanned zip or rar file?
[08:08] <anchor> if i could find an alternative download i'd give it a try.
[08:08] <nevermind> bimberi: thanks, i'll checkit
[08:08] <timfrost> anchor:  msttcorefonts is in multiverse (for edgy at least) so you need that repository enabled
[08:08] <rubix_> pirating some software nevermind  :-P?
[08:08] <wylde> how do i add write permissions to a computer on a network?
[08:08] <bimberi> nevermind: np :)
[08:08] <nevermind> rubix_: lol, you wish :P
[08:09] <nevermind> na, it's only a huge video that i want to upload to rapidshare
[08:10] <wylde> bimberi: how do i add write permissions to a computer on a network?
[08:10] <anchor> thanks tim, that did the trick.
[08:10] <wylde> bimberi: to write to another computer?
[08:11] <tonyyarusso> !automatix | anchor, nevermind, nothlit
[08:11] <ubotu> anchor, nevermind, nothlit: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[08:12] <nothlit> tonyyarusso, err, what @ me, i just said not to use automatix
[08:12] <wylde> !WorksForMe
[08:12] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[08:12] <Bakefy> Can anyone help me use my slave drive?  I just installed ubuntu
[08:12] <nothlit> why*
[08:12] <nothlit> Bakefy, do you know what filesystem it has
[08:12] <tonyyarusso> nothlit: It came up, so just making sure everyone's aware, that's all :)
[08:12] <nevermind> tonyyarusso: i know that, but, like i said, i only used it to get mttsfonts :P
[08:12] <anchor> that's all i needed it for too. :)
[08:12] <nothlit> which are in repos
[08:12] <tonyyarusso> nevermind: but...but...that's so easy on it's own?
[08:13] <Bakefy> nothlit, I can see it on the device manager
[08:13] <nothlit> Bakefy, filesystem? is it a new drive with nothing on it?
[08:13] <nevermind> tonyyarusso: i only used it since i was in a hurry :P
[08:13] <Bakefy> well, no.  It might have some NTFS
[08:13] <nothlit> then you need to install ntfs-3g
[08:13] <Bakefy> i tried to erase it during install
[08:14] <nothlit> oh
[08:14] <Bakefy> I don't need the stuff on it
[08:14] <Bakefy> i just want to mount it
[08:14] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok install gparted through synaptic or command line, then run it and give it a filesystem/parition it
[08:14] <nothlit> Bakefy do that first
[08:15] <Bakefy> okay, I will see if I can find gparted on synaptic
[08:15] <Bakefy> thanks nothlit
[08:15] <nothlit> nevermind, you would have saved more time if you didn't have to manually download and run automatix
[08:15] <nothlit> Bakefy, after that ask someone about adding your drive in fstab and tell them the setup of your drive
[08:15] <Bakefy> okay
[08:15] <nevermind> nothlit: i know, but it was already installed (f***ing brother )
[08:16] <nothlit> nevermind, why in the world did you give him admin/sudo priveleges?
[08:16] <nothlit> privileges*
[08:17] <nevermind> i didn't, i forgot (yea, stu***) to lock my session
[08:18] <nothlit> Bakefy, you need to choose a filesystem, for reliability/more space choose ext3, for speed reiserfs... i wouldn't recommend other filesystems and they are harder to manage or don't have enough features
[08:18] <nevermind> besides, he has his own pc, but sometimes comes to my bedroom to use mine oO and when he started doing it, i started locking my sessions :P
[08:18] <Bakefy> nothlit, I am installing gparted.  is this going to be through terminal, or graphical? when I use it
[08:18] <nothlit> Its graphical :)
[08:18] <nothlit> if not you already had the tools on your computer to partition it
[08:18] <jbroome> since the "g" stands for gnome, i'd say graphical
[08:18] <wylde> crap, it's almost midnight, I have a java program to write, two essays due yesterday, and two big tests in two days.  I'm screwed. yippie
[08:20] <Lovloss> is there a graphical frontend for video file conversions? ffmpeg confuses me
[08:20] <kuzmaster> hey all
[08:20] <kuzmaster> im following this http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p3
[08:20] <n30n> !wireless
[08:20] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:20] <Bakefy> how go I get gparted to run.  I type it in, in terminal and it says I need to be in the root?
[08:20] <kuzmaster> to set up a server
[08:21] <Delkster> Bakefy, are you running the live CD?
[08:21] <Bakefy> no
[08:21] <Delkster> Ok... it may not be a good idea to edit the partitions on the same hard disk you're currently running from now.
[08:21] <kuzmaster> now, for step 5, where i need to edit the "/etc/hosts", what is the purpose for the "server1.example.com" line, and do i need that
[08:21] <nothlit> Bakefy, Settings -> Administration -> Gparted
[08:21] <Delkster> But, yeah, as nothlit said.
[08:21] <nothlit> Delkster, its not even mounted yet, thats why hes partitioning it
[08:22] <Delkster> Ah, ok, sorry. Haven't been following.
[08:22] <kuzmaster> this server will mainly for running an intranet, and it wont be for hosting a website, viewable for the puplic
[08:22] <nothlit> I'm starting to forget the placement of everything in gnome-panel
[08:22] <ArrenLex> kuzmaster: It's your hostname, and you don't, really, unless you want other people to talk to your machine easily.
[08:22] <ArrenLex> kuzmaster: Oh. If it's a server you'll want a hostname.
[08:23] <strav> hi there.. I just tried to hard link /dev/dsp to /dev/adsp... prolly this was stupid, anyways, to get oss back on, where should I link dsp? (tried every files in /dev/snd/)
[08:23] <Bakefy> thanks nothlit
[08:23] <kuzmaster> well,ok, the line looks like this "192.168.0.100   server1.example.com      server1",  if my ip address is 192.168.1.104, and my hostname is "frankie", should i make it look like this "192.168.1.104   frankie"?
[08:23] <nothlit> Bakefy, lol, you're not finished yet
[08:23] <timfrost> Bakefy: in edgy, it is System->Administrati0n->Gnome partition editor.  gksu will prompt youi for *your* password
[08:24] <ArrenLex> kuzmaster: You don't have a domain name?
[08:24] <kuzmaster> no
[08:24] <kuzmaster> this will be for hosting an intranet
[08:24] <strav> (in other words, how do I recreate /dev/dsp ? ;)
[08:24] <Bakefy> I am creating the partition!
[08:24] <ArrenLex> kuzmaster: I myself have been trying to make sense of the hostname mess so I can do what you want to do with SSH. If you find a way, please tell me, because I am uberly confused. Not that that helps you much :)
[08:24] <nothlit> strav, why not run alsa and use aoss
[08:25] <n30n> when i run (from root) "ndiswrapper -l" it tells me there are no drivers installed. How do i install a driver
[08:25] <Lovloss> Guys, im trying to encode this video i have so that when i embed it into my webpage, it will be played easily from the average computer. My xvid mpeg4 format didnt work. It said "find plugins" and then couldnt find any. My mpeg-2 tries to run in quicktime, which no one i know uses
[08:25] <crimsun> strav: you don't _ever_ relink those. They're created by loading snd_pcm_oss.
[08:25] <Z3dzDead> Hi, when i run ./configure on any application I am getting an 'access denied - bad interpreter'-
[08:25] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: then you want an mpeg.
[08:25] <Z3dzDead> now whats up with that?
[08:25] <Bakefy> how exciting!  what is the next step? fstab? nothlit!!!
[08:25] <kuzmaster> arrenlex: well, im doing all this  remotely with ssh
[08:25] <crimsun> strav: unload snd_pcm_oss, remove the symlink that you created if necessary, then reload snd_pcm_oss
[08:25] <Lovloss> ArrenLex just a plain mpeg?
[08:25] <nothlit> Lovloss, the easiest way to do it is transcode it into flash video, you can upload it to a flash video site and embed it from there
[08:26] <Z3dzDead> Do i need to reinstall ubuntu? cause that'd be a bit of a bother- especially when you have a crappy connection-
[08:26] <strav> nothlit: I tried to use aoss but it appears to give me very bad sampling quality
[08:26] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: If you want it to be playable on the average computer, it's your best bet, yes.
[08:26] <strav> crimsun, btw, thanks ;)
[08:26] <Z3dzDead> anyone?
[08:26] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok you're finished? Tell me what drive it is (1,2,3,4 /dev/hd(a/b/c/d)) and what file systems you used and if you partitioned it
[08:26] <Dorian`> My pc can't boot from pc :\\
[08:26] <Lovloss> Well i want it to autoplay and all sorts of stuff, so i cant have it as like, a link to youtube
[08:27] <ArrenLex> Dorian`: ...come again?
[08:27] <Lovloss> So i guess i have to try mpeg. What codecs would a plain mpeg ask for from a browser?
[08:27] <strav> crimsun, I do this with modprobe?
[08:27] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: The mpeg codec. Which is implemented in every video player ever made.
[08:27] <Delkster> Z3dzDead, is that the only thing that isn't working?
[08:27] <timfrost> Z3dzDead: you don't need to reinstall.  'Bad interpreter' means that the first line of the configure script is looking for a shell that doesn't exist.  Often, replacing that line with '#!/bin/sh' will work
[08:27] <kuzmaster> ArrenLex: to get SSH working, i installed openssh (sudo apt-get ssh openssh-server) on the server and just download and ran PuTTY on my computer(windows)
[08:27] <Lovloss> I see. And mpeg2 is quicktime, mpeg4 is xvid, and so forth?
[08:27] <Bakefy> its the slave drive, /dev/hdb1 i used ext3
[08:28] <nothlit> ArrenLex, flash/quicktime ime is whats most playable in browsers
[08:28] <ArrenLex> kuzmaster: Yes, I mean, I want to be able to type "ssh em@emerson" rather than "ssh em@192.168.0.103" and can't figure out how to get that up.
[08:28] <Bakefy> I am guessing it is drive 2, even though I have some removable drives and two cd/dvd rom drives
[08:28] <kuzmaster> ahhhhhhhhhh
[08:28] <kuzmaster> well, i dont know.........
[08:28] <ArrenLex> nothlit: I can't even begin to imagine how it is possible to say quicktime is more playable than mpeg. Flash is debatable.
[08:28] <kuzmaster> !hostname
[08:28] <ubotu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[08:29] <Lovloss> Quicktime requires drivers that dont autoinstall, yopu have to hunt them down.
[08:29] <Lovloss> at least flash does it in a popup

[08:29] <x-r00t-x> hello. can anyone help me with apache2 Shere on local area?
[08:30] <Lovloss> does the front video work for any of you? The site is http://www.vasilisagames.com
[08:30] <ArrenLex> nothlit: Quicktime is a proprietary plugin for which open-source codecs don't even exist. mpeg has been implemented in all manner of libraries and licenses since forever. Anything can play it.
[08:30] <nothlit> Bakefy, so you only have one partition on hdb?
[08:30] <Bakefy> nothlit, yes
[08:30] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Yes, but I have MPlayer, and MPlayer can play any movie ever made :)
[08:30] <Bakefy> wait
[08:30] <nothlit> vlc/mplayer/and the ugly/bad codecs can play it
[08:30] <Lovloss> Ah thats true

[08:31] <Lovloss> Okay now, let me ask this. Where can i get something to transcode files without having to use the commmand line?
[08:31] <nothlit> ArrenLex, sure once its downloaded, just from what ive seen people use for embedded streaming video...
[08:31] <n30n> Can someone help me with this error: FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.15-27-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid argument
[08:31] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-mpeg.html This is for mencoder. If you're using transcode or whatever, google, I guess.
[08:31] <timfrost> ArrenLex: if you are using DHCP to configure the IP address of emerson, then you have a problem, because you need to have the IP-to-name mapping updated on all the machines that you need to connect from
[08:31] <Bakefy> nothlit, there are three volumes shown on the device manager
[08:31] <Z3dzDead> tried that with [$ sh configure ]  too.
[08:31] <ArrenLex> nothlit: You must hang out on apple.com a lot.
[08:31] <nothlit> nope
[08:32] <ArrenLex> timfrost: Yes I am, and I guess I have a problem. :(
[08:32] <strav> worked
[08:32] <strav> thanks crimsun

[08:32] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: You're new at this Linux thing, aren't you. :)
[08:33] <Lovloss> er yeah
[08:33] <x-r00t-x> hello. can anyone help me with apache2 Shere on local area network?
[08:33] <Lovloss> command lines are frightening
[08:33] <acetoxy> Hehe, I found my Best Linux 5.3 manual this morning.
[08:33] <olds> lol
[08:33] <acetoxy> On paper.
[08:33] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: there are many GUIs for mencoder, but due to the staggering number of options, every GUI I've ever seen is horrendously confusing and frankly unnavigable.
[08:33] <acetoxy> Bought it 7 years ago
[08:33] <Lovloss> :< well i suppose il just bookmark this page then....
[08:33] <nothlit> Bakefy, can you open a terminal and run sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdb and tell me what comes out?
[08:33] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: They're easy once you get used to them. I prefer a command line over a GUI for most tasks now.
[08:34] <olds> agreed
[08:34] <Lovloss> Maybe someday ill make my own gui for it :D~
[08:34] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: There are hundreds and hundreds.
[08:34] <nothlit> Lovloss, why don't you try uploading it to some flash video site like youtube and then embedding that into your webpage
[08:34] <Lovloss> Mine will rule them all.
[08:34] <acetoxy> The Pragmatic Programmer has great examples on that command line is often better than GUI.
[08:34] <whyameye> Lovloss I just signed in. What do you want to do?
[08:35] <Lovloss> nothlit, id rather not. Its an opening video. I think ill just turn it to an mpeg
[08:35] <olds> not use the commandline in linux
[08:35] <Lovloss> whyameye, just figuring out what kind of file to embed as a video to open my site, so that the average computer can use it
[08:35] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/projects.html This is the official MPlayer\MEncoder site. They have a very large list of GUIs. Scroll down to "Mencoder GUIs".
[08:35] <ArrenLex> Frontends.
[08:35] <Lovloss> ah. none of them are in the apt-cache
[08:35] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: No.
[08:35] <olds> Lovloss: flash
[08:35] <Bakefy> nothlit, what all do you want to know?
[08:36] <whyameye> Lovloss: I do flash streaming video for my websites. I use ffmpeg to do it. i have instructions on the web if you want. Can your web pages support PHP?
[08:36] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: They're right, you might want to consider Flash. Mencoder can also convert to flv :)
[08:36] <nothlit> !pastebin
[08:36] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:36] <Lovloss> but i have to host the video elsewhere to use a flash video guys
[08:36] <Lovloss> My website is hosted by a PHP server with godaddy
[08:36] <timfrost> ArrenLex: your best hope is to configure the server emerson at a fixed IP address.  That can be done even if you have an ADSL or cable modem, as long as you configure the DHCP server on the modem to exclude that IP address (eg, I have a system at 192.168.13.2, and the DHCP server gives addresses above .128)
[08:36] <olds> so?
[08:36] <nothlit> Bakefy, paste the whole thing into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and tell me the url
[08:36] <olds> make the flash video file
[08:36] <olds> upload it to your webspace
[08:36] <Lovloss> oh :D
[08:37] <whyameye> Lovloss: then flash will work. i highly recommend. Works with more platforms than anything else. Also mencoder didn't work for me as well as ffmpeg.
[08:37] <Lovloss> so... ffmpeg my file to .flv format?
[08:37] <ArrenLex> timfrost: I do have a cable modem, which is attached to a router, which provides DCHP services. Only one connection can be made to the router, and I have two computers I would like to be able to address by hostname. I guess I'm screwed?
[08:37] <x-r00t-x> !apache
[08:37] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[08:37] <whyameye> Lovloss: I put directions on the web: http://cratel.wichita.edu/cratel/cratel_streaming_video
[08:38] <Bakefy> nothlit, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35538/
[08:38] <ArrenLex> timfrost: "Only one connection can be made to the router" went through the past-midnight filter. It started out in my head as "the cable modem only has one ethernet port into which something may be plugged" xD

[08:39] <Nigromante> Hello, how can I avoid a sudo user to modify /etc/sudoers ?
[08:39] <timfrost> ArrenLex: do you have a switch or hub between the router and the PC's?
[08:39] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok, now sudo mkdir /media/hdb1
[08:39] <ArrenLex> timfrost: No; the router acts as a hub. It has four ports.
[08:39] <nothlit> Bakefy, after that gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[08:40] <nothlit> Bakefy, tell me when you're done

[08:41] <ArrenLex> tonyyarusso: I remember when I was setting up an ftp server, reading the package descriptions for each server told me what it was about and how it differed from others. This might be a good place to start. Wikipedia, I guess, will help more.
[08:41] <tonyyarusso> ArrenLex: Ok
[08:41] <Z3dzDead> timfrost: no luck :( it says "..cannot run C compiled programs")
[08:41] <Nigromante> Can anyone help me?

[08:41] <ubotu> Nigromante: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:42] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok... now at the very bottom paste in /dev/hdb1     /media/hdb1     ext3     defaults        0       2
[08:42] <ArrenLex> Z3dzDead: Do you have build-essential installed?
[08:42] <whyameye> Nigromante: if the user has sudo privs it doesn't sound possible to do what you want to me...
[08:42] <Z3dzDead> Just did.
[08:42] <nothlit> Bakefy, on a new line of course
[08:42] <timfrost> ArrenLex: then you are OK.  Change the server (emerson)  so that it has a fixed IP address, rather than using DHCP to configure eth0.  Then change the router so that address is not in the DHCP range, and add the entry to /etc/hosts on the other machines
[08:42] <jordo23> Has anyone here installed gnash successfully?
[08:42] <nothlit> Bakefy, after that you save... and close the program
[08:42] <x-r00t-x> can anyone help me with firestarter. how do i open outgoing 80 port????
[08:42] <timfrost> Z3dzDead: what gives that error message?
[08:42] <Z3dzDead> ArrenLex: doesnt seem to help. I think i botched something up. i never tried compiling or configuring from source since I'd 6.06 installed
[08:42] <ArrenLex> timfrost: By "the entry" in /etc/hosts, what exactly do you mean?
[08:42] <Lovloss> You guys are right, mencoder cannot translate to flv... ill use ffmpeg
[08:43] <Bakefy> what do i save it as? nothlit
[08:43] <Nigromante> whyameye, but then some options in sudoers to restrict commands look useless...
[08:43] <whyameye> Lovloss: actually I think it will do it but the metadata info isn't so good....
[08:43] <nothlit> Bakefy, just save it... you opened a file that already exists and you just modified it
[08:43] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Yes it can xD
[08:43] <timfrost> ArrenLex: '192.168.0.x  emerson' (where the 'x' represents the IP address you fix emerson at
[08:43] <Bakefy> nothlit, its only letting me save as
[08:43] <nothlit> Bakefy, /mnt/hdb3     ext3     defaults        0       2 make sure all of that is one one line, and a new line
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=flv:vbitrate=800 -of lavf -lavfopts format=flv -ofps 30 <infile> -o <outfile>
[08:44] <Lovloss> whyameye then why is it giving me "flv not recognized" :( sudo mencoder Office.avi -of flv
[08:44] <Z3dzDead> timfrost: the fluxbox src. I know about the debian pkg. problem is, i can't get that to work either. when i try to log in, i get another unrelated error message saying that access to ~/.fluxbox/startup is denied- the error is given by this line in /usr/bin/startfluxbox. anywhos, thats why I am giving it a shot with the src
[08:44] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok, try again.. gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[08:44] <tonyyarusso> ArrenLex: Do you have a personal favorite?
[08:44] <Lovloss> ArrenLex, thats chinese to me :<
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: If it were that easy, it would be more popular. xD
[08:45] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Just copy and paste that command, and replace <infile> with whatever file you want to convert, and <outfile> with the filename you want it to have, ending in .flv
[08:45] <Bakefy> okay this time it did not let me save over it because my permission
[08:45] <nothlit> Z3dzDead, what version of ubuntu are you running? i have 6.10 and fluxbox works fine
[08:45] <ArrenLex> tonyyarusso: Been a long time since I ran ftp; don't remember anything about them. Sorry.
[08:45] <tonyyarusso> 'k
[08:45] <ArrenLex> timfrost: I see. And I have to do this for every computer on which I will want to use the hostname emerson?
[08:45] <nevermind> damn zipsplit
[08:46] <whyameye> Lovloss: dunno, but I'll bet something is wrong in your command. My mencoder cheat sheet is: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-selecting-codec.html
[08:46] <nevermind> i cannot belive ther's no way to create a spanned rar or zi file in linux!
[08:46] <Z3dzDead> i tried a script with the shebang and a simple ls command- doesnt seem to work either- just gives the error "bad interpreter"
[08:46] <timfrost> ArrenLex: yes, unless you can run a local nameserver
[08:46] <kuzmaster> so anyway, in this file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35541/ , do i need the "server1.example.com" part, if im just using the server to host an intranet?
[08:46] <ArrenLex> timfrost: what are the benefits of this?
[08:46] <Lovloss> It says no audio decoder is selected
[08:47] <Bakefy> nothlit, how can I make it so I can save over it.  its not letting me because I am not the "owner"
[08:47] <nothlit> Bakefy, yeah close it and try again
[08:47] <kuzmaster> anyone? in this file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35541/ , do i need the "server1.example.com" part, if im just using the server to host an intranet?
[08:47] <nothlit> Bakefy, make sure its the whole thing in quotes        'gksudo gedit /etc/fstab'
[08:48] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Here's a simple explanation: mencoder -{output video codec} {codec library} -{codec library options} {videocodec}=flv:{video bitrate}=800{kb/s} {output format}={decided by format library} {format library options: format}=flv {frames-per-second of output movie}=30 {infile} -o {outfile}

[08:49] <whyameye> francis: are you trying to delete from nautilus?
[08:49] <Lovloss> ... okay, im gona go get a gui
[08:49] <francis> Lovloss: yes
[08:50] <whyameye> francis: have you tried deleting as root from the command line?
[08:50] <nothlit> francis, alt+f2 gksudo nautilus
[08:50] <francis> Lovloss: can no longer delete saying an error im not the owner of the file
[08:50] <kuzmaster> meh!
[08:50] <kuzmaster> anyone? in this file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35541/ , do i need the "server1.example.com" part, if im just using the server to host an intranet?
[08:50] <whyameye> francis: follow nothlit's advice (not my last advice).
[08:50] <francis> nothlit: what will happen with that
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Oh. add "-oac mp3lame" somewhere in there
[08:51] <nothlit> francis, the window can delete anything you want
[08:51] <nothlit> francis, it has super user privileges
[08:51] <francis> nothlit: is it safe?
[08:51] <jlaw> good morning guys, i just installed kubuntu and acountered some problems with amarok. it play almost all formats without problems but when i try to play an mp3 stream it goes quiet without an error ... sounds that familiar to somebody?
[08:51] <Bakefy> nothlit, i saved the files how do i knoe its working?
[08:51] <nothlit> francis, as long as you delete the right things
[08:51] <ArrenLex> timfrost: Thanks a lot for all your help. Do you have any links I could read so I can wrap my head around the whole issue? :)
[08:51] <nothlit> Bakefy, now, sudo mount -a
[08:51] <whyameye> jlaw: have you installed the restricted formats?
[08:51] <whyameye> !restricted formats

[08:52] <nothlit> Bakefy, you can tell with mount -a
[08:52] <jlaw> whyameye ... i think not, thanx for the hint
[08:52] <burepe_> ArrenLex: whyameye I did the command but I can't find it. Where is it?
[08:52] <nothlit> Bakefy, then go to /media/hdb1 and it should be there :)
[08:52] <kuzmaster> anyone? in this file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35541/ , do i need the "server1.example.com" part, if im just using the server to host an intranet?

[08:53] <burepe_> ArrenLex: whyameye I found it. Thanks
[08:53] <francis> nothlit: thnks ..file deleted ...whats your email or ym id if u mind talking
[08:53] <nothlit> francis, sorry, just ask people in this chatroom

[08:55] <ArrenLex> kuzmaster: You don't need the example.com part. The server1 part will be the hostname of your machine.
[08:55] <Lovloss> This website says "Debian apt-get source:deb http://tutuxclan.free.fr/debs . /       can i use the command lien somehwo to get this?				
[08:55] <Lovloss> ah wait, i remember nevermind
[08:55] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Did you get what I said above?

[08:55] <francis> nothlit: do u know how to set a shared folder..samba already installed.i've used sytem admin tools shared folder but it wont work
[08:55] <nothlit> !samba
[08:55] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:55] <Bakefy> nothlit, you have any idea wy its not showing 80 GB and only 32.1?
[08:55] <nevermind> someone called me?
[08:55] <Lovloss> ArrenLex - im gonna use a front end ^_^

[08:56] <jlaw> whyameye, uses amarok those gstreamer stuff?
[08:56] <nevermind> oh, i see, nevermind xD
[08:56] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Good luck. xD
[08:56] <ArrenLex> jlaw: Like yoda, speaks jlaw?
[08:56] <whyameye> jlaw: honestly I don't know how amarok decodes mp3s. I use xmms. But I know in general ubuntu doesn't support mp3s out of the box for any of their packages because of its proprietary nature.
[08:56] <nothlit> Bakefy, you probably didn't partition it properly
[08:56] <Lovloss> lol the command line is too much for my brani atm
[08:57] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: but I gave you the command to run! xD
[08:57] <Bakefy> no, I did.  32.1 is what is left of my primary hard drive
[08:57] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=flv:vbitrate=800 -of lavf -lavfopts format=flv -ofps 30 -oac mp3lame <infile> -o <outfile>
[08:57] <whyameye> jlaw: maybe this will help: http://winanga.wordpress.com/2006/03/18/amarok-mp3-support-in-ubuntu-dapper/
[08:58] <Lovloss> wait... so inline = Offic.mpeg  and outfile should be Office.flv ?
[08:58] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: infile is your input file, whatever its name is.
[08:59] <Lovloss> ArrenLex : mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=flv:vbitrate=800 -of lavf -lavfopts format=flv -ofps 30 -oac mp3lame Offic -o Offici
[08:59] <Lovloss> it fails
[08:59] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: you need extensions. Proper filenames.
[08:59] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: infile is the file you would "file -> open" in a GUI, and outfile is the file you would "file -> save as" in a GUI.
[09:00] <ArrenLex> Obviously the infile has to exist.
[09:00] <Lovloss> "Requested audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available."
[09:00] <thePuck> excuse me, I have a couple questions...everyone advices to do a fresh install of edgy instead of updating, but my burner is dying...if I do a fresh install of dapper and upgrade will that still have all the issues? Also, what is actually different in edgy?
[09:00] <nothlit> Bakefy, open gparted again and check the partition size and if there is any free space
[09:00] <jlaw> whyameye, thanx a lot ... it just confused me because it worked seemingly right after install in debian ... i expected it to be the same in kubuntu
[09:01] <Lovloss> ack "Cannot initialize muxer."
[09:01] <whyameye> jlaw: i'm surprised it worked in debian becuase of the same proprietary issues. Anyway, how you get it going.
[09:01] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: *confused* That's extremely odd...
[09:01] <Lovloss> :/
[09:01] <Bakefy> nothlit, 75.31 GiB unused.
[09:01] <whyameye> Lovloss: does mplayer play your video OK?
[09:02] <Lovloss> oh mplayer never works, i use vlc
[09:02] <Bakefy> Maybe I should restart or something for the setting to take effect?
[09:02] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: ...I see...
[09:02] <Lovloss> c.c
[09:02] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: Good luck then. xD
[09:02] <Lovloss> >.<
[09:02] <ArrenLex> ^-^''
[09:03] <whyameye> Lovloss: so if you type "mplayer <filename.extension>" what error do you get?
[09:03] <jlaw> whyameye, it's a oneliner posted on the site you gave me
[09:03] <nothlit> Bakefy, sorry, unused space... as in not assigned to a partition, it would be the last entry in the partition listing
[09:03] <RMorris84> what is the program i always see people using called,  the one that they are making screencast videos from?
[09:03] <Lovloss> mplayer: command not found
[09:03] <you_explorer> hi friends i new user of ubuntu  how i install realplayer
[09:03] <nothlit> Bakefy, that probably means you should delete that partition you have right now and make a new one that takes up the whole drive
[09:03] <RMorris84> you
[09:03] <whyameye> Lovloss: install mplayer and see if it likes you file: "sudo apt-get install mplayer"
[09:04] <nothlit> Bakefy, then sudo umount -a; sudo mount -a   don't mind the messages
[09:04] <Lovloss> woah its installing all these lib files
[09:04] <RMorris84> you_explorer: goto google and search for automatix
[09:04] <whyameye> Lovloss: let it do what it wants. Linux is chatty, but it shouldn't scare you. OS X and WinXP do stuff like that all the time but they shut up about it....
[09:05] <nothlit> Lovloss, you probably need to set mplayer to use xv, in command line its -vo xv and in gmplayer (graphical) its right click on the video window, preferences, video tab
[09:05] <RMorris84> you_explorer: if u just got ubuntu i recommend u stop there and check that out for sure
[09:05] <whyameye> nothlit: it sounded like Lovloss didn't even have mplayer installed....
[09:05] <quik_> hey folks
[09:05] <quik_> what is the command to create groups?
[09:05] <quik_> and manage groups?
[09:06] <ryukun> hello everyone
[09:06] <ArrenLex> quik_: addgroup ;)
[09:06] <nothlit> whyameye, no earlier he said it usually doesnt work
[09:06] <nothlit> whyameye, so i told him why
[09:06] <Bakefy> nothlit, If I right click to see the properties of the folder named hdb1 in the media folder, its volume is "/" is that right?
[09:06] <RancidLM> can some one suggest a good pda that would be able to sync up with ubuntu?
[09:06] <menko> Hi, I want to compress the contents of a partition (as bz2) and copy it to a folder. I guess tar -xcjf would be the appropriate base command, is there anything else I need to add?
[09:06] <whyameye> nothlit: he said the error for mplayer was "command not found. " now he is installing...
[09:06] <Lovloss> I have mplayer therwe now, but it says it cannot detect video output when i try to open a file with it
[09:06] <burepe_> can someone check this? www.ekoshi.net
[09:06] <ArrenLex> menko: not x. x means extract.
[09:06] <nothlit> whyameye, i said EARLIER
[09:07] <whyameye> nothlit: well in any case it sounds like your advice might help him now...
[09:07] <Lovloss> okay! mplayer offic.AVI makes the file open. yay
[09:07] <menko> ArrenLex: Ah yes,mad a mistake, so any more to add to the proper one?
[09:07] <whyameye> Lovloss: does it play OK and w/ audio and video?
[09:07] <Lovloss> this video has no audio
[09:07] <nothlit> Bakefy, no that isn't correct
[09:07] <Zelda> hello everyone
[09:07] <Lovloss> but yes
[09:07] <ArrenLex> menko: That will work. If you're compressing a whole partition as bz2, grab a cup of coffee because that's going to be a long wait.
[09:08] <ArrenLex> Lovloss: If it has no audio why are we bothering with this?! XD
[09:08] <tonyyarusso> Okay, ftp server up and running.  Now I need to know how to change the default directory for a particular user...

[09:11] <LordGoth> can someone instruct me on how to pull files from my NTFS partition over to Xubuntu?
[09:11] <chriskk> Anybody using Shorewall firewall?
[09:11] <quik_> how do I list all groups
[09:11] <whyameye> LordGoth: can't Xubuntu see the partition OK?
[09:12] <chriskk> I'm in the process of setting it up, but kind of confused regarding the  rules
[09:12] <LordGoth> not sure. how would I check to see if Xubuntu can see it?

[09:12] <LordGoth> I assume so, whyameye.
[09:13] <whyameye> LordGoth: I don't really get it. You have 1 disk w/ 2 partitions, one is Linux and the other NTFS?
[09:13] <LordGoth> no, 2 disks, two separate systems.

[09:18] <burepe_> Is there any free dynamic dns service that I can use with my own domain?
[09:18] <Bakefy> tomorrow mythtv!
[09:18] <whyameye> burepe_: www.no-ip.com
[09:19] <nothlit> mooreand13213, ok if you want just a functioning kde without anything else, install kdebase, if you want kubuntu, then install kubuntu-desktop, and if you want all of kde you install kde (you can use synaptic, but a command line package manager from a virtual console would be preferable)
=== WikiMan is now known as MatthewV
[09:19] <whyameye> burepe_: sorry. Might not support your own domain.
[09:19] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok see if you can write anything to the drive
[09:19] <Bakefy> nothlit, thanks for your help, I will tell others of your knowlege
[09:19] <LordGoth> whyameye: no errors reported back. I assumed it worked?
[09:19] <burepe_> yeah
[09:19] <nothlit> Bakefy, also, run ln -s /media/hdb1 hdb1
[09:19] <nothlit> Bakefy, it makes a link in your home folder, it might be usefule
[09:19] <whyameye> LordGoth: so you typed both lines? Can you see your files? "ls /mnt/hda"
[09:19] <burepe_> Ok, Anybody know a real cheap dynamic dns sevice?
[09:20] <LordGoth> gah, permission denied -.-
=== a6hishek is now known as [abhishek] 
[09:20] <whyameye> LordGoth: try "sudo ls /mnt/hda"
[09:20] <LordGoth> ok, that worked :D
[09:20] <FirstStrike> burepe_: there are free ones
[09:20] <whyameye> LordGoth: so are you set then?
[09:21] <burepe_> can you use your own domain?
[09:21] <LordGoth> almost. can I now use Thunar to drag files from NTFS, or is there another way I have to do this?
[09:21] <Bakefy> I believe it is write protected
[09:21] <nothlit> Lovloss ffmpeg -i test.mpg -ab 56 -ar 22050 -b 500 -r 15 -s 320x240 test.flv <-- grabbed it from google results
[09:21] <nothlit> VLC can transcode things
[09:22] <burepe_> FirstStrike: can you use your own domain? Do you know the name of one?
[09:22] <whyameye> LordGoth: I don't know thunar. You could use nautilus to drag and drop. From the command line: "gksudo nautilus"
[09:22] <FirstStrike> burepe_: They all have their own rules. Google it.
[09:22] <Bakefy> nothlit, how do i take off the write protection?
[09:22] <LordGoth> ack, nautilus isn't installed.
[09:23] <nothlit> LordGoth, copy to another drive or write something to the ntfs drive
[09:23] <nothlit> Bakefy, ok, what is your username in linux
[09:23] <burepe_> FirstStrike: I did and it is not straight forward thats why I am asking.
[09:23] <Bakefy> westjd
[09:23] <lumar> question: when using synaptic i go to install nvidia-settings, it then puts nvidia-glx (which ive already installed) under 'to be removed' . but all guuides talk about installing both
[09:23] <whyameye> LordGoth: you are on kubuntu, huh?
[09:23] <lumar> how can i get the settings to install without it wanting to remove glx
[09:23] <nothlit> Bakefy, sudo chown -R westjd:westjd /media/hdb1
[09:24] <Bakefy> is the second one my password
[09:24] <nothlit> no
[09:24] <FirstStrike> burepe_: This isn't a support channel for dynamic dns services.
[09:24] <nothlit> its your group
[09:24] <whyameye> LordGoth: I would *not* recommend writing the ntfs drive from linux. Only read.
[09:24] <damageDOne> Hi, can anyone help me shift files from one computer on my network to another?
[09:24] <burepe_> ah ha
[09:24] <LordGoth> whyameye: I'm on Xubuntu 6.06
[09:24] <infinity1> if i put a video DVD in the drive, should fdisk -l /dev/cdrom show anything?
[09:25] <whyameye> LordGoth: right. Sorry. Forgot. is the xubuntu file manager called thunar or something?
[09:25] <nothlit> whyameye, ntfs-3g or captive are pretty safe
[09:25] <nothlit> whyameye, it is
[09:25] <infinity1> i'm trying to play back a dvd without luck.
[09:25] <LordGoth> whyameye: yes.
[09:25] <whyameye> nothlit: that is not how he mounted, thoguh.
[09:25] <Bakefy> i can wrtite in there now!
[09:25] <whyameye> LordGoth: then "sudo thunar" should be fine
[09:25] <lumar> pls help
[09:25] <nothlit> whyameye, yeah but you said ntfs drive from linux, might give him the impression ntfs writing is not possible/practical in linux
[09:25] <nothlit> LordGoth, no gksudo thunar
[09:26] <nothlit> LordGoth, never use sudo for graphical programs
[09:26] <whyameye> ok nothlit. You know best. Continue to overwhelm everybody with your knowledge. :-) I'm going to bed....
[09:26] <damageDOne> Hi...... I've got two ubuntu machines on my network and I want to try and move my home folder from one to the other. Can anyone help?
[09:26] <nothlit> whyameye, rofl no i don't
[09:26] <lumar> yo nothlit, might i request your assistance
[09:27] <Lovloss> One last try... i wish to turn Offic.avi to Offic.flv     It does not have sound. Does anyone know a working command that will allow this
[09:27] <nothlit> damageDOne, you need to install ssh  NFS or rsync, and use that to transfer files
[09:27] <Lovloss> because installing frontends is just as tough as anything
=== a6hishek is now known as [abhishek] 
[09:28] <nothlit> damageDOne, I only know how to use ssh or samba from the top of my head, but rsync is probably the best solution
[09:28] <damageDOne> nothlit: I have installed NFS on both machines and have made the home folder on one machine shared. However, I don't seem to be able to view the shared folder from the other machine. :)
[09:28] <nothlit> Bakefy, thats great :)
[09:28] <Bakefy> nothlit, you're the best help!
[09:29] <blaa> nolimitsoya
[09:29] <Bakefy> thanks so much
[09:29] <nothlit> damageDOne, I don't use NFS... but its probably a user authentication or config file error
[09:29] <nothlit> damageDOne, are you sure you made the folder visible?
[09:30] <damageDOne> nothlit: I don't know how to make it visible? I added it using the instructions in the help... but apart from that I don't know what else to do.
[09:30] <LordGoth> why, even when I gksudo into NTFS, it gives a long message about not connecting to D-BUS.
[09:30] <nothlit> !NFS
[09:30] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[09:30] <LordGoth> I'm not going to risk it.
[09:31] <nothlit> damageDOne, you used those?
[09:31] <damageDOne> nothlit: Sorry what's "those"
[09:31] <nothlit> !NFS | damageDOne
[09:31] <ubotu> damageDOne: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[09:32] <LordGoth> I wonder though...
[09:32] <damageDOne> nothlit: I'm not following you? I guess this is IRC speak.
[09:32] <LordGoth> is it possible to download stuff locally as localhost?
[09:32] <nothlit> LordGoth, oh dbus stuff, ignore those... that happens everywhere... anyways you mounted your NTFS drive read only
[09:32] <LordGoth> from one hd to another?
[09:32] <Lovloss> does linux come with GTK+ 2.4 ?
[09:32] <lumar>  question: when using synaptic i go to install nvidia-settings, it then puts nvidia-glx (which ive already installed) under 'to be removed' . but id like both to be installed, they are supposed to cooperate.h
[09:33] <LordGoth> is there a way to mount NTFS as read-write?
[09:33] <Corporal_Dirge> Ok, I'm trying to burn an audio CD from MP3s, but both my burning apps don'r recognize mp3.
[09:33] <nothlit> LordGoth, you need to install ntfs-3g
[09:33] <nothlit> LordGoth, ubuntuguide.org
[09:33] <LordGoth> nothlit: thank you.

[09:40] <fontis> i just installed it and its great
[09:40] <lumar> and id like to install the nvidia-settings. but keep the glx
[09:40] <meshyf> archive manager? That come with Ubuntu by chance or do i chgeck the package manager for that?

[09:42] <quintok> hda, hdb, hdc etc... is that set by hdd order per boot?
[09:43] <lumar> but they arn't available in my synaptic pm, i downloaded them via aptitude just then using the line you gave me
[09:43] <lumar> so thanks, ill see where i go from here..
[09:43] <nothlit> lumar, if you're installing nvidia 1.0-9629 from an alternate place, you probably already have nvidia-settings installed

[10:10] <nothlit> abuyazan, why not
[10:10] <abuyazan>  Depends: libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.14.8) but 1.14.5-0ubuntu1 is to be installed

[10:10] <damageDOne> nothlit: $ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[10:10] <damageDOne>  * Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server...                               [fail] 
[10:11] <nothlit> jadacyrus-laptop, it takes command line gconf editing, look for ssh vino-server and gconf on google
[10:11] <jadacyrus-laptop> ah
[10:11] <nothlit> damageDOne, sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
[10:11] <nothlit> jadacyrus-laptop, i would recommend installing x11vnc on that computer
[10:12] <nothlit> jadacyrus-laptop, and doing a reverse connection to a listening vnc server
[10:12] <nothlit> jadacyrus-laptop, you could tunnel it over vnc, if you wanted
[10:12] <nothlit> jadacyrus-laptop, or not even a listening server, just run it normally and connect to it
[10:12] <fek> moin
[10:12] <nothlit> tunnel it over ssh*
[10:12] <jadacyrus-laptop> nice
[10:13] <yed> help: i'm trying to install dapper AMD64, and it's hanging on "creating live CD user". any ideas why?
[10:13] <nothlit> jadacyrus-laptop, installing and using x11vnc is much simpler... theres of course x0vncserver and x0vnc4server from xvncserver and xvnc4server  but they take a lot more cpu
[10:13] <nothlit> like 30%
[10:13] <damageDOne> nothlit: I assume I'm supposed to replace user@192.168.0.xxx with something else?
[10:14] <nothlit> damageDOne, and dir and newdir :)
[10:14] <real_ate> hey all :P
[10:14] <real_ate> hows it goin?
[10:14] <damageDOne> nothlit: I hate being stupid... What goes in in place of the user@... bit?
[10:15] <nothlit> !offtopic | real_ate
[10:15] <ubotu> real_ate: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:15] <nothlit> damageDOne, your username... as in /home/user
[10:15] <jadacyrus-laptop> nothlit, okay ive installed x11vnc
[10:15] <real_ate> well i am lookin for some support but i didn't think i should just start askin away
[10:15] <nothlit> damageDOne, without the /home/ of course
[10:15] <jadacyrus-laptop> and ran it
[10:15] <jadacyrus-laptop> but how do i connect to it instead of the vino server
[10:15] <nothlit> now run vncviewer on the other side
[10:15] <nothlit> and connect to it
[10:15] <tonyyarusso> real_ate: That's how it's done here, strange as it seems ;)
[10:15] <real_ate> but here goes... anyone ever try to install the cisco Aironet Utility?
[10:15] <nothlit> as soon as you run it its running lol
[10:16] <damageDOne> nothlit: the user name of the origin machine or the destination?
[10:16] <real_ate> tonyyarusso: thanks, gotta get used to it i suppose
[10:16] <nothlit> damageDOne, oldmachine
[10:16] <nothlit> damageDOne, gl
[10:16] <dreamer> does anybody know how I can make the last.fm function of AmaroK work? I put all my login-data, but last.fm doesn't say it works
[10:17] <ubuntu> ok im trying to install 6.06 onto a sata drive how can i make the installer load it up
[10:17] <nothlit> dreamer, doesn't say it works or says it doesn't work?
[10:18] <kuzmaster> hey, im not quite sure where to ask this, so, im going to ask this both here and in #mysql........
[10:18] <damageDOne> nothlit: okay I got the message: ssh: ubuntu: Name or service not known
[10:18] <kuzmaster>  anyway, i did the command "mysqladmin -h frankie -u root password <PASSWORD>", it it came out with this result "mysqladmin: connect to server at 'frankie' failed" then,
[10:18] <kuzmaster>  on a new line it says this "error: 'Lost connection to MySQL server during query'
[10:18] <kuzmaster> help?
[10:18] <nothlit> damageDOne, /msg me what command you used
[10:18] <dreamer> nothlit: last.fm says I haven't listened to music and I have to install the software
[10:19] <NineTeen67Comet> I am attempting to add a printer to my server (headless) and using the cups web interface (IP:631) but I'm not seeing all the drivers that are normally listed .. is there another foomatic I need to install?
[10:19] <nothlit> dreamer, oh I don't use amarok, I just wanted you to clarify so people could help you... anyways have you tried listen? its gtk so you don't have to load kde libs just for one app (it has last.fm support, but i don't use it)
[10:20] <NineTeen67Comet> gutenprint? somthing?
[10:20] <dreamer> nothlit: Amarok is pretty good, except for the media-library :/
[10:20] <_JECKEL_> hello everybody
[10:20] <dreamer> nothlit: what do you use for music playing ?
[10:20] <roy_> what's the command to unload a module?
[10:21] <damageDOne> nothlit: did you get that?
[10:21] <nothlit> dreamer, i'm not mixing libs for one app, and yes there might be more than one, but by the time i find a new one ive found a replacement for the old one
[10:21] <nothlit> damageDOne, no, i'm sorry
[10:21] <frying_fish> roy_: sudo rmmod NAMEOFMODULE
[10:21] <dreamer> nothlit: er .. what do you mean ?
[10:21] <nothlit> dreamer, i use listen, but my main criteria is lyrics and how accessible they are
[10:21] <real_ate> anyone catch my question about using cisco Aironet Utility? anyone ever have any experience
[10:21] <dreamer> ok
[10:21] <real_ate> ?
[10:21] <nothlit> dreamer, listen is still the most feature filled in terms of what people think of mostly
[10:22] <nothlit> dreamer, in the gtk world
[10:22] <dreamer> haha, ok :)
[10:22] <dreamer> I'm in KDE atm, but I can try it
[10:22] <jessy> hi all, in what package is the "deb" utility ?
[10:22] <nothlit> dreamer, oh you're running kubuntu? lol then don't use gtk apps... that means you have to load the libs in your ram
[10:23] <damageDOne> nothlit: I tried using /msg but it doesn't appear to be working for me.
[10:23] <nothlit> jessy, a graphic and command line installer for debs is already installed
[10:23] <dreamer> I liko Amarok so far, but it's very case-sensitive, so if some tracks have different case for an artist, there are 2 different artists in the list :/
[10:23] <dreamer> andd I have that alot apperantly
[10:23] <nothlit> jessy, for command line try sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb
[10:24] <dreamer> I have all my music in a cetrain order on my disk, so I like the 'media-library' as it is in xmms, bucalue it just browses the list
[10:24] <jessy> nothlit, thanks but I'd like that precise tool called deb , I know some other do simlar things, but the syntax may differ
[10:24] <real_ate> anyone who ever tried to use the cisco Aironet Client Utility ever get to set a WEP key, mine won't let me
[10:24] <nothlit> damageDOne, you could just paste it into the channel if you don't mind people knowing your usernames
[10:24] <_JECKEL_> so..how easy is ssh to setup?
[10:25] <nothlit> jessy, the correct command line tool for installing .debs is dpkg or gdebi
[10:25] <nothlit> for gui
[10:25] <jessy> ok nothlit but some documentation tells me to use deb
[10:26] <nothlit> _JECKEL_, just sudo aptitude install openssh-server && sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[10:26] <jessy> I just would like to know in which package is that tool :)
[10:26] <nothlit> jessy, well use dpkg -i or double click on them and use the graphical tool
[10:26] <nothlit> .deb is the package format
[10:26] <nothlit> dpkg is the tool
[10:26] <Twinxor_> I wish "normal" apps like Firefox had a killring
=== Twinxor_ is now known as Twinxor
[10:26] <jessy> nothlit, there is a tool called "deb" too
[10:26] <_JECKEL_> oh..cool
[10:26] <jessy> just I don't know where it is
[10:27] <nothlit> !info deb | jessy
[10:27] <ubotu> Package deb does not exist in any distro I know
[10:27] <_JECKEL_> lol..says it failed
[10:27] <damageDOne> nothlit: I've pasted it in the other channel.
[10:27] <kuzmaster> anyway, i did the command "mysqladmin -h frankie -u root password <PASSWORD>", it it came out with this result "mysqladmin: connect to server at 'frankie' failed" then
[10:27] <jessy> ah, sorry, I realise my mistake now, feel very stupid :)
[10:27] <kuzmaster> on a new line it says this "error: 'Lost connection to MySQL server during query'
[10:27] <bimberi> gdebi ?
[10:27] <kuzmaster> can some PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!! help me?
[10:28] <nothlit> damageDOne, which one?
[10:28] <jessy> it wasn't a command but a repository line, so starting with "deb" :)
[10:28] <kuzmaster> i really REALLY need this fixe
[10:28] <kuzmaster> fixed
[10:28] <nothlit> jessy, lol ...
[10:28] <bimberi> ah :)
[10:28] <damageDOne> nothlit: the one where you said "reply to this" "here"
[10:28] <Twinxor> what's wrong, kuzmaster???????????
[10:28] <jessy> well anyway thanks :) first step in a new distro are always a bit difficult
[10:29] <kuzmaster>  it it came out with this result "mysqladmin: connect to server at 'frankie' failed"
[10:29] <_JECKEL_> hmmmm
[10:29] <kuzmaster> anyway, i did the command "mysqladmin -h frankie -u root password <PASSWORD>", it it came out with this result "mysqladmin: connect to server at 'frankie' failed" then
[10:29] <kuzmaster> anyway, i did the command "mysqladmin -h frankie -u root password <PASSWORD>", it it came out with this result "mysqladmin: connect to server at 'frankie' failed" then
[10:29] <Twinxor> oh, I have no idea about that :/
[10:29] <_JECKEL_> Starting openBSD secure shell server... fail
[10:29] <kuzmaster> lol
[10:29] <_JECKEL_> hmmm
[10:29] <Doow> kuzmaster: stop spamming
[10:29] <Twinxor> maybe in another freenode chan - not really an ubuntu issue
[10:29] <kuzmaster> doow: sorry, i diddnt mean to, honestly
[10:29] <nothlit> damageDOne, i think your nickname isn't registered, just paste it in the channel or /join #damageDOne and tell me there
[10:29] <Doow> kuzmaster: sure..
[10:30] <_JECKEL_> I take it my ssh port isn't open?
[10:30] <nothlit> _JECKEL_, sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
[10:30] <real_ate> wireless!! not working!!! please help!!
[10:30] <Doow> real_ate: lol
[10:30] <kuzmaster> !details
[10:30] <_JECKEL_> Restarting OpenBSD Secure shell server ok
[10:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about details - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:30] <_JECKEL_> is that it?
[10:30] <kuzmaster> !detail
[10:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about detail - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:31] <bimberi> kuzmaster: what is "frankie". It appears to be assuming that's a host on your network?
[10:31] <real_ate> i have a cisco card that i can't get working. i have only just managed to install the client that they give for linux (after a whole load of greif!)
[10:31] <real_ate> but i still cant seem to get it to work
[10:31] <_JECKEL_> oh awesome!
[10:31] <nothlit> _JECKEL_, yup, now connect to it with ssh username@192.168.0.XXX
[10:31] <bimberi> kuzmaster: ... which it can't find - hence the error
[10:32] <real_ate> my profesional opinion is that its "just not working"
[10:32] <_JECKEL_> i'm connecting to it with a windows comp
[10:32] <nothlit> use putty
[10:32] <real_ate> or somehting like that
[10:32] <_JECKEL_> I am
[10:32] <nothlit> have fun
[10:32] <sc4ttrbrain> kuzmaster: try replace it withlocalhost
[10:32] <nothlit> if you want to bump up the security you should take a look at the ssh how to and advanced ssh in the ubuntu wiki
[10:33] <nothlit> otherwise if the ssh server is exposed to the internet it won't take long to bring in with a dictionary attack
[10:33] <nothlit> break in*
[10:33] <kuzmaster> sc4ttrbrain: allready tried that
[10:33] <kuzmaster> diddnt work :(
[10:33] <bimberi> kuzmaster: or try without "-h frankie" altogether
[10:33] <_JECKEL_> ok thanks nothlit
[10:33] <nothlit> or brute force
[10:33] <_JECKEL_> I just wanted something to do with my work time now >_>
[10:34] <_JECKEL_> and to see if I could do it
[10:34] <nothlit> _JECKEL_, have fun
[10:34] <kuzmaster> bimberi: diddnt work :(
[10:34] <nothlit> you can learn tunneling and keys next! :)
[10:34] <nothlit> then the scp command if you want to do it cli style :)
[10:34] <_JECKEL_> now I can use any terminal command I would use on the ubuntu machine it's self right? cept that ya know...visual applications wont work
[10:34] <_JECKEL_> right?
[10:34] <jessy> is there an howto somewhere to install nvidia drivers when you have a custom kernel ?
[10:35] <nothlit> _JECKEL_, visual applications can work over vnc, or if you enable X server fowarding in putty and install xming... xming.sourceforge.net
[10:35] <_JECKEL_> that will work for windows?
[10:35] <jadacyrus-laptop> is there a way to reload the gconf settings?
[10:35] <_JECKEL_> oh..and how do I shut down the server?
[10:36] <_JECKEL_> well that's funny
[10:36] <_JECKEL_> I stopped the server in the SSH client..still going though lol
[10:37] <real_ate> anyone here know anyting about cisco wireless cards or am i just wasting my time?
[10:37] <nothlit> _JECKEL_, yeah, you can install an x server in windows... if you want to maintain themes look into .gtkrc-2.0 file creation
[10:37] <nothlit> its supposed to thats what a server/daemon does
[10:37] <morphix> just a question.. has there been any PROPER fix out yet for the JMicron controller issues ?
[10:37] <nothlit> sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop
[10:38] <googie> sis 900 network card troubles MAC address: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF any ideas what to do with this?
[10:39] <floating_> real_ate: probably someone :p ask same question in 2h or tomorrow or such, and you might get better assistancve than forums
[10:39] <_JECKEL_> hmmmm
[10:39] <nothlit> !google
[10:39] <ubotu> Google is a very popular search engine: http://www.google.com  -  Google also has a Linux-specific search engine: http://google.com/linux
[10:39] <floating_> my wlan problem got solved here, after I tried few methods on forums :p
[10:39] <nothlit> !community
[10:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about community - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:39] <nothlit> !wiki
[10:39] <ubotu> wiki is http://wiki.ubuntu.com - Loads of user-contributed documentation
[10:39] <_JECKEL_> so what should I look for to make my connection more secure?
[10:39] <nothlit> !wiki | _JECKEL_
[10:39] <ubotu> _JECKEL_: wiki is http://wiki.ubuntu.com - Loads of user-contributed documentation
[10:40] <nothlit> look for stuff there
[10:40] <_JECKEL_> cool
[10:40] <nothlit> specifically the SSHHowTo and AdvancedSSH
=== ozzloy_ is now known as ozzloy
[10:40] <nothlit> the best thing you can do is use key based authentication
=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[10:40] <morphix> looks like ubuntu is still retarded and hasnt added a kernel to fix the jmicron issues
[10:40] <nothlit> theres a key creation utility for putty, but it isnt putty.exe.. .also make sure you use the export function
[10:41] <nothlit> and turn of password based authentication
[10:41] <nothlit> after that change ports
[10:41] <nothlit> the rest you will have to read
[10:41] <googie> any ideas how to permanently change MAC address?
[10:42] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone manage to compile uslash theme containing transparent png ? i compile mine,but png2usplash make the transparent part become black..

[10:42] <nothlit> googie, mac addresses aren't supposed to be changed

[10:43] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone manage to compile uslash theme containing transparent png ? i compile mine,but png2usplash make the transparent part become black...?
[10:43] <nothlit> sc4ttrbrain, wait a while in between reasking
[10:43] <noober> um quick question, how do i change to Host-Only?
[10:43] <dollsong> Hello Ubuntu
[10:44] <sc4ttrbrain> i did :p
[10:45] <Seveas> sc4ttrbrain, usplash doesn't support transparency
[10:45] <noober> im trying to get my internet working on my newly installed ubuntu
[10:45] <noober> and i need to Shut down the vmware OS and change the networking option from NAT to Bridged
[10:45] <noober> but how?
[10:45] <nothlit> hit the the big red button
[10:45] <dreamer> nothlit: Listen also has this case-sensitive medialibrary, that sucks :/ I don't want to rename every trock that has different casing :/
[10:45] <sc4ttrbrain> Seveas: really? but, i see some ppl on kde-look or gnome-look compile their theme.. and it use transparent png
[10:45] <dreamer> atm I can't even because it's all on ntfs-disk
[10:46] <nothlit> and then change the properties of the machine
[10:46] <Seveas> sc4ttrbrain, as the person who implemented large parts of usplash I can tell you that transparency isn't supported :)
[10:47] <sc0tt> Seveas :D
[10:47] <sc0tt> morning folks
[10:47] <Seveas> hi sc0tt
[10:47] <noober> anyone know how to Shut down the vmware OS and change the networking option from NAT to Bridged??
[10:47] <sc4ttrbrain> Seveas: u might get me wrong, i dont want transparency like beryl, but what i want is like using icon which has transparent background
[10:48] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: check its setting
[10:48] <sexcopter8000> can Evolution be used as an RSS feed reader?
[10:48] <nothlit> dreamer, oh, maybe theres a gconf setting for it or  something
[10:48] <nothlit> dreamer, try googling it
[10:48] <Seveas> sc4ttrbrain, usplash doesn't support that, it'll render the transparent pixels as (probably) black
[10:48] <Seveas> sexcopter8000, no. Better use liferea
[10:48] <_JECKEL_> ok so I don't get it...
[10:49] <sexcopter8000> Seveas: thanks for the suggestion
[10:49] <_JECKEL_> I'm doing what they said in the wiki..but I can still easily connect..it's still asking for username and password
[10:49] <sc4ttrbrain> Seveas: yeah u maybe right actually,because i contact those ppl, but never get respond
[10:49] <_JECKEL_> nothing about a passkey...
[10:49] <dollsong> #ubuntu?
[10:49] <damageDOne> nothlit: did you see the output in the other channel
[10:49] <nothlit> sexcopter8000, if you really want to you can use thunderbird, but definitely liferea is the best program... theres also the sage extension for firefox which is popular
[10:50] <sc4ttrbrain> Seveas: thanks for info though its making me mad for days, just hope somedays it support transparency
[10:50] <sc0tt> morning Seveas :] 
[10:50] <Seveas> sc4ttrbrain, if I have time it'll be supported for feisty ;)
[10:50] <noober> sc4ttbrain: i really dont know how to do buttloads of basic stuff, how do i check the setting?
[10:50] <sc4ttrbrain> Seveas: looking forward ;)
[10:50] <noober> if i can get there, i think im home free!
[10:51] <dollsong> Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalal
[10:51] <dollsong> Why won't anyone help me
[10:51] <Seveas> dollsong, you didn't ask anything
[10:52] <sexcopter8000> thanks nothlit

[10:55] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: 1. vmware is not os, 2. you can change the setting as easy as clicking if u have the workstation edition
[10:55] <noober> hmmmm
[10:55] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: what edition is your vmware?
[10:56] <nothlit> sc4ttrbrain, no he didn't register his nick,

[10:57] <Corbeaux> noober is your dns not the same as your gateway?
[10:58] <noober> how can i check?
[10:58] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: what os are u tryin to install on vmware? ubuntu? and whats the host os?
[10:58] <Corbeaux> ifconfig witll show you the gateway i guess
[10:58] <Corbeaux> gtg
[10:59] <noober> im just running ubuntu, only one partition
[11:00] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: and ur problem would be..? installing other os on vmware?
[11:00] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: use my name to make clear ur talkin to me ;)

[11:20] <Surghi> thank you Doow
[11:20] <paragon36> itclan.... : you need to make for space available .... can be on the same disk ... look at fips (google) or if you have windows installed look at partition magic
[11:21] <Doow> Surghi: don't thank me, thank google ^^
[11:21] <paragon36> noober can you now read your /etc/resolv.conf file?
[11:21] <rausb0> noober: it should be nameserver followed by a ip address. which address is it?
[11:21] <Itclanster> paragon36: ya i was thinking about partition magic but i feared by hearing about its crapy acts
[11:22] <noober> rausb0 its 192.168.0.1
[11:22] <paragon36> Yeah there is a risk involved ....
[11:22] <rausb0> noober: and is that the correct setting for your nameserver?
[11:22] <Itclanster> paragon36: ok i will try it
[11:22] <paragon36> No problem ..... Good luck

[11:34] <kuzmaster> gee, that help
[11:34] <kuzmaster> sorry
[11:34] <boink> kurzmaster: you want the user to only be able to log in to a certain chrooted dir?
[11:34] <boink> that's a called a "virtual user"

[11:35] <Stormx2> kuzmaster: Look in the config file. It will be in there.
[11:35] <boink> then they should be able to login just like a normal user
[11:35] <boink> that's easy to do, I think that's already in the default setup
[11:35] <kuzmaster> but where is the config file?
[11:35] <boink> proftpd.conf
[11:35] <kuzmaster> its a bit hard when you dont have a GUI
[11:36] <sc4ttrbrain> noober: u get dumped because u reply too slowly and u ask something not important,makes everyone mad
[11:36] <boink> it's easier without a GUI :)

[11:48] <rastilin> Why create an installable cd, and for what?
[11:48] <nothlit> niru, reconstructor.aperantis
[11:48] <mnepton> niru: take a look at the OEM install method
[11:48] <niru> I am creating an installable cd with d-i
[11:49] <niru> I have come up with the iso image
[11:49] <rastilin> So what's the problem?
[11:49] <niru> but after the base packages are getting installed the process stops and no other package are getting installed
[11:51] <niru> rastilin:did you get my point
[11:52] <quik_> how do I get the UID and GUI of a user?
[11:52] <paragon36> cat /etc/passwd
[11:52] <fyrestrtr> quik_: to get it of your own user, type id
[11:53] <quik_> other users?
[11:53] <paragon36> cat /etc/passwd
[11:53] <fyrestrtr> quik_: grep username /etc/passwd
[11:53] <tomix> looking to connect to an OSX server heard that you can (with some tweaking of remote desktop settings) use VNC for this purpose.
[11:53] <fyrestrtr> tomix: ssh works great :)
[11:53] <tomix> Anyone got any more info and or some advice on a good VNC client?
[11:54] <mnepton> tomix: ssh + sftp + samba
[11:54] <rastilin> tomix, tightvnc is better for most purposes
[11:54] <paragon36> root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash    ..... this show uid of 0 (first 0) and gid of 0 (second 0)
[11:54] <mnepton> tomix: never send a GUI to do a terminal's job ;)
[11:54] <rastilin> It works better over low speed connections and just like vnc over high speed
[11:54] <rastilin> Unless your application needs a gui
[11:54] <glaz> where can i see what is the resolution of my desktop
[11:55] <glaz> dont tell me xorg.conf :)
[11:55] <mnepton> glaz: on your monitor?
[11:55] <glaz> yeah
[11:55] <tomix> anepton: im looking to administer the osx machine
[11:55] <glaz> the one im actually running
[11:55] <mnepton> exactly.
[11:55] <mnepton> tomix: you can do all that from the command line
[11:56] <paragon36> look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf  for resolution
[11:56] <glaz> paragon36, i know that.
[11:56] <paragon36> so ... ?
[11:56] <glaz> how to know one of the all its set in there i am actually using
[11:57] <kuzmaster> can some here PLEASE! help me with proftpd?
[11:57] <glaz> i want to run 1440x900, but not sure if AiXGL supports it
[11:57] <kandinski> my Edgy install (clean, not an upgade) keeps not using swap
[11:57] <paragon36> menu ....   Desktop/screnresolutution
[11:58] <VigoFusion> Whats the or where is the information to set up my box to help the sick kids?
[11:58] <paragon36> menu ....   Desktop/screenresolutution
[11:58] <kandinski> despite the fact that I edited fstab to replace /dev/hda2 for the disk ID
[11:58] <glaz> paragon36, what menu ?
[11:58] <kandinski> swapon -s gives me /dev/hda2                               partition       1052248 11780   -1
[11:58] <kuzmaster> anyway, i cant send files to the ftp server outside the home directory?
[11:58] <tomix> im sure i can, but the fact is that apple provide a suite of decent tools that do this stuff quickly and easily so I would really rather use those
[11:58] <kandinski> what can I do to enable swap?
[11:58] <paragon36> you window manager bar at the top !
[11:58] <kuzmaster> help anyone, im running proftpd as the ftp server
[11:59] <paragon36> sorry ... System/Desktop/ScreenResolution
[11:59] <fyrestrtr> kandinski: don't worry if its not using it -- its a Good Thing(tm)
[11:59] <glaz> i dont have dekstop in there
[11:59] <glaz> preferences and administration
[11:59] <paragon36> ok let me find the command ...
[11:59] <ashish> hello ppl
[11:59] <kuzmaster> ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!
[11:59] <ashish> i m a newbie
[11:59] <glaz> paragon36, thanks
[11:59] <fyrestrtr> kandinski: swap is only used when there isn't enough RAM for programs. So if you RAM is being used 100% -- no need for swap. You should always maximize ram usage, swap is slow.
[11:59] <kuzmaster> i cant send files to the ftp server outside the home directory?
[11:59] <kuzmaster> i cant send files to the ftp server outside the home directory?
[12:00] <ashish> wanna have sum good linux ebook
[12:00] <kuzmaster> grrrrrr, sorry for spamming
[12:00] <kuzmaster> i hate it when it does that
[12:00] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: what?
[12:00] <glaz> you're not only spamming, you're loud.
[12:00] <kuzmaster> i cant send files to the ftp server outside the home directory?
[12:00] <paragon36> yeah try  system/preference/screenresolution  ... lol
[12:00] <VigoFusion> ashish: I have one bkmarked if you want me to pull it up.
[12:01] <glaz> paragon36, i guess if 1440x900 is not there i just add it to xorg.conf ?
[12:01] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: because you are locked inside your home directoy by your ftp server. Go change the settings in its configuration file for your user. For safety reasons, ftp doesn't allow users to roam around the system via ftp commands.
[12:01] <ashish> vigofusion:didnt get u
[12:01] <fyrestrtr> glaz: are you on a laptop with an intel chipset?
[12:01] <glaz> fyrestrtr, no
[12:01] <paragon36> Glaz : yes but you may need to ajust the monitor section to accept it.
[12:01] <glaz> im on a desktop with a widescreen monitor
[12:02] <kandinski> fyrestrtr
[12:02] <kuzmaster> fyestrtr: ill look again............
[12:02] <VigoFusion> ashish: :)
[12:02] <glaz> same monitor on an other windows box runs 1440x900
[12:02] <fyrestrtr> glaz: ah, you can then set the resolution in xorg.conf -- and make sure your accelerated drivers are installed.
[12:02] <glaz> they are, im using AiXGL + beryl
[12:02] <kandinski> fyrestrtr: it uses zero swap all the time, and load goes super high when in dapper it used to just swap
[12:03] <glaz> ill try that
[12:03] <glaz> brb
[12:03] <kandinski> same case uses: firefox with a shitload of tabs, working in the gimp, and suddenly a conversation starting in skype
[12:03] <fyrestrtr> kandinski: how much ram do you have?
[12:03] <kandinski> it used to swap in dapper, now it crashes or gets s.l.o.w and I see load shoot up
[12:03] <kandinski> I have one gig
[12:03] <paragon36> Glaz : as mentioned add it to the xorg.conf ... then ctrl/alt/backspace should restart XDM
[12:03] <fyrestrtr> and how much of it is being used?
[12:04] <kandinski> oh right
[12:04] <kuzmaster> can anyone tell me where abouts in the proftpd config file i change stuff, so i can upload EVERYWHERE on the server?
[12:04] <kandinski> right now it is 60 for programs and 40 for cache
[12:04] <kandinski> I need to check how much when it starts going pear-shaped
[12:04] <Ubuntu> any help on gfxboot?
[12:04] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: you really, really, really don't want to enable that setting.
[12:04] <Ubuntu> newbie on linux here :(
[12:04] <kandinski> fyrestrtr: thanks. let me load the machine till load shoots up, and check memory usage then.
[12:04] <fyrestrtr> Ubuntu: ask a question :)
[12:04] <VigoFusion> Learning is fun!
[12:05] <paragon36> Ive asked the following many times does no one know the answer  ????
[12:05] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt: but, no one on the outside network can access that anyway
[12:05] <paragon36> I can set the mtu size via # ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492 but where does one set the MTU size permanently?
[12:05] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:its limitited for inside-network only!
[12:05] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: the setting is in the configuration file, I don't recall what it is off the top. Use scp if you can.
[12:05] <sc4ttrbrain> paragon36: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=291123
[12:05] <fyrestrtr> paragon36: /etc/networking/
[12:05] <sc4ttrbrain> paragon36: but not the exact solution
[12:06] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:scp? (sorry if im pissing you off, i dont really know anything about profptd)
[12:06] <paragon36> Ueah I thought that /etc/networking/interfaces
[12:06] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: scp is secure copy. A way to transfer files using encryption. A lot better than FTP.
[12:06] <paragon36> but cant see anything there as an example for mtu...
[12:06] <Ubuntu> hello again
[12:06] <fyrestrtr> paragon36: man interfaces should tell you
[12:06] <Ubuntu> it's about how to use gfxboot
[12:07] <Ubuntu> the graphical splashscrren
[12:07] <fyrestrtr> what about it?
[12:07] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:but i dont need encryption or anything, im the only person in about 2kms radious that knows anything about this stuff
[12:07] <quik_> I want to kill a process (in a script) that is named (I don't know the pid) ... using kill -HUP
[12:07] <gradin_> if i have a ssh server running and i want to used key based authentication does the other box have to have an SSH dameon running aswell?
[12:07] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt: all i want is that ftp have full privlidges to the whole HD
[12:08] <frogzoo> paragon36: is this a ppp interface?
[12:08] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: then ftp as root.
[12:08] <trope> if you're going to use an ftp daemon use vsftpd
[12:08] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:but HOW?
[12:08] <fyrestrtr> gradin_: no.
[12:08] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: in the settings file, there is a line that is commented out -- it allows root access. Uncomment it, save the file, restart ftp.
[12:09] <kuzmaster> ok, thanx
[12:09] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: then, create a password for root user, and login using that.
[12:09] <fyrestrtr> gradin_: no.
[12:09] <gradin_> fyrestrtr: so all i have to do is copy the key from the remote box to the .ssh/authorized_keys file
[12:09] <paragon36> Thanks Guys ....  /etc/network/interfaces  mtu <size>   :-O
[12:09] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt: once again... how?

[12:21] <noiesmo> Paddy_EIRE, sudo apt-get install kde should do it
[12:21] <Paddy_EIRE> noiesmo: thx
[12:21] <noiesmo> Paddy_EIRE, then before you logon go sessions and pick kde
[12:21] <labanux> Paddy_EIRE, sudo apt-get install kde <-- then it will ask you, wether you want to use gdm or kdem to use
[12:21] <VigoFusion> labinux: Yes, the Plubins can be gotten from Synaptic Package Manager, System-->Administration-->Keyboard Plugins
[12:22] <Paddy_EIRE> labanux: noiesmo: thx guys

[12:24] <xukun> Paddy_EIRE, thanks a lot, I will
[12:25] <labanux> VigoFusion: is there any command line i can use, to get back to the keyborad layout set step??
[12:25] <Paddy_EIRE> xukun: also if you would like try "sudo apt-get install gtkpod"
[12:25] <glaz> what about gtkipod ?
[12:25] <VigoFusion> labinux: apologies, PluGins, its early here and I have yet to drink my coffee

[12:36] <thomas> hey guys, my network card isn't showing up in the network-admin. what can i do to troubleshoot?
[12:37] <VigoFusion> frogzoo: Yes, that seemed to work for a few people
[12:37] <labanux> VigoFusion: wait minute.., il try it
[12:38] <frogzoo> thomas: look in /var/log/messages  where the kernel tries to figure out a driver for the card
[12:38] <thomas> frogzoo: ok. how can i make ubuntu edgy boot with verbose printouts instead of just gui?
[12:39] <VigoFusion> labunux: Look at the Layouts Tab in Keyboard Preferances
[12:39] <felixfoertsch> Cound anyone tell me in which units the geometry has to be given to ETerm?
[12:39] <thomas> frogzoo: what should i look for?
[12:40] <frogzoo> thomas: 'eth' would be a good call
[12:40] <thomas> frogzoo: duh... :)
[12:40] <soundray> felixfoertsch: pixels, probably
[12:41] <felixfoertsch> soundray: Thats the point - it can't be pixels. :(
[12:41] <Paddy_EIRE> guys which would be considered the most stable and combination between (aiglx,beryl,compiz,xgl) and do I need to install one of these or 2 and why
[12:41] <soundray> felixfoertsch: then it'll be characters
[12:41] <thomas> frogzoo: ok it says something about hda-intel: Invalid position buffer
[12:41] <thomas> frogzoo: any idea what that could mean
[12:41] <felixfoertsch> soundray: If I set it to 512 width - it should be half my screen. It isn't.
[12:41] <glaz> aigxl,beryl
[12:41] <soundray> thomas: that's your audio driver
[12:41] <felixfoertsch> soundray: How do I mesure it then?
[12:41] <glaz> Xgl is pretty slower and unstable
[12:42] <frogzoo> thomas: cut/paste into google & see what turns up
[12:42] <thomas> soundray: hmmm so theres nothing there about my eth card
[12:42] <thomas> frogzoo: yeah thats a sound thing i thinkm
[12:42] <soundray> felixfoertsch: try 80x24
[12:42] <soundray> thomas: is it a PCI card?
[12:42] <thomas> is there a way to do a dpkg-reconfigure for your network
[12:42] <Paddy_EIRE> glaz: aiglx and beyl ok... aiglx has the fancy effects and beryl is ??
[12:42] <thomas> soundray: it is onboard
[12:43] <labanux> VigoFusin: i ve look in my xorg.conf
[12:43] <soundray> thomas: does it show up with lspci?
[12:43] <thomas> soundray: just a sec
[12:43] <glaz> Paddy_EIRE, AiXGL has the same feature as xgl, but pretty faster on GPU/CPU
[12:43] <glaz> and AiXGL is part of edgy 6.10
[12:43] <glaz> no need to install Xgl
[12:44] <Paddy_EIRE> glaz: im using 6.10 how do I activate aiglx??
[12:44] <glaz> it is already "activated"
[12:44] <thomas> soundray: nothing under eth or network, and i couldn't see anything
[12:44] <glaz> you have an ATI or GF video card ?
[12:44] <Paddy_EIRE> glaz: then where is all the effects
[12:44] <soundray> thomas: is it disabled in the BIOS setup?

[12:49] <Qwerty> :o
[12:50] <soundray> VigoFusion: PC105 is just a keyboard type, not a layout. It can still be qwerty, qwertz, azerty, dvorak, ...
[12:50] <Qwerty> :o :o its me!
[12:51] <VigoFusion> labanux: Yes, the 105 layout is the QWERTY, Generic US
[12:51] <naxxatoe> try dvorak
[12:51] <naxxatoe> thats a cool one :D

[02:18] <NET||abuse> if the graphics processor is over heating it should just cut out and you machine would die, it's unlikely to slow too much,,, but i suppose it's not beyond the realms of possability
[02:19] <NET||abuse> i would just thinki t highly unlikely
[02:19] <Placid> Doesn't look good VigoFusion
[02:19] <VigoFusion> Hrmmm
[02:19] <NET||abuse> if you gpu is running hot it means your runnin alot of high graphic stufff, more than likely your graphics memory is loaded up and that's not gonna help.

[02:45] <zaan> my screen goes black.
[02:45] <huiber1> *guessing
[02:45] <aleswy> one question
[02:45] <zaan> my computer is still doing something.
[02:46] <dawkirst> Am I correct if I say that DVDs are super sensitive to scratches, as opposed to CDs?
[02:46] <aleswy> this file /etc/inittab on ubuntu 6.10 no exist
[02:46] <zaan> it's an Acer aspire 5500
[02:46] <DanglyBits> i have a windowsxp(32bit) machine at work and I want to have a graphical connection to a server (amd64) at home...what are my best/easiest to setup options to allow this to work?
[02:46] <JJones0207> I thought about it but then I ran into a problem what am I going to use all I have is a 512 usb and 1 1gb mem stick
[02:46] <Tomcat_> dawkirst: I'd say they are both the same sensitive, but DVDs have a higher data to area ratio, so it will affect more.
[02:46] <zaan> a laptop with centrino platform
[02:46] <zaan> and ATI x700 m video card.
[02:47] <dawkirst> Tomcat_: Thanks.
[02:47] <cmt^^> zaan - I had the exact same problem
[02:48] <cmt^^> zaan - press alt+f2 when in the menu
[02:48] <zaan> aha
[02:48] <cmt^^> and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:48] <huiber1> zaan: sound like you ati card is not used correctly, have you try to start with boot option "failsave", or tried to use vesa? (probably not)
[02:48] <scane__> what is the background for "aptitude install mc" not working on 6.10 amd64 ?
[02:48] <cmt^^> change driver="ati" to driver="vesa"
[02:48] <huiber1> zaan: ignore me, listen to cmt^^
[02:48] <cmt^^> heh
[02:48] <zaan> okay cmt and huiber1
[02:48] <cmt^^> there's a guide somewhere
[02:48] <zaan> let me try that right now
[02:48] <cmt^^> but that's the first step
[02:48] <KomiaPoika> how can i install xv 3.10a in ubuntu?
[02:48] <zaan> I'm working on 2 computers
[02:48] <huiber1> JJones0207: so your booting of usb atm?
[02:48] <cmt^^> then u need to install fglrx
[02:48] <zaan> what is the second step?
[02:49] <cmt^^> but changing driver to vesa will get you through the installation
[02:49] <cmt^^> did for me anyway
[02:49] <cmt^^> wow
[02:49] <cmt^^> i actually HELPED someone
[02:49] <cmt^^> big day for me
[02:49] <JJones0207> :( no
[02:50] <JJones0207> just off a CD-RW
[02:50] <zaan> small problem... when exactly do I need to press ALT F2?
[02:50] <cmt^^> well
[02:50] <huiber1> JJones0207: hmmm, so you're booting of the only cdrom available in the system?
[02:50] <huiber1> cmt^^: congrats :-)
[02:50] <JJones0207> yes
[02:50] <cmt^^> don't really remember, i think it might be when you're in the installation-boot-menu
[02:51] <huiber1> JJones0207: have you tried disabling "splash" and "quiet" at the boot prompt?
[02:51] <zaan> it's not doing anything for me right now :(
[02:51] <cmt^^> ok hang on
[02:51] <cmt^^> try changing the resolution of the setup by pressing F4 (I think, there are tips on the bottom of the screen)
[02:52] <JJones0207> uhhh its a older computer it doesnt even have it
[02:52] <cmt^^> to increase resolution, then you will see the error message that comes up
[02:52] <soundray> KomiaPoika: do you mean the image viewer?
[02:52] <zainka> ok Im back, no compilation done yet.  How do i install make utility, its not installed as far as I can see. Install build-essential only asks for destination file opperand using -T, tried one but source is not found
[02:52] <cmt^^> zaan - then try pressing alt+f2 when the error message pops up
[02:52] <cmt^^> i remember now, that's what I did
[02:53] <cmt^^> you'll get a x-server errormessage in a console-graphics box
[02:53] <huiber1> cmt^^: don't you mean "ctrl-alt-f2" ?
[02:53] <cmt^^> huiber1 - not outside of x
[02:53] <cmt^^> huiber1 - I did alt+f2
[02:53] <cmt^^> might be different on other systems
[02:53] <jrib> zainka: sudo apt-get install build-essential    should just install a package.  Can you be more specific about what asked you for a destination?  Pastebin the output please
[02:53] <zaan> that doesn't seem to do anything yet.
[02:53] <huiber1> JJones0207: does not have _what_?

[02:54] <cmt^^> zaan - tell me what you're looking at right now
[02:54] <JJones0207> :
[02:54] <JJones0207> :(
[02:54] <Jowi> JJones0207, I would recommend turning off ACPI if the cd boots but fails to detect at installation time (if I understood correctly)
[02:54] <zaan> and f4 gets me in "special boot parameters, overview"
[02:54] <jrib> zainka: by the way, what program are you compiling?
[02:54] <cmt^^> well, like I said, there are tips on the bottom of the screen
[02:54] <zaan> which, if I press it, only mentions 'Rescue' and a way to boot into a rescue mode
[02:54] <scane__> What is the preferred way to get midnight commander into 6.10 AMD64 ? Add debian sources? Download some package? Please help I cant find any answer that fits on the web.
[02:55] <cmt^^> zaan - what are the different F*-commands listed on the bottom of the screen?
[02:55] <Dylan`> hi, can someone help me?
[02:55] <Dylan`> How can i get 'aoss' ?
[02:55] <huiber1> scane__: for M.C. "apt-get install mc"
[02:55] <jrib> Dylan`: sudo apt-get install aoss
[02:55] <cmt^^> I know you're supposed to be able to change the resolution from VGA
[02:55] <Dylan`> doesnt work
[02:55] <zaan> they are not listed at the bottom, but rather in the middle of the screen.
[02:55] <scane__> huiber1, on 6.10 amd64 it does not know of "mc"
[02:55] <Dylan`> It says cant find the pacckets
[02:55] <jrib> !info aoss
[02:55] <ubotu> Package aoss does not exist in any distro I know
[02:55] <zaan> they range from f2 to f10
[02:55] <Dylan`> Well, how can i get it?
[02:55] <jrib> Dylan`: alsa-oss  I mean :)

[02:56] <Dylan`> nice, it works
[02:56] <cmt^^> there's too much flood here for me to concentrate
[02:56] <soundray> scane__: you need to activate the right repository
[02:56] <Jowi> cmt^^, look at the bottom of that page for changing resolutions
[02:56] <JJones0207> This is what happens, I start up the computer with the CD with Ubuntu Installation Alternate. Then, I click Install in text mode, I check off english and stuff. Next, It checks for devices then I get the error "Your installation CD couldnt be mounted. This probaly means that a CD was not in the drive. If so you can insert it now and try again.
[02:56] <zaan> I'm there
[02:56] <Dylan`> Btw, if im gaming, the sound comes like 3 or 4 seconds later, how can i fix this?

[02:58] <Dylan`> But still the sound comes 4 seconds later
[02:58] <Dylan`> :/
[02:58] <keeganX> Dylan`: Is it a linux native game then?
[02:58] <Dylan`> its a linux game, yes

[02:59] <JJones0207> SATA? its rewriteable
[02:59] <soundray> JJones0207: how is it connected?
[03:00] <rambo3> :)
[03:00] <zainka> when typing 'make' it simply says command not found
[03:00] <rambo3> aot.get install make
[03:00] <fyrestrtr> zainka: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[03:00] <Jowi> zainka, you need to install build-essential
[03:00] <knoppix> hello world
[03:00] <JJones0207> Not sure but I know ive installed ubuntu on it before with what ever it has
[03:01] <soundray> JJones0207: have you used the "Check CD" boot option?
[03:01] <ubuntuxx> my problem is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35577/

[03:03] <JJones0207> Yes, Check CD for defects ( I Doubt after burning it 6 times its defective ) its doesnt detect cd
[03:03] <rambo3> ubuntuxx, ask in #c
[03:03] <soundray> Dylan`: nobody knows, otherwise they would have replied to you. Try in a few ours when a few new people have logged on.

[03:05] <ubuntuxx> ok
[03:06] <Ash-Fox> What a choice...
[03:06] <JJones0207> Why isnt it able to detect the cd but at the same time its booting off of it.......
[03:06] <Ash-Fox> JJones0207, because you need to fit the bootloader in the first 512k or something
[03:06] <JJones0207> 512 of ram?
[03:07] <Ash-Fox> Yes.
[03:07] <JJones0207> maybe thats why its not working ( cant detect cd ) that computer only has like 128 RAM
[03:07] <sod75> !helpme | knoppix
[03:07] <ubotu> knoppix: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:07] <JJones0207> thats why i got the alternate
[03:07] <soundray> Ash-Fox: you're not being helpful
[03:07] <ollum> hi... i got a problem. i'm in the livecd mode now and i want to mount my ubuntu partitions cuz my xserver is fucked up. i dont manage to get them mounted properly.
[03:07] <Ash-Fox> That's MB, I was talking about KB
[03:07] <soundray> JJones0207: that's not the reason
[03:07] <knoppix> hehehe ok
[03:07] <Jowi> JJones0207, no that is not the problem.
[03:08] <Jowi> JJones0207, I've installed ubuntu in systems with 64mb ram :)
[03:08] <knoppix> heres my prob: how do i change the username and password in pppoeconf
[03:08] <Ash-Fox> The bootloader to my knowledge doesn't have enough code to know which boot device it's booting from
[03:08] <stiffme1983> hello everyone
[03:08] <Ash-Fox> enough room for code
[03:08] <JJones0207> it says Mounting \dev\blahblah then it says invalid arguement
[03:09] <JJones0207> and then that message pops up
[03:09] <soundray> JJones0207: the CD boots while the drive is under the control of the BIOS. Then the kernel tries to take over, which is when it fails for some reason.
[03:09] <knoppix> coz i recently transferred residence and i kind of don't know how to change the username and password that loads on my pc
[03:09] <knoppix> im using knoppix now - quite obviously
[03:09] <JJones0207> But it says it loaded the kernal before installation starts
[03:09] <rambo3> JJones0207, does it have a console
[03:09] <JJones0207> ?
[03:10] <soundray> JJones0207: this happens sometimes when a CD-ROM is of the more recent SATA type, and is connected to a controller that doesn't have support. Hence my earlier question.
[03:10] <rambo3> shell  pormpt
[03:10] <soundray> JJones0207: since you've installed ubuntu before, that isn't the problem now.
[03:10] <thomas> how can i kill X so it doesn't start again?
[03:10] <soundray> thomas: 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'
[03:10] <JJones0207> Well last time I ran the CD and I couldnt get the regular one to work so someone told me to get the alternate and it worked
[03:11] <soundray> JJones0207: so you have the Ubuntu Desktop CD as well?
[03:11] <JJones0207> The regular one?
[03:11] <soundray> JJones0207: yes
[03:11] <Jowi> knoppix, should be in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets (or "pap-secrets" those files are usually identical)
[03:11] <JJones0207> Yeah but it doesnt have enough ram to run also it freezes when I try to start ubuntu ( run from cd )
[03:12] <knoppix> ok i will try thanks mate!
[03:12] <soundray> JJones0207: can you borrow some RAM somewhere just for the installation?
[03:12] <knoppix> logging off and rebooting
[03:12] <JJones0207> I could try but it would take a little while since its a old computer
[03:12] <JJones0207> Pentium 3
[03:12] <JJones0207> 128 ram
[03:12] <phlasphy_> hey all
[03:12] <JJones0207> 30gb hdd
[03:13] <ollum> hi... i got a problem. i'm in the livecd mode now and i want to mount my ubuntu partitions cuz my xserver is fucked up. i dont manage to get them mounted properly.
[03:13] <soundray> JJones0207: you might fare better with a xubuntu installation on that machine.
[03:13] <zainka> Is it possible to use, say ghost, to create a image of my Linux ubuntu partition to port it to another running bigger hdd? offcourse with some system repair after oprting to make installation match with hardware...
[03:13] <m15k> any one who sucessfully installed an Fujitsu-Siemens Wireless Adabter... : )
[03:13] <soundray> !language | ollum
[03:13] <ubotu> ollum: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:13] <JJones0207> whats xubuntu
[03:13] <ollum> sry
[03:13] <soundray> !xubuntu | JJones0207
[03:13] <ubotu> JJones0207: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[03:14] <JJones0207> whats the differance? its not as good is it?
[03:14] <DARKGuy> Mornin' :)
[03:14] <phlasphy_> JJones0207: its better :P
[03:14] <foxxNBonE> can any help installing dans guardian
[03:14] <soundray> JJones0207: it depends on what you mean by 'good'
[03:15] <JJones0207> Well nvm but Im looking at the system requirements
[03:15] <phlasphy_> ok
[03:15] <JJones0207> should i still get the alternate
[03:15] <soundray> JJones0207: gnome is very user friendly, but it's also very slow on old systems like yours
[03:15] <Jowi> JJones0207, you can also look here for low mem alternative installations: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems
[03:15] <JJones0207> because that requires 64mb and I wouldnt want to take up the whole 128 ram
[03:15] <soundray> JJones0207: no, I'd try the regular one
[03:15] <JJones0207> ok
[03:16] <zainka> ... Aboute compiling... when running ./configure on package kontrollerlab found on sourceforg, what does this message mean...
[03:16] <zainka> checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X includes.
[03:16] <JJones0207> well im going to download it and I got to go to school right now but thanks you all helped me so I wouldnt be sitting here still trying to find out y
[03:16] <soundray> zainka: yes, that's possible. You have to update your /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst after that operation
[03:16] <zainka> X is ... unknown to me
[03:16] <zainka> thanks for answering my first one, Soundary
[03:16] <timo91> what dose it mean when the power button on the top right wont respond when presed ?
[03:17] <thomas> how do i stop x, so that it won't restart automatically?
[03:17] <stiffme1983> zainka: you maybe need development files for xserver
[03:17] <stiffme1983> thomas: ctrl+atl+F1
[03:17] <soundray> thomas: 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'. I've told you before
[03:17] <soundray> stiffme1983: that's not correct
[03:17] <stiffme1983> thomas: then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[03:17] <SeyToN> can someone help me please with wifi to the ap?
[03:17] <soundray> stiffme1983: okay, I take it back
[03:18] <timo91> it seems the only way i can log out is by pressing the restart button on my pc the ubuntu button dose not respond
[03:18] <thomas> soundray: sry my x died :)
[03:18] <stiffme1983> soundray: hi ,do you familiar with intel C++ compiler?
[03:18] <soundray> stiffme1983: no
[03:19] <SeyToN> anyone?
[03:19] <timo91> how do i turn the computer off from the tuminal
[03:19] <voraistos> sudo halt
[03:19] <timo91> thank you
[03:19] <glaz> halt wont shut it down tho
[03:19] <timo91> log off ?
[03:20] <glaz> it will just bring the computer to be halted
[03:20] <timo91> i want to restart
[03:20] <glaz> you want to power it off ?
[03:20] <voraistos> sudo reboot
[03:20] <timo91> yes
[03:20] <voraistos> or ctrl alt del
[03:20] <timo91> thank you
[03:20] <glaz> man halt
[03:20] <Eclypse> hah, that's quite funny. on the automatix wiki it says don't listen to anyone in the ubuntu channel if they say that automatix caused the problem, they are misinformed, lmao
[03:20] <Eclypse> after what you guys told me yesterday, I believe it.
[03:20] <voraistos> halt -R reboots as well i think
[03:21] <timo91> i hate it when this thing crashs
[03:21] <timo91> now the terminal wont load :-/
[03:21] <SniZ> what i must do for increase system perfomance? i`ve get this: 3.7 16.6 169:22.03 Xorg  , i have gnome and i think my old video card cant do hardware acceleration
[03:21] <ollum> i cannot boot into gnome becauze my xserver broke. i tried to reconfigure it but it doesnt work. it says: no screens found ; xf86CloseConsole:KDSETMODE failed bad file descriptor; xf86CloseConsole: VT_GETMODE failed bad file descriptor.
[03:22] <voraistos> OK i have some problem installing ubuntu on a quite old machine (10 years old ). I dont want X, i just want  a 3com etherlink III ISA to be detected... can anybody help ?
[03:22] <Eclypse> timo91 what happened?
[03:22] <timo91> thats the thing no error masege nothing
[03:22] <Eclypse> timo91 persistent?
[03:23] <timo91> it just stops working slow thou untill i cant even do any thing
[03:23] <Tazmon> wow...
[03:23] <timo91> Eclypse:im getting sick of this
[03:23] <humbolt> I would like the latest beagle from feisty to be backported to dapper. There were significant bug-fixes!
[03:23] <stiffme1983> ollum: you need correct graphic drivers?
[03:23] <humbolt> How to make that happen?
[03:23] <timo91> the opend applications work great but wont let me open any more
[03:23] <SniZ> if i change viedo card riva tnt 2 to more powerfull, and get hardware acceleration, XORG gnome can be faster?
[03:23] <timo91> or even restart it
[03:24] <sod75> voraistos: not sure, but might look into recompiling your kernel and enabling isa stuff , it may no longer be in there by default on ubuntu...
[03:24] <Eclypse> timo91 have you posted on the ubuntuforums?
[03:24] <glaz> SniZ, get AIGLX
[03:24] <glaz> + gnome
[03:24] <SniZ> glaz, what?
[03:24] <Eclypse> timo91, they are often much more helpful then the IRC
[03:24] <Eclypse> timo91 unless you're setting up something like compiz.
[03:24] <Tazmon> I'm new to this and very impressed with all that's in ubuntu.. was wondering if I could get some help with a wireless issue though :P It's the only thing I haven't been about to get working yet
[03:24] <ollum> before it worked normally.. but i changed smth in the xorg.conf file ( me - dumb ) and it wont start... if i try to copy another backup file it doesnt work either
[03:24] <Tomcat_> Tazmon: Just state your question.
[03:25] <voraistos> sod75: is the kernel source present on the CD ? How do i compile with the ubuntu package if there is one ?
[03:25] <ollum> i tried reconfiguring but i cant choose vesa. there is only neomagic, silicon... and voodoo
[03:25] <timo91> Eclypse:im just a nomal user all i want to do is log on use the work processor and a bit of internet the log off
[03:25] <Eclypse> timo91, we're all normal.  we all have basic needs that we need fofilled. and sometimes those needs are ridiculously hard to satisfy in linux.
[03:26] <Eclypse> timo91, in your case, hardware incapatability, your best bet is posting on the forum, trust me.
[03:26] <Tazmon> well, I've followed all I can from the forums and other places with getting the wireless setup and when I type "iwlist eth1 scan" I get a list of all the networks near my house and mine.  And useing the Network manager I see all the networks, but I can't connect to any of them.  I try, it hangs for about two mins, and then connects to the eth0 wired connection again
[03:26] <sod75> voraistos: don't know if it's on the cd, but you need "sudo apt-get build-essential" and then do a "make menuconfig" which should get you the menu for selecting the option/modules
[03:26] <Eclypse> timo91, its the most active form I've ever been to in my life, lol, 2000 people active half the time.

[03:28] <Eclypse> timo91, ubuntu is your main computer?
[03:28] <timo91> yhe
[03:28] <Eclypse> ok
[03:28] <voraistos> sod75: You mean if i install the ubuntu kernel-source package it will put the sources in /src and ill just have to configure, compile, install and reboot just like a vanilla one ?
[03:28] <Eclypse> umm
[03:28] <Eclypse> I could post for you if you want?
[03:28] <timo91> bit of a shame like
[03:28] <Eclypse> you may have to format, though
[03:28] <Eclypse> I can't think of any reason why nothing would start.
[03:29] <Tazmon> ne1?
[03:29] <sod75> voraistos: yup build-essential is a metapackege with dev stuff like make, etc
[03:29] <timo91> :(all the power is taken away from me
[03:29] <Eclypse> what?

[03:37] <Tazmon> yup
[03:37] <rausb0> Tazmon: is it open (unencrypted) wlan?
[03:37] <Tazmon> I'm still digging, but haven't seen anyone get to where I'm at
[03:37] <Tazmon> and not connect
[03:37] <Tazmon> yes wide open
[03:38] <Tazmon> I'll lock it down after I connect

[03:39] <rausb0> Tazmon: and you use bcm43xx for that?
[03:39] <Tazmon> I've tried using both the kernel method and the ndiswrapper method
[03:39] <Tazmon> yes
[03:40] <rausb0> Tazmon: for bcm43xx you need firmware files in /lib/firmware/<your_kernel_version>
[03:40] <Tazmon> that would be the 2.6.17-10-generic folder right?
[03:40] <derFlo> Suspend to RAM does not work

[03:49] <Tazmon> and I just did a ifconfig eth1 and it all looks good
[03:49] <rausb0> Tazmon: so can you ping the AP's ip address now?
[03:49] <brett> Avi container?
[03:49] <Tazmon> yup
[03:49] <voraistos> manc: i am sure its due to the width of the icons, which are different. if you setup properly nautilus it should do the job.
[03:49] <Tazmon> but... it's on the wire...
[03:50] <brett> how/where do i get avi container?
[03:50] <keeganX> brett: what video player are you using?
[03:50] <brett> i was trying to use totem
[03:50] <brett> or vlc
[03:50] <voraistos> brett: it is supported by mplayer, totem, etc out of the box
[03:50] <manc> voraistos, it aligns horizontally but not vertically like windows
[03:51] <voraistos> manc well you can use explorer.exe under wine if you want it like windows :P

[03:51] <brett> where do i get avi container?
[03:51] <callas> dunno

[03:51] <voraistos> you might have security issues though. just to align godam icons on a desktop
[03:52] <keeganX> Whats the channel for the new ubuntu release?
[03:52] <voraistos> brett: it is not something to download. i think your problem i related to codecs, not to the container.

[03:52] <brett> well, i dont know
[03:52] <keeganX> alright thanks

[03:54] <rausb0> Tazmon: yes
[03:54] <Tazmon> whoa...
[03:54] <voraistos> brett: when you have a .avi file, it certainly uses the avi container. The container says how to sync audio, video and others. If you want a good container, you can use ogm instead. However to play your avi files properly, you will need the codecs the video track and audio track use. It can be Xvid and mp3. If you want to install those, go to RestrictedFormats on the wiki

[04:02] <Karhuton> I have a laptop with 3 usb ports, all of them should be 2.0/1.0. After reboot Gnome's HAL device manager shows two 1.0 and one 2.0 USB controllers. If I plug an usb (2.0) cd drive into any of the ports, the usb 1.0 controllers take over it. I rmmod ohci_hcd and modprobed ehci_hcd, which then took over all the ports (I can plug in the drive to any port and the 2.0 controller handles it). But now my usb mouse or keyboard (1.0) won't work 
[04:02] <David777> You didn't use the "<" character to give it some input.
[04:03] <David777> Gah, I'm helping more people than I'm getting help
[04:03] <dredhammer> patch -p ../tsocks-1.8b5-tordns1.diff
[04:04] <jrib> dredhammer: you need an argument to -p and you need the "<".  Patch reads from standard input
[04:04] <voraistos> David777: its always like that with me, thats why its rare when i come around here ...
[04:04] <David777> dredhammer: You shoul've typed "patch -p0 < ../tsocks-1.8b-tordns1.diff"
[04:04] <Karhuton> I modprobed ohci after ehci, but when I stuck the cd drive in the port the 2.0 controller took over and then the kernel driver spit an error to console I had open and now the drive doesn't work anymore.. How can I get both 2.0 and 1.0 working? Can I dedicate certain ports to ohci and others to ehci, if it can't automatically chooset he correct controller?
[04:04] <dredhammer> ok thanks
[04:04] <David777> dredhammer: If -p0 does not work, try -p1

[04:24] <Carooo> fuck you !
[04:24] <Diiba> Does anyone of you know the command for bittornado?

[04:25] <voraistos> yeah but we usually get something for saying "damn"
[04:25] <DARKGuy> Yay
[04:25] <Diiba> No darkguy
[04:25] <jrib> crimsun: thank you
[04:25] <Diiba> IT doesnt.
[04:25] <DARKGuy> Diiba: oO I think I have bittornado here... lemme check
[04:25] <David777> Just to verify: No kernel or console experts in here right now at all?
[04:25] <voraistos> ops rule
[04:25] <DARKGuy> they do
[04:25] <Diiba> The bittornado launches nicely from xfce menu.
[04:25] <jrib> DARKGuy: ask your real question please
[04:25] <Polysics> David777, what is a "console expert"? a bash programmer?
[04:25] <x-r00t-x> !find
[04:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about find - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:26] <jrib> David777: ask your real question please
[04:26] <Diiba> But when I use fluxbox, I'm not able to find it from the menus
[04:26] <Polysics> one quick thing: anyone using good old dialup on ubuntu?
[04:26] <DARKGuy> Diiba: hey, you're right oO
[04:26] <David777> Polysics: A console expert would be someone who knows how to run linux without a window manager.
[04:26] <Diiba> Kinda wierd isn't it?
[04:26] <jessid> Carooo I think you are in the wrong place,
[04:26] <jrib> David777: the answer to your question is "yes" or "no", do either of those help you in any way?
[04:26] <Polysics> i think anyone can do that David .-)
[04:26] <thevenin> David777: there are people in here that can answer whatever you question is
[04:26] <DARKGuy> Diiba: I got it
[04:27] <Diiba> Darkguy, tellmetellmetellme :D
[04:27] <Polysics> just go ahead and tell us what the problem is, i'm usually useless but not always .-)
[04:27] <DARKGuy> Diiba: In a terminal, type: "cd /usr/bin && ls -a | grep 'bit'" and you'll get the command names
[04:27] <voraistos> David777 i thought you needed a kernel expert ?
[04:27] <Polysics> anyway, anyone knows where "Modem Lights" applet has gone?
[04:27] <David777> lol, once again for the record "How do I prevent this from happening: "Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30"?
[04:27] <Diiba> Ty Darkguy
[04:27] <DARKGuy> Diiba: welcome :)
[04:28] <Polysics> i only have the crappy Modem Monitor one which does not use pon/poff, and i'm not a fan of other methods
[04:28] <David777> Does anyone know how to disable "Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30"?
[04:28] <lenista> sry no i'm a bloody newbie
[04:28] <Polysics> i'm running 6.10 stock if it's useful
[04:28] <Journeyman> no need to repeat David777
[04:28] <voraistos> David777: i dont even know which console is ubuntu using, but there must be a man page giving info about that
[04:29] <David777> That would be both a console and a kernel expert question because some forum posts recommend rebuilding the kernel and others recommend passing arguments to grub.
[04:29] <Valmarko> I already downloaded unrar, non free. What do I do now. Just unpack the file?
[04:30] <jrib> Valmarko: downloaded?  Did you install it with the package manager?
[04:30] <David777> Now, my Ubuntu system is a crappy little embedded board with a nerfed AMD Geode processor running at @400 MHz so rebuilding the kernel will take about a day.
[04:30] <Valmarko> the packed file?
[04:30] <Polysics> David777, this will be something you already know, but arguments to grub is better and safer if everything else works
[04:30] <Valmarko> yes. synaptic...
[04:30] <Polysics> David777, totally offtopic, could i use one of those to power a RAID disk cabinet?
[04:30] <David777> Unfortunately, none of the arguments to grub that have been suggested work, Polysics?
[04:30] <jrib> Valmarko: you can just double click on your file now, or use the command line 'unrar x file.rar' if you prefer
[04:30] <Valmarko> tanks
[04:30] <Valmarko> :)
[04:31] <David777> Polysics: This board is so woefully underpowered, I wouldn't use it to control a toilet flusher.
[04:31] <crimsun> David777: which vga= parameter did you pass?
[04:31] <David777> I used "vga=normal", "video=vga16:off"
[04:31] <Polysics> where is my Modem Lights applet? lol
[04:31] <David777> Neither worked
[04:31] <Polysics> all the docs mention that, and i don't have it :-)
[04:31] <voraistos> Polysics: i think u can, as some products already do it
[04:32] <David777> Polysics: I am googling "Modem Lights"...
[04:32] <Polysics> i have a couple spare 250gb hds, sata
[04:32] <Polysics> David777, seems like it's not included in the 6.10 stock
[04:32] <voraistos> gimme one i just lost 500 gigs
[04:32] <Polysics> Modem Lights is the recommended applet for pon/poff
[04:33] <Placid> can anyone tell me which package stddef.h would be in? i can't find it via apt-cache and i've installed build-essential, and anything libstdc++ related.
[04:34] <jrib> Polysics: is it the same as "modem monitor" applet that you can add to gnome-panel?
[04:35] <Joe1> hello
[04:35] <Polysics> jrib, no, that's another that works with the built in dialup, which doesn't work for me
[04:35] <David777> Isn't "Modem Lights" a Gnome application?
[04:35] <Joe1> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[04:35] <Polysics> David777, it is, but it's not installed nor i can find one anywhere
[04:36] <jrib> Polysics: the description for gnome-applets seems to indicate it comes with modemlights, it seems to be the same
[04:36] <Polysics> or rather, i'm starting to suppose it's actually that app
[04:36] <Polysics> yes, but the configuration dialog is totally different, i think something's wrong somewhere
[04:36] <bradbury9> anyone here with a 5G ipod? got a little problem
[04:36] <Polysics> not that i really care, i can dial just fine, it's just to have a normal button to do it
[04:36] <bradbury9> need the firmware
[04:36] <Polysics> a two-state button would do too

[04:38] <Journeyman> why does ubuntu discourage compiling from source
[04:39] <unimatrix9> hello there, how can i turn off update message?
[04:39] <Polysics> Journeyman, because it is normally overkill
[04:39] <Guardian> hi i need help please, i'm following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ActiveDirectoryWinbindHowto ; however, when i type "net ads join" it just waits forever :(
[04:39] <Guardian> i'm using edgy
[04:39] <Polysics> software works just fine and you can tap the large knowledge base
[04:39] <Guardian> it used to work with dapper
[04:40] <Journeyman> Polysics, overkill how? I find programs function better when I compile them
[04:40] <Polysics> do you? i can't tell the difference :-)
[04:40] <David777> Polysics: It looks like it either comes with Gnome or it doesn't
[04:40] <Polysics> David777, then it's the second :-) oh well, i'll just make a couple of desktop icons
[04:40] <Journeyman> I also like to modify it to store the files where I tell it to
[04:41] <David777> Polysics: If you have access to a version of Gnome with it installed, you might be able to copy the files over and modify some configuration but it'll probably be a major PITA.
[04:41] <cyber> yea editing where it installs to etc
[04:41] <Polysics> David777, totally not worth it, i was misled by the fact that the docs reference one app but there is actually another
[04:41] <cyber> u can change things in the build so yea

[04:43] <sysrage> not use ntfs
[04:43] <cyber> Valmarko, take the long route, set up an ftp server and connect to it using ure  M$ machine :P
[04:43] <compengi> valarians, are you on windows while you want to access linux directory?
[04:43] <stoorty> use a pen drive
[04:43] <cyber> then u can share files simply
[04:44] <Valmarko> thanks
[04:44] <sysrage> ya, go the direction compengi said. going from linux to windows isn't going to work
[04:44] <SidSilver4> if it's the other way around, need to set permission properly perhaps?
[04:44] <sysrage> not safely anyway

[04:45] <Valmarko> sda1 is a ntfs file system
[04:45] <Tazmon> I've been doing some searching about the problem you were helping me with David777 and it seems that a lot of people lost their wireless connection with the upgrade to a newer kernel, Is there a way for me to install an older kernel?
[04:45] <mypapit> Luke: http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/IRC_Communication
[04:45] <Vorbote> SidSilver4: The user in question should add an "export LANG=blah" to his/her .bashrc
[04:45] <mypapit> Luke: lot of openoffice.org hotshot are there
[04:45] <David777> Valmarko: Can you run "mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows"?
[04:45] <Journeyman> Raven, a gui to configure apache?
[04:45] <David777> Valmarko: You have to create "/mnt/windows" first though...
[04:45] <mypapit> Luke: you prolly need #users.openoffice.org
[04:45] <Luke> mypapit: thanks! i
[04:45] <Vorbote> Raven: no such thing.
[04:45] <Journeyman> why not just configure the httpd.conf file what do you need a gui for?
[04:46] <Raven> yes m , I used to use comanche in windows of I have heard of webmin
[04:46] <David777> Tazmon: Yes, you can install an older kernel, but it might be difficult.
[04:46] <Tazmon> that's not just for apache though raven
[04:46] <Vorbote> Raven: webmin is an option but is it a can of worms, and as far as I know RedHat tools have not been ported.
[04:46] <pakix> where can i change the Splash Screen which is downloaded from art.gnome.org
[04:46] <cyber> lol umm raven do it the normal way
[04:46] <pakix> thx

[04:46] <Tazmon> I'm using ISPConfig now... but that's a pretty hard install
[04:47] <Journeyman> Raven,  the apache config is super easy, why would you need a gui to edit it?
[04:47] <Valmarko> I dont understand linux at all because I just started using ubuntu yesterday. Waht I can say is that the tow SO are already isntalled. Grub does the selection :)
[04:47] <Raven> ok how do i install apche with all the php mysql etc
[04:47] <David777> Valmarko: You need to open an xterm window.
[04:47] <Journeyman> install php
[04:47] <Journeyman> and install mysql
[04:47] <Valmarko> The problem is: I want to transfer one file from ubuntu to sda1, where windows is installed
[04:47] <David777> Valmarko: Then I can walk you through the steps of mounting sda1 and copying your file there.
[04:48] <Tazmon> Raven, here's my favorite place for server setup help http://www.howtoforge.com/

[04:50] <Journeyman> airsnort
[04:50] <cyber> valarians,  set up an ftp server :P
[04:50] <David777> compengi: Newer kernels support writing to NTFS
[04:50] <Journeyman> but I guess you want more of a meter
[04:51] <Valmarko> tank you
[04:51] <compengi> David777, i couldn't right ;)
[04:51] <cyber> lol seriously Valmarko i think it might be easyer :P
[04:51] <David777> compengi: I use SystemRescueCD to write to NTFS partitions all the time.
[04:51] <stoorty> use ntfs-3g
[04:51] <David777> I think that uses a 2.6.15 kernel
[04:52] <stoorty> or just create a fat partition

[04:53] <compengi> David777, i had removed windows and nfts partions as well :D
[04:53] <Journeyman> AcidBurn, airsnort isn't a cracker

[04:53] <gpd> i am trying to help someone install ubuntu dapper via telephone - are there screen shots of the manual partition somewhere?
[04:53] <Journeyman> it can be used to crack WEP keys but that is not it's primary purpose
[04:53] <Raven> cheers david777
[04:53] <David777> Raven: aptitude is a character mode interface to apt.
[04:54] <AcidBurn> thanks......
[04:54] <Obstfliege> nabend
[04:54] <Tazmon> Raven:  Check out http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10
[04:54] <Tazmon> Raven: that worked great for me
[04:55] <David777> Can anyone tell me what channels would know how to prevent this: "Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30"
[04:55] <Tazmon> Acid, kismet is a big one
[04:55] <Journeyman> gpd, yes but they are hard to find
[04:55] <Tazmon> and I've heard of airfart... but never used it
[04:55] <gpd> Journeyman: i can find screens for server - but not desktop. - any ideas/?
[04:56] <David777> gpd: Just get them to open an xterm
[04:56] <David777> gpd: Is this during install?
[04:56] <gpd> yes in stall
[04:56] <Journeyman> *shurg* is the server a cli install?
[04:56] <David777> Augh
[04:56] <gpd> they are stuck on the screen where the partitioner asks for the mount points
[04:56] <Journeyman> i hate how linux does paritions :)
[04:56] <gpd> says that the windows partition has errors
[04:56] <David777> gpd: There are virtual terminals available during the install
[04:56] <Tazmon> AcidBurn: check out http://wifi-radar.systemimager.org/
[04:57] <David777> gpd: They could switch to a virtual terminal and run the character mode partitioner of choice
[04:57] <gpd> David777: ok - what is the character mode installer agina?
[04:57] <David777> Well, there's always fdisk...but I don't know what the installer uses.
[04:58] <David777> Lemme check what's on the CD-ROM
[04:58] <gpd> David777: the partitions are fine
[04:58] <AcidBurn> tarzmon: tks, but it does not work broadcom 4318
[04:58] <gpd> David777: he can't seem to get past the mount point setup
[04:58] <cyber> hmm
[04:58] <Journeyman> how hard is it to make 2 paritions
[04:58] <Journeyman> / and swap
[04:59] <cyber> i have a file, it looks like an exacutable file, pure-ftpd
[04:59] <cyber> how do i run it?
[04:59] <Journeyman> cyber, ./pure-ftpd
[04:59] <gpd> Journeyman: the partitions are there - but when he goes past it says 'fat 32 disk has uncorrected errors-'
[04:59] <Journeyman> o.O
[04:59] <Journeyman> weird
[04:59] <leafw> any clue on how to launch emacs without X, so that it remains inside an xterm?
[04:59] <jrib> !info pure-ftpd | cyber
[04:59] <ubotu> pure-ftpd: Pure-FTPd FTP server. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.21-5ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 150 kB, installed size 460 kB
[05:00] <jrib> cyber: pure-ftpd is in the repositories, no need to run an executable you download.  Just install using synaptic or apt-get
[05:00] <SidSilver4> i don't know how many times Ubuntu asks me for my password again when I am sure I tied it correctly the first time
[05:00] <SidSilver4> anyone else experience this?
[05:00] <David777> leafw: run emacs instead of xemacs
[05:00] <SidSilver4> typed it correctly
[05:00] <Journeyman> leafw, man emacs
[05:00] <David777> leafw: emacs may be sym-linked to xemacs.
[05:01] <gpd> If i can ssh into this jmachine can i install from there?
[05:01] <cyber> jrib, i compiled frmo source
[05:01] <Journeyman> or use vi *GRIN*
[05:01] <cyber> even tho i had no idea what was going on :P
[05:01] <jrib> cyber: right, no need to do that
[05:01] <cyber> i just did ./configure then make & then make install
[05:01] <cyber> but yea its running now, well seems to be
[05:01] <gpd> ie. is there a curses install on the live disk?
[05:01] <David777> leafw: Type "ls -l `which emacs`" and tell us what you see
[05:02] <David777> gpd: I think you either have to be at the console or use a serial line.
[05:02] <rausb0> jrib: i think this is the most common mistake of linux newbies now. they try to install software downloadeded from anywhere instead of taking it from the repos.
[05:02] <leafw> David777 : -nw does it. Apparently emacs launches the GUI whenever there is #DISPLAY defined
[05:02] <cyber> hmm jrib telnet from my M$ to the ftpd
[05:02] <cyber> i log in fine but when i try ls or dir
[05:02] <David777> leafw: Good to know
[05:02] <cyber> i get " non data connection"
[05:02] <cyber> "no data connection"
[05:03] <cyber> any ideas?
[05:03] <cyber> altho i think its ftp client related
[05:03] <David777> Well thanks for all the help folks, lol
[05:03] <asdf__> why does flash crash on the thin client
[05:03] <gpd> ok --  i have screenshots of his machines -- he has 'no mount point selected for sdb1 -- but we wnt to install on sda!?
[05:03] <leafw> David777 : ls -l `which emacs` prints  /usr/bin/emacs -> /etc/alternatives/emacs
[05:03] <jrib> cyber: idk, I've never used telnet to ftp
[05:03] <leafw> David777 : ubuntu has its weirdos ...
[05:03] <gpd> sdb1 refuses to have no mount point?
[05:03] <cyber> i im not telnetin lol
[05:04] <cyber> i meant ot say ftp =D
[05:04] <cyber> there we go
[05:04] <cyber> i now have access  to my whole file system
[05:04] <cyber> through pure-ftpd
[05:04] <cyber> instant shareing ftw
[05:04] <cyber> much easyer then setting up samba or sumthing like that
[05:05] <jrib> !enter
[05:05] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[05:05] <cyber> thanks for the help guys
[05:05] <asdf__> why does flash crash on the thin client
[05:05] <jrib> cyber: np, glad it works, but in the future I would recommend installing packages fromt he repositories instead of compiling
[05:05] <Journeyman> cyber, ftp is differenet than samba
[05:05] <Journeyman> samba allows for real time running of files
[05:06] <Journeyman> it is more of a remote drive, or network file system if you will
[05:06] <Journeyman> but fur coping files, yes it is a much better protocol to use
[05:06] <Journeyman> or
[05:06] <Journeyman> erm for8
[05:06] <Journeyman> dang, I give up
[05:06] <Randakar> bah, update-grub bails out when it generates menu.list
[05:06] <DARKGuy> lol
[05:07] <Journeyman> cyber, keep in mind that ftp is a plain-text protocol, so don't use it on a network you don't trust, for that there is sftp
[05:07] <asdf__> so any help
[05:08] <jrib> asdf__: what does this command return:    xdpyinfo | grep 'depth of root'
[05:08] <cyber> yea Journeyman i just needed a simple way of shareing files on my home network
[05:08] <Randakar> of course nobody seems interested in debugging the update-grub shell script ;-)
[05:08] <constrictor> how do i see a server's ssh configuration
[05:09] <kynes> I installed edgy eft 1 hour ago
[05:09] <kynes> everything is good but...
[05:09] <asdf__> jrib,   depth of root window:    16 planes
[05:09] <kynes> when I modify menu.lst
[05:09] <cyber> no malicous users, yes i know it is diffrent to samba, diffrence that i like the most is pure-ftpd works & is set up easily, samba is a mission. yes jrib i know i should use the repositry's but u have to compile stuff some times, i mean other wise u never learn
[05:09] <rausb0> cyber: you could also have installed openssh-server on the ubuntu box and winscp on the windows box
[05:09] <kynes> it is written correctly, but there is no change
[05:09] <voraistos> cyber you can use nfs, its fast and very reliable, and you can share with windows as well if you install windows services for unix from the microsoft website
[05:09] <kynes> I make default 5 (windows) and ubuntu comes up selected..
[05:09] <kynes> everytime
[05:10] <jrib> cyber: you could learn to recompile the ubuntu source package too (giving ideas)
[05:10] <kynes> and another issue (bug)
[05:10] <jrib> asdf__: you may be bitten by this bug, please try one of the workarounds listed in the comments:  https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911
[05:10] <kynes> livecd is working strangely and doesn't install in my HP nx5000 laptop
[05:10] <cyber> ok 1 last question. if i cd to the dir of pure-ftpd. i use ./pure-ftpd to exacute it, but this is in a terminal and the terminal stays open. how do i make it so it runs in the back ground?
[05:11] <constrictor> is there a way of looking a a server's SSH configuration from the command line?
[05:11] <cyber> & how would i shut it down in the correct fassion
[05:11] <asdf__> jrib, i'll take a look
[05:11] <jrib> constrictor: take a look at /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[05:11] <voraistos> cyber add && at the end
[05:11] <rausb0> constrictor: less /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[05:11] <constrictor> thanks
[05:11] <cyber> thanks voraistos, any ideas on stopping it :P
[05:12] <voraistos> i usually press the power button but shutdown command exists i think :)

[05:13] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:13] <kynes> I already asked my question..
[05:13] <kynes> and I think these are bugs in edgy eft
[05:13] <voraistos> ubotu is a stupid bot. dont mind :P

[05:14] <asdf__> jrib, no what happens is that when ever i try to go to a site on the thin client eg. candyland.com the browser closes but when i view on the server it works fine
[05:14] <Randakar> kynes: OS selection is a bit odd in menu.list. I use 'savedefault' myself, that way it boots the last menu entry you chose
[05:14] <kynes> I also did "default saved" and sudo grub-reboot 5
[05:15] <kynes> Randakar: could you show me your menu.list file?
[05:15] <h0ax> hello anyone hree ?
[05:15] <lumpki> kynes, menu.lst is probably doing exactly what you told it to
[05:15] <kynes> I tried savedefault stuff.. it didn't work either
[05:15] <Rocito> how do i limit up/download rates on single programs or ports ?
[05:15] <kynes> lumpki: I have 5 items in the list
[05:15] <Randakar> kynes: Doubt my menu.list would help you, I've never tried doing what you're describing there.
[05:15] <jrib> asdf__: hmm mayb be different then, but try closing all firefox and starting it as:  XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 firefox
[05:15] <kynes> lumpki: and the last one is Windows..
[05:15] <kynes> lumpki: it boots correctly by manual selection..
[05:16] <h0ax> can i run ubuntu on a 166mhz pc ?
[05:16] <jbroome> probably not with a GUI
[05:16] <miles_> h0ax, try Xubuntu
[05:16] <asdf__> jrib, how do i make it run like that
[05:16] <David777> Haha!! I'm a wily hacker and you folks aren't!
[05:16] <Randakar> h0ax: Don't expect that to run with anything near decent speed at any rate ;-)
[05:16] <h0ax> wats Xubuntu
[05:16] <Aversin> anyone got a sec? I have a newbie problem
[05:17] <constrictor> can someone tell me why there could be a cron job running each hour although i have not set one up?
[05:17] <Randakar> k0ax: I'm running the server edition on a 200Mhz one though. No desktop however.
[05:17] <Randakar> h0ax: xubuntu
[05:17] <cyber> ok, i would like to create 2 launchers, 1 to shut down pureftpd and one to start it again
[05:17] <cyber> could some one please pvt me
[05:17] <lumpki> kynes, put 'default 4' in the file to boot the fifth OS
[05:17] <cyber> i would appreciate pvt help
[05:17] <jbroome> constrictor: look in /etc/cron.hourly/
[05:17] <h0ax> wats xubuntu
[05:17] <jrib> asdf__: you would enter that in a terminal
[05:17] <constrictor> thanks
[05:17] <Randakar> !xubuntu
[05:17] <kynes> lumpki: man... I'm sorry
[05:17] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[05:17] <lumpki> kynes, look in the comments of menu.lst to see how it works
[05:17] <kynes> lumpki: I should have seen..
[05:18] <David777> lol, For anyone who is interested, the brute force approach to preventing the "Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30" is to blacklist your frame buffer driver in /etc/modeprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer.
[05:18] <asdf__> jrib, i tryed alt f2 one sec
[05:18] <jrib> asdf__: I'm not too familiar with thin clients, so if I say doesn't make sense, let me know

[05:19] <CREWMAN_peppe> hi guys i have a problem: my notebook has an ati radeon 9600 i run ubuntu edgy with proprietary driver. Notwithstanding i have installed correctly the driver (and both games or xgl runs smoothly) i have slow screensavers
[05:19] <voraistos> David777: Well Hitler was doing the same kind of stuff, but his life ended up early.
[05:19] <CREWMAN_peppe> only screensavers run slowly
[05:19] <David777> Funny think is that the blacklist-framebuffer driver says this at the top: "# Framebuffer drivers are generally buggy and poorly-supported, and cause
[05:19] <David777> # suspend failures, kernel panics and general mayhem.  For this reason we
[05:19] <David777> # never load them automatically.
[05:19] <h0ax> i dont have 128mb ram for xubuntu do i need 128 ?
[05:19] <Aversin> I can get windows to see the shared file on the samba server, but I cant write to it. I also cant get the ubuntu box to see the windows box. Any ideas?
[05:19] <jrib> asdf__: what about:  FIREFOX_DSP=none firefox
[05:19] <apixelatedoffice> could someone tell me the EASIEST way to view nfo files on Linux (Ubuntu)?
[05:20] <jbroome> apixelatedoffice: less *.nfo
[05:20] <voraistos> gedit ?
[05:20] <h0ax> i dont have 128mb ram for xubuntu do i need 128 ?
[05:20] <Randakar> h0ax: To run the Desktop CD (LiveCD + Install CD), you need 128 MB RAM, when using the Alternate Install CD you can do with 64 MB.
[05:20] <jbroome> they're just text files
[05:20] <Rocito> how do i throttle up/download rates to programs or ports in ubuntu?
[05:20] <Randakar> h0ax: that's from http://xubuntu.org/get
[05:21] <apixelatedoffice> well if I change the extension to .txt, it's still garbled.
[05:21] <cyber> h0ax, get ureself a new machine =D
[05:21] <Randakar> Rocito: that's traffic shaping
[05:21] <h0ax> its an old one i had in the cubbaord lol
[05:21] <asdf__> jrib, The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
[05:21] <asdf__> This probably reflects a bug in the program.
[05:21] <asdf__> The error was 'BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)'.

[05:27] <deusjevoo> maybe someone can translate ?
[05:27] <timo90> when adding public keys do you type them in the terminal or do you paste them on the souces.list

[05:27] <cyber> jrib, you cant use sudo when ure using the GUI file browser :/
[05:27] <jrib> cyber: gksudo nautilus  , but I'd recommend not using it often.  Maybe you should setup a group with /var/www
[05:28] <cyber> a group?
[05:29] <jrib> cyber: yeah, 'www-data' is the usual one I think.  Just change group ownership to www-data and allow the group to read write and execute

[05:34] <lumpki> no dice?, what exactly happend
[05:34] <Randakar> apixelatedoffice: can you run 'file filename.nfo' and tell us what it says?

[05:39] <Randakar> bthornton: there are several ways ;-)
[05:40] <apixelatedoffice> Randakar, sorry for my ignorance but what is an sfv file?
[05:40] <bthornton> Randakar: I thought so.  Well, as long as php4 and php5 play nicely together, I'll go ahead and install.  Thanks!
[05:40] <Randakar> bthornton: usually it's a matter of having a #!/usr/bin/php4 link at the top, or having a .php4 filename extension
[05:40] <datil> any rythmbox users? i was wondering if it supprots reading cover art tags into the mp3 files
[05:40] <Randakar> apixelatedoffice: sfv? No idea ;-)

[05:43] <asdf__> jrib, cant ltsp dont like flash9 beta
[05:43] <Randakar> lumpki: :-)
[05:43] <Randakar> !webmin
[05:43] <ubotu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[05:43] <patrixx> ok
[05:43] <patrixx> is there a equivalent
[05:43] <patrixx> ?
[05:43] <patrixx> Plesk ?
[05:43] <Randakar> patrixx: that's about as much as I know about it too :-)
[05:44] <apixelatedoffice> Randakar yeah I guess... people don't want you to "compile" their movie rips unless they know their way around a computer.
[05:44] <patrixx> nothjing else
[05:44] <patrixx> :(
[05:44] <jrib> asdf__: I see, I'm out of ideas then.  Concerning the link you gave me:  isn't that how you installed flash already?
[05:44] <patrixx> ?
[05:44] <patrixx> nothing new ?
[05:44] <lumpki> patrixx, what are you needing to comfigure?
[05:44] <asdf__> no
[05:44] <Randakar> apixelatedoffice: heh, I'd have given up on such obnoxious file formats already too :-)
[05:44] <asdf__> jrib no
[05:44] <kudzubane> anyone installed python 2.5 under edgy?
[05:44] <jrib> asdf__: how did you install it?

[05:44] <jrib> !anyone | kudzubane
[05:44] <ubotu> kudzubane: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[05:44] <patrixx> with an interface
[05:44] <patrixx> some thing like plesk
[05:45] <apixelatedoffice> Randakar, Stranger than fiction is awesome, but you gave me an idea... I think I'm just going to use another torrent.  This only took 14 hours.
[05:45] <Rocito> How to set up samba? I did everything but now when i try to open a folder on this box from a windows pc on the network, it prompts me with a login screen that doesn't accept my login/password combination. Any pointers?
[05:45] <asdf__> package manager
[05:45] <Randakar> apixelatedoffice: *lol*
[05:45] <Flankk> Ubuntu is sporadically shutting down on my PC.  What should I do?
[05:45] <Randakar> apixelatedoffice: good luck :-)
[05:45] <lumpki> patrixx, let me check
[05:45] <asdf__> jrib, package manager
[05:45] <apixelatedoffice> Randakar :)
[05:45] <patrixx> cool
[05:45] <kudzubane> got it, every channel seems to have a slightly different question-asking tradition
[05:45] <cmt^^> Randakar - well.. it has the following lines in it:
[05:46] <kudzubane> let me rephrase
[05:46] <Randakar> Rocito: did you add samba users?
[05:46] <cmt^^> drivera90 - "fglrx"
[05:46] <hid3> Evening everyone. Is there any way to send an e-mail message with attached file using `mail` commad?
[05:46] <Randakar> Rocito: if you did - remove them. They get in the way if you have 'real' users for them.
[05:46] <PaSurf> I installed EFT with no problems about two weeks ago.  But when I go to change the time by rightclick - adjust time and date -    I get the bug tracker.  The system at home has no issues with this and we have installed other systems here in the office with no problems.  Aside from reinstalling, is there something I can do to help repair this?
[05:46] <matju> my CPU is stuck at 800 MHz instead of doing 1730 MHz, despite the BIOS settings. This is a Toshiba Satellite. cpufreq-selector has no effect. what should I try?
[05:46] <jrib> asdf__: apt-get is just the command line way of doing the same thing as the package manager
[05:47] <kudzubane> how do i use python 2.5 after install as a user, but keep python 2.4.x as default python for running of essential scripts?
[05:47] <Randakar> PaSurf: sounds like that applet crashes
[05:47] <jrib> kudzubane: you run python2.5 to use python2.5, python should still point to python2.4
[05:47] <DanglyBits> what is the best choice for a mail server for edgy ubuntu?
[05:47] <mormoloc> where can i find a list of all ink-jet printers under linux/ubuntu?
[05:47] <budw> matju: mine stays at 600 MHz until I put a load on it
[05:47] <Rocito> Randakar; how do i remove sambausers?
[05:47] <budw> then it jumps up automaticly
[05:48] <kudzubane> jrib: and, if i want to set python2.5 as default?
[05:48] <Flankk> Ubuntu is sporadically shutting down my PC.  What should I do?
[05:48] <lumpki> patrixx, there's one called ispconfig
[05:48] <Randakar> Rocito: smbpasswd -x user
[05:48] <matju> budw: ah, but here, it stayed at 1730 MHz until very recently
=== SteveC is now known as ssssss
[05:48] <jrib> kudzubane: you would make the /usr/bin/python link point to python2.5 I guess
[05:48] <wavefunction> After installing realplayer, using the .bin available at www.real.com I still cannot watch any .ram within firefox. At /usr/lib/firefox/plugins there are "nphelix.so", "nphelix.xpt". Are the any additional step should I follow to make realplayer plugin available at firefox ?
[05:48] <patrixx> ok
[05:48] <patrixx> ISP config
[05:49] <kudzubane> Flankk: is ubuntu doing a proper shutdown, or does the machine just power off
[05:49] <PaSurf> Randakar:  I think so.  Is there anyway to resolve that without the reinstall?  You know when you get the system setup the way you like then something like this happens.  I just want to have the system sync with an network NTP server
[05:49] <Rocito> Randakar: how do i bring up a list of all sambausers?
[05:49] <lumpki> http://www.ispconfig.org/
[05:49] <patrixx> maybe i look at this
[05:49] <matju> budw: and you're right, it's increasing, which would explain the crazy values I get when trying to profile a program...
[05:49] <patrixx> thanks ispconfig
[05:49] <fwap> how can i get the default ubuntu gui shell/terminal to have a black background? (instead of white)
[05:49] <Randakar> PaSurf: Doesn't it do that by default already?
[05:49] <budw> matju: the bios upgrade probably improved CPU handling
[05:49] <Randakar> Rocito: not sure actually
[05:49] <jbroome> fwap: edit > profiles
[05:49] <kudzubane> jrib: i wonder if python2.5 can be set the same way java is set via an alternatives script
[05:50] <Flankk> kudzubane, it does a proper shutdown.  Something to do with the temperature being too high.. it quotes something like -2453 C.  ACPI is turned off though.
[05:50] <matju> budw: i don't remember upgrading my BIOS. I don't even know how to upgrade the BIOS.
[05:50] <Randakar> Rocito: but I'd first remove just the one you use to connect to that box, to see if it helps
[05:50] <budw> matju: throtling is good - saves power - reduces heat - and doesn't affect performance much
[05:50] <jrib> kudzubane: I wouldn't recommend making python2.5 default.  It doesn't seem to use alternatives, but you can add it if you want
[05:50] <plsDaemon> Again jdk: how to use certain directory as default
[05:50] <budw> matju: I see
[05:50] <PaSurf> Randakar:  nope.  System is showing totally different time than supposed to.  I guess I could change time via command line
[05:50] <kudzubane> Flankk: it might not be ubuntu shutting down your machine, but the machine shutting itself down
[05:50] <matju> budw: my problem isn't so much performance, it's the measurement of performance, and for that i need something that can be stable when i need it to
[05:51] <jrib> plsDaemon: how are you installing java?
[05:51] <plsDaemon> /opt/jdk/bin/java -> straight from here
[05:51] <Flankk> kudzubane, I don't have this problem under Windows.
[05:51] <plsDaemon> i ran the installer
[05:51] <kudzubane> Flankk: b/c you are not using acpi, your cpu fan might be be kicking in (many times acpi controlled)
[05:51] <Randakar> PaSurf: do you have ntp installed? That's the program you need to auto-sync time servers. Also, run 'tzconfig' to see if you have the timezone set up correctly
[05:51] <PaSurf> Randakar:  But wife uses the machine too.  It breaks her heart not to have the correct time or the ability to change it...  :)
[05:51] <jrib> plsDaemon: why not use the ubuntu packages?  Then alternatives will get setup for you
[05:51] <wavefunction> fwap,  go to menu 'Edit' > 'Current profile'. Go to 'colors' tab and choose the colors you want.
[05:51] <cmt^^> Randakar - any ideas on how to solve my fglrx-problem?
[05:51] <Randakar> PaSurf: Yeah, I can imagine.
[05:51] <PaSurf> Randakar:  Ya, did it from aptitude
[05:52] <kudzubane> Flankk: and if the cpu fan isn't on, then the cpu will likely overheat, at which time the hardware detects overheating of cpu and performs a thermal-triggered shutdown
[05:52] <plsDaemon> okay, I'll try
[05:52] <matju> budw: if i run a busy loop with nice -20, my program looks like it's more than twice faster.
[05:52] <jrib> !java > plsDaemon
[05:52] <Flankk> kudzubane, I turned ACPI in an attempt to solve this problem.
[05:52] <wavefunction> fwap, and do not forget to save your profile to make this change persist.
[05:52] <matju> budw: the busy loop makes the CPU stick to high speed.
[05:52] <Flankk> kudzubane, turned ACPI off*
[05:52] <Randakar> cmt^^: you could try moving xorg.conf away (mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.backup) and then running dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server)
[05:53] <Randakar> cmt^^: that should generate a 'clean' x.org config file, hopefully your ati configuration tool will actually do something then next time you run it.
[05:53] <cmt^^> Randakar - I found this when doing fglrxinfo:
[05:53] <cmt^^> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[05:53] <Randakar> PaSurf: I'd check the timezone configuration first, then run ntpdate to see if it syncs
[05:54] <olds> need to install mp3 codecs on fresh edgy install
[05:54] <olds> how do I go about that
[05:54] <PaSurf> Randakar:  Sounds good, thanks for the help!  :)
[05:54] <fwap> how can i get to a normal text based virtual console in ubuntu and how do i switch back and forth to Gnome? (i tried ctrl+alt+backspace but it just took me to the gnome login screen)
[05:54] <kudzubane> Flankk: have you peeped in the logs to see whether that sheds any light?
[05:54] <jrib> !mp3 > olds
[05:54] <Randakar> cmt^^: yep, sounds like the config file is wrong then
[05:54] <fwap> !mp3 > fwap
[05:55] <A3n> how do i turn on a wireless device ?
[05:55] <Randakar> fwap: ctrl-alt-f1
[05:55] <A3n> i read http://www.ioi.knaw.nl/~heimel/computers/connecting_wireless.html but i'm not on laptop
[05:55] <Randakar> fwap: back is alt-f7
[05:55] <A3n> so no 'FP' key :s
[05:55] <Randakar> fwap: or ctrl-f7, I forget  ;-)
[05:55] <budw> matju: I see.  you may be out of luck - I can't disable throttling on my laptop.  What does this program do that requires consistant CPU resources?
[05:55] <fwap> ah so it's like normal linux
[05:55] <fwap> thanks
[05:55] <Randakar> fwap: np
[05:56] <Flankk> kudzubane, yes, that's how I found out it was shutting down due to ACPI.  However it's still shutting down when it is off.
[05:56] <ajopaul_> anyone using/used enlightenment wm here?
[05:56] <kudzubane> Flankk: how are you disabling acpi?
[05:56] <Randakar> ajopaul_: yes, but it's been 7 years or so .. so maybe I don't count ;-)
[05:56] <cmt^^> haha
[05:57] <cmt^^> Randakar - package "xorg-server" is not installed and there is no information
[05:57] <A3n> how do i turn on wireless device ? are there function keys for it for PC's too? (like FN + F3 in notebook)
[05:57] <ajopaul_> oh! was on e16, din figure how to run a command , like alt-f2 in other desktops
[05:57] <lumpki> !resolution
[05:57] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[05:57] <budw> matju: can you try to pace the app with system clock (ex sleep()) instead of CPU load?
=== ^JaReD^ is now known as HydrageN
[05:57] <cmt^^> Randakar - strange huh?
[05:57] <Flankk> kudzubane, in my grub menu.lst I set acpi=off
[05:58] <matju> budw: the program is a user interface for a sound/video program, and i'm trying to accelerate it, so i need to measure how fast it is, but the test is only a few seconds, and the cpu clock change is skewing the results, so i can't figure out how to accelerate my program.
[05:58] <Randakar> cmt^^: a moment
[05:59] <Randakar> cmt^^: not really, the package is called 'xserver-xorg' ;-)
[05:59] <lumpki> yep
[05:59] <kudzubane> Flankk: did you verify acpi is indeed off after booting with that option?
[05:59] <matju> budw: no, the program doesn't do a busy loop itself, but i need to run a busy loop in the background of it so that it runs faster, in order to cancel the freq throttle.
[05:59] <rogue781> can someone direct me to how to build a kernel module and all that good stuff pleasE?
[06:00] <cmt^^> so Randakar - should I use ATI here, or go with fglrx? in the menu that comes up
[06:00] <A3n> $ ndiswrapper -l \n Installed ndis drivers: prisma00        driver present, hardware present \n$ modprobe ndiswrapper\n$ dmesg\nndiswrapper version 1.2 loaded (preempt=yes,smp=no)

[06:04] <David777> Instead of logging in using your user name at the login prompt, use "root".
[06:04] <jrib> A3n: are you in windows now?
[06:04] <lumpki> David777, ubuntu uses sudo
[06:04] <A3n> yes
[06:04] <A3n> dual booting
[06:04] <jrib> !ext3 | A3n
[06:04] <ubotu> A3n: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[06:04] <David777> lumpki: I use root
[06:04] <A3n> i need internet in ubuntu
[06:04] <Randakar> psyke88: epochs are introduced to upgrade something to something with a lower version number, usually because something broke on the newer version
[06:04] <David777> lumpki: And I use ubuntu.
[06:04] <A3n> and write?
[06:05] <jrib> A3n: yes
[06:05] <A3n> i always mount hda1
[06:05] <lumpki> yes, it can be enabled, but you cant log in as root by default
[06:05] <psyke88> Randakar, is it possible to specify the epoch in checkinstall?
[06:05] <jrib> A3n: the reason you can't use sudo is in those two files, we can fix that from windows if you install fs-driver and get you back in shape
[06:05] <Randakar> psyke88: normally you can bump the version number yourselves by adding a changelog entry for it. but I don't know if that includes epochs
[06:05] <David777> lumpki: If you are a regular desktop user, sudo is fine.  If you are an actual system administrator (like me) you want to be logged in as root all the time.
[06:06] <jrib> David777: that is what 'sudo -i' is for
[06:06] <cmt^^> Randakar - I have a philips 190B 19" LCD, should I still just go with "Generic Monitor"?
[06:06] <Randakar> cmt^^: yeah, most monitors are autodetected fine
[06:06] <David777> jrib: It's just easier for me to log in as root.
[06:06] <jrib> David777: that is fine
[06:06] <mnoir> David777: yeah - that wat there is no audit trail as to who actually made the changes - I don't think so
[06:06] <lumpki> David777, A3n is not a sysadmin
[06:06] <ClydeGoffe> hey does anyone know how to get audio working with ubuntu 6.10 server
[06:06] <mnoir> wat=way :)
[06:07] <David777> jrib: I have to use many distros and I don't like having to keep track of each method of assuming root.
[06:07] <ClydeGoffe> i dont want to apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[06:07] <Randakar> David777: I just did a 'sudo bash' and changed the password for root. Much easier for an oldtimer ;-)
[06:07] <mnoir> David777: so which distributions do not support sudo?
[06:08] <A3n> i always set myself root with su => [password]  but i always log in with my account "a3n" on boot
[06:08] <SpaceBass> hey folks
[06:08] <A3n> guess i'll have to try logging in as "root"
[06:08] <cmt^^> ok now I'm done Randakar.. Restart X?
[06:08] <jrib> David777: yes, I understand.  And I think you should use whatever you prefer.  In ubuntu however, the sudo model is preferred, so we tend to recommend that to users.  Usually we just link to the sudo wiki page to let users make up their own minds and avoid this discussion every time :)
[06:08] <cmt^^> and then try sudo ati-configure...
[06:08] <SpaceBass> I just installed ubuntu on hda (first IDE drive) and it wanted to install grub on hd0 ...which i let it
[06:08] <Randakar> cmt^^: sounds like an idea
[06:08] <SpaceBass> now when I boot for the first time i get grub error 2
[06:08] <Randakar> cmt^^: of course, if it doesn't work, you can just put your xorg.conf back and be right back where you started.
[06:08] <ClydeGoffe> anyone?
[06:09] <David777> mnoir: I don't know.  I don't keep track.  Right now, one project I'm on doesn't even use a distro.  It just has a cross-compiled busybox and some other software.  No sudo.
[06:09] <kittyhawk> greetings.  Can anyone tell me the right way to get the public key for the development packages?
[06:09] <jrib> A3n: did you understand what I said about why sudo wasn't working for you?
[06:09] <lumpki> ClydeGoffe, i think you want alsa apckages
[06:09] <lumpki> *packages
[06:09] <A3n> not mush
[06:09] <A3n> :)
[06:09] <A3n> srr
[06:09] <ClydeGoffe> just apt-get install alsa?
[06:09] <lumpki> apt-cache show asla  first  ;)
[06:10] <Randakar> !SpaceBass: sounds like grub did not install properly then
[06:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about SpaceBass: sounds like grub did not install properly then - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:10] <jrib> A3n: ok, you have an error in either /etc/hostname or /etc/hosts.  So to fix this, you can install fs-driver on windows.  That way you can edit the files on your linux partition.  Just pastebin the contents of /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
[06:10] <ClydeGoffe> let me give you the run down...i have ubuntu server installed on my laptop
[06:10] <ClydeGoffe> i dont like the desktop version
[06:10] <compengi> why it's not secure to install .rpm packages by alien?
[06:10] <ClydeGoffe> not a fan of gnome
[06:10] <Randakar> SpaceBass: (sorry for stating the obvious)
[06:10] <ClydeGoffe> so i've installed xorg and afterstep
[06:10] <SpaceBass> Randakar, yeah...i kinda figured that :)
[06:10] <ClydeGoffe> haven't figured out how to get my sound working but i'll try looking into alsa
[06:10] <A3n> jrib: k
[06:11] <SpaceBass> When I tried to specify that it install on hda it errored out during the install
[06:11] <ClydeGoffe> will it configure it for my sound card?
[06:11] <Randakar> SpaceBass: can you be a bit more specific when you say 'error 2' ?
[06:11] <SpaceBass> so it only likes to install on hd0...and I'm not even sure what hd0 is
[06:11] <Garito> hi all
[06:11] <ClydeGoffe> do i need to start alsa manually or will it start automatically with the proper settings?
[06:11] <SpaceBass> Randakar, thats all the screen says .... grub error 2
[06:11] <DeathWolf> hello all, when i do "su username"(with a correct username) it says "no shell", i checked, and the shell is fine, i tried with many users, and it always gives that error, also these users can ssh in fine
[06:11] <David777> lol, you gotta like aptitude
[06:11] <compengi> SpaceBass, what's the problem?
[06:11] <lumpki> ClydeGoffe, maybe sude apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[06:11] <DeathWolf> it's just when i try to su that it goes wrong, any ideas?
[06:11] <jamclx> hey, im using wine with ubuntu and im wondering how to make it run exe files when I double click them...
[06:11] <SpaceBass> compengi, fresh install to hda trying for the first boot...grub error 2
[06:12] <ClydeGoffe> i dont like kde either
[06:12] <paradox34690> can someone tell me how I can put the trashcan on the desktop of ubuntu 6.10 rather than having it in the panel?
[06:12] <Randakar> SpaceBass: there's a list here: http://www.linuxselfhelp.com/gnu/grub/html_chapter/grub_13.html
[06:12] <jrib> !icons | paradox34690
[06:12] <ubotu> paradox34690: Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[06:12] <ClydeGoffe> xfce is ok but i prefer afterstep
[06:12] <lumpki> ClydeGoffe, ok, then well it's libalsa something or other i belive
[06:12] <compengi> SpaceBass, are you trying to install ubuntu?
[06:12] <SpaceBass> compengi, yeah
[06:12] <ClydeGoffe> alright i'll try looking into that
[06:13] <ClydeGoffe> thanks
[06:13] <lumpki> ClydeGoffe, libasound2
[06:13] <Randakar> SpaceBass: 2 : Bad file or directory type
[06:13] <Randakar>     This error is returned if a file requested is not a regular file, but something like a symbolic link, directory, or FIFO.
[06:13] <SpaceBass> compengi, got a software raid5 array I want to preserve then a stand-alone system drive (hda) which I'm trying to install onto
[06:13] <jrib> DeathWolf: weird, what shell is the user's default?
[06:13] <Randakar> SpaceBass: did you install it on 'hda0', or on 'hda0,0' ?
[06:13] <SpaceBass> Randakar, yeah...thats about as ambigious as saying "error 2" :)
[06:13] <burepe_> Where does drupal install to?
[06:13] <Randakar> SpaceBass: unfortunately ;-)
[06:13] <SpaceBass> Randakar, the installer said grub would install on hd0   not hda0 or anything else
[06:14] <A3n> jrib: do i need to install linux swap too?
[06:14] <Randakar> SpaceBass: at any rate, the solution here would be to run grub from live CD, see if it installes
[06:14] <A3n> jrib:or just the linux partition?
[06:14] <wavefunction> Does anyone know how to get realplayer plugin functioning on Edgy ?
[06:14] <jbroome> !realplayer | wavefunction
[06:14] <ubotu> wavefunction: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[06:14] <jrib> A3n: no, we just need access to /
[06:14] <compengi> SpaceBass, i think you should remove your partition that you want to install your ubuntu on and create a new ext3 one, maybe that will help
[06:14] <SpaceBass> Randakar, not opposed to that, but not sure how to do much with grub via the commandline
[06:14] <Randakar> SpaceBass: me neither to be honest ;-)
[06:15] <SpaceBass> compengi, during the install I told it to wipe hda and create a new structure
[06:15] <fnf> Does anyone know how to setup the local network between 2 PCs ?. I installed Ubuntu on a friend's machine but she hasn't got network access yet. I'd want to transfer updates to her machine without having to use the additional USB drive.
[06:15] <jamclx> how can I make wine open exe files in ubuntu?
[06:15] <carld> is doing an upgrade to edgy *safe* yet?
[06:15] <David777> Gah, why does Ubuntu have to use such a crazy setup for Apache
[06:15] <jrib> jamclx: wine file.exe
[06:15] <carld> jamclx, wine notepad.exe
[06:15] <jamclx> yes but how can I make it do that automatically?
[06:15] <Randakar> SpaceBass: but it sounds like you don't have a menu.list (which configures partitions) and grub gives up in confusion or something
[06:15] <jamclx> like, when I double click an exe file
[06:15] <jbroome> jamclx: right click on .exe and choose "open with" and select wine
[06:15] <wizo> hey all, when i run ./configure, it says that it cant find libncurses or libcurses, but when i try to apt-get install libncurses5, it says that it is already up to date, why is this so?
[06:15] <Randakar> SpaceBass: what version were you installing?
[06:15] <SpaceBass> Randakar, thanks for the tips...at least increases my vocab about the issue
[06:15] <kittyhawk> I'm trying to install g++ and some other libraries, but they are not authenticated.  How can I install the appropriate public key?
[06:15] <SpaceBass> Randakar, 6.10
[06:15] <carld> wizo, you probably need to install the devel packages
[06:16] <jamclx> thanks jbroome :D
[06:16] <wavefunction> jbroome, I've already installed the restricted format, and also installed realplayer using the .bin at real.com. Any time I try to open a .rm the browser only gives me the chance to open it with an external app, not within the browser, i.e. within a plugin. :(
[06:16] <jrib> DeathWolf: http://www.sunmanagers.org/archives/1995/0281.html  the title seems promisong though i have not read it
[06:16] <jbroome> wizo: try the -dev pkgs also
[06:16] <David777> wizo, some configure files incorrectly look for the wrong name for libcurses
[06:16] <fnf> Anyone ? I know that kind of 'ad-hoc' network is possible, but haven't got to known how to configure it.
[06:16] <wizo> devel?
[06:16] <DeathWolf> jrib, permissions are fine
[06:16] <DeathWolf> and they can ssh fine, which means it works:/
[06:16] <Naamaah> hi! who knows what to do with USB hard drive (NTFS filesystem) - i can't write anything on it because of privileges. How can I change 'em?
[06:16] <Randakar> SpaceBass: hm, too bad, would have been nice if I could have told you to retry it with a newer version
[06:16] <David777> wizo: You will have to find out what the name of libcurses is on your system and modify the configure file to use that
[06:16] <wizo> David777, how can i do that?
[06:17] <wizo> should i get hte devel ones too?
[06:17] <A3n> jrib:only hosts has a little text
[06:17] <SpaceBass> Randakar, LOL!
[06:17] <carld> Naamaah, I don't know that you can write to ntfs (you can, but it isn't easy or recomended)
[06:17] <Randakar> SpaceBass: They uploaded a new grub version to feisty but i wouldn't recommend that
[06:17] <jrib> A3n: pastebin both of the files
[06:17] <ThinkingMan> OK...so I noticed that my system was failing activating swap...
[06:17] <w3ccv> jamclx, you could write a small shell script, with the name notepad (or whatver your .exe file is) make it exectuable and put it in your path. works for me
[06:17] <jrib> !pastebin | A3n
[06:17] <ubotu> A3n: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:17] <ThinkingMan> so I did a swapoff -a
[06:17] <SpaceBass> I'm on a tour of distros this week.... I wiped my suse 10 box which was the orignal host of this raid array...tried FC6 and now back to ubuntu
[06:17] <wizo> i think ill try install dev
[06:17] <wizo> then try configuring the ./config, thanks
[06:18] <David777> wizo: On my SUSE 10.1 system, the library is /usr/lib/libncurses.so
[06:18] <ThinkingMan> and then forgetting what partition I had set as swap I checked out fstab
[06:18] <Randakar> SpaceBass: Actually trying it with Dapper (6.06) might also be an option, mind - upgrading it to 6.10 later might be easier than figuring out what went wrong on the installation ;-) (I dislike grub. A lot.)
[06:18] <A3n> jrib:hostname has just the newline character and thats all
[06:18] <ThinkingMan> ....whoah my god
[06:18] <David777> wizo: Your configure script is probably looking for /usr/lib/libcurses.so (which won't exist)
[06:18] <jrib> A3n: ok, and the other file?
[06:18] <David777> wizo: You will have to edit the configure script to look for libncurses.so
[06:18] <wizo> i see, thanks
[06:18] <SpaceBass> Im gonna reinstall...and pay closer attention to the settings
[06:19] <A3n> jrib:pastin...
[06:19] <jrib> A3n: link?
[06:19] <A3n> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35601/
[06:19] <Randakar> SpaceBass: That might help
[06:19] <wizo> i`ll give it a go Davis777, thanks
[06:19] <Randakar> SpaceBass: if this problem persists, check back in. It should be fixable
[06:19] <wizo> err, which one would the configure file be named?
[06:19] <SpaceBass> Randakar, thanks!
[06:19] <David777> wizo: If you need more help, type /query David777 and you can post your script into the window.
[06:19] <SpaceBass> before I leave...how well does ubutnu play in an AD domain?
[06:19] <Randakar> SpaceBass: no problem
[06:19] <wizo> thanks ^^
[06:20] <ThinkingMan> so um... anyone want to tell me why everything in fstab is commented out with "--converted during upgrade to edgy"?
[06:20] <DeathWolf> ok even weirder
[06:20] <DeathWolf> 2 users, with exactly the same shell
[06:20] <DeathWolf> i can su to one but not to the other
[06:20] <carld> ThinkingMan, I would love to know, I am thinking about doing an upgrade
[06:20] <David777> DeathWolf: Does one have an empty password?
[06:20] <jrib> A3n: ok, first.  I thought it would be ok to write to the files, but only if you have an editor that will format the files correctly (vim?).  So I'd recommend you just reboot to ubuntu, but select "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then edit the files with this command: 'nano /etc/hosts' and 'nano /etc/hostname'.  In nano, to save and exit you press ctrl-o ctrl-x
[06:20] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: they changed the way Ubuntu adresses filesystems from /dev/hdX or /dev/sdX to /dev/disk/by-label/...
[06:21] <DeathWolf> nope
[06:21] <DeathWolf> both have a password
[06:21] <DeathWolf> both have a home dir too
[06:21] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: OK, so how do I find my swap partition?
[06:21] <DeathWolf> with exactly same permissions
[06:21] <DeathWolf> i'm quite surprised
[06:21] <David777> DeathWolf: Any output in dmesg?
[06:21] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: it should have left the old partition names in there in comments
[06:21] <carld> ThinkingMan, this may help http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=287096&page=3
[06:21] <foxtrot> Therefore,
[06:21] <jrib> A3n: You want to pick a hostname.  For example "ubuntu".  Make your /etc/hostname file contain only that: "ubuntu".  In your /etc/hosts, change the first line to:  "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost ubuntu" .  No quotes in the files of course
[06:21] <Darkwolf> yo
[06:21] <DeathWolf> nothing in dmesg
[06:22] <DeathWolf> or /var/log/messages
[06:22] <wizo> whoa, im assuming the configure file is named configure
[06:22] <wizo> wow, installing the dev solved it
[06:22] <David777> DeathWolf: It doesn't log the login failures?
[06:22] <David777> Augh
[06:22] <A3n> jrib:but i dont really understand what all these changes are for?
[06:22] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: if that fails, use a program like gparted or fdisk to figure out what your disk geometry looks like
[06:22] <DeathWolf> it's not a login failure
[06:22] <DeathWolf> the error is "No shell"
=== juan is now known as Juan___
[06:23] <DeathWolf> if i look in auth.log
[06:23] <jrib> A3n: /etc/hostname stores your hostname.  sudo uses /etc/hosts to make sure your hostname points back to 127.0.0.1
[06:23] <DeathWolf> ah
[06:23] <DeathWolf> it does
[06:23] <David777> What's it say DeathWolf?
[06:24] <A3n> jrib: ow, so if i change that i'l be able to be root on "a3n"
[06:24] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: also, if you look in /dev/disk/by-label/ and do an ls -ld there you'll find the labels are actually symlinks pointing to drives
[06:24] <DeathWolf> David777, what does?
[06:24] <DeathWolf> the really weird part is that it does work for one user but not for another
[06:24] <David777> DeathWolf: auth.log?
[06:24] <cj> I need a picture of Feisty Fawn to put on my fridge for my daughter.  do we have one?
[06:24] <jrib> A3n: yes, if you change "ubuntu" to "a3n" in what I said.  You become root with the sudo command
[06:24] <compengi> when i'm trying to run limewire it gives me runLime.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")

[06:25] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: bash: cd: /dev/disk/by-label/: No such file or directory
[06:25] <DeathWolf> there's no failure
[06:25] <carld> where is there a changelog for edgy or release notes?
[06:25] <DeathWolf> i cant invent one:/
[06:25] <jrib> A3n: as long as a3n is your first user, he should be in the "admin" group.  So he should be able to use sudo.  Why would you want to login as root?
[06:26] <David777> lol, ok sorry DeathWolf
[06:26] <David777> What's the error su is giving you, DeathWolf
[06:26] <cmt^^> Randakar - X crashed unfortunately
[06:26] <DeathWolf> "No shell"
[06:26] <DeathWolf> ok, i have found something new
[06:26] <cmt^^> with driver="ati"
[06:26] <A3n> jrib:does it mather wether i'm "root" or "a3n" ?
[06:26] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: that's odd
[06:26] <DeathWolf> now, sshing yields "/bin/bash: Permission denied" but the permission look fine to me
=== Spenlex is now known as spenlex-afk
[06:26] <David777> What do the two lines in /etc/passwd look like?
[06:26] <DeathWolf> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 664084 2006-04-22 00:51 /bin/bash
[06:26] <DeathWolf> isnt that enough?
[06:26] <SpaceBass> what should I set as the install point for grub if I want it to go on the mbr of the first disk?
[06:26] <jrib> A3n: no you can do everything with sudo as a3n that you could do if you logged in as root
[06:27] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: and /dev/disk/by-uuid ?
[06:27] <David777> DeathWolf: You may have a hidden char in /etc/passwd
[06:27] <Randakar> cmt^^: have you rerun your ati configurator?
[06:27] <A3n> jrib: but all my files and configs stay the same wether i login on a3n or login on root , right?
[06:27] <Randakar> SpaceBass: hd0,0 I think
[06:27] <Randakar> SpaceBass: but hd0 might also be it ;-)
[06:27] <SpaceBass> Randakar, what is hd0 ?
[06:27] <jrib> A3n: no, they don't have the same home directory
[06:28] <SpaceBass> its not a drive I have...
[06:28] <compengi> jrib, in the runLime.sh_limewire i have cd /opt/LimeWire/
[06:28] <compengi> ./runLime.sh
[06:28] <Randakar> SpaceBass: you can also run mbr, which puts a minimal master boot record on /hdX, then install grub on the first partition
[06:28] <David777> Yeah A3n, if you log in as root, your home directory is /root
[06:28] <SpaceBass> hd0 is what it defaults to and thats what has me stuck now
[06:28] <jrib> compengi: try 'bash runLime.sh'.  I would recommend frostwire instead though
[06:28] <cmt^^> Randakar - I'm back in X now, with the same xorg.conf as previously
[06:28] <A3n> jrib:just the home directory? so ndiswrapper and its drivers and all are still there and working , right?
[06:28] <Randakar> SpaceBass: grub uses different naming scheme from linux itself
[06:28] <cmt^^> x wouldn't start without it
[06:28] <David777> Yeah, A3n
[06:28] <manmadha> jrib, hee my kino is not working dude....(Digital Video conversion)and moreover the ffmpeg cmd is not working...no manual entry what to do..?
[06:28] <DeathWolf> nope
[06:28] <SpaceBass> this is getting hard :)
[06:29] <DeathWolf> just rewrote passwd
[06:29] <DeathWolf> it's clean
[06:29] <rhyddin_> anyone here ever work with Open Cubic Player?
[06:29] <DeathWolf> no weird char:/
[06:29] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: that's there, but I just see the 4 uuids, I just need to be able to figure out (roughly) the size of each of them so I can remember which one i set as swap
[06:29] <Randakar> cmt^^: hm, you can try running that dpkg-reconfigure command ( or just copy in the new xorg.conf file) and then running the ati tools without restarting X
[06:29] <jrib> manmadha: is "ffmpeg" package installed?
[06:30] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: ls -ld in that directory will get you the real device names
[06:30] <manmadha> jrib, 1m i will check
[06:30] <A3n> jrib:i think i'll just logon as root :p
[06:30] <DeathWolf> can someone tell me his permissions for /bin /bin/sh and /bin/bash?
[06:30] <A3n> bbl
[06:30] <DeathWolf> and owner/groups
[06:30] <slurp> hi :)
[06:30] <jrib> A3n: that's really not a good idea... You should fix sudo regardless.
[06:30] <SpaceBass> installing for the 4th time....after that I'm going to bash my raid array with a sledge hammer and forget it
[06:31] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: um... nope?  all I get is drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 120 2006-12-05 22:17
[06:31] <rhyddin_> ok, another way of putting it .. program is looking for libadplug-1.5.1 and I have libadplug-2.0 but it doesn't seem to see it .. is there a way to make the program look for the new lib instead of the old one?
[06:31] <slurp> I've got a problem using my Radeon graphics card, it slows extremly (to 1fps or even less) down, after playing about 2min
[06:31] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: ls -ld /dev/disk/by-uuid/*
[06:31] <David777> DeathWolf: drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2006-12-05 11:44 /bin
[06:31] <manmadha> jrib, no dude..
[06:31] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: what you got was the size/permissions of that directory itself
[06:31] <fabiim> dirty easy way to set up a ssh server ( that's what i need to allow a computer on my network to control my computer right?) on my ubuntu machine ?
[06:31] <David777> DeathWolf: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2006-12-05 11:26 /bin/sh -> dash
[06:32] <David777> DeathWolf: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 676836 2006-09-19 18:24 /bin/bash
[06:32] <jrib> manmadha: you need to install it to get a man page for it
[06:32] <jrib> and to have it
[06:32] <David777> fabiim: You have to install the openssh-server package
[06:32] <cmt^^> !ati
[06:32] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:33] <manmadha> okkk
[06:33] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: OK, so now I can see them as ../../sda4 and ../../sda3 ../../sda1 snd ../../sda2
[06:33] <Randakar> cmt^^: any luck?
[06:33] <ThinkingMan> but I still can't see geometry to figure out which one was swap
[06:33] <fabiim> David777: yeah i noticed , i am reading the ssh how to on the wiki , thanks =)
[06:33] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: fdisk /dev/sda
[06:33] <wizo> hey, let`s say i compile and install a app using make and make install
[06:33] <wizo> then what if i wanna remove it, what do i do?
[06:33] <cmt^^> hmm
[06:33] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: then type 'p' to get a partition listing, and 'q' to exit
[06:33] <cmt^^> Randakar - at least I don't get the same error
[06:34] <lumpki> wizo, see if it will do 'make uninstall'
[06:34] <David777> wizo: make uninstall sometimes works if the creator made that target
[06:34] <Randakar> cmt^^: progress, then :-)
[06:34] <jrib> wizo: you hope that there is a 'make uninstall' otherwise you have to rm manually.  You should consider using checkinstall isntead of make install
[06:34] <jrib> !checkinstall | wizo
[06:34] <ubotu> wizo: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
=== rausb0_ is now known as rausb0
[06:34] <wizo> ah i see
[06:34] <wizo> eek
[06:34] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: har!!!
[06:34] <ThinkingMan>  /dev/sda2 is my swap
[06:34] <ThinkingMan> OK... so *crosses fingers* here goes nothin
[06:34] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: there you go :-)
[06:35] <cmt^^> wish me luck
[06:35] <wizo> oh noes
[06:35] <ThinkingMan> great...
[06:35] <wizo> make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'.  Stop.
[06:35] <ThinkingMan> so I did a sudo mkswap /dev/sda2
[06:36] <mwe> isn't creating a file 'blacklist-foo' containing 'blacklist foo' in /etc/modprobe.d/ supposed to stop the module foo from loading?
[06:36] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: you may just try swapon /dev/sda2 first ..
[06:36] <[GuS] > Re
[06:36] <David777> wizo: You can uninstall it the hard way by looking at what the install target in the Makefile does (look for the "install:" line in the Makefile)
[06:36] <ThinkingMan> Randakar: there we go
[06:36] <ThinkingMan> well, no error msg
[06:36] <ThinkingMan> So... how does one test whether swap is working
[06:37] <Randakar> ThinkingMan: and if you look in top ?

[06:39] <David777> Augh, so samba on ubuntu does not use smbpasswd?
[06:39] <Randakar> David777: frankly I think using smbpasswd is a mistake in nearly all cases
[06:40] <burepe_> How do I view apache documentation?
[06:40] <jbroome> kudzubane: top doesn't give any clues?
[06:40] <jrib> wizo: you can reinstall it with checkinstall and then remove it too
[06:40] <Randakar> David777: Either you want local user accounts, or you want to use something more complex like an LDAP server setup
[06:40] <David777> Randakar: I just want to share some files on a local network
[06:40] <wizo> oh really?
[06:40] <wizo> thanks jrih
[06:40] <David777> Randakar: It's an embedded system
[06:40] <wizo> imma try that now
[06:40] <lumpki> jrib that's good to know
[06:40] <rhyddin_> Can I force an application to use a newer version of a library if it doesn't find the old version that its looking for?
[06:41] <jrib> wizo: I think it will just overwrite the files that you already have so it should work
[06:41] <wizo> ah good point there
[06:41] <dreamer> hmm, where is the trash-bin in kde ?
[06:41] <wizo> thanks for that idea
[06:41] <kudzubane> jbroome: well, load on this machine running other distro is around 0.00 almost all the time, under ubuntu, it is around 0.60-0.80 most of the time
[06:41] <Randakar> David777: So you make a linux account for the other users
[06:41] <jbroome> kudzubane: that's not that high
[06:41] <puffy-san> anyone here who is running peercast on their linux? I'm trying to get my channel working and I wonder would there be someone willing to test the channel?
[06:42] <wizo> so to remove it.. how would i know what the app name i should type in for?
[06:42] <lumpki> dreamer,  trash:/
[06:42] <kudzubane> jbroome: it is when compared to the other distro, and since this is happening all the time, it is probably affecting overall performance to a measurable degree
[06:42] <cmt^^> hey Randakar
[06:42] <Randakar> kudzubane: maybe you should compare top output on those 2 systems, see what the 'big' consumer is
[06:42] <David777> Randakar: There is only one user: root
[06:42] <cmt^^> progress indeed
[06:43] <DeathWolf> what can cause a /bin/bash permission denied when both / /bin and /bin/bash have 755?.
[06:43] <Randakar> David777: So? Just add a user for the share you want to share. It's not much different from smbpasswd, except that you also let linux know that user exists.
[06:43] <cmt^^> Randakar - X started this time, but it seems I had messed up my keyboard settings, given that I couldn't type anything in the textbox for my username
[06:43] <kudzubane> Randakar: the strange thing is, cpu and memory usage appears to behave similarly
[06:43] <cmt^^> Randakar - but when I do 'glxinfo' I get a whole lot more information than I used to
[06:43] <Randakar> cmt^^: but you're using the correct driver now?
[06:43] <rindolf> Hi all.
[06:43] <puffy-san> anybody?
[06:43] <rindolf> I'm trying to debug the kernel using UML and gdb. But then the switch_threads() gets invoked in the middle and I can no longer debug. What should I do to fix it?
[06:43] <kudzubane> Randakar: but load is significantly higher
[06:43] <dreamer> thnx lumpki
[06:44] <rindolf> puffy-san: what is your problem?
[06:44] <David777> Randakar: I don't want to add users.  There are not users.  It's a headless embedded system.  Jeepers.  No one's ever going to log into this thing except to do administrative stuff.
[06:44] <Randakar> David777: if you use smbpasswd you are *also* adding users.
[06:44] <cmt^^> Randakar - I don't know really.. there's a lot of info on the glx-system in glxinfo, but the same annoying line..
[06:44] <jbroome> David777: just add the users and change their shell to /bin/false.
[06:44] <puffy-san> rindolf: trying to get a peercast channel working but have to have someone who would test does it work...
[06:44] <David777> Randakar: If I use smbpasswd, the password for samba can be different than the one for login.
[06:44] <Randakar> cmt^^: which one?
[06:45] <cmt^^> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[06:45] <puffy-san> rindolf: if you are interested, peercast.org and I'll try to guide you to my channel ;)
[06:45] <cmt^^> at the top
[06:45] <cmt^^> but then a whole lot of info, and it seems to me it's not stating anything going wrong
[06:45] <rindolf> puffy-san: what software do I need?
[06:45] <cmt^^> just info, straight up
[06:45] <Randakar> David777: Yes, but every time I've tried that on any linux distro it just breaks samba
[06:45] <puffy-san> rindolf: you need peercast (peercast.org), you don't need to do a install cause it comes in a binary for linux
[06:45] <David777> Randakar: I've been using Samba since 2002 with smbpasswd and never had a problem.
[06:45] <compengi> jrib, if i will do sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash and select no will it effect other applications
[06:46] <rindolf> puffy-san: OK.
[06:46] <David777> Randakar: ...not once
[06:46] <Randakar> David777: *shrug* YMMV I guess
[06:46] <jrib> compengi: dash is default for /bin/sh on edgy
[06:46] <David777> Randakar: At least I have a sane smb.conf from a SUSE installation I can use.
[06:47] <cmt^^> Randakar - I get that same error when running glxdemo and / or glxgears
[06:47] <Randakar> cmt^^: what does fglrxinfo say?
[06:47] <cmt^^> it runs, but barely
[06:47] <compengi> jrib, so it won't make any difference?
[06:47] <jrib> compengi: no, why are you running that?
[06:47] <rindolf> puffy-san: OK, I have the peercast client. Now how do I connect to you?
[06:47] <cmt^^> Randakar - same as before :<
[06:47] <cmt^^> let me pastebin it

[06:49] <Randakar> cmt^^: to xorg.conf
[06:49] <rindolf> puffy-san: http://yp.peercast.org/?find=streamfi&Submit=Search&host=127.0.0.1%3A7144&status=online ?
[06:49] <Raven> I use D-Link, their ok.
[06:49] <compengi> jrib, that's why i should do that command so that i will run
[06:49] <puffy-san> rindolf: yeah that is the correct one
[06:49] <David777> Anyone know where USB thumb drives get mounted?
[06:49] <rindolf> puffy-san: OK.
[06:49] <HumanPrototype> lakbu, afaik they are universally supported as they work on a hardware level - somebody correct me if im wrong here please
[06:50] <compengi> it*
[06:50] <jrib> compengi: what command?
[06:50] <HumanPrototype> David777, /media/usbdisk i think
[06:50] <puffy-san> rindolf: now download the m3u file from the play link and then try to play it in some audio playing app (I use xmms)
[06:50] <David777> Not showing up
[06:50] <compengi> jrib, sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
[06:50] <lakbu> Raven, HumanPrototype, does the USB ports in the hub will be seen as *many* ports in the ubuntu box?

[06:50] <Raven> where to get info to setup samba for network connection to xp machine
[06:50] <HumanPrototype> lakbu, i think it would yes

[06:51] <cmt^^> to add Composite "0"
[06:51] <Randakar> cmt^^: ah, ok
[06:51] <jrib> compengi: I don't think it will work.  Can you explain what exactly the problem is?  What error are you getting and with what command?
[06:51] <Kitch> ty, but... wht do i do about my kernal error?
[06:51] <David777> Crud, gotta mount it by hand, gets picked up as sda
[06:51] <Kitch> or is it in there?
[06:51] <cmt^^> Randakar - I get this from the x-server log
[06:51] <Randakar> cmt^^: hrm, tricky
[06:51] <Kitch> and i did look b4 i came here :P
[06:51] <cmt^^> "(WW) fglrx: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:1:0:1) found"
[06:51] <rindolf> puffy-san: I don't see where it is.
[06:51] <lakbu> HumanPrototype, aahh. thanks. so each port in the hub will have a corresponding entry in the /dev/ ?
[06:51] <HumanPrototype> David777, it should get picked up as sd something as thats how usb drives work
[06:51] <HumanPrototype> lakbu, i would think so yes
[06:51] <puffy-san> rindolf: where what is?
[06:51] <compengi> jrib, i read the post and found this out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=278134&highlight=limewire

[06:52] <cmt^^> Randakar - which is very strange, since I told the configuration program the adress was 1.0.0
[06:52] <cmt^^> not 1.0.1
[06:52] <SpaceBass> well...ubuntu and grub just dont like me
[06:52] <puffy-san> rindolf: humm well it might be on your desktop or at your home directory... depending on where you downloaded it...
[06:52] <rubix_> is filesharing discussion allowed in this channel for the purpose of finding a good prog
[06:52] <kudzubane> Raven: probably not
[06:52] <HumanPrototype> David777, try adding a line in fstab for it and if you are using gnome try checking in System.>Preferences >Removable Drives and Media
[06:52] <rindolf> puffy-san: OK.
[06:52] <David777> Ah farg it
[06:52] <lumpki> wizo, install checkinstall =)

[06:53] <LacunaV> Is it possible to prevent gnome-volume-manager from mounting specific partitions on a usbdisk? I get 4 disks up on my desktop, but only use one of them

[06:53] <cmt^^> Randakar - it says 1.0.0 in xorg.conf though 8(
[06:53] <jrib> compengi: it won't break anything, go ahead.  But it would be better if you edited the limewire files to use bash instead of sh imo
[06:53] <HumanPrototype> David777, if its a server install you may not have the hotplug stuff installed
[06:53] <kudzubane> Raven: no, if you want some common apps (such as flash-player)

[06:56] <mwozniak> like move file.0 to file.1 and file.1 to file.2 etc to an arbitrary number
[06:57] <puffy-san> mwozniak: atleast with python that is possible
[06:57] <lumpki> Amaranth, sorry, nothing... it doesnt seem to know enough topcias thats all
[06:57] <compengi> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35608/
[06:57] <wizo> ah i renamed it, oh another question, do i do apt-get remove name or do i have to use dpkg -r name ?
[06:57] <mwozniak> puffy-san, how would it know when to stop?
[06:57] <Amaranth> lumpki: teach it :)
[06:57] <Raven> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[06:57] <mwozniak> puffy-san, check if the file exists and then move it?
[06:57] <HumanPrototype> wizo apt-get remove works for me
[06:57] <wizo> i see, thanks
[06:58] <puffy-san> mwozniak: humm well dunno exactly what you want to do but yes it is possible to check if a file exists with python
[06:58] <lumpki> Amaranth, alright then i
[06:58] <jrib> compengi: change line 2 to:    bash runLime.sh
[06:58] <lumpki> Amaranth, alright then i'll try
[06:58] <mwozniak> puffy-san, alright, thanks, i'll look into implementing it with python
[06:58] <David777> So, because Debian/Ubuntu have to have their own setup for Apache2, none of the Apache2 docs mean anything.
[06:58] <rindolf> puffy-san: OK.
[06:58] <compengi> jrib, i had tried it before but didn't work
[06:59] <puffy-san> mwozniak: np, it could be pretty difficult if you don't know python though...
[06:59] <Kitch> an intel P4 is compatible with linux in it?

[06:59] <rindolf> puffy-san: it's a broken link.
[06:59] <mwozniak> puffy-san, i've used it a couple of times before... nothing very complicated
[06:59] <iceman_> Hey guys small problem.  I removed the main user name because I had an error and now my soundcard will not turn on.  That and sudo apt-get install command does nothing
[06:59] <puffy-san> rindolf: humm... well thanks for trying anyway ;)
[06:59] <jrib> compengi: if it doesn't work, pastebin /opt/LimeWire/runlime.sh
[06:59] <mwozniak> puffy-san, but this should just be one loop with some weird file syntax
[06:59] <cmt^^> I guess I should just give in
[07:00] <cmt^^> I'm not supposed to be able to get it to work
[07:00] <cmt^^> I can't get ati drivers on my system worth of crap
[07:00] <puffy-san> mwozniak: yeah shouldn't be too complicated... if you wan't to check if a file exist, just do a os.path.isfile(path), but first make sure that you have imported the os module
[07:00] <kudzubane> cmt^^: what chipset?
[07:00] <gpd> is there a way to do something like `wall message` to someone who is logged into X11 and has no terminals open?
[07:00] <cmt^^> kudzubane - ati radeon x700 se
[07:00] <cmt^^> and please don't send me that how-to guide
[07:00] <David777> Iceman_: who are you logged in if you deleted the user account?
[07:00] <cmt^^> it doesn't work on my system evidently
[07:00] <fwap> i dont get why some people make fun of ubuntu, this is awsome.. isn't this what even hardcore linux users always wanted.. a stable/easy to use linux desktop to get people using totally free/open source software/operating systems :D i'm not going to buy a mac now to get away from windows
[07:01] <kudzubane> cmt^^: http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/install.html#9
[07:01] <David777> iceman_: If you are logged in as root, you don't need the sudo part in sudo apt-get
[07:01] <kudzubane> cmt^^: http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/install.html#6
[07:01] <cmt^^> fwap - I agree
[07:01] <carpediem> fwap: who makes fun of Ubuntu?
[07:01] <Iceman_B> but Ubuntu doesnt come with a root account,. right?
[07:01] <Iceman_B> =)
[07:01] <iceman_> David777, I went into the recovery kernel and went root and remade the exact same profile name so I could restore my home directory
[07:01] <ArrenLex> fwap: That's exactly why people make fun of ubuntu.
[07:01] <kudzubane> cmt^^: that is short and sweet
[07:01] <fwap> heh
[07:01] <puffy-san> Iceman_B: ubuntu comes with sudo
[07:02] <compengi> jrib, there is no limewire folder in opt
[07:02] <compengi> lol
[07:02] <David777> Iceman_B: Ubuntu does come with root
[07:02] <rindolf> puffy-san: you're welcome.
[07:02] <burepe_> I just installed apache and I was messing around and I changed apache's "apache2-default" file name. After I did that I got a "access forbidden" error so I changed it back but I still get the same error when accessing http://localhost/ . Did I change the directory permissions when I changed the name? How can I fix it?
[07:02] <devilotx> I've got a USB flash drive question/issue, if anyone can assist, that would be nice
[07:02] <cmt^^> kudzubane - thank you, almost looks too easy to be true
[07:02] <cmt^^> gonna try it
[07:02] <cmt^^> brb
[07:02] <carpediem> devilotx: don't ask, just ask
[07:02] <inkeh> hey, i'm having problems with my sound on edgy, it keeps randomly muting?
[07:02] <devilotx> oh ok
[07:02] <jrib> compengi: did you use the write capitalization as in your script?  LimeWire
[07:02] <David777> Iceman_B: If you log into the recovery console, you can set the password for root using passwd and log in as root in the normal login.
[07:03] <Iceman_B> puffy-san / David777: iceman_ isnt'a clone of me, its a different person, but thanks :)
[07:03] <Iceman_B> oh , and I didnt know that
[07:03] <vcef> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild is outdated
[07:03] <iceman_> no no I'm no clone
[07:03] <Iceman_B> but I cnt login anyways, I broke the startup script
[07:03] <Iceman_B> when I tried to get Beryl running
[07:03] <fwap> i think you can set a password for root using 'sudo -' and then preferably using pwgen to generate a good password
[07:03] <devilotx> When I boot Edgy on my laptop with the USB key inserted, it works fine, it automounts it, it shows on the desktop, all is good, I can eject and insert it again, and also insert other keys
[07:03] <vcef> what package do I need to instal to be able to do make xconfig
[07:03] <Lin> hi all.. why in one host using totem-mozilla-plugin I can see a .wmf file embedded on a webpage and in the other system I cannot. The same codecs are installed (about:plugins, show me the codecs). In both systems the same command is executed: /usr/lib/totem/totem-mozilla-viewer ... while one show audio and video the other one shows only the audio.. any tips?
[07:03] <vcef> or at least make menuconfig
[07:04] <devilotx> but if I boot without the key in, I get nothing upon inserting the key, I checked /dev/ and there is no sdb listed
[07:04] <Lin> libncurses5-dev, make, gcc, and libc headers
[07:04] <ArrenLex> vcef: when you run ./configure, it will tell you what it needs.
[07:04] <devilotx> sda is my SATA hard drive
[07:04] <iceman_> Iceman_B, Ha.  I tried removing beryl and now I can't restore to blank session.  And no commands work for me
[07:04] <vcef> there's no configure script in my kernel source dir
[07:04] <compengi> jrib, in the search i found only the runlime.sh which is locate in /usr/share/gnome/help/desktopguide/sample/

[07:05] <devilotx> let me try again,
[07:05] <cmt^^> kudzubane - is reboot really necessary?
[07:05] <cmt^^> kudzubane - isn't x restart enough?
[07:05] <vcef> Lin: what do you mean? it's not compressed

[07:07] <iceman_> David777, Why is it that I delete the account and restore one with the same name and my soundcard does not work and I can't modprobe alsamixer
[07:07] <devilotx> then it goes through 9, 10, 11, now it's on 14...

[07:08] <devilotx> nothing new logged, the light on the key has gone off
[07:08] <kudzubane> iceman_: rights assigned to original user probably isn't assigned to the new
[07:08] <devilotx> it went to 14, and stopped

[07:08] <iceman_> kudzubane, what config file do I need to change/adjust to get my sound to work
[07:08] <vcef> all I am asking is what packages do I need to be able to do make menuconfig or make xconfig
[07:08] <carpediem> devilotx: I searched for that error, and there are some people seeing the same thing on Edgy.
[07:09] <aversin1> Got a Samba question. I can access the shared folder on the Ubuntu box from windows but I can't write to it. I also cant see the Windows box from Ubuntu. Any ideas?

[07:09] <Allans> here is something else that is odd about this.. when i do a ls -l in the root it show some of the folders, but then i will do a sudo ls -l and i see all of them. But i still can't access the folders
[07:09] <devilotx> hmm, I did search but I didn't come up with much... any links to where you saw that?

[07:10] <Allans> Can someone help me please?
[07:10] <Lin> vcef: be welcome.
[07:10] <Lin> vcef: can I stop the download?
[07:10] <Lin> vcef: ;-)
[07:10] <vcef> what download?
[07:10] <carpediem> devilotx: but, it doesn't have a solution I thought was worth mentioning to you

[07:11] <Lin> vcef: aptitude install linux-source-2.6.17
[07:11] <devilotx> Ah,
[07:11] <vcef> sure.
[07:11] <Lin> vcef: im downloading here..  ;-)
[07:11] <devilotx> shame really, it's not a huge deal, but it is a pain
[07:11] <Lin> vcef: just 40 minutes left ;-)

[07:18] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Do you know\have a guess as to what caused this error? Did it work before? What did you change? How much do you know about rescuing systems? What other systems do you have on this machine? Do you have an ubuntu liveCD lying around which you can use to rescue the system? Does Grub start at all and then crash only when you're trying to boot ubuntu, or does grub not come up at all? Be specific, man!~
[07:18] <ArrenLex> !
[07:18] <cmt^^> kudzubane - didn't work

[07:19] <Lin> vcef: just make menuconfig
[07:19] <Octarine> thats all i know on the subject.
[07:19] <Lin> vcef: my tip.. install kernel-package debian package
[07:19] <ArrenLex> Octarine: you mean you don't even know if you changed your system in some way?

[07:20] <LacunaV> Can anyone vouch for udev 103

[07:24] <ArrenLex> Octarine, go to this website: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:24] <Octarine> whatever.
[07:24] <compengi> omg
[07:24] <Octarine> okays..
[07:24] <compengi> Octarine, stop
[07:24] <BSDnux> is there a package with alsaconf or do i have to build alsa again?
[07:24] <ArrenLex> Octarine: there, paste the output. It will give you a link to what you pasted.
[07:24] <MystaMax> wow my question flew by
[07:25] <ArrenLex> Octarine: paste THAT LINK here.
[07:25] <wsoderberg> yea they seem to do so mysta :P
[07:25] <ArrenLex> Octarine: That is how pastebin works. It is a "bin" which keeps "pastes" and returns links at which these pastes may be viewed by those who care to view them.
[07:25] <David777> Anywayz, is the Ubuntu version of Apache2 SSL enabled?
[07:25] <winand> so my question is, how do you get ~ to expand to "/home/winand"
[07:26] <MystaMax> David777, i dont think so, you'll have to install seperately
[07:26] <Octarine> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35614/
[07:26] <Octarine> there.
[07:26] <MystaMax> woohoo he got it
[07:26] <Octarine> =D
[07:26] <David777> winand: I think you have to pass the --no-tilde option to ls
[07:26] <xzk> I have a membership to scrybe, and for some reason it tells me I need to install Adobe .. i thought i already did with automatix and easy ubuntu
[07:26] <gpd> how can i 'attach' to a running X11 destop? tightvncserver creates a new display at :1
[07:26] <xzk> how do i install adobe
[07:26] <justincredible> Anyone here successfully configured an integrated bluetooth device?
[07:26] <David777> winand: ...or is it bash?
[07:26] <vcef> is it safe to use option "Use register arguments" if I am going to use nvidia binary driver?
[07:26] <winand> David777: in C++
[07:26] <ArrenLex> xzk: Similar to the way you download the internet.
[07:26] <MystaMax> justincredible, I've also tried w/ no success
[07:26] <ArrenLex> xzk: Adobe is a company. Are you looking for a specific product?
[07:26] <xzk> ArrenLex:   lmao
[07:26] <Saviq> can anyone help me get the Tao OpenGL Framework to work?
[07:27] <xzk> ArrenLex:   yeh my fault hahaha
[07:27] <fwap> is there any way for 'drm' to end up in 'restricted' apps for ubuntu?
[07:27] <winand> David777: ifstream pidfile("~/.app/.pidlock");
[07:27] <Octarine> ArrenLex: V
[07:27] <David777> winand: What function call is returning "~"?
[07:27] <Octarine> ArrenLex http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35614/
[07:27] <justincredible> My laptop is suppose to be supported, but the OBEX client in KDE doesn't scan for devices
[07:27] <xzk> i need adobe flash player 8
[07:27] <justincredible> *9
[07:27] <crimsun> sorry, 8 doesn't exist for Linux.
[07:27] <winand> David777: If another user runs it I want to get the home user dir
[07:27] <David777> winand: I think the "~"
[07:27] <xzk> well balls.
[07:27] <ArrenLex> Octarine: I saw. Okay, so ubuntu is on the secnd drive. Can you tell me what the first partition on the second drive contains?
[07:27] <MystaMax> is edgy eft support in ubuntu+1 these days?
[07:27] <xzk> what do i do
[07:28] <tundejeg> hi
[07:28] <jrib> xzk: use 9?
[07:28] <ArrenLex> MystaMax: No. Edgy is released and edgy is here.
[07:28] <apokryphos> MystaMax: no, edgy is current stable
[07:28] <xzk> i can't use scrybe with Linux ?
[07:28] <sp00n3d> can someone help me? I've wasted 6 discs so far trying to burn this damned iso.
[07:28] <MystaMax> thanks ArrenLex and apokryphos
[07:28] <ArrenLex> xzk: Adobe Flash 9 beta can be downloaded from labs.adobe.com
[07:28] <Octarine> Just Data from windows
[07:28] <xzk> i knew that.. just testing you
[07:28] <tundejeg> hi everybody
[07:28] <xzk> i'm an idiot
[07:28] <crimsun> ArrenLex: (and is available in -backports)
[07:28] <justincredible> MystaMax, what type of bluetooth device is integrated on your computer?
[07:28] <tundejeg> can someone bail me out of a problem
[07:28] <sp00n3d> is my problem atypical or common?
[07:29] <David777> winand: "~" is specific to bash
[07:29] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Okay. Now please pastebin your entire /boot/grub/menu.lst file
[07:29] <MystaMax> justincredible, my laptop is able to find bluetooth devices, but I haven't been able to transfer files or use the A2DP profile
[07:29] <Octarine> righto
[07:29] <winand> David777: ok I will try #c++
[07:29] <Octarine> ah..
[07:29] <tundejeg> i want to install oracle 10g enterprise on my ubuntu
[07:29] <justincredible> mystamax, what type of laptop to youown?
[07:29] <ArrenLex> sp00n3d: And what happened when you tried to burn this ISO?
[07:29] <ArrenLex> Octarine: hold on, no, wait.
[07:29] <Octarine> ArrenLex: I get 'No such file or directory'
[07:29] <sp00n3d> write errors.
[07:29] <tundejeg> but i could not get enterprise edition
[07:29] <ArrenLex> Octarine: It's not that easy. I forgot you were on a LiveCD.
[07:30] <ArrenLex> Octarine: open a terminal and run the command "mkdir /target"
[07:30] <Octarine> okay
[07:30] <sp00n3d> i even went out and bought new discs.
[07:30] <sp00n3d> i've tried nero and alcoholsoft...
[07:30] <apokryphos> sp00n3d: rewritables are really good if you're thinking of running Linux distributions
[07:30] <ArrenLex> sp00n3d: Access to any other CD drives? Your drive might be bad.
[07:30] <Octarine> ArrenLex: Permission denied, apparently
[07:30] <allee> justincredible: My AVN ISDN modem playes nicely together with Dell's build in bluetooth.  My MS mouse working before always disconnects when going into sleep (not search why it happes)
[07:30] <ArrenLex> Octarine: "sudo mkdir /target" then
[07:30] <Octarine> k
[07:30] <sp00n3d> eh i was hoping it wasn't the hardware
[07:30] <MystaMax> justincredible, I also didnt spend alot of time on it. But my Dell D620 (dapper install) w/ integrated bluetooth found my phone, both my bluetooth stereo headphones, my cellphone bluetooth headsets. basically it found them all, but i can't use them for anything
[07:30] <tundejeg> its only express edition
[07:30] <tundejeg> i hope
[07:30] <sp00n3d> maybe i will run out and get some rewritables
[07:30] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Then run "sudo mount /dev/hdb2 /target"
[07:31] <Octarine> ArrenLex: its done that..
[07:31] <tundejeg> if i install express edition
[07:31] <sp00n3d> i just wondered what you guys used to burn your isos
[07:31] <Octarine> ArrenLex: not displayed anything though
[07:31] <sp00n3d> what programs
[07:31] <ArrenLex> Octarine: It shouldn't. Run the mount command and tell me when you've done
[07:31] <allee> MystaMax: ah, D620.  You have intel gfx in it?
[07:31] <tundejeg> it will perform all the functionality of the express edition
[07:31] <jerp> k3b is a good burner
[07:31] <sindrum> i used nero
[07:31] <Halcy0n> sp00n3d: I personally use K3B for everything
[07:31] <MystaMax> allee, nope I have nvidia 5600
[07:31] <justincredible> mystamax, So your dell worked out of the box with bluetooth (Not worked, but atleast turned on)?
[07:31] <sindrum> for win or linux?
[07:31] <ArrenLex> sp00n3d: I used k3b. I haven't run Windows in several years :)
[07:31] <haxality> I'm having a bizarre problem with NFS!
[07:31] <Octarine> ArrenLex: Done
[07:31] <allee> MystaMax: k
[07:31] <tundejeg> hi halcyo
[07:31] <sp00n3d> k3b is linux based?
[07:31] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Now run "sudo chroot /target"
[07:32] <ArrenLex> sp00n3d: Yes
[07:32] <MystaMax> justincredible, no i installed some packages
[07:32] <haxality> I've followed a bunch of walkthroughs but I can't get NFS working
[07:32] <sp00n3d> crap...
[07:32] <MystaMax> justincredible, from the repositories
[07:32] <ArrenLex> sp00n3d: Again: do you have access to other CD burners?
[07:32] <haxality> I keep getting 'permission denied' errors from the NFS server
[07:32] <justincredible> mystamax, which ones?
[07:32] <sp00n3d> no i don't
[07:32] <sindrum> im a pirate so no need not to use it
[07:32] <sindrum> lol
[07:32] <sp00n3d> i may just go ahead and buy another one
[07:32] <sp00n3d> install it
[07:32] <MystaMax> hmm, i'll have to reboot to check, give me 5 minutes
[07:32] <Octarine> ArrenLex: 'Cannot run command /bin/bash' No such directory'
[07:32] <benny99> hello, problems with my Radeon 9600 graphics card... I get less than 1 fps after playing about 2min, probably when it needs new textures... I'm using fglrx, A N Y ! ideas are welcome!!
[07:32] <justincredible> mk
[07:33] <ArrenLex> Octarine: ...That's very odd.
[07:33] <sp00n3d> i've already wasted 2 hours just trying to burn it ... i think the linux gods are testing me.
[07:33] <ArrenLex> Octarine: please pastebin the commands you've run up to this point, starting from the mkdir command.
[07:33] <tundejeg> hi
[07:33] <ArrenLex> sp00n3d: You can always install from a USB stick or floppy if you're desperate.
[07:33] <tundejeg> can some one help
[07:33] <HumanPrototype> wow! has anybody tried installing beryl, turning on the wobbly windows plugin and running cat /dev/urandom from a terminal?
[07:33] <ArrenLex> !someone | tundejeg
[07:33] <ubotu> tundejeg: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[07:34] <haxality> can anyone help?
[07:34] <benny99> it works properly under windows, no dmesgS
[07:34] <SpaceBass> can anyone help me with my install issue?
[07:34] <ArrenLex> XD WOW
[07:34] <tundejeg> yes arrenlex
[07:34] <SpaceBass> i keep getting grub error 2 on first boot
[07:34] <David777> winand: You should getenv("HOME")
[07:34] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, whats the issue?
[07:34] <tundejeg> pls
[07:34] <cmt^^> ArrenLex - I'm having problems getting glx and / or ati drivers working
[07:34] <sp00n3d> yeah not that desperate. i'll just upgrade my ram and cd-r drive. been needing to.
[07:34] <Octarine> ArrenLex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35618/
[07:34] <tundejeg> i want to install oracle 10g
[07:34] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: "problems" is very vague.
[07:34] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, what is your hdd setup, are you dual booting, do you have a sperate /boot partition?
[07:34] <tundejeg> on my ubuntu
[07:34] <tundejeg> linux
[07:35] <benny99> again, any!! ideas are welcome... the drivers should be installed correctly
[07:35] <cmt^^> ArrenLex - i have the following errormessage that haunts me: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[07:35] <tundejeg> but i dont see an enterprise edition for ubuntu
[07:35] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, 5 drives...all on pci controller cards...1 200gb (first drive) for the sytem...rest are part of a raid 5 software array
[07:35] <tundejeg> on the net
[07:35] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Well, yeah. You can't expecute parts of commands and expect them to do the same thing. xD
[07:35] <justincredible> ahh hcitool scan doesnt work!
[07:35] <SpaceBass> installing to the 200gb drive (hda)
[07:35] <tundejeg> i only saw express edition
[07:35] <ArrenLex> Octarine: I said: Then run "sudo mount /dev/hdb2 /target"
[07:35] <ArrenLex> Octarine: And you run just "mount".
[07:35] <tundejeg> my question now
[07:35] <Octarine> ohhhh.
[07:35] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Run the full command please.
[07:35] <Octarine> :D
[07:35] <Octarine> will do
[07:35] <jerp> HumanPrototype, what happens with beryl when you do that?
[07:35] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, wow - impressive! how come you cant put the 200gb drive on the mobo?
[07:36] <Octarine> ArrenLex: Done that
[07:36] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: Then enable the DRI extension in xorg.conf
[07:36] <HumanPrototype> jerp, it makes the window dance like crazy - amusing to watch
[07:36] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, the onboard ide controller is shot
[07:36] <ArrenLex> Octarine: now run sudo chroot /target
[07:36] <sindrum> benny gimmi a sec
[07:36] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, ah, sucky
[07:36] <tundejeg> is that if i install dat express i hope it will perform the functionalities of that of enterprise edition
[07:36] <rubix_> what totem plugin do i need for dvd's
[07:36] <ArrenLex> Octarine: I brb for a moment.
[07:36] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, ok then did it install ok and just wont reboot?
[07:36] <Octarine> ArrenLex: Okay then
[07:36] <sindrum> nm
[07:36] <tundejeg> Arrenlex
[07:36] <tundejeg> i will be waiting 4 u
[07:36] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, yep...installer insists on putting grub on hd0 ...which doesnt exist as far as I know
[07:37] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, thats just the first hard drive
[07:37] <sp00n3d> i just had a big scare... had to look at bank balance and forgot about a 675$ check i wrote. thinking my bad day just got worser.
[07:37] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, wonder which one it thinks is first
[07:37] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, and it should be (hd0,0) to be the first partition
[07:37] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, how can i see which drives grub calls what
[07:37] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, think it would be hda
[07:37] <David777> winand: This program will get the user's home directory: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35621/
[07:37] <SpaceBass> tried hda in setup and when it came time to install grub it errored out and quit the installer
[07:38] <HumanPrototype> can anybody confirm that grub (hd0,0) will always be the same as /dev/hda1
[07:38] <rubix_> SpaceBass, are you having install problems
[07:38] <SpaceBass> rubix_,  yeah
[07:38] <David777> HumanPrototype: I think that's only true if your system only has IDE drives
[07:38] <SpaceBass> my 200gb drive is technically my first ide drive
[07:38] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Okay. Have you run the chroot command?
[07:38] <HumanPrototype> David777, ok, thanks
[07:38] <Octarine> ArrenLex:yes
[07:39] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, do you have any non-ide drives (scsi, sata etc?)
[07:39] <SpaceBass> yeah
[07:39] <cj> I need a picture of Feisty Fawn to put on my fridge for my daughter.  do we have one?
[07:39] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Now run "cat /boot/grub/menu.lst" which will output the contents of that file. Pastebin these contents.
[07:39] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, then (hd0,0) may be the first of those drives
[07:39] <HumanPrototype> can you look in the bios and see if that gives u the hdd order?
[07:40] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, is it hardware raid?
[07:40] <VincentHall> hi there
[07:40] <Octarine> ArrenLex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35622/
[07:40] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, no, software raid...md0 using reiserfs
[07:40] <rubix_> SpaceBass, just one moment...i have a guide that might help you
[07:40] <rubix_> SpaceBass, well actually, try to go into the installer, kill the gdm and then use xinit from the console
[07:40] <MystaMax> justincredible, I've got gnome-bluetooth, bluez-utils, bluez-pin, bluez-pcmcia-support, and bluez-cups installed.
[07:41] <rubix_> then run ubiquity from the commandline in basic x
[07:41] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype,part of the problem is that since they are on controller cards the bios doesnt see them
[07:41] <SpaceBass> or list them
[07:41] <SpaceBass> what will xinit do ?
[07:41] <alberto> hi to all, sorry i have a big prob with ubu 6.10 i386 since i removed an sd and a usb pendrive without the unmount : they are no more recognized and mounted (after a reboot too): with the last 2 ubuntu restart i receive an "failed to initialize HAL!" message.. ani idea where to find any info o suggestion??    sorry the long message
[07:41] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, ok...take it back..Bios lists my 200gb drive (hda) as the first in the list
[07:41] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, you could try using the install disk as a rescue disk to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to try each hd in turn (hd0,0) (hd1,0) etc
[07:42] <MystaMax> justincredible, So now under System -> Preferences I have Bluetooth Manager which can scan for my bluetooth devices. It'll find lots when I'm @ work, b/c all computers have bluetooth
[07:42] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Strange... everything looks alright. Fine, now run "update-grub".
[07:42] <keeb_>  i want to scp my id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys on remote
[07:42] <keeb_>                machine, but don't want it to overwrite previous entries
[07:42] <keeb_> using scp, any ideas?
[07:42] <David777> alberto: What does dmesg say about the problem?
[07:43] <joey-> hello
[07:43] <justincredible> MystaMax, are you using gnome or kde?
[07:43] <hou5ton_> I accidentally downloaded and installed the wrong version of EasyUbuntu. How do I unistall it?
[07:43] <rubix_> SpaceBass, exactly what problem are you having?
[07:43] <rubix_> hou5ton, just change your reps and apt-get update-distro
[07:43] <ArrenLex> Octarine: Done?
[07:43] <alberto> ty david dmseg seems to be ok about the pendrive
[07:43] <SpaceBass> rubix_, installed to hda ... grub on hd0 (as per installer)...trying for first boot and I get grub error 2
[07:44] <ArrenLex> Oh, he's gone. xD
[07:44] <hou5ton_> rubix_:   that will "Unistall" the wrong one?
[07:44] <MystaMax> justincredible, Im using gnome. I just realized that I'm also using libbluetooth1, libbluetooh1-dev, libbtctl2-dev, libgnomebt0-dev, and python2.4-libbtctl
[07:44] <ArrenLex> Well, less work for me, I guess...
[07:44] <MystaMax> justincredible, I don't know much about KDE, sorry.
[07:45] <Przemek3> witam
[07:45] <alberto> the devices are recognized too with the hal-device-manager active : i see the connect and disconnect log (for both sd and usb)
[07:45] <justincredible> That's alright. I'm playing with the commands and it seems like it can't even find my bluetooth interface
[07:45] <justincredible> which would explain why it can't scan
[07:45] <arnor> hello all
[07:45] <ArrenLex> !hi

=== joey- is now known as homecable
[07:46] <MystaMax> justincredible, yea i didnt do much to get it working. I found a thread on the forums explaining what the bluetooth manager was. So I installed it, and it started to scan. not much work involved, it just worked.
[07:47] <arnor> does anyone know how to fix APT database?
[07:47] <HumanPrototype> arnor, ubotu is a bot that responds to stuff it knows about - ask it about something by saying ubotu: <something> or !<something>
[07:47] <justincredible> mystamax, I wish it was that easy :(
[07:47] <ArrenLex> arnor: "fix" it? How is it broken?
[07:47] <arnor> HumanPrototype: I guessed
[07:47] <arnor> ;)
[07:47] <HumanPrototype> arnor, gdgd :)
[07:47] <freight> hello?
[07:47] <ArrenLex> arnor: Sure you did, AFTER you said hi to it ;)

[07:48] <justincredible> mystamax, do you know if you could ndiswrapper the windows driver for the bluetooth to the kernel?
[07:48] <arnor> !apt

[07:48] <HumanPrototype> does anybody know of a place i can a load of programs to write to practice my basic skills?
[07:49] <justincredible> or is ndiswrapper for just wireless cards?
[07:49] <zainka> Hi... where can I get a reliable archieve/unpacker tool which can take rpm packages??? The default one (archieve manager) in Ubuntu (6,06) wont recon it...
[07:49] <homecable> any one use the server iso ?
[07:49] <MystaMax> For those that use WiFi to access the internet, what packages do you use to manage your WiFi?
[07:49] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, using the live CD how can I mount hda to look at /boot?
[07:49] <cmt^^> ArrenLex - I have this in my DRI section: Mode 0666
[07:50] <cmt^^> ArrenLex - what am I supposed to have?
[07:50] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: That is correct, but are you even loading the DRI module?
[07:50] <freight> who used "manual" ubuntu install with light apps?
[07:50] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, cd /mnt && sudo mkdir hda1 && sudo mount /dev/hda1 hda1
[07:50] <cmt^^> I don't know
[07:50] <cmt^^> :)
[07:50] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: Make sure "dri" is in your extensions.
[07:50] <justincredible> mystamax, I dont currently use ndiswrapper for wireless utilities, but I am familiar with using it
[07:50] <cmt^^> How?
[07:51] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, that changes to /media , creates a dir and mounts /dev/hda1 on that dir
[07:51] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, tried...says no entry in fstab...which I cannot edit b/c the CD is readonly
[07:51] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: pastebin your conf file please.
[07:51] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, then yuo need to give a place to mount it on
[07:51] <HumanPrototype> like i added the hda1 on the end (which is the name of the dir i created"
[07:51] <SpaceBass> hummmm
[07:52] <cmt^^> ArrenLex - http://pastebin.se/4803
[07:52] <MystaMax> justincredible, right now I only can connect to my home wireless network, b/c I altered a txt file, isn't there a GUI to add/remove SSIDs and setup WPA or WEP
[07:52] <SpaceBass> i just dont understand they underlaying issue...why is this so hard to install
[07:52] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, in the live cd try sudo grub-install /dev/hda
[07:52] <justincredible> mystamax, have you tried editing the interfaces file or setting up wpa_supplicant?
[07:53] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: You are. Hmm...
[07:53] <ArrenLex> cmt^^: Dunno; I have to go, sorry. xD
[07:53] <cmt^^> Wtf? :(
[07:53] <HumanPrototype> SpaceBass, then you know its on /dev/hda
[07:53] <SpaceBass> HumanPrototype, tried that before but not with sudo...with sudo i get an error that it could not find device for /boot

[07:54] <rubix_> what is bluetooth
[07:54] <cmt^^> Can anyone else look at my xorg.conf and maybe give me a hint to what's wrong?

[07:56] <Dheeraj_k> hi can any body tell me wat is the name of default ubuntu theme?
[07:56] <SpaceBass> i give up....I'm pretty sure this box wasn't ever meant to run ubutnt
[07:56] <SpaceBass> s/ubutnt/ubuntu
[07:56] <MystaMax> justincredible, but i do see a wpa_supplicant folder in etc
[07:57] <oripi> human ?
[07:57] <justincredible> mystamax, Ok. So what are you looking to do? Use a GUI to connect to different networks or to setup WPA support?
[07:57] <v3rtigo_> what file have all modules that load on boot time?
[07:57] <nofearrr> !ispconfig
[07:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ispconfig - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:57] <MystaMax> justincredible, A GUI to manage different WiFi networks, and I'll worry about WPA later. Sorry if it seems confusing
[07:57] <nofearrr> !dvb card
[07:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dvb card - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:57] <Dheeraj_k> is it available on ubuntu's repo? i am on edubuntu
[07:58] <dave_> got a weird problem, not a huge deal but kind of annoying, every once in awhile when i log in to gnome, it opens up like 4-5 windows of my home folder
[07:58] <dave_> anyone know what thats all about?
[07:59] <justincredible> mystamax, do you have wlassistant?

[07:59] <zainka> HI.. again.. How can I unpack rpm packages in Ubuntu?? Archieve manager wont recon the package. I can download a tgz package also for sae program but only the source and then I have to recompile it and my scills is relative dull, also It seems like I have to install xserver before ./configure will succede, and as far as I know I need to downloade and install the whole debiane CD image to make this happen on my computer, so.... please, since I have the optio
[07:59] <rambo3> dave_, take a look at session
[07:59] <HumanPrototype> i try and run make sense and it just gives me errors
[07:59] <MystaMax> justincredible, no i dont. its in the repositories?
[07:59] <justincredible> yep
[07:59] <Dheeraj_k> is human-ubuntu theme available on repo?
[07:59] <justincredible> just apt-get it
[08:00] <MystaMax> justincredible, thanks will do.
[08:00] <HumanPrototype> zainka, what were you hoping to do with the rpm?
[08:00] <Dheeraj_k> any 1?
[08:00] <alberto> >	hi to all, sorry i have a big prob with ubu 6.10 i386 since i removed an sd and a usb pendrive without the unmount : they are no more recognized and mounted (after a reboot too): with the last 2 ubuntu restart i receive an "failed to initialize HAL!" message.. ani idea where to find any info o suggestion?? sorry the long message
[08:00] <dave_> startup programs are update-notifier /usr/lib/evolution/2.8/evolution-alarm-notify, gnome-pwoermanager and gnome volume manager
[08:00] <alberto> or any idea to begin a troubleshoot
[08:00] <justincredible> mystamax, That's just another GUI tool. It may or may not work. I have had problems using GUI's to work correctly with my ipw2100 wireless device
[08:01] <dope> for some reason i have two copies of the icons in the top right of my screen
[08:01] <dope> but one is slightly moved to the left so i see two sets over each other
[08:01] <dope> how do i get rid of that
[08:01] <Dheeraj_k>  is human-ubuntu theme available on repo?
[08:01] <zainka> HumanPrototype, The rpm includes installation files for ubuntu, and no need for recompiling, by some means I dont know why, the tgz packages only includes source to be compiled, thats what I need rpm for
[08:02] <v3rtigo_> how can i remove modules that load on boot time by defualt on edgy?/
[08:02] <DaSkreech> !info camorama

[08:02] <MystaMax> justincredible, thats good to know. If I want to use WPA down the road should I use another app? I thought I came across a fedora core developed app for managing wifi networks.
[08:02] <Dheeraj_k>  is human-ubuntu theme available on repo?
[08:02] <crimsun> Dheeraj_k: yes
[08:02] <crimsun> (wasn't this answered already in #edubuntu?)
[08:03] <HumanPrototype> zainka, as far as i know the default file-roller program on ubuntu supports rpms so you could try that or convert the rpm to a deb with alien
[08:03] <Dheeraj_k> crimsun: how can i get that?
[08:03] <crimsun> Dheeraj_k: laserjock just told you.
[08:03] <Adium> hid3, how do i stop edgy putting my laptop on standby when i close the laptop lid
[08:04] <justincredible> mystamax, For WPA, you want to look into an application called WPA_Supplicant. I ran across it a few times but my card doesn't support wpa so I didn't look into it.
[08:04] <Adium> this never happened with previous releases
[08:04] <Adium> hi*
[08:04] <dave_> dont close your laptop lid
[08:04] <Adium> got kids i need to :)
[08:04] <MystaMax> justincredible, ok Thanks. I found the redhat developed app called NetworkManager that does the same thing. I wonder what most ubuntu users use.
[08:04] <dave_> ahhh QUICK HIDE THE PORN
[08:05] <Dheeraj_k> crimsun: where?
[08:05] <MystaMax> justincredible, link: http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/
[08:05] <crimsun> Dheeraj_k: < LaserJock> if you have installed ubuntu-artwork you have it
[08:05] <Dheeraj_k> crimsun: but it is not in list :(
[08:06] <justincredible> mystamax, Thanks
[08:06] <zainka> HumanPrototype,  ... 'file-roller' ? Ill go look for it, thanx ... Ill hope Ill clever enough to find it :)
[08:06] <Cyde> I have a nice little error going on.  I just loaded my MySQL backups from a Gentoo system and now I get errors when starting MySQL because I overwrote the users table.  What do you make of this?  /usr/bin/mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed

[08:06] <hou5ton_> I accidentally installed the wrong version of EasyUbuntu, and would like to unistall it. It is not listed in Synaptic. Can I just do somethikng like; sudo apt-get remover easyubuntu?
[08:07] <Dheeraj_k> crimsun: is it possible to get it through apt? if yes than wat i need to type?
[08:07] <crimsun> Dheeraj_k: apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-artwork
[08:08] <crimsun> Dheeraj_k: hmm, are you doing this on an edgy install?
[08:08] <Dheeraj_k> crimsun: i am on dapper
[08:08] <dr0ck> is it possible to install gnome 2.16.1 on Dapper Drake ?

[08:09] <HumanPrototype> zainka, its in the repos
[08:10] <cmt^^> I need to find someone who has actually gotten their ATI-graphics card to work with Ubuntu. Please contact me or highlight me in this channel so that I can learn how you worked through the problems
[08:10] <hou5ton_> Adium:   System >> Preferences >> Power Management
[08:10] <Adium> tryed it still does it :(
[08:11] <nothlit> dr0ck, there are tons of dependencies that would be required, you should upgrade to edgy if you want a newer version of gnome
[08:11] <hou5ton_> is there some command in Ubuntu, sort of like the "pretend" command in Gentoo, where I can see what would happen before I actually do something?
[08:11] <MystaMax> cmt^^, what issues are you having so we can all see it.
[08:11] <dr0ck> nothilt: thx
[08:11] <zainka> HumanPrototype, It seems like wath I reffere to as beeing "archieve manager" and what you call "file-roller" is the very same thingy... Any alternatives I can install from some where or are there any add-ons to file-roller making it capable to extract rpm's?? alien seems not to be a part of my system, yet (command unknown) so an advice for where to get it would be nice,,, if any alternatives for file-roller cant be given.. Thanx
[08:12] <scheelings> hello all
[08:13] <cmt^^> MystaMax - my error: http://pastebin.se/4807 - and here is my xorg.conf: http://pastebin.se/4803

[08:15] <unimatrix9> ok
[08:15] <mypapit> apokryphos, zainka thanks
[08:15] <v3rtigo_> How do i remove modules that load on boot time by defualt?
[08:16] <hou5ton_> I'm looking online for directions on how to use apt-get to remove an application....  anyone have a link or know the answer?
[08:17] <robban_> hou5ton_: apt-get remove application
[08:18] <hou5ton_> robban_:   thanks ... just found some info  ... would I want to maybe to apt-get --purge remove packagename ... to also get the config files?
[08:18] <hou5ton_> robban_:   or I see there is also apt-get autoremove packagename, that also gets the dependencies?
[08:19] <zainka> any alternatives for file-roller???
[08:19] <hou5ton_> Also ...  I keep getting mixed reviews on Automatrix2 .... I'm open to more opinions?
[08:20] <LjL> !automatix
[08:20] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
=== Luci3n_ is now known as Luci3n
[08:20] <LjL> hou5ton_: that *is* intended to remove unused dependencies. i don't think you should add a package name, just "apt-get autoremove"
[08:20] <LjL> though i haven't tried with a package name, might work as well
[08:21] <hou5ton_> LjL:   I have to add the packagename, ... I'm wanting to uninstall a package ... I accidentlly downloaded the wrong version of EasyUbunut
[08:22] <LjL> hou5ton_: right, it works with a package name too
[08:23] <hou5ton_> LjL:   I guess I just want to be sure that autoremove knows to ONLY take dependencies that aren't used by anything else?
[08:23] <LjL> hou5ton_: it's most defitely supposed to behave like that
[08:23] <cmt^^> dave_ - u here?
[08:24] <hou5ton_> LjL:   great .... i'll give it a try right now
[08:24] <dave_> yeah
[08:24] <cmt^^> dave_ - what model and make do you have?

[08:32] <kuzmaster> cyde: no its not, this is only for the network
[08:32] <aG`Whitey_rG> hello
[08:32] <aG`Whitey_rG> i got a question
[08:32] <unimatrix9> #title		Ubuntu, memtest86+r #root		(hd1,0)
[08:32] <Cyde> kuzmaster: So you're sure it's firewalled off from the outside world?
[08:32] <aG`Whitey_rG> is ubuntu not making dvd images anymore?
[08:32] <unimatrix9> yes?
[08:32] <compengi> i have a problem with running k3b it says http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35632/
[08:33] <dave_> should be #title  #root #kernel #etc #etc  #boot
[08:33] <unimatrix9> ok thnx
[08:33] <SliMM> can i install xubuntu without ereasing the data on a partition?
[08:33] <apokryphos> compengi: have you been launching GUI programs with sudo?
[08:34] <kuzmaster> cyde: im 100% sure
[08:34] <compengi> apokryphos, what do you mean
[08:34] <mordof> alright, my friend made a program and wants me to compile install it, he asked me what my include dir is, how do i check that?
[08:34] <aG`Whitey_rG> is there a dvd release of ubuntu?
[08:34] <Cyde> kuzmaster: Okay, then maybe it's an okay idea if you really trust your devs.  I just don't have any experience with proftpd, sorry :-(
[08:34] <apokryphos> compengi: did you start any Graphical programs (specifically k3b) with sudo?
[08:34] <apokryphos> compengi: because, well, it looks like you did.
[08:34] <SliMM> there is a cd release of ubuntu
[08:34] <apokryphos> !kdesu | compengi
[08:34] <ubotu> compengi: In KDE, use kdesu to run graphical applications with root priveleges when you have to. Do *not* do sudo {GUIAPP}; you can muck up your permissions/config files. For what to use in GNOME, see !gksudo
[08:34] <kuzmaster> cyde: im the only one that KNOWS how to access it
[08:34] <carzzz215> is it bad to start GUI programs with sudo?
[08:34] <aG`Whitey_rG> there used to be a dvd, is there only a cd now?
[08:35] <linkrjh> My guess is no DVD release, as I do not see any on their website for download.
[08:35] <apokryphos> carzzz215: yes, you shouldn't.
[08:35] <Cyde> kuzmaster: Security through obscurity?
[08:35] <unimatrix9> reboot
[08:35] <compengi> apokryphos, i've just downloaded k3b and trying to run it =/
[08:35] <Cyde> kuzmaster: If you're going to be the only one using it, why not just use WinSCP or something like it?
[08:35] <apokryphos> compengi: as root? Or with sudo?
[08:35] <compengi> by clicking on the icon
[08:35] <compengi> apokryphos, in the applications list
[08:35] <apokryphos> compengi: actually, it might well have not been k3b
[08:35] <jerp> carld, I've heard that gksudo is the better option to use when root privs are required
[08:35] <carzzz215> why? and what if you need root privileges to run a GUI program?
[08:35] <Cyde> kuzmaster: That's what I use for the kinds of situations you're describing.  It doesn't need a separate server either ... it works right through sshd using ssh as a secure tunnel.
[08:36] <apokryphos> compengi: but at some other time you started a graphical app with sudo, and hence mucked up (i) permissions in ~/.kde and (ii) your DCOP sockets
[08:36] <jerp> carzzz215, I've heard that gksudo is the better option to use when root privs are required
[08:36] <kuzmaster> cyde: hmmmmmmm.......... ill look into it
[08:36] <Zaggynl> Hi, I'm looking for alternatives to Filemon and Netlimiter, are there any of those?
[08:36] <compengi> apokryphos, when it didn't run i tried to run it from the terminal by typing only k3b
[08:36] <compengi> and it gave me this result
[08:36] <Cyde> kuzmaster: You've used scp before, right?
[08:37] <kuzmaster> cyde: nope
[08:37] <carzzz215> interesting...what is the difference between sudo and gksudo?
[08:37] <Cyde> kuzmaster: I haven't bothered with ftp in many years now because it's yet another service that opens holes and isn't necessary.
[08:37] <apokryphos> compengi: like I said, then you started another graphical app with sudo before. Which you shouldn't have done.
[08:37] <Cyde> kuzmaster: scp is a command-line tool to securely copy files between remote locations and local locations.
[08:37] <Cyde> kuzmaster: It uses SSH as a tunnel.
[08:37] <compengi> apokryphos, so what should i do?
[08:37] <Cyde> kuzmaster: Various GUIs for scp exist, like WinSCP, that provide an FTP-alike interface.
[08:37] <apokryphos> compengi: never do it again :P. See the ubotu factoid. But for now, try changes all your home permissions
[08:37] <kuzmaster> cyde: hmmmmmmmmm.......... sounds good....... im downloading WinSCP now
[08:38] <Cyde> kuzmaster: It's very good, you'll like it.
[08:38] <apokryphos> compengi: sudo chown -R compengi:compengi /home/compengi
[08:38] <skold> hi im running beryl svn on ubuntu edgy. Beryl runs fine on gnome, but wont start on KDE but i don't know why could you help me?
[08:38] <kuzmaster> grrrrrrrrrrrrr
[08:38] <kuzmaster>  is source forge down for anyone?
[08:39] <compengi> apokryphos, oh i made gksudo to open .sh file and edit it that what i done with sudo =/
[08:39] <apokryphos> compengi: no, it looks like you definitely used sudo directly
[08:39] <kuzmaster> i cant get tohttp://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/
[08:39] <apokryphos> compengi: opening an .sh with root perms would never have given you that result
[08:39] <compengi> apokryphos, but it
[08:39] <compengi> apokryphos, but it's all what i have done with sudo command =/
[08:40] <apokryphos> compengi: the terminal says otherwise :)(
[08:40] <carzzz215> interesting...what is the difference between sudo and gksudo?
[08:40] <Cyde> kuzmaster: scp is good and simple when using it with people you trust because it just uses normal ssh accounts, e.g. your system accounts.  It doesn't replace a real ftp server because it doesn't have its own accounts ... so to make another account for someone to access scp with you have to make another system account.  You can set its shell to scp-only or whatever, but for a large number of different users, scp doesn't really make sense.
[08:40] <compengi> apokryphos, anyway after changing permissions will everything be fine?
[08:40] <Cyde> kuzmaster: But if it's just for you, scp makes perfect sense.
[08:40] <apokryphos> compengi: hopefully, unless dcop sockets in /tmp are mucked up too. We'll find out though
[08:40] <apokryphos> compengi: for kde apps just use kdesu in the future
[08:41] <compengi> apokryphos, then how to find out that everything is fine now?
[08:41] <compengi> and i have nothing to worry about :)
[08:42] <apokryphos> compengi: start k3b up again
[08:42] <jerp> gksudo is recommended when a graphical item is called up
[08:42] <compengi> apokryphos, i did and it's running
[08:43] <compengi> apokryphos, so conclusion everything is fine now :)
[08:43] <stoorty_> is there anything i can do to my gfx card in ubuntu that will make it require less power when im running on a battery?
[08:43] <stoorty_> apart from underclock it

[08:43] <ubotu> carzzz215: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[08:43] <Murchadh> !kdesu v sudo
[08:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kdesu v sudo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:44] <Murchadh> !kdesu
[08:44] <ubotu> In KDE, use kdesu to run graphical applications with root priveleges when you have to. Do *not* do sudo {GUIAPP}; you can muck up your permissions/config files. For what to use in GNOME, see !gksudo
[08:44] <apokryphos> carzzz215: gksudo sets up the environment more properly for graphical running
[08:44] <apokryphos> sets different environment variables, etc
[08:44] <ahaller> hi. i have an intel core 2 duo chip. which cd release shout i install, the "Intel x86" or the "64-bit PC" release?
[08:45] <kuzmaster> ahaller: use the intel x86 version
[08:45] <kuzmaster> ahaller: its supported more
[08:45] <Murchadh> apokryphos, Is there a readme on the implications of using sudo instead?
[08:45] <ahaller> ok, i will
[08:46] <countervirus> im stoked i have a version of kubuntu with beryl running off my thumb drive
[08:46] <carzzz215> has any one had any problems with the "suspend" feature in Ubuntu?  I'm running ubuntu on a laptop. SOmetimes Suspend works, and other times it doesnt
[08:46] <apokryphos> Murchadh: maybe, try Google. Basically what happens, often with KDE programs, is that sudo (root) will take ownership of the application running, but it'll use the user's config files
[08:47] <apokryphos> Murchadh: hence the config files are rewritten with root perms, and a new user on next trying can't access those files. Similar thing with dcop sockets
[08:47] <Murchadh> apecat,
[08:49] <Valmarko> I just installed beagle but I can't find it
[08:49] <kuzmaster> cyde: when uploading a file to the http dir, i got a permissions error
[08:49] <Murchadh> apokryphos, Thanks! Been meaning to nail this down for a while. Have had problems with it before.
[08:49] <kuzmaster> so, do i need to change the chroot stuff to 777 for /var/www?
[08:49] <bur[n] er_> anyone know if there's an app out there that will let you copy & paste to a windows remote desktop session?  not files, but just the clipboard
[08:50] <bur[n] er_> kuzmaster: nope... chown www-data:www-data
[08:50] <kuzmaster> k, than
[08:50] <kuzmaster> x
[08:50] <bur[n] er_> kuzmaster: if you use samba, you can make it so that any file you dump there takes that ownership
[08:50] <zainka> Zainka has left the rooom
[08:51] <phoenix87ta> having difficulty burning CD-R under Ubuntu Edgy.  After selecting files to be burned, I'm asked to insert a blank CD-R.  I've got one in, and it recognizes it as a blank insofar as Ubuntu is concerned, but the burning process fails to recognize it.  anyone seen anything like this, and know a fix for it?
[08:51] <kuzmaster> bur[n] er_: i might use samba, but not just now, i want to get everything going, then ill set samba up
[08:52] <kuzmaster> chown: missing operand after `www-data:www-data'
[08:52] <kuzmaster> cyde: when i did that, i got chown: missing operand after `www-data:www-data'
[08:52] <carzzz215> has any one had any problems with the "suspend" feature in Ubuntu?  I'm running ubuntu on a laptop. SOmetimes Suspend works, and other times it doesnt
[08:52] <kuzmaster> that, sorry for spamming :(
[08:52] <rogue780> carzzz215, I've never gotten suspend to work
[08:52] <stoorty_> yea carzzz215
[08:52] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, who makes the laptop?
[08:53] <rogue780> or hibernate
[08:53] <rambo3> kuzmaster, like dir ?
[08:53] <carzzz215> Mine is a gateway nx100x
[08:53] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, gateways also have notorious issues with suspend mode
[08:53] <Cyde> kuzmaster: Is the user you're logged in as in the www-data group, and are the perms on your www directory set to g+w ?
[08:53] <kuzmaster> rambo3: i did chown www-data:www-data, and i got error "missing operand after `www-data:www-data' "
[08:53] <stoorty_> happens on my HP easynote too
[08:53] <carzzz215> so when you say it suspend never works...does your screen just blank out and then nothing?
[08:54] <kuzmaster> goodness i dont know
[08:54] <rambo3> kuzmaster, sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www
[08:54] <Cyde> kuzmaster: It's chown -R www-data:www-data <insert web directory here>
[08:54] <stoorty_> mine just shows random colours
[08:54] <rogue780> well I get an error message in text mode, and I have to restart
[08:54] <kuzmaster> cyde: ahhhhhhhhhh, thanx
[08:54] <lee2> why does the root partition need to be at least 2gb, is that the actual partition ubuntu will need ?
[08:54] <kuzmaster> chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www ?
[08:54] <Cyde> kuzmaster: www-data:www-data gives the user and group name respectively, but if you don't give it stuff to work on, it won't have anything to do.
[08:54] <Cyde> kuzmaster: That should work.
[08:54] <Cyde> kuzmaster: -R is for recursive
[08:54] <carzzz215> does anyone know how i can see a "verbose" mode when i do suspend so I can see where it starts to hang?
[08:55] <kuzmaster> k
[08:55] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, how old is the n100x?
[08:55] <carzzz215> its been out about a year now
[08:55] <rogue780> does anyone know how to install unichrome pro drivers on ubuntu?
[08:55] <carzzz215> i got mine last month
[08:56] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, check support.gateway.com for known issues with that laptop
[08:56] <kuzmaster> grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[08:56] <tideline> anyone know what the si and hi percentages are in the cpu line when you run top?
[08:57] <phoenix87ta> the site should ask you for your serial number.  did you get it directly from gateway or from a retail outlet?
[08:57] <carzzz215> well actually everything works very well on this gateway...although suspend and sound problems are my only problems...although a lot of people are having the same sound problem i am having
[08:57] <assasukasse> hi all, someone could tell me how to compile this? http://ar.linux.it/software/gunzets/
[08:57] <carzzz215> directly from gateway
[08:58] <killown> linux yet has support to write in ntfs partition?
[08:58] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, then enter your serial number on the site, and it'll bring up any relevant support info for that laptop.  also, check for driver/bios updates
[08:58] <bur[n] er_> kuzmaster: chown www-data:www-data filename.html
[08:58] <carzzz215> the suspend and sound problems are only with ubuntu....i dual boot with windows and sound and suspend and fine in windows
[08:58] <bur[n] er_> killown: checkout fuse
[08:58] <bur[n] er_> !fuse
[08:58] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[08:58] <carzzz215> i should check for a bios update...good idea
[08:58] <LTjake> is /var/run purged on reboot?
[08:58] <eugman> How can I tell which codecs are illegal (U.S.A) and which are just nonfree?

[08:58] <kuzmaster> bur[n] er_: i want it for the whole dir
[08:58] <lee2> Ubuntu installer is demanding a SWAP partition, but with 2gb of ram, surely i wont need one ?
[08:59] <rogue780> can someone tell me how to add a kernel module?
[08:59] <assasukasse> rambo3 i asked the man that made it, works on xorg fine
[08:59] <carzzz215> i confused with the IRC...how do you choose my name and type to me...the text turns red
[08:59] <bur[n] er_> kuzmaster: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
[08:59] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, you mean it automatically highlights messages meant for you?
[08:59] <igge> hello
[08:59] <carzzz215> yes
[09:00] <kuzmaster> thanx, ill give it a try
[09:00] <bur[n] er_> rogue780: it depends, modprobe is the command to load a module, but if you don't have it, it won't load
[09:00] <carzzz215> you just did it again phoenix lol...how?
[09:00] <bur[n] er_> rogue780: better bet is to ask about the hardware you're trying to setup
[09:00] <igge> is there a shell command that can swap the order of windows? i.e. bring a window on top of others?
=== acez is now known as aceZ
[09:00] <w3ccv> carzzz215, name the person you are answering
[09:00] <w3ccv> not like this
[09:00] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, it's a common IRC script incorporated into most clients.  if you enter the full name of your target, followed by a comma, it'll do that
=== aceZ is now known as acez
[09:01] <bur[n] er_> igge: varies depending on your window manager
[09:01] <rambo3> assasukasse, then download read readme file , configure make install or make and insert module
[09:01] <carzzz215> phoenix87t, ok...did it work?
[09:01] <carzzz215> oops
[09:01] <rogue780> bur[n] er_, I have. I'm trying to get unichrome drivers working for unichrome pro IGP, and I downloaded the distro-nonspecific driver from via, but the instructions don't quite work with ubuntu.
[09:01] <carzzz215> phoenix87ta, ok...did it work?
[09:01] <rogue780> can someone tell me how to add a kernel module?
[09:01] <phoenix87ta> carzzz215, indeed it did
[09:01] <rogue780> does anyone know how to install unichrome pro drivers on ubuntu?
[09:01] <kuzmaster> grrrrrrrrrrr
[09:01] <igge> bur[n] er_: ok... i'm using gnome/metacity
[09:01] <kuzmaster> stupid permissions!
[09:01] <kuzmaster> its not working!
[09:01] <bur[n] er_> rogue780: wish I could, check the wiki by chance?
[09:01] <kuzmaster> !permissions
[09:01] <ubotu> The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[09:01] <rogue780> bur[n] er_, numerous times
[09:02] <carzzz215> phoenix87ta, sweet...is there any shortcut for doing that? some people have really long complex names?
[09:02] <bur[n] er_> igge: i'm not saying I know, but more to the point, your question should be about metacity's ability to do it via term
[09:02] <igge> bur[n] er_: if you know of ANY window manager where it works I can change wm just got get it to work
[09:02] <rambo3> rogue780, is driver in kernel ?
[09:02] <igge> ok
[09:02] <w3ccv> carzzz215, start the name , then hit tab - it will autocomplete, but might pick the wrong name, try a longer form
[09:02] <rogue780> rambo3, not that I know of
[09:02] <phoenix87ta> w3ccv, thanks, I didn't know that one
[09:02] <p33k4y> what is gnome-app-install ?
[09:02] <igge> anyone who knows of a way to swap the order of windows in metacity using shell commands?
[09:02] <rambo3> rogue780, then find it make it and insmod
[09:03] <p33k4y> does it use apt-get ?
[09:03] <bur[n] er_> igge: alt+tab works for me :)  sorry I don't know the term command
[09:03] <carzzz215> w3ccv, ahhh it just worked on your name...thanks :)
[09:03] <rogue780> I'm kinda new, and people haven't been able to help me with it
[09:03] <rogue780> insmod?
[09:03] <w3ccv> carzzz215, like for carzzz215 carld is the default for car
[09:03] <johny5> Silly question, can I mount a networked dvd burner in order to burn things on it?
[09:03] <w3ccv> carzzz215, mike
[09:03] <igge> bur[n] er_: heh.. :) I need to do it from a script
[09:03] <bur[n] er_> insmod is like modprobe, but doesn't check for dependencies like modprobe does
[09:03] <bur[n] er_> modprobe > insmod
[09:03] <carzzz215> w3ccv, thanks
[09:03] <phoenix87ta> having difficulty burning CD-R under Ubuntu Edgy.  After selecting files to be burned, I'm asked to insert a blank CD-R.

[09:04] <bur[n] er_> igge: I think you can with fluxbox, but it's been ages since I've played with it
[09:04] <kuzmaster> should i be doing somthing like chmod to change the permissions?
[09:04] <rogue780> would I put it in the /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic folder and then build it using ./configure make install?
[09:04] <bur[n] er_> phoenix87ta: what's your burning app?
[09:04] <bur[n] er_> phoenix87ta: use gnomebaker?
[09:04] <rogue780> rambo3, above is for you
[09:05] <phoenix87ta> bur[n] er_: using serpentine, mostly, or whatever's native to ubuntu
[09:05] <sparrw> I have a PCL printer installed, my Firefox print properties dialog says Letter, but the printer is complaining it has no A4 paper.  Help?
[09:05] <rambo3> if your going to compile /usr/src is good area to do that from not necessery but a good practice
[09:06] <tovella> sparrw: you may have to change the gnome printer settings.
[09:07] <sparrw> tovella: im using kde
[09:07] <tovella> sparrw: ok, the kde printer settings.
[09:07] <kuzmaster> hey, if this helps anyone, here is the output from "chmod -l /var" drwxr-xr-x  4 www-data www-data 4096 2006-12-06 21:29 www
[09:07] <kuzmaster> so, what do i need to do so i can put files there via ftp/scp?
[09:08] <bur[n] er_> kuzmaster: via your ftp or sftp client, right click the file and chmod it
[09:08] <kuzmaster> bur[n] er_:its repiles with a permissions error
[09:09] <phoenix87ta> bur[n] er_, would gnomebaker work better than serpentine or native burning?
[09:09] <bur[n] er_> phoenix87ta: possibly

[09:09] <kuzmaster> bur[n] er_:Error message from server: Permission denied
[09:09] <rsl> Is there any way to get the file upload dialog box in Firefox to show thumbnails?
[09:09] <drcode> I try to use wvdial
[09:09] <tovella> sparrw: i haven't used KDE for a very long time - but if my memory if correct, there should be somewhere that you can change the properties of the printer.  look for a tab that indicates the paper type & change it.
[09:09] <rambo3> if your goind to upload to that dir  you need write permission for the rest
[09:09] <drcode> from linux client to linux server
[09:09] <drcode> the logon is ok
[09:10] <drcode> but cannot find ppp command?
[09:10] <drcode> any idea?
[09:10] <rambo3> kuzmaster if your goind to upload to that dir  you need write permission for the rest
[09:11] <kuzmaster> rambo#: yes, that sounds about right...... how?
[09:11] <DaftDog> anyone know if i can get zope 2.8 (with it's dependency python 2.3.5) in dapper drake without having to do a manual install?
[09:11] <kuzmaster> rambo3: yes, that sounds about right...... how?

[09:20] <jamieoliver22> hi
[09:20] <jvolkman> Akez, sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:20] <kitche> Akez: admin is user admin or root?
[09:21] <jamieoliver22> could anyone help me please? I am getting an 'error 17' when running GRUB?
[09:21] <Akez> wah?
[09:21] <Akez> and thanks jvolkman
[09:22] <cheatersrealm> Akez: if it's read only, and you are actually root, then the permissions need to be changed.  if you are not actually root, then you become root using 'sudo' and then edit the file as root

[09:22] <cheatersrealm> ezenu: dia
[09:22] <Halcy0n> ezenu: I've always used dia.
[09:23] <kitche> jamieoliver22: Solution
[09:23] <kitche> This error is returned if the partition requested exists, but the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB.
[09:23] <kitche> Be sure to check your root(x,y) settings in your grub.conf.
[09:23] <kitche> Also, if you are trying to boot Windows, make sure that your grub.conf file has the root (hdX,Y) (or rootnoverify (hdX,Y)) and chainloader (hdX,Y)+1 in it.
[09:23] <jvolkman> ezenu, umbrello is uml-specific
[09:23] <kitche> sorry was meant to be one line :(
[09:23] <ezenu> cheatersrealm, Halcy0n ok, I'll try. I didn't realize it could be used for UML, easily
[09:23] <jamieoliver22> thanks.. im fairly new to ubuntu and linux, but ill have a go
[09:24] <cheatersrealm> ezenu: use the UML toolset

[09:49] <felixfoertsch> Good evening. I have a problem installing Ubuntu on an ASUS Laptop. It has a Widescreen monitor and is stuck at the point where you have to set the resolution of the xserver.
[09:50] <weswh-> I have an external USB hard drive that I would like to be able to plug back and forth between my linux machine and my windows laptop for file storage. what file system will be best for this (photos, music, documents) - and are there any significant disadvantages? My inclination is FAT32?
[09:50] <felixfoertsch> I can select the resolution - but after clicking "continue" it jumps back to exact the same screen.
[09:51] <shwag> if I do  'reset'   the screen clears and says  "Erase is backspace."  Then, when I use vim, my backspace key doesn't work. How do fix this?
[09:51] <kitche> weswh- fat32/vfat unless you want to install 3rd party drivers in windows
[09:51] <black__> Italian?
[09:51] <soundray> Hexxoo: I suggest you try to connect to the de. mirror instead of is. Do 'sudo sed 's/is\./de\./g' /etc/apt/sources.list'
[09:52] <soundray> Hexxoo: everything inside the outer quotes -- then the previous command again.
[09:52] <Hexxoo> ok
[09:53] <Hexxoo> that last thing is still timing out
[09:53] <Hexxoo> it's the same ip as before
[09:54] <weswh-> kitche - if i wanted to install 3rd party drivers what would my options be? and is 'vfat' another option besides fat32? not familiar with that one
[09:54] <soundray> Hexxoo: the sed command hasn't worked then... hold on...
[09:54] <Hexxoo> wait
[09:54] <kitche> weswh-: vfat is what linux calls fat32
[09:55] <kitche> weswh-: fs-driver.org for the windows ext3 drivers
[09:55] <Hexxoo> I changed in system -> administration -> software sources from Icelandic to Main Server
[09:55] <Hexxoo> And now it works
[09:55] <weswh-> kitche - thank you!
[09:56] <felixfoertsch> Could anyone help me with my problem? I try to install Ubuntu Edgy Efty on an ASUS M6000 Notebook - and it's stuck on setting the resolution of the xserver.
[09:56] <soundray> Hexxoo: installations work, too?
[09:56] <Hexxoo> waiting for this thing in the terminal to finish
[09:56] <soundray> lee2: how did you get into this situation with the boot problem?
[09:57] <dgirlsdemlover> hey yall

[09:58] <soundray> Hexxoo: something must be wrong in Iceland, then ;)

[09:59] <mc44> Huffalump: what error are you getting?
[09:59] <Huffalump> I've checked the support section of the Ubuntu site, including the details about the August flub.

[10:00] <soundray> jamesbrose: edit /etc/motd
[10:00] <blekos> hello ppl
[10:00] <kitche> wildchild: probably esd (sound server) is using your sound or another program
[10:00] <Huffalump> mc44, it says "failed to start the x server"
[10:00] <Huffalump> mc44, and then something about a log file
[10:00] <blekos> i got 2 usb sticks one is kingston and the other non branded
[10:00] <Huffalump> mc44, which I don't know how to read
[10:00] <Huffalump> georgy, I will try that right now.
[10:01] <wildchild> kitche: how can I awoid this "sound server" ?
[10:01] <blekos> kingston is recognised by both win & linux, but the non branded is completed ignored by linux (ubuntu) any ideas?
[10:01] <kitche> wildchild: disable it but not sure how to do it with esd
[10:01] <Jeeva> syntax to see the uptime of my PPPoE connection ?
[10:01] <wildchild> don't even know what or where is esd
[10:01] <soundray> blekos: run 'tail -f /var/log/messages' and look for errors while you plug it in

[10:03] <Huffalump> georgy, I recognized all the questions from what I've done twice already
[10:03] <p33k4y> is the gnome-app-install database updated when i update the synaptic database or it's a different one?
[10:03] <soundray> owen_: I don't think it's possible -- it's a closed format
[10:04] <wildchild> soundray: in system settings >sound system ->hardware ->select the audio device = auto select = should I change this?
[10:04] <georgy> Huffalump, : what is the error message
[10:04] <Huffalump> georgy, however this time, instead of Moniter (something) Advanced {which was default choice} ...I chose medium, changed refresh rates, and now it appears to work.
[10:04] <Huffalump> georgy, so I believe this last config did the trick
[10:04] <Paddy_EIRE> hey guys Im using beryl with aiglx, sometimes when I right click the title bar the window decorator crashes causing me to have to reload it again?? Is there any reason for this and how could it be fixed

[10:07] <aszharon> good evening. i read, that it is ok to install a 32bit-version of ubuntu on a 64bit supporting computer. but is it ok to install a 64bit-version of ubuntu on a 32bit supporting computer, i mean: can such a system work stable?
[10:07] <soundray> n00bie: braindead leftover from DOS times
[10:07] <LjL>  /etc/apt
[10:07] <cmweb> ljl, sorry ljl, i will next time. I just thought that every one would like to know the answer
[10:08] <n00bie> I want to be able to use ubuntu, mandriva, possibly an older version of windows.. and have a partition that both os can read/write and pull from.
[10:08] <n00bie> help me.
=== n00bie is now known as jon_doe
[10:08] <jon_doe> there.
[10:08] <LjL> the answer, maybe, "sorry i don't know anything about", i doubt it.
[10:08] <LjL> anyway /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:08] <jon_doe> all on a 120gb HDD

[10:08] <wildchild> soundray: well now it's set on autodetect, other options are: 1) open sound system, 2)Advanced Linux sound architecture, 3) no audio input/out put, 4)Enlightened sound daemon, 5)network audio system, 6)Threated open sound system....
[10:09] <mc44> jon_doe: yes you can have 4 partitions and a swap partition, that is fine
[10:09] <apokryphos> jon_doe: make windows fat32, and leave ubuntu as default
[10:09] <apokryphos> !ext3
[10:09] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[10:09] <soundray> jon_doe: it's rude to ask a question and then change nicks
[10:09] <fuffe> I have no problem in committing generally.. but when moving trunk to branches/name I always get a 403 error
[10:10] <soundray> wildchild: close that dialog and read my previous line *very* carefully
[10:10] <dogmeat> which ftp client would ppl recommend?
[10:10] <jon_doe> so like partition it like this: 20gb for Ubuntu, 20 for Mandriva, 20 for win, and 60gb where all OS's can read/write to and from.
[10:10] <NicksteSA> in what repository can I find kismet?
[10:10] <cmweb> ljl, why would the gksudo gedit etc/apt/sources.list give me a blank file even though i have packages avalibal?
[10:10] <dogmeat> ftp client with gui?
[10:10] <georgy> dogmeat : gftp
[10:10] <dogmeat> thanks
[10:10] <LjL> cmweb: because it's /etc/apt/sources.list and not etc/apt/sources.list
[10:10] <kitche> cmweb: try /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:10] <mc44> jon_doe: yes, that should be fine
[10:10] <cmweb> ops forgot to take off the /
[10:11] <jon_doe> and both should work?
[10:11] <mc44> jon_doe: both what?
[10:11] <jon_doe> os's read/write to the extended partition
[10:11] <Valmarko_> hello. What aplication I have to use top chm documents?
[10:11] <mc44> jon_doe: if you make it fat32 then yes

[10:12] <jon_doe> will it automatically set it up to dual or 3x boot for different os's?

[10:16] <blekos> i use gnome, but i got install k3b (is there and alternative for gnome?). When I use K3b and change workspace the K3b icon still appears on the bottom taskbar.
[10:17] <blekos> Does this have to do with K3b being a KDE app?
[10:17] <ubunul> is someone using xampp and cacti on the same machine ?
[10:17] <LjL> blekos: gnomebaker is the closest gnome equivalent, i suppose
[10:17] <alex-weej> here's a question for the pros, can i safely read-only mount a filesystem on a loop that is actively being written to?

[10:18] <PhantomePhreak> Hi @LL
[10:18] <LjL> !hi
[10:18] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!

[10:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bye - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:19] <blekos> any suggestion for best burning soft for gnome?
[10:19] <LjL> !best
[10:19] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[10:19] <blekos> i would like to mess up my sys with constant installs etc
[10:19] <soundray> blekos: you would?
[10:19] <soundray> blekos: anyway, there's little danger of that. This isn't windows after all.
[10:20] <soundray> blekos: for me, the nautilus burner is best
[10:20] <blekos> lol, well i'm just trying not to be lost among applications
[10:20] <blekos> cause of my limited time, i try to switch to linux with not too much hasle
[10:21] <jamieoliver22> i am looking for the person who helped me a few minutes ago.. i cant remember his name.. began with T? sorry

[10:21] <soundray> blekos: I used to use k3b a lot, but since my last fresh install, I haven't installed it again
[10:21] <blekos> i just need a cd/dvd burning soft which allow me to do(burn) the same things as with nero
[10:21] <blekos> i c
[10:21] <soundray> blekos: k3b is the full-featured one I reckon
[10:21] <PhantomePhreak> does anybody know, how can I configure ubuntu to login anybody automatically? (sry 4 my english^^)
[10:22] <blekos> maybe then I should stick to it

[10:23] <alex-weej> ernz: in what context?
[10:23] <blekos> lol
[10:23] <alex-weej> blekos: seriously, there is a NeroLinux
[10:23] <blekos> no kidding?
[10:23] <Hazarath> Can't install 'ndiswrapper', says 'make' doesn't exist.
[10:23] <alex-weej> http://www.nero.com/eng/NeroLINUX.html
[10:23] <blekos> maybe i should have a look

[10:24] <Hazarath> Can't seem to install 'ndiswrapper'
[10:25] <PhantomePhreak> ^^
[10:25] <PhantomePhreak> no kde or gnome^^
[10:25] <blekos> nero linux aint freeware
[10:25] <DARKGuy> Holy cow
[10:25] <DARKGuy> Nero for Linux!
[10:25] <DARKGuy> :D
[10:25] <blekos> gnomebaker doesnt look that bad
[10:25] <blekos> y get nero when u got k3b?
[10:25] <soundray> PhantomePhreak: on dapper, you would have used inittab. Edgy uses upstart in place of sysvinit, so everything has changed... you'll have to look for docs on upstart
[10:25] <soundray> !upstart
[10:25] <ubotu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[10:25] <alex-weej> blekos: Nero Windows isn't freeware either... :P
[10:25] <PhantomePhreak> hm k ;)
[10:25] <Hazarath> Any dice here, guys?
[10:26] <blekos> u got a point :) but now i'm in Linux!!1

[10:27] <alex-weej> ernz: ask the room, there are some GPG commands you need but i forgot how to use them
[10:27] <soundray> Hazarath: if you had "got" it, you wouldn't be trying to compile anything.
[10:27] <Trini_Man> whats the best way to do Remte dexktop on ubuntu ?
[10:27] <soundray> Trini_Man: vnc, configure via vino-preferences
[10:27] <Hazarath> soundray, Ok, I have the source, and now attempting to install... 'make' cannot be found.
[10:27] <jamieoliver22> im looking for the person who helped me a few minutes ago... ?
[10:28] <Trini_Man> humm
[10:28] <blekos> sometimes times Linux confuses me with all that options, and thats what I like
[10:28] <soundray> Hazarath: you're on the wrong track. But if you insist that you must compile something, install build-essential
[10:28] <Trini_Man> oundray : what ?
[10:28] <DARKGuy> This is weird though, the Nero that came with my burner has no serial number o_o; how am I suppossed to use it for my Linux one :(

[10:46] <weswh-> i'm trying to decide if i should format my external usb storage drive as ext2 or fat32. for storing music/photos/documents, i can do ext2 and use the fs-driver.org tool to access it from windows and linux, or i can just do fat32. it's a 160gig usb2.0 drive, any recommendations?

[10:46] <meshyf> I've tried those things but haven't figured it out yet. Ish weird.
[10:47] <Hazarath> Help getting WiFi up? All my other attemps failed. Read guides.
[10:47] <meshyf> K guess it'll just be more trial and error.
[10:48] <soundray> weswh-: if you're not shy of installing an extra Windows driver, ext3 is by far the best option (ext2fs will read/write ext3, too)
[10:48] <Hazarath> Need help getting my Belkin 54G PCI card online.
[10:48] <daviey> Hi, has anybody here got lirc to work?
[10:49] <cmt^^> daviey - irssi ftw
[10:49] <thomas> weswh-: whats the fs-driver tool like on windows, if it's good. i'd go with ext3
[10:49] <daviey> cmt^^, huh?
[10:49] <cmt^^> !irssi
[10:49] <ubotu> irssi is a command line interface IRC client ( "sudo apt-get install irssi" without the quotes to try it out )
[10:49] <daviey> cmt^^, Thats great!! how does that helo?
[10:49] <cmt^^> daviey - helo?
[10:49] <thomas> help
[10:49] <Hazarath> Help.
[10:50] <thomas> he meant help
[10:50] <daviey> cmt^^, sorry helo mean't to say help
[10:50] <weswh-> soundray - does ext3 offer big advantages just for a storage drive? the only reason i was thinking ext2 is they say on the website: "If you mount an Ext3 file system as an Ext2 file system and the file system is not cleanly dismounted, (e.g. due to a system crash), you have to run the e2fsck tool. (Linux does it automatically.) Running e2fsck can take several hours on large volumes. You do not benefit from journaling the Ext3 file system, because you have to r
[10:50] <weswh-> un e2fsck."
[10:50] <Hazarath> Need help with wireless, read guides, still stuck.
[10:50] <thomas> Hazarath: whats the matter
[10:50] <cmt^^> daviey - I guess it doesn't.. but I recommend you give irssi a shot, it's by far the best irc-client available
[10:50] <weswh-> thomas: seems to be excellent. fs-driver.org
[10:50] <cmt^^> (if you ask me)
[10:51] <thomas> weswh-: well don't use fat32 then :)
[10:51] <daviey> cmt^^, ahh, i'm looking for LIRC - linux infra red
[10:51] <thomas> lol
[10:51] <Hazarath> thomas, can't seem to get wireless to work, was gonna try to get the wrapper thingy installed, was told I'm going the wrong way, tried the ubuntu interface thingy, still no dice.
[10:51] <thomas> Hazarath: if there are no linux drivers installed, you'll need to use the ndis wrapper
[10:52] <Hazarath> thomas, I tought so... can't get past ''make' not found'
[10:52] <Byan> how big should my swap be, with 2GB of ram?
[10:52] <mc44> Hazarath: apt-get install build-essential
[10:52] <thomas> Hazarath: hmmm where are you doing that?
[10:52] <kitche> Byan: don't need a swap with 2GB of ram really
[10:52] <Byan> kitche: should I have one anyways?
[10:52] <Hazarath> thomas, Hmm? Where am I donig what?
[10:53] <kitche> Byan: if you want to be safe yes but it probably won't be used
[10:53] <kudzubane> kitche: unless you want to capture coredumps of mem leaks and such
[10:53] <thomas> Hazarath: when does it say make not found
[10:53] <cmt^^> daviey - heheh, i just assumed lirc was something in regards to IRC
[10:53] <cmt^^> Like licq
[10:53] <daviey> cmt^^, cheers anyway
[10:53] <cmt^^> sure
[10:53] <Hazarath> thomas, in the newly created directory after un-compressing ndis
[10:54] <thomas> Hazarath: ok you should install ndis with Ubuntu's package manager
[10:54] <Hazarath> Er... installs
[10:54] <Hazarath> Eh?
[10:54] <kitche> kudzubane: yes but don't think many ubuntu users with 2 gb's of ram will be doing that
[10:54] <Hazarath> thomas, thanks... I hate doing it the bash way.
[10:54] <kudzubane> kitche: i do :)
[10:55] <thomas> Hazarath: from what you are saying, you are installing ndis from source. you can just install a binary of it. use synaptic
[10:55] <Hazarath> thomas, Doing so now.
[10:55] <thomas> Hazarath: :)
[10:55] <thomas> Hazarath: what guide are you using for ndis?
[10:55] <CarlFK> I need a util to fixed a tweaked partition table - like something that will see the FS's on the disk and figure out where the start/end of the 3 primary partitions should be. any suggestions ?
[10:56] <Hazarath> thomas, Some dude's that has my Belkin 54G card. Was told that I have a hard nosed chip on the card.
[10:57] <thomas> Hazarath: ok there is an ndis howto on the ubuntu wiki, i'm not sure of the address, but i used that to get my wireless working. you should check it out

[11:03] <dxdt> Where does $PATH get all of its paths from?  It seems like it has a lot more than the ones just in /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc
[11:04] <kitche> dxdt: .bashrc and .bash_profile in your home directory
[11:04] <kunwon1> ~/.bashrc ?
[11:06] <Byan> better practice to have both OS's on the same disk or one on each?
[11:06] <hjmills> what do I need to do to iptables to connect to a local irc server on the network (client and server side)?
[11:06] <DARKGuy> Byan: I'd prefer one OS on each disk, so in case one of them screws up, you can just format and reinstall
[11:06] <dxdt> Yeah I checked there, but it doesn't seem to have anything.  Like my echo $PATH has things like sbin in it and I don't see .bashrc or bash_profile adding that.  Is that added by some other program somewhere?
[11:06] <NineTeen67Comet> Eeeks gadzooks .. When I login I get a white desktop and no icons .. No real time when it started, but it was yesterday, I just assumed there was an issue with Beryl but upon logging in today it's stuck like this again ..
[11:07] <kingrayray> anybody here familiar with ubuntu on ppc? specifically an older G3 imac?
[11:07] <hjmills> what do I need to do to iptables to connect to a local irc server on the network (client and server side)?
[11:08] <hjmills> NineTeen67Comet: check your xorg logs and any berly logs (if it does log stuff) and try logging into gnome failsafe so as not to laod beryl
[11:08] <kitche> hjmills: for client side nothing for server side you just have to make sure the port is open that the irc server is running on
[11:09] <Byan> can someone give me the name of the thing I need to do for dual monitors?
[11:09] <hjmills> kitche: how do I do that - I don't know iptables that well
[11:09] <kitche> !firestarter|hjmills
[11:09] <ubotu> hjmills: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[11:09] <NineTeen67Comet> hjmills: gotchya .. thanks .. I'll go less a little .. :)
[11:09] <mc44> Byan: Xinerama
[11:09] <hjmills> Byan: what do you mean? like xinerama?
[11:09] <Byan> hjmills: IDK
[11:09] <LaserLine> what's the command line to see ever package installed on your system
[11:09] <Byan> I just want dual monitors like I have in XP
[11:09] <Byan> atm
[11:10] <DARKGuy> Byan: For dual monitors you can use Xinerama
[11:10] <hjmills> kitche: thanks but the pc its running on is a serer with no gui
[11:10] <kingrayray> on recent nvidia cards you can also use twinview
[11:10] <hjmills> Byan: do you have an nvidia gfx card?
[11:10] <kitche> hjmills: then look up the iptables howto that ubotu said
[11:10] <Byan> hjmills: mhmm 7600GT

[11:13] <DARKGuy> AdamKili: Nothing better that giving out free CDs for everyone to try! :D
[11:13] <nothlit> fireflier works on a server that has no x
[11:14] <AdamKili> I'm going to have my Ubuntu laptop with me. But the CDs is a excellent idea I wouldn't have thought of.

[11:16] <psychad> hi, i have ubuntu 6.10 and i compiled mplayer. it can play most stuff, but mp3files and videofiles with mp3soundlayer sounds really bad, really distorted terrible sound
[11:16] <psychad> mp3s play fine in xmms though
[11:17] <psychad> any hints what i can do to fix this?
[11:17] <haxality> hello
[11:17] <haxality> I'm having problems with NFS
[11:17] <okn> does anyone know how can i fix the console fonts..they are huuge..how can i set the resolution someting like 1280x1024 ?
[11:17] <haxality> I've read like 4 tutorials, and I think I've figured it out
[11:17] <haxality> the problem is that root isn't mapped on the server
[11:17] <ITSa341> Can anyone point me to information about EVDO cards in Ubuntu?
[11:17] <haxality> what should I do to fix it
[11:17] <mamonassassina> trying to open photoshop 7.0 in wine...
[11:17] <mamonassassina> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35660/
[11:18] <amonkey> when i start X i get an api mismatch, the nvidia kernel module is 9625, but the X module is 9629. how can i update the kernel module? i have a suspicion that the kernel module just needs to be reloaded, but i don't know how.
[11:18] <kingrayray> how do u install ubuntu 6.06 LTS from a PPC system via CLI? when X starts, the resolution or something seems to be invalid so i can't see anything
[11:18] <mamonassassina> what is that?how can i solve it?
[11:18] <dxdt> okn,umm yo mean like the consoles not in gnome-terminal but the console like when you hit ctrl+alt+F1 ?
[11:18] <hjmills> kitche: ok, i have added an input rule to accept traffic on 6667 but i still cant connect, any ideas?
[11:18] <kitche> haxality: well if you explain what's wrong then someone might help you
[11:18] <aleprof> dxdt, I've tried installing xserver-xorg-video-via
[11:18] <haxality> kitche: sorry, heh
[11:18] <kitche> hjmills: did you restart iptables?
[11:18] <haxality> I get the error 'Permission Denied' when trying to connect to the server
[11:18] <mathieu__> psychad: do things sound ok with mplayer ?
[11:18] <aleprof> but when i set "via" as driver and restart X, X does not start
[11:18] <OneSeventeen> I'm creating a virtual machine to run Ubuntu 6.06 server, how much space should I allocate for the primary drive?
[11:18] <haxality> (connect = mount NFS drives on the client)
[11:19] <hjmills> kitche: no - that will probably be it - how do i do that?
[11:19] <psychad> mathieu__: everything but mp3s. i can for instance play wmv files and they sound perfect
[11:19] <mamonassassina> that's strange,i guess...winetools said Photoshop 7 runs fine.
[11:19] <kitche> hjmills: depends the server uses ubuntu?
[11:19] <ar24> Has anyone had success digitally signing documents in OpenOffice under Edgy?
[11:19] <hjmills> kitche: yup
[11:19] <Hazarath> Ok, this is getting no where... all the others that help go off before I get resolved... need WiFi help, tried everything.
[11:19] <kitche> hjmills: then look in /etc/init.d there should be an iptables script in there then do sudo /etc/init.d/iptables restart
[11:20] <dxdt> aleprof, when it fails to startx, what's the more detailed error, it probably gives you a chance to see one or something, right?  Or does it just straight crash?  If you change the driver to vesa can you get in X?
[11:20] <psychad> mathieu__: right now i am playing an wav in mplayer, it sounds nice
[11:20] <hjmills> kitche: no - theres no iptables script there - thats the first place i looked
[11:20] <haxality> oh, the irony..
[11:21] <kitche> amonkey: well considering that the X module and the kernel module are the same thing really you would do sudo rmmod nvidia then sudo modprobe nvidia
[11:21] <ar24> I've exported the certificate path variable to the appropriate .mozilla/firefox/default profile directory and restarted OOo, but it still crashes every time I try to sign a document.
[11:21] <psychad> mathieu__: and i can't decode mp3 to wav, the same sound goes into the audiodump.wav
[11:21] <kitche> hjmills: hmm it might be in another script which  I have no clue where though but it should say in that howto where the script it
[11:21] <aleprof> dxdt, with vesa driver X starts, with via i got something like "no device found"
[11:21] <Hazarath> Need WiFi help, please. Tried the guides, etc, no good.
[11:21] <amonkey> kitche, that's the first thing i tried but when i tried to rmmod nvidia, it said the module was in use.
[11:21] <dcordes> how can i convert mpeg video to mp4? i tried mencoder before but i didn't understand what argument i needed. please help
[11:22] <hjmills> kitche: oh - apparently the firewall is inactive in ubuntu by default so it cant be the firewall
[11:22] <bertx> hi
[11:22] <dxdt> aleprof, interesting, are you absolutely sure that's what the video card is?
[11:22] <fbc> What packages do I need to install to get the MAKE command?
[11:22] <dxdt> fbc, sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:22] <kitche> hjmills: look at /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow
[11:22] <dxdt> fbc, that should hook you up with all the cool tools.
[11:22] <dxdt> g++ , etc
[11:22] <dxdt> and make
[11:22] <fbc> dxdt:  thanks
[11:23] <mathieu__> psychad: well it does sound like mplayer is not decoding your mp3s properly
[11:23] <dcordes> anybody?
[11:23] <bertx> Hi, do somebody knows an easy way to use beagle with vfat partition ?
[11:23] <bertx> please
[11:23] <amonkey> kitche: can i force it to unload somehow?
[11:23] <ar24> Seriously, I've created both self-signed certs and certs with root authorities and imported them into Firefox, and OOo seems to see them, but I have no idea why it keeps crashing.
[11:23] <mathieu__> psychad: does mpg123 work ?
[11:23] <psychad> mathieu__: exactly
[11:23] <psychad> mathieu__: let me try, i didn't even know i sh9ould have mpg123
[11:24] <mathieu__> psychad: it's just another program
[11:24] <aleprof> dxdt, yes, or better, hope yes... asus K8M890
[11:24] <psychad> i know what it is
[11:24] <Hova> hwo then how do i do a back up ,like the restore in windows
[11:24] <psychad> no, i don't have mpg123 installed
[11:24] <psychad> mathieu__: however, xmms plays nicely
[11:24] <psychad> xmms default ubuntu package
[11:24] <aleprof> dxdt, it's an integrated video card
[11:24] <rubix_> i am having some probs with the display of a .wmv file, its all choppy and unrecognizable
[11:25] <dxdt> aleprof, that's what I was guessing, lemme google real quick
[11:25] <analfabeta> how can i download only packages .deb for a instalation of software?!
[11:26] <kitche> Hova: you need to backup yourself with partimage or another way
[11:26] <Stormx2> Issue! Following the BerylOnEdgy guide from the wiki. When updating my package list, one of the repos 404s. Further investigation (led me too http://amaranth.selfip.com/) says its closed. What should I do?
[11:26] <Hova> cani get partimage on the sytmatic packadge ?
[11:26] <kitche> Stormx2: remove it from your source.list
[11:26] <kitche> Hova: yes
[11:27] <Stormx2> kitche: And not do the beryl thing?
[11:27] <cmt^^> What might be wrong when mplayer works from terminal but the gui doesnt work
[11:27] <kudzubane> wow, background load is just too high, removing from laptop
[11:27] <Hova> thanks
[11:27] <kitche> kudzubane:  :)
[11:27] <cmt^^> kudzubane - my dear old friend :>
[11:28] <cmt^^> i finally got the ati drivers working
[11:28] <kudzubane> kitche: too used to 0.00 0.00 0.00
[11:28] <kitche> cmt^^: your probably missing the frontend but if you run gmplayer in console it will give you more information
[11:28] <Hova> its not there  partimage
[11:28] <mathieu__> psychad: it could be that you did not have the proper development header files when you compiled mplayer
[11:28] <ar24> Anyone here actually using OOo?
[11:28] <kudzubane> cmt^^: good job, what additional step(s) did you have to perform
[11:28] <hjmills> ok, which is the simplest and easiest irc daemon?
[11:29] <thomas> i'm having some problem with the nvidia-glx drivers, i installed them but it says "unable to load nvidia kernel driver! be sure you have instaled the nvidia driver for running kernel" anyone got any ideas?
[11:29] <cmt^^> kudzubane - i actually download the linux drivers from ati.com :}
[11:29] <cmt^^> walhfmf
[11:29] <kitche> Hova: sure it is partimage just looked at packages.ubuntu.com
[11:29] <sponix> whats the best torrent client ?
[11:29] <psychad> mathieu__: i guess so, but the configrue script says it finds mp3lib, what shall i be looking for. what <package>-dev solves this mystery? can you play mp3s in mplayer on your machine?
[11:30] <cmt^^> kitche - it added an icon to the applications/multimedia-menu
[11:30] <DARKGuy> anybody knows why bittornado doesn't resume my torrents?
[11:30] <Crescendo> After the upgrade to Edgy, Xchat opens links using Mozilla.  It should open them using Firefox. Any ideas on how to fix it?
[11:30] <kitche> cmt^^: what did?
[11:30] <mamonassassina> no,really,what is going on here?
[11:30] <cmt^^> the mplayer-installation
[11:30] <mamonassassina> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35660/
[11:30] <cmt^^> (from synaptic)
[11:30] <alessandropironi> dxdt it's me (aleprof), i've logged from my laptop, so i can restart X on pc
[11:30] <mathieu__> psychad: yes
[11:30] <kitche> cmt^^: doesn't mean anything console would give you more information why it's not running
[11:30] <mamonassassina> what can i do to run photoshop 7.0?
[11:30] <cmt^^> ok hang on
[11:31] <mamonassassina> this error message is very...errorous :P
[11:31] <mamonassassina> its...errorific.
[11:31] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: check the WINE appdb: http://appdb.wine.org and search for PS 7
[11:31] <mathieu__> psychad: when it plays the mp3 it says : Opening audio decoder: [mp3lib]  MPEG layer-2, layer-3
[11:31] <sponix> mamonassassina: might check the wine site see if it runs photoshop
[11:31] <mamonassassina> sponix: winetools says it runs fine
[11:31] <Myria> i think i found a bug in the ubuntu 6.06 x86-64 distribution, although i don't know for use
[11:31] <kingrayray> i have used photoshop 7 in wine
[11:31] <Myria> sure
[11:31] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: winetools is way outdated
[11:31] <haxality> so does anyone know what would cause me to get a "Permission denied" error while mounting an NFS share
[11:31] <haxality> ?
[11:31] <sponix> mamonassassina: never heard of winetools
[11:31] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: PS7 runs on Wine anyways

[11:32] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: see in the wine appdb if your error has been already issued there? I don't have PS7 so...
[11:32] <mamonassassina> http://appdb.wine.org/ not found on firefox
[11:32] <psychad> mathieu__: yes
[11:32] <Myria> when you do "man time", the example command "time -f "%E real,%U user,%S sys" ls -Fs"  is given, but if you actually try that command, you get -bash: -f: command not found

[11:32] <tkooda> how do I stop ubuntu from sleeping/suspending and/or logging me out when I close my laptop?   (commenting out "#ACPI_HIBERNATE=true" and "ACPI_SLEEP=true" in /etc/default/acpi-support dosn't seem to work?)
[11:32] <dxdt> alessandropironi, I'm reading a few posts about it, but haven't come up with a "good" solution yet.  You might want to repeat the question to the rest of the room too in case some people smarter than me can figure it out too(since it has been a while)

[11:32] <mamonassassina> http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=1336
[11:32] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: so.. o.o?
[11:32] <DARKGuy> ah
[11:32] <DARKGuy> winehq
[11:32] <hjmills> does a simple irc daemon exist?
[11:32] <DARKGuy> thanks kitche xD
[11:33] <dxdt> tkooda, you have gnome power manager?  You should be able to change those options there
[11:33] <alessandropironi> ok, thank you dxdt
[11:33] <mamonassassina> DARKGuy: what i just sent won't load here.

[11:33] <Lattyware> wrong channel
[11:33] <Lattyware> sorry guys
[11:33] <psychad> mathieu__: yes
[11:33] <haxality> guess not..
[11:33] <DARKGuy> lol
[11:33] <tkooda> dxdt, thnx, I'll check it out

[11:33] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:33] <psychad> mathieu__: i get sound, just very bad sound
[11:33] <dxdt> tkooda, System >> Preferences Power Mangement
[11:33] <Myria> anyone know how to use "time"'s command line options?
[11:33] <cmt^^> kitche - http://pastebin.se/4818
[11:33] <psychad> mathieu__: the sound is similar to what it supposed to sound like, but very very bad
[11:33] <tkooda> dxdt, cool, thnx
[11:33] <stoorty> is there a way to load up a console with jsut the keyboard?
[11:33] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: I think the wine site is down (like, WTF?!)
[11:34] <kitche> Myria: yes time <command> and that's it
[11:34] <haxality> stoorty: hit ctrl-alt-F2
[11:34] <psychad> stoorty: ctrl+alr+f1
[11:34] <psychad> stoorty: ctrl+alt+f1
[11:34] <haxality> psychad's suggestion works too
[11:34] <Myria> kitche: try it - it doesn't work
[11:34] <dxdt> stoorty, once in gnome?  do one of the ctrl+alt+F keys or do alt+F2 and type gnome-terminal
[11:34] <mamonassassina> DARKGuy: ya,that's very strange.
[11:34] <DARKGuy> mamonassassina: nor .org or .com work :(
[11:34] <kitche> cmt^^: your missing the skin of the frontend
[11:34] <Myria> kitche: it tries to interpret the first option as the command and execute it
[11:34] <psychad> dxdt: a console or a terminal?
[11:34] <haxality> Myria: that IS the command
=== Griverr is now known as Griver
[11:35] <Myria> haxality: not according to "man time"
[11:35] <Myria> "man time" says there's options to do formatting and such
[11:35] <haxality> what option are you trying to use
[11:35] <Myria> --format=%U
[11:35] <dxdt> psychad, huh?
[11:35] <alessandropironi> I can't configure my video card asus k8m890
[11:35] <Myria> i think bash might have a builtin named "time" that's interfering
[11:35] <kitche> Myria: it should be time [options]  command [argument]  and there is only one option called -p
[11:36] <Skenvoy> halp: windows/linux samba interoperability - i want to be able to have windows users browse root shares with anonymous access. Share = user makes password dialogues pop up on all windows clients
[11:36] <Myria> my ubuntu 6.06 x86-64 says there's 8 options
[11:36] <psychad> dxdt: i'm asking the quasi-philosophical question "is a console the same thing as a terminal?"
[11:36] <Skenvoy> and as a bonus i'd like all user account bound to the linux system's passwd system
[11:37] <Skenvoy> currently, linux machines can't smbmount with security = share
[11:37] <kitche> Myria: you talking about GNU options?
[11:37] <Skenvoy> and windows machines want passwords when browsing shares with security = user
[11:37] <stoorty> hmmm.... my taskbar thing has crashed, how can i kill it and reload it
[11:37] <stoorty> ?
[11:37] <dxdt> psychad, In response to someone asking how to get to one, probably not.  I think there is one, but off the top of my head, I honestly can't even think of a function that I have to do in console that I can't do with gnome-terminal..
[11:37] <Myria> kitche: i guess.  the manpage says it's a debian program.
[11:37] <amonkey> i restarted gdm and now x won't start because of an nvidia kernel module api mismatch. when i try to rmmod nvidia it tells me the module is in use, any ideas?
[11:38] <dxdt> stoorty, if you can open a console or terminal do sudo killall gnome-panel  and it should autorestart itself
[11:38] <haxality> can anyone tell me why I'd get a 'permission denied' error when trying to mount an NFS share
[11:38] <kitche> haxality: your NFS permissions is wrong
[11:38] <haxality> ...
[11:38] <haxality> on where, the server or the client?
[11:38] <dxdt> latex hurts my brain
[11:38] <haxality> and what about them is wrong?
[11:38] <psychad> stoorty: do you want to start the taskbar thing, or do you want to reset your session. you can alwasy restart x (and log otu from x) byt typing ctrl+alt+backspace
[11:38] <kitche> !NFS|haxality
[11:38] <ubotu> haxality: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[11:38] <ernz> !beryl
[11:38] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:39] <haxality> ok, kitche, I've been through everything on that page
[11:39] <Crescendo> After the upgrade to Edgy, Xchat opens links using Mozilla.  It should open them using Firefox. Any ideas on how to fix it?
[11:39] <haxality> no luck
[11:39] <psychad> stoorty: oh, type alt+f2 and you'll get a box from where you can launch programs, you can forinstance type gnome-terminal
[11:40] <diminthedam> i dont have enough permission to empty the wastebin. Is there a command to do this?
[11:40] <kitche> haxality: how are you trying to mount the NFS share?
[11:40] <meshyf> Ok now this is getting frustrating D:  I am using the ndiswrapper-1.31, got it installed and everything. Found what I think is the right driver for it, but now ndsiwrapper says "Driver present, hardware present Invalid driver!" what the heck do I do now?
[11:40] <dxdt> alessandropironi, do you plan to use this driver to try to do things like Beryl and the other 3d video card things?  I ask because I found a solution that would probably work, but it uses an open source driver that although better for your card than vesa, won't let you do 3d stuff.
[11:40] <frandavid100> hi
[11:40] <Byan> how do I change the resolution of the terminal for my server?
=== ubuntu4alexej is now known as AV1611
=== acez is now known as aceZ
[11:41] <Skenvoy> my samba server is also not responding to netbios broadcasts for name resolution
[11:41] <frandavid100> is there a command for shutting down the computer?
[11:41] <Myria> the options work if i do /usr/bin/time instead of time
[11:41] <Byan> frandavid100: shutdown
[11:41] <Byan> ?
[11:41] <Myria> i'll just do that then
[11:41] <Myria> bye
[11:41] <frandavid100> thanks Byan, and any way to delay it, say, 30 min?
[11:41] <kitche> haxality: since to me it sounds like your not using sudo when trying to mount it
[11:42] <Byan> frandavid100: man shutdown
[11:42] <dxdt> Byan, do you mean your console font like when you press ctrl+alt+F1  ?
[11:42] <alessandropironi> dxdt, no actually i don't need 3d
[11:42] <Byan> dxdt: huh?
[11:42] <hjmills> how do I specify a password when connecting to an irc server?
[11:42] <Byan> dxdt: I mean, I am on a almost headless server

[11:47] <dxdt> alessandropironi, the thread here has some interesting solutions, but I am not sure if these are the best options.  Someone mentions a fix by removing one driver then using another but you still leave via in your xorg.conf because they use the same name for some weird reason.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291157&highlight=asus+K8M890+video

[11:52] <dxdt> alessandropironi, yeah long story short it looks like you hit a bug in Ubuntu that should be fixed in the next release :( in the meantime I think you can use that post to solve the problem.  I would use that post probably if I were you
[11:52] <Flosoft> https://launchpad.net/bugs/74102

[11:54] <ubotu> Stormx2: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)

[11:54] <ITSa341> Stormx2   their interface works great in ff linux
[11:54] <Stormx2> Amaranth: Don't worry. Been there broke x fixed it logged back in.
[11:54] <Stormx2> Amaranth: My card is unsupported, I guess.
[11:54] <sancho> Guys, no advice on this one? : I'd like offer something to community. I have a server on the net with pretty fast and stable connection and I would like to offer a mirror for installations. How can I do this?
[11:54] <Amaranth> Stormx2: What card?
[11:54] <Stormx2> Amaranth: Old nvidia, 1 second.
[11:54] <nuked_omen> sancho, i tried searching on ubuntu.com, couldn't find a link whatsoever
[11:55] <Stormx2> Amaranth: Bleh. How do I get its name? I forget. Its like an NVIDIA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro
[11:55] <sancho> nuked_omen: Neither did I, I would not ask otherwise :-)
[11:55] <kitche> Stormx2: yeah you want the nvidia-legacy drivers
[11:55] <Amaranth> Stormx2: oh hell, that'll never be supported :)

[11:58] <holycow> i've packages some using a hack way back ... is there a decent shortish howto, the debian notes on packaging are too long

[11:59] <h6w> Hey, is it possible to make the gnome panel float above the applications rather than push them over?

[11:59] <Amaranth> kitche: They'll probably be in feisty too
[11:59] <nuked_omen> sancho, i'll probably contact the developers.. and also tell them to make it easier to participate
