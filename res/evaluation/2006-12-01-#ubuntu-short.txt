[12:01] <zeeble> JohnFlux: it was conflicting with something from bonjour. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35030/  <-- here's the error
[12:01] <whale> thank you
[12:01] <JohnFlux> zeeble: hmm that's not good
[12:02] <zeeble> JohnFlux: i know. removing bonjour helped. the rest of the kde install seems to be going good.

[12:02] <DavidW2> Hi.
[12:02] <DavidW2> /usr/bin/ldd: line 171: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: No such file or directory
[12:02] <DavidW2> ldd: /lib/ld-linux.so.2 exited with unknown exit code (127)
[12:02] <zeeble> JohnFlux: ok
[12:03] <bandaid> why would switching to a terminal view cause my ubuntu to crash?
[12:03] <DavidW2> Does ubuntu not have /lib/ld-linux.so.2, or is my ldd messed up? Either way, apt-get --reinstall doesn't seem to overwrite any files?
[12:03] <sorush21> how do I configure kernel?
[12:03] <stefg> burwaco: 'server' in ubuntu-speak == 'base system'... the next thing up to the foodchain over fluxbx  would be xfce then, indeed. but you have to manually select all the xfce packages, xubuntu-desktop will install alot of other cruft
[12:03] <alecjw> battlesquid: i've gotta go now. if you find a deb, install it using gdebi or sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb. if you find an rpm, do sudo alien -d <filename>.rpm then sudo dpkg -i outputfile>.deb
[12:04] <battlesquid> alecjw, ok thanks
[12:04] <lotusleaf> Where do I report a hardware bug in Edgy (Launchpad?) where a device used to work in Dapper doesn't in Edgy?

[12:06] <lllloo> hi folks
[12:07] <lllloo> i have a ide hardrive were ubuntu resides
[12:07] <lllloo> and my  windows installation happens to be on a raid partition  ,, STRIPPED type
[12:07] <billias> Hello people!
[12:07] <lllloo> when booting the log errors says theres I/O buffer error  i guess when trying to mount it its ntfs too
[12:08] <lllloo> any suggestions
[12:08] <lumpki> !generic
[12:09] <ubotu> Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[12:09] <H3g3m0n> lllloo: Try cfdisk the drive and see if it has the partitions you expect, also file -s /dev/drive
[12:09] <billias> I have a problem with my DVD-RAM on my laptop, I am using Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). There is no way I can mount it
[12:10] <lllloo> it says cannot open disk drive
[12:10] <burwaco> stefg: so I: apt-get install x-window-system xfce4 ?
[12:10] <lllloo> its like it hasnt even mounted it at all
[12:10] <lllloo> its a a stripped type
[12:11] <burwaco> !xfce4
[12:11] <ubotu> xfce4: meta-package for xfce4 dependencies. In component universe, is optional. Version 4.3.90.2 (edgy), package size 4 kB, installed size 48 kB
[12:11] <eilker> where is /tmp ?? i cant find it via konqueror
[12:11] <burwaco> huh?
[12:12] <burwaco> that can't be right...
[12:12] <lumpki> eilker, just type /tmp in the address bar
[12:13] <stefg> burwaco: as i said there's no simple installation of one or two packages... you've got to manually go through the package list in aptitude and select your wanted packages. all those meta-packages probably install stuff that you don't want
[12:13] <atoponce> how do i enter unicode into gnome-terminal?
[12:13] <eilker> lumpki: thank you, but what is its path ?
[12:14] <burwaco> stefg: isn't there a package like the gnome-base-system
[12:15] <atoponce> i can view utf-8, just can't enter the characters.  and it's driving me nuts. anyone know?
[12:15] <LinuxHelp> I've been looking at the packages in feisty, and I've found "kqemu-source", now the package description says "This package provides the source code for the kqemu kernel modules." BUT then it also says "it is a closed source proprietary product". So am I right in assuming that this is now an "open source" program, but it is just not "free software"?
[12:15] <patrick_king> how do i play midi files
[12:16] <stefg> xfce4 is such a meta-package... but there might even be stuff as a dependency (like the xfce4 print-manager) that you don't want...
[12:16] <LinuxHelp> Either way, the package description is confusing.
[12:16] <eilker> lumpki: i cant send pm, some registiration problem, thanx for info
[12:16] <Zaire> that server link told me nothing
[12:17] <patrick_king> !midi

[12:18] <stefg> that SuSE-feeling :-)
[12:18] <Spee_Der> lol
[12:18] <Zaire> I need a good free 2 way e-mail server anyone know of one...also prefereably easy to configure

[12:18] <Pie-rate> Hmm, wifi still isn't working quite well enough, networkmanager can see the network (unsecured wireless), but when i try to connect to it it doesn't work. its really low signal here but when the laptop had windows on it it was able to connect (barely)

[12:28] <jughead> hello, I have a question or two before i install ubuntu about partitions
[12:29] <systemrestore> ask jughead
[12:29] <jughead> I have a 100 gig hdd on my laptop that has windows on it.  does the ubuntu partitioner include a way to split the partition to make room for ubuntu?
[12:29] <tonyyarusso> jughead: yes
[12:29] <systemrestore> yes
[12:29] <tonyyarusso> !dualboot | jughead
[12:29] <ubotu> jughead: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[12:29] <jughead> Is it fairly reliable?
[12:29] <stefg> !install
[12:29] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[12:29] <systemrestore> of course
[12:29] <LjL> jughead: fairly... but resizing partitions is never quite a safe operation
[12:29] <tonyyarusso> jughead: If you read the instructions, it's fine.
[12:30] <jughead> ok...  I would like to dual boot but resizing partitions seemed dangerous
[12:30] <LjL> jughead: you definitely should have a backup of data you care about
[12:30] <iwkse> jughead: take care cause laptops has hidden s... partition
[12:30] <thor> jughead: I have a 100G in my laptop and split it into four pieces...15G for windows, 25 G for FAT32 (d drive) 15G for fat32 (e drive) and the rest (30G) for linux
[12:30] <shadowsong> jughead: do you have windows on dual boot?
[12:30] <thor> jughead: the fat32 partitions can be accessed (r/w) by both linux and windows, so they contain pics, music, etc
[12:30] <jughead> thor did you do that after the windows partition was there, or did you reformat and create your partitions?
[12:31] <bimberi> jughead: you should make sure you have backups
[12:31] <iwkse> thor: the same with ntfs
[12:31] <thor> jughead: first, no ntfs cannot be written by linux...it is purely experimental right now.
[12:31] <SamuraiCat> jughead: I just went through repartioning a Windows laptop to dual boot into Ubuntu.
[12:31] <jughead> SamuraiCat were you successful?
[12:31] <iwkse> thor: thats not true
[12:31] <bimberi> jughead: the resizer is safe but doesn't claim perfection
[12:32] <systemrestore> i just did that samurai with an ibm netvista
[12:32] <jughead> ok that's pretty good
[12:32] <SamuraiCat> The partitioner built into the current install process is pretty good.
[12:32] <iwkse> jughead: you can use ntfs and write safetly with linux too
[12:32] <_r00t_> pppd: In file /etc/ppp/peers/gp: unrecognized option '/dev/rfcomm0'
[12:32] <_r00t_> anyone help me with it please
[12:32] <SamuraiCat> My two biggest pieces of advice: 1) Read the install guides on the web.  They're pretty good.
[12:32] <jughead> the size limit for a fat32 partition is what 30 gig?
[12:32] <thor> jughead: as for the partitioning, when the install gets to that point choose 'Custom', tell it to leave 15G for windows, and 30G for linux. YOu can create the fat32 in either system, at install or later
[12:32] <iwkse> jughead: no limit
[12:32] <systemrestore> 32
[12:32] <SamuraiCat> And 2) make sure to defragment your disk.
[12:32] <systemrestore> 32gb for fat
[12:33] <thor> iwkse: everything I have read about it states to be careful...ntfs right now is not stable
[12:33] <jughead> yeah I'll defreag before I change it around
[12:33] <SamuraiCat> And don't use the Windows defragmenter; it's crap.

[12:33] <systemrestore> what do you like to defrag guys?
[12:33] <systemrestore> perfectdisk
[12:33] <iwkse> thor: have you also read about ntfs-3g?
[12:34] <_r00t_> systemrestore, hey can you help me ?
[12:34] <systemrestore> with?
[12:34] <SamuraiCat> Jughead: I've already forgotten what I used; I googled for 5-10 minutes, found a few free candidates, and grabbed one.  Did a nice job in just a few minutes.
