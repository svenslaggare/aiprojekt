[12:01] <ubotu> ashley_: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[12:01] <ubun> what's wrong with installing codecs manually
[12:01] <kitche> ashley_: people have broken their install with it many times and I know LjL is getting tired in helping people fix it
[12:01] <ubun> at least ubuntu has dependency resolution
[12:01] <DavidRiep> !info unrar-fre
[12:01] <ubotu> Package unrar-fre does not exist in any distro I know
[12:02] <DavidRiep> thank you

[12:02] <ashley_> I know it installed some things that didn't show up like picassa
[12:02] <amaia_> IMHO automatix is helping a lot of people migrating from window$ to linux. you make it sound like it is a clock bomb :D
[12:03] <DARKGuy> agent: ah yes, I've tried that one too, didn't like it much :P
[12:03] <jrib> can the automatix discussion be moved to #ubuntu-offtopic please?
[12:03] <DARKGuy> Not to start a flamefight, but I agree with amaia_ oO
[12:03] <DARKGuy> roger that :P
[12:03] <lubix> ashley_: they are on your computer you just have to run from terminal
[12:03] <lubix> jrib: why?
[12:03] <LjL> lubix: because it is not ontopic.
[12:03] <jrib> lubix: because #ubuntu is for support
[12:03] <lubix> ok

[12:07] <jrib> !w32codecs > ValMarko
[12:08] <ValMarko> tanks

[12:10] <ValMarko> where can I get w32codecs ?
[12:10] <lostinc> Is there a program or set of programs that can help recover deleted files from a ext3 formatted hard-drive?

[12:16] <emosamurai> I reboot my computer, but it won't run off the live cd.
[12:16] <ashley_> lol hi emosamurai nice nick
[12:16] <emosamurai> It's awesome.
[12:16] <emosamurai> Wanna hear the explanation?
[12:16] <ashley_> sure
[12:16] <fredrich> FATAL: Module prism2_cs not found. :(
[12:16] <emosamurai> Okay, the thing is, samurai are emo.
[12:16] <ashley_> lmao why?
[12:16] <emosamurai> They think it's okay to cry(really) and they write poems about death and the evanescence of beauty.
[12:16] <emosamurai> Plus, when they get depressed, they cut themselves.
[12:17] <d1gital> I have just upgraded to edgy from dapper, and now my wireless does not work.
[12:17] <ashley_> lmao Im putting that on my msn status message my friends will get a kick out of that

[12:17] <emosamurai> So yeah, samurai are emo.
[12:17] <bat0> fredrich: try find /lib/modules -name "prism*"
[12:17] <emosamurai> I was just wondering, what the hell should I do to make my boot cd boot?
[12:17] <emosamurai> When I restart my computer, it goes to the battery recalibration screen, and then straight to Windows.
[12:17] <emosamurai> It doesn't start up Ubuntu.
[12:17] <emosamurai> What should I do?
[12:18] <fredrich> bat0, theres a heap of prism2_cs modules for the different kernels
[12:18] <ashley_> did you go into your bios emosamurai
[12:18] <ashley_> and change the boot order?
[12:18] <emosamurai> No... how do you do that?
[12:18] <emosamurai> :.(...
[12:18] <emosamurai> The periods are tears.
[12:18] <ashley_> um press f10 I think when your computer boots

[12:19] <ashley_> np
[12:19] <mikefoo> find . -name *.mp3 -exec id3info '{}' \; | grep -Hi string - The filename is "standard input" I think im missing an option in the exec, how can I get the filename also. Anyone know?

[12:21] <nicola> is there a way to determine which packages got installed recently ?
[12:21] <DavidRiep> thanks for your help guys it's been great! :)
[12:24] <xpander25007> for c development... is there an IDE or similar you can recommend?
[12:24] <idefix_> it isn't so that when you once post a problem here some lawful hackers can fix it while you're away from your PC?
[12:25] <mjr> xpander25007, shan't recommend, but options include anjuta, eclipse, kdevelop
[12:25] <bat0> xpander25007: i like eclipse
[12:26] <cntb> setxkbmap -option grp:lswitch,grp:lalt_toggle,caps:shift_lock,grp_led:scroll,numpad:microsoft,grp:alt_shift_toggle
[12:26] <cntb> what is wrong
[12:26] <cntb> alt+shift  wont change language
[12:27] <wylde> what does it mean when the nickserve sends me this:  If this is your nickname, type /msg NickServ IDENTIFY <password>?
[12:27] <j1p> Has anyone installed the newer Intel 915GM drivers on their laptop?
[12:28] <xpander25007> mjr, thanks, which is the lightest?
[12:29] <xpander25007> bat0, eclipse works for C?
[12:29] <mjr> xpander25007, possibly anjuta. And yes it does.
[12:29] <cox377> can anyone recommend a way to speed up ubuntu
[12:29] <cox377> its feeling a little sluggish recently
[12:29] <cox377> not sure why
[12:29] <mjr> see eclipse-cdt
[12:30] <speeddemon8803> cox377 more ram maybe...but that costs a lil
[12:30] <Rasta> i installed the nvidia-xgl package with synaptic but when i type "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" i get this message: "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[12:30] <wylde> cox377: try using xfce
[12:30] <Rasta> the nvidia driver for your running kernel." , someone has a troble with that before? i cant seem to install beryl :(
[12:30] <cox377> wylde: i didnt really want to move away from ubuntu
[12:30] <cox377> wylde: just looking for tweaks
[12:30] <wylde> it is ubuntu
[12:30] <speeddemon8803> it doesnt move it...it is..just a different desktop environment :)
[12:30] <wylde> only with a differnt look
[12:30] <cox377> !xfce
[12:30] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[12:31] <speeddemon8803> thanks cox377 was about to do that :)
[12:31] <xpander25007> thanks bat,mjr
[12:32] <gilt> hello everybody...can anbody tell me where to get video 4 linyx 2 with framework version 2.0
[12:32] <cox377> speeddemon8803: is there no way to actually speedit up? no tweaks
[12:32] <speeddemon8803> do the xubuntu or you could do ram upgrades
[12:32] <Rasta> there is a way so i can know what type of video card i have(ati/nvidia) with ubuntu?
[12:32] <econobeing> so i can have the audio of a movie(VLC player) and music(rhythmbox) going at the same time, but i don't get video on my video. but i can't watch a youtube video and have rhythmbox going at the same time...
[12:33] <Turtl1> hi, i have a slight problem
[12:33] <mjr> Rasta, lspci
[12:33] <Turtl1> my edgy won't boot anymore
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[12:33] <speeddemon8803> cox377 you could try those suggestions
[12:33] <gilt> hello everybody...can anbody tell me where to get video 4 linux 2 with framework version 2.0
[12:33] <Rasta> mjr, ok ill try
[12:33] <mjr> Rasta, it'll spew out contents of your box, there should be a line or two about display or vga controllers
[12:33] <Turtl1> it stops at Loading Enterprise Volume Management
[12:33] <econobeing> actually sometimes the video shows, like when i double click the videofile and it opens, but as soon as i click on the video player or anything it blacks out
[12:34] <gilt> <turtl1> what the probl;em
[12:34] <cox377> speeddemon8803: ok so nothing without great change?
[12:34] <speeddemon8803> um....im still kinda new so there might be other ways
[12:34] <speeddemon8803> they might now a few other ways so stay put :)
[12:34] <Turtl1> gilt: Edgy stopped booting for me, it doesn't get past "Loading Enterprise Volume Management System" or something
[12:35] <d1gita1> i just upgraded from dapper to edgy, for the sake of being able to use beryl.. now i just have one question.  how do i install beryl??
[12:35] <mikefoo> find . -name *.mp3 -exec id3info '{}' \; | grep -Hi string - The filename is "standard input" I think im missing an option in the exec, how can I get the filename also. Anyone know?
[12:35] <wylde> !beryl
[12:35] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:35] <umgan> i have an issue w/ a newly formatted and mounted drive if anyone has a second
[12:35] <gilt> i think filesystem has gone corrupted or some module problem...get a live cd and boot and do a filesystem check
[12:35] <Turtl1> gilt: I'm booting off the live cd now
[12:35] <tamgo> trying to get a guide for installing enlightenment 17 in edgy. Everything I fine is at least a year old and has some strange hacks. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[12:35] <mjr> mikefoo, strange, that seems about right to me
[12:36] <d1gita1> i know what beryl does, i just need to know how to install/us it
[12:36] <Turtl1> gilt: how do i do a filesystem check?
[12:36] <wylde> will a pentium 2 run xubuntu fine?\
[12:36] <d1gita1> fsck
[12:36] <wylde> it tells ya on the page
[12:36] <mjr> wylde, yes; it's more about the memory

[12:37] <Jewsus> o_o
[12:38] <j1p> Has anyone installed the newer Intel 915GM drivers on their laptop? Or know how to enable 3d acceleration on i810 driver?
=== Hit3k_ is now known as Hit3k
[12:39] <Turtl1> gilt: thanks, are there any options i should be passing? I have a SATA laptop hard drive that's configured for dual boot
[12:40] <d1gita1> could someone just point me in the right direction as to where to find a beryl .deb or an apt repository for it?
[12:41] <wylde> dlgital: you need to edit your repository list I think
[12:41] <wylde> dlgital: then apt-get will do it
[12:41] <Turtl1> d1gita1: there's a few Howtos in the Ubuntu forums depending on which graphics card you have
[12:43] <d1gita1> which repositories should i add?
[12:44] <Turtl1> gilt: it just says that the filesystem is clean when I do fsck /dev/sda2
[12:45] <gilt> <turtl1>ok..try to reboot and see
[12:46] <gilt> <turtl1>if it doesnot work there meay be some module confliction
[12:46] <agent> how do i check what device was mounted at a certain mount point if it is not listed in fstab?
[12:46] <umgan> anyone have time to help me out w/ a drive that works but doesnt show up on the desktop?

[12:49] <ubun> when i right-click on my ipod device on the desktop to eject it it won't let me, says only root can unmount it, is there a way to get sudo or somethin to work from the right click menu?
[12:50] <agent> ubun: there is something wrong with how it is being mounted or used
[12:50] <ubun> i'm not using it abnormally as far as i know :/
[12:51] <agent> ubun: it may be that you are not closing all applications that are using it or you have an application that refuses to close (even if it looks like it is closed)
[12:51] <ubun> if i just pull the ipod out without ejecting it first whats the worst that can happen?
=== alvarom is now known as daniminas
[12:51] <agent> ubun: filesystem corrupts (= you have to format it)
[12:52] <agent> ubun: it should not hurt the hardware though
[12:52] <dave> is there some new mp3 codec that ubuntu doesnt support by default?
[12:52] <dave> i just got a bunch of mp3's offo f ktorrent, and none of them seem to work at all
[12:52] <mjr> dave, no, it's the same old mp3 that ubuntu doesn't support by default
[12:52] <ubun> ubuntu doesnt support any mp3 by default

[12:52] <dave> well you know what i mean, above about beyond gstreamer
[12:52] <umgan> any idea how to add an icon for a newly formatted drive to the desktop? and places -> computer
[12:52] <agent> there is more than one version of mp3?
[12:52] <dave> i dunno thats what im wonderin
[12:53] <agent> dave: that would not make sense... why would it still be called mp3? :)
[12:53] <ubun> well mp4 maybe but that's diff :P
[12:53] <mjr> well, I've seen some mp3 audio files packaged in wavs, maybe it's something similarly exotic
[12:53] <agent> dave: gstreamer does nto support mp3 by default
[12:53] <addicted68098> mp4 is more compressed
[12:53] <ubun> vlc media player plays mp3s by default but ubuntu doesnt come with vlc by default
[12:54] <dave> can someone try this for me? http://projectlink.homelinux.com/cometogether.mp3
[12:54] <umgan> i would reccoment downloading automatix2 and using it to install all the codecs and stuff you will need
[12:54] <dave> well all other mp3's work
[12:54] <agent> dave: don't download automatix :)

[12:55] <dave> but i just got these albums off ktorrent and none of them seem to work, they're all full complete files, they just dont seem to be mp3's
[12:55] <umgan> works fine for me if i just install 1 or 2 things at a time =P good for nubs like me
[12:55] <agent> dave: if you hae mp3 support and that mp3 does not play it means its a broken mp3
[12:55] <econobeing> my god
[12:55] <dave> yeah but like 40 broken mp3's ?
[12:55] <agent> :D
[12:55] <econobeing> O_O i think i've fixed everything in ubuntu i needed

[12:56] <econobeing> there's NOTHING that doesn't work like i want it to :O
[12:56] <umgan> i have 1 more issue till i'm happy
[12:56] <agent> econobeing: you should not have broken them in the first place ;P
[12:56] <d1gita1> dave:  what mediaplayer are you using?
[12:56] <agent> dave: that mp3 does not stream for me
[12:56] <umgan> i jsut have a small problem (well im guessing its small)
[12:56] <econobeing> well...you know, when it installs it doesn't like broadcom wifi, had to get 915 resolution, video codes, alsa audio didn't work, etc
[12:56] <dave> http://projectlink.homelinux.com/cometogether.mp3 anyone mind confirming that this is corrupted so i dont continue this search for nothing
[12:56] <dave> ok
[12:57] <dave> so corrupted files

[12:57] <dave> i just popped it on my webserver to see if anyone else had any luck
[12:57] <agent> dave: give me 2 min download is taking a long time
[12:57] <ubun> though slowly but surely ubuntu is replacing windows for me

[12:58] <ubun> the ipod stuff should be working but some stuff is lockin it
[12:59] <agent> ubun: yeah, ipod is not good linux hardware... apple doesnt like you using ipod on linux ;)

[01:02] <econobeing> i've never seen it get used
[01:02] <wubrgamer> yes it does
[01:02] <wubrgamer> but that doesn't matter
[01:02] <agent> ubun: you know you can always sell that ipod and get something that uses ogg and works 100% in linux
[01:02] <wubrgamer> my dillema is should I get 10 gigs or a remote ?
[01:02] <econobeing> i'd be using 770MB/1GB of my ram and swap would be empty
[01:02] <wubrgamer> (a nice remote)
[01:02] <econobeing> does it only use it when absolutely necessary or something?
[01:03] <agent> ubun: when i switched to linux years and years ago thats what i did.... sold all the crap windows hardware and bought linux friendly stuff
[01:03] <ubun> =] 
[01:03] <agent> how do i check what device was mounted at a certain mount point if it is not listed in fstab?

[01:05] <agent> thank you jrib and itsmabus that was my stupid question for the week... who would have though it was that easy ;)
[01:05] <itsmabus> reakin: do you have alsa compiled into the kernel?
[01:05] <wubrgamer> well, laters
[01:05] <umgan> could someone help me out w/ an icon/partition problem?
[01:05] <jrib> !someone | umgan
[01:05] <ubotu> umgan: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[01:05] <genben> hi, i want to install ubuntu_edgy_server version but want to know if it will come with all libs, even tho' it has no X?
[01:06] <umgan> jrib lol i did 3 times earlier =P
[01:06] <kishan> can any one help with networking please i am unable to access my linux box from windows
[01:06] <jrib> genben: "all the libs" ?  what libs?
[01:06] <umgan> i know u all are busy
[01:06] <genben> X libs, gtk
[01:06] <agent> kishan: fix windows ;P
[01:06] <kishan> sure agent
[01:06] <kishan> lol
[01:06] <agent> hehe
[01:06] <jrib> umgan: describe the problem in one line
[01:06] <kishan> agent do u know any thing about it
[01:06] <agent> i have a quit one liner fix for you ;P
[01:06] <php-freak_> hey guys ubuntu email program sucked all my e-mails from my yahoo inbox into its inbox how can I get them back into my web interface e-mail?
[01:07] <agent> php-freak: are you using paid yahoo or free?
[01:07] <gilt> hello everybody...can anbody tell me where to get video 4 linyx 2 with framework version 2.0
[01:07] <WizCraker> if the server is on the local network but I want to use the local domain name to get to the server how would I go about doing that?
[01:07] <tonyyarusso> php-freak_: Did you use POP?  If so, you can't.
[01:07] <pluma> Is there a way to set up a program to be executed when the shell (e.g. tty1-6) idles for longer than a minute? Basically like blank, except it runs a program in the foreground (screensaver, basically) rather than blanking the screen.
[01:07] <umgan> i unmounted a drive in ntfs...used gparted to format it to ext3.  with the help of a friend i got the drive remounted and i can access it with the file system.  However, the drive no longer shows on my desktop or in places --> computer
[01:07] <php-freak_> tonyyarusso, yes i used pop
[01:08] <tonyyarusso> :(
[01:08] <php-freak> yea i know
[01:08] <jrib> genben: no, but why would you want them on a server with no X?   You can install X later if you want, then you would get them
[01:08] <funkyHat> Anyone got ipw2200 working with WPA-PSK?
[01:08] <agent> php-freak: pop will usually erase your emails on server
[01:08] <pluma> umgan: did you check your fstab?
[01:08] <genben> jrib: there are a few app i needs that depend on X11 unfortunately
[01:08] <jrib> genben: what apps?
[01:08] <daniminas> i need to make a python script win SQLite... to use sqlite on ubuntu what i need to install? Thanks!
[01:09] <genben> looking
[01:09] <agent> php-freak: you are sol yahoo does not have any way of uploading files... you would have to send all your emails to your yahoo account (not good solution)
[01:09] <umgan> pluma the NEW uuid is unknown so we replaced it with /media/hda1 and it works i'm not sure how else to edit the fstab to make the icon show
[01:09] <php-freak> I Know that sucks
[01:09] <jrib> genben: well when you install with apt, it will pull in whatever you need
[01:09] <php-freak> fuck
[01:09] <php-freak> damit pisses me off
[01:09] <kishan> hi any one can help with samba sever
[01:09] <jrib> !language | php-freak
[01:09] <ubotu> php-freak: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:09] <jrib> !samba | kishan
[01:09] <ubotu> kishan: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[01:09] <corevette> how do i improve the fps in world of warcraft?
[01:10] <RawSewage> Question:  I ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  then ESC before finishing.  now it says it's locked.  how can I unlock it
[01:10] <RawSewage> I already tried sudo dpkg --configure -a
[01:10] <pluma> umgan: if in doubt, remove the NTFS drive from /etc/fstab if it's in there and replace it with the correct ext3 partition's instructions. Then unmount it and remount it in the GNOME disk manager
[01:10] <RawSewage>  /var/cache/debconf/config.dat is locked by another process
[01:10] <pluma> umgan: At least that's how I fixed a similar problem last week ^^
[01:10] <umgan> pluma ok i did the first part of that...thats how we got it working....but let me try that second part
[01:11] <cntb> any chance for links like mms://athav01.forthnet.gr/polis in ubuntu ?
[01:11] <umgan> pluma can i use pysdm to unmount and remount?
[01:11] <w3ccv> RawSewage, off hand I don't know where lock files are kept u U, probably in /var/lock - find the dpkg lock and remove it.
[01:11] <ashley_> corvette check out my friends website http://www.niknights.net/
[01:12] <batina> i new to linux. can somebody tell me how can i read UDF dvds?
[01:12] <RawSewage> w3ccv, ok ty
[01:12] <pluma> umgan: Actually, I just rebooted, but I guess unmounting should work too.
[01:12] <aSt3raL_>  /join #avr
[01:12] <umgan> pluma hmm no change...i also tried rebooting earlier
[01:12] <genben> jrib: can't remember but is to do with rails + mongrel + nginx etc
[01:12] <aSt3raL_> heh
[01:13] <umgan> pluma the drive works fine itsjust that theres no icon
[01:13] <jrib> genben: well whatever is available to the desktop is available to the server, they use the same repository
[01:13] <genben> nm, i'll deal with it as happens
[01:13] <genben> thank you
[01:13] <pluma> umgan: Hm... odd. Does it appear properly in the GNOME disk info stuffs (disk admin, space monitor in System Monitor)?
[01:14] <pluma> s/space monitor/devices tab/
[01:15] <umgan> pluma it shows up in system monitor file systems tab...if thats not what u mean i'ms till a bit of a nub ><
[01:15] <reakin> can anyone help me figure out why my built-in soundcard stopped working after installing the latest ALSA drivers? alsaconf detects it, says it is installing what is necessary, but aplay -l still says the soundcard is not working.  It is an HDA-Intel, I also have an RME HDSP Multiface that is somewhat working.
[01:16] <pluma> umgan: I mean the GUI based programs. Menu->System->Administration->Disks for example
[01:16] <econobeing> ktorrent seems to be moving rather slowly
[01:16] <cmt^^> !mp3
[01:16] <umgan> hmm i dont have one called disks
[01:16] <umgan> pluma hmm i dont have one called disks
[01:17] <umgan> pluma however it shows up on pydsm jsut fine
[01:17] <cmt^^> Where did the bot go?
[01:17] <MikeyMike> does anyone know if there is a plugin for gaim that logs the away messages of others?
[01:17] <cmt^^> ubotu -
[01:17] <cmt^^> hm
[01:17] <pluma> umgan: try gksu disks-admin
[01:17] <kash> ok, a little lost here
[01:17] <kash> i've used FreeBSD my whole life and decided to try Ubuntu
[01:18] <kash> but i'm a little confused.. why not package headers with apps/libs?
[01:18] <corevette> does anyone know how to improve the fps in world of warcraft under wine?
[01:18] <cmt^^> !ati
[01:18] <Music_Shuffle1> Question real quick. If I want all my machines to share files with NFS inter-machine, do I need NFS server installed on all?
[01:18] <jrib> kash: most people probably won't need headers
[01:18] <pluma> umgan: Hm... no idea then. I'm not much of an expert myself either.
[01:19] <kash> jrib: that's retarded
[01:19] <daniminas> waht i need to install to use sqlite + python on my ubuntu?
[01:19] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, if you want all machines to share out files, then yes they all must be NFS servers
[01:19] <umgan> pluma hmm well thanks anyways :)
[01:20] <jrib> kash: not sure why, but feel free to continue the discussion in #ubuntu-offtopic (#ubuntu we keep for support issues)
[01:20] <umgan> anyone else care to take a stab? lol
[01:20] <Music_Shuffle1> Ok, and if I want to share my home folder, I should put into my /etc/exports the line '/home *(rw, async)'?
[01:21] <_azrael> w3ccv: That's false
[01:21] <w3ccv> _azrael, ok, esplain
[01:21] <agent> daniminas: sqlite, python and the needed sqlite python lib (or the needed python sqlite lib)... yes, that is not very helpful, but its a start... search the repos for python and sqlite and see if you can find the mentioned packages
[01:21] <_azrael> w3ccv: If you make a single nfs server, and mount it to another machine you want sharing, then putting files in that nfs directory makes them available on the main nfs server.
[01:21] <w3ccv> s/esp/exp/
[01:22] <_azrael> w3ccv: i.e. server has nfs+storage, client1 puts file in a "share" directory, which is really just an nfs mount from the server. Client2 mounts nfs share, sees file which client1 puts on there.
[01:22] <Music_Shuffle1> So if machine A is the current server, and B is the only node on it, and I want files from B -> C, I just need to install client NFS software on C?
[01:22] <_azrael> MusicShuffle1: Sorry, what do you mean by a "node" on it.
[01:23] <Music_Shuffle1> Right. Except I want them to be able to move the files without needing any specific one on.
[01:23] <_azrael> ?
=== yama` is now known as yama
[01:23] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: Ah. Then you would need them all NFS, or, my personal reccomendation would just be an rsync.
[01:23] <Music_Shuffle1> rsync?
[01:23] <daniminas> agent: thanks, im already seaching.. a lot of libs.. :S
[01:24] <_azrael> rsync is something that incrementally copies files in the same way that scp does
[01:24] <_azrael> For example:
[01:24] <_azrael> rsync heaven:~ ~/azrael
[01:24] <_azrael> would copy my home directory on heaven to a folder in my home directory here calld azrael
[01:24] <umgan> ok whoever is the ultimate ubuntu guru i need help lol
[01:24] <_azrael> Now if I ran this again, it would do md5 sums on all the stuff in my local directory, and check it against remote md5 sums
[01:25] <umgan> been through 3 people already lol
[01:25] <_azrael> The result is that it would then only copy the changed files
[01:25] <_azrael> So if you set it up so that once a day or so, each of the 3 computers rsyncs to one another,
[01:25] <x-r00t-x> i need help with bluetooth. i can send file from pc to cellphone but i cant send file from cellphone to pc
[01:25] <Music_Shuffle1> Ah...ok. If I'm..relatively new to NFS in general, what would your rec. be to do?
[01:25] <lovloss> f everyone knew about linux i doubt anyone would use windows
[01:25] <SilentDis> hello :)
[01:26] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: Well, what _specifically_ is your task
[01:26] <lovloss> Hey SilentDis
[01:26] <SilentDis> having grub problems... is ubotu having some sort of issue?  he don't wanna talk to me :(
[01:26] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: You've described a 1-time transfer, but I don't know if this needs to be done in real time or what. All I know is you need to be able to do some sort of decentralized transfer.
[01:26] <SilentDis> !grub
[01:26] <Music_Shuffle1> I don't want to delegate one spec. machine as a fileserver...I want the various files I need scattered on multiple drives on multiple machines, and I want to be able to sorta...pull from whichever as I need it.
[01:26] <lingkun> hi everyoe
[01:26] <Ubotwo> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[01:26] <umgan> i need help w/ a partition that is mounted and working but not showing as an icon
[01:26] <SilentDis> oh, he got renamed lol
[01:27] <cmt^^> !mp3
[01:27] <Ubotwo> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:27] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: OK. I can tell you how to do that, but if that were set up, it would not allow you to easily pick which hard drive you were writing to. Is that OK?
[01:27] <SilentDis> thank you ubotwu :)
[01:27] <tonyyarusso> !bot | SilentDis
[01:27] <Ubotwo> This is a temporary Ubotu replacement.
[01:28] <tonyyarusso> ubotu took too many sleeping pills it seems
[01:28] <umgan> i need help w/ a partition that is mounted and working but not showing as an icon
[01:28] <_azrael> i.e. we can have a folder that contains data from all 3 machines, but if you make a new file in that folder, I can't tell what machine it'll be on.
[01:28] <Ubotwo> Sorry, package searching is not available - try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[01:28] <x-r00t-x> lol @ ubotwo
[01:28] <mumbles> anyone know how to rest a mysql root password ?
[01:28] <w3ccv> umgan, if you close your eyes you won't see that the icon isn't there.  It's not really important, they just clutter the screen an block the airline traytable image
[01:28] <kitche> mumbles: I just follow the mysql howto since it's lengthy
[01:29] <mumbles> you got a link handy ?
[01:29] <mumbles> kitche,  yeh ive tired for about 1/2 an hour now
[01:29] <jrib> mumbles: it's on the official mysql site in their documentation iirc
[01:29] <lingkun> i agree with you w3ccv   :)
[01:29] <_azrael> mumbles: I'm not an expert on mysql, but I'm pretty sure you can't do that.
[01:29] <Music_Shuffle1> Well, I mean, I want one drive for movies, one for music, one for documents, etc...I just want the separate drives, rather than being all on the same machine, to be on diff. machines. If the term 'decentralized fileserving network' makes any sense. xD
[01:29] <mumbles> _azrael, realy ?
[01:29] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:29] <umgan> w3ccv yeah but it bugs me that the icon doesnt show in places --> computer
[01:29] <x-r00t-x> lol @ ubotwo
[01:30] <x-r00t-x> i need help with bluetooth. i can send file from pc to cellphone but i cant send file from cellphone to pc
[01:30] <kitche> mumbles: yeah got one http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html
[01:30] <cmt^^> Where can I find a list of programs to convert from .avi and .mp3 to their free-format equivalents?
[01:30] <_azrael> mumbles: I stand corrected. Listen to kitche.
[01:30] <graham_100> winehq
[01:30] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: OK, makes sense now. I can help you with that.
[01:30] <w3ccv> umgan, relzx, have a homebrew, don't worry about it.  most of time my icn't are no there either
[01:30] <corevette> how come when i change the settings for nvidia to make wow run on openGL, wow says unable to startup 3d accelerator
[01:30] <graham_100> #winehq
[01:30] <Music_Shuffle1> ^^
[01:31] <kitche> cmt^^: avi is just a container
[01:31] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: Have you set up any NFS servers before?
[01:31] <Music_Shuffle1> I don't need help -yet-, I just need to know if its possible before I get this new machine. xD
[01:31] <Nookie^> !networkprinter
[01:31] <Nookie^> why doesnt bot work?
[01:31] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: Oh, OK, it's definitely possible.
[01:31] <cmt^^> kitche - well you get my point
[01:31] <Music_Shuffle1> Set this one up yesterday...it works so far >.> Lol
[01:31] <cmt^^> from *.free-format
[01:31] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: I thought you were trying to do a distributed filesystem, which is slightly different and orders of magnitude harder.
[01:31] <kitche> cmt^^: well avi can be xvid and such or any other free video format
[01:32] <_azrael> Music_Shuffle1: But if they're going in separate folders, all is well.
[01:32] <umgan> w3ccv lol well it bugs me...its that last annoying little thing till i have linux running properly (minus bluetooth reconnects that dont work)
[01:33] <lime4x4> how can i have firefox 2.0 use xmms to play mp3's from a webserver instead of having the mozilla-mplayer pluggin in ubuntu
[01:33] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, once you have NFS set up on one machine - it's easy to do the same on many
[01:33] <ubuntero> #cedega
[01:33] <Music_Shuffle1> Question aboutt eh /etc/exports file though.
[01:33] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, then learn how to set up the auto-mount system
[01:34] <umgan> i need help w/ a partition that is mounted and working but not showing as an icon
[01:34] <Xappe> lime4x4: perhaps you could use the extension MediaPlayerConnectivity
[01:34] <ubuntero_> join pepin
[01:34] <Music_Shuffle1> w3ccv,  WHen I edit it, if I say '/files *(rw,async)', what's that going to do?
=== Crankymonky is now known as Spirochete
[01:34] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1: you have to edit the fstab file to include the devices and the folders they go in.
[01:35] <agent> daniminas: the easiest way is to read sqlites website and search google for sqlite python - that should tell you what package you need
[01:35] <Music_Shuffle1> Right, I got that, except...when I reboot my router/modem, the IP's of the machines change, so in my /etc/exports, I need to include something for that, or it dies.
[01:35] <Music_Shuffle1> So if I use a * before the (rw as opposed to a specific IP, it'll be ok, yes?
[01:36] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1: woo thats complicated.
[01:36] <corevette> how do i make nvidia use openGL for rendering? which command
[01:36] <kitche> corevette: you sure it's not using openGL already?
[01:36] <daniminas> agent: ok, thanks.. i find this package: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/misc/sqlite.. but,.. hmm.
[01:36] <kudzubane> !nvidia
[01:36] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:37] <Music_Shuffle1> lovloss, heh...so I can't just use the * to allow it from all IP's? Or should I specify as like 192.168.1.*?
[01:37] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, the machines then all become servers - they most probably should have fixed addresses
[01:37] <J-_> when installing the ubuntu 6.06 LAMP server, *then* xubuntu so I have a gui, xubuntu shouldn't overwrite the server, no? whenever i search to see if apache, or mysql is installed, it isn't. It's never happened before, would this be a confliction between ubuntu and xubuntu, or what?
=== Frankenstein_AFK is now known as Frankenstein
[01:37] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, for example  music, movie, etc.
[01:37] <Music_Shuffle1> How do I set fixed ones?
[01:37] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1: I think i would allow all IPs personally
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[01:37] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, and put them in your hosts file
[01:37] <kitche> J-: the xubuntu-desktop doesn't touch servers besides X of course
[01:38] <Music_Shuffle1> lovloss, I think that's what I'll do...just because...I dunno how to set it up otherwise. :p
[01:38] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1: Yeah, plus your in Linux so... security issues arent that big a deal
[01:38] <agent> daniminas: you are trying too hard... i just did a google for "python sqlite" and the first 3 hits gave good information
[01:39] <Music_Shuffle1> Well, I'm making it rw...what are the odds of someone else accessing the drive and erasing it all? >.> Good?
=== scrumptious is now known as numist
[01:39] <J-_> kitche: okay, i just don't understand why apache and mysql wasn't installed when I installed LAMP
[01:39] <lovloss> heh. very very bad, Music_Shuffle1
[01:39] <kitche> Music_Shuffle1: just hope that your NFS servers won't be seen on the internet since they are very insecure
[01:39] <daniminas> agent: thanks, there i go.. )
[01:39] <Music_Shuffle1> Seen online? You're not serious, are you? >.>
[01:40] <agent> daniminas: i will save you the trouble....
[01:40] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1: Well as you are linux and using dial up, and not windows on broadband, you are at the very bottom of a hacker's black list
[01:40] <agent> daniminas: just install python-pysqlite2 package ;)
[01:41] <w3ccv> Music_Shuffle1, get a firewall of some kind, don't allow NFS in, or possibly out
[01:41] <Music_Shuffle1> lovloss, Linux and broadband.* =/
[01:41] <agent> daniminas: you need sqlite3 not 2
[01:41] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1:  Oh! Well , how good's your router
[01:41] <Music_Shuffle1> Quite? Haven't had all my files ransacked yet. xD
[01:42] <kitche> Music_Shuffle1: as long as you keep NFS hidden(from people on the net) or even use a port knocker you'll be good
[01:42] <lovloss> Music_Shuffle1: Personally i hate messing with IPs and ports. The website of your router often has good info on it.
[01:42] <mumbles> thanks whoever it was that helped me
[01:42] <kitche> Mumbles: no problem I use that how-to alot sometimes :)
[01:43] <priich> Any suggestion on what do do with this error :     "intel_ioctl.c:62: intelEmitIrqLocked: Assertion `((*(int *)intel->driHwLock)" . Comes up pretty much every time i want to use opengl for something.
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[01:43] <mumbles> ive lernt the lession now
[01:43] <daniminas> agent: ok,.. and.. thats it?... i dont need some server.. or.. ? )))
[01:43] <mumbles> bookmark eveything
[01:43] <mdious> kitche:  what are your thoughts on keeping it hidden...portmapper stuff in hosts.allow and deny...and using ip address/range for access?
[01:43] <Music_Shuffle1> kitche, I could just unmount the drive when I don't need it, couldn't I? Solve the issue?
[01:43] <kitche> Music_Shuffle1: the server would still be running though
[01:44] <agent> daniminas: all you need installed are python, sqlite and that python-sqlite package :)
[01:44] <kitche> mdious: the portmap is good but I use a port knocker also it's more advance a port knocker is but it works
[01:44] <econobeing> this torrent isn't going nearly as fast as it did in windows O_o
[01:44] <daniminas> agent: gereat, thanks verry much...
[01:44] <agent> daniminas: a server is just a name for any computer that is used to serve things to other computers....
[01:45] <tFF> hello... can some1 explain why i "dpkg-reconfigure locales" doesn't bring interface windows with locale chooser (ubuntu 6.06)? i've damage the brain solving it.. nothing helps
[01:45] <umgan> i need help w/ a partition that is mounted and working but not showing as an icon
[01:45] <J-_> !LAMP
[01:45] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[01:45] <lovloss> econobeing: I dont see how the OS could affect download speed, maybe its just slow today?
[01:45] <daniminas> agent: now to work... :S..

[01:45] <mdious> econobeing:  that is because windows lets everything in and out you probably have some decent firewalling happening on linux LOL

[01:46] <mdious> kitche:  just getting into NFS a bit...never heard of a port knocker
[01:46] <kitche> econobeing: you want to disable ipv6 and it should be faster
[01:46] <kitche> mdious: well you have to "ping" certain ports to get access to the port you want
[01:46] <umgan> i need help w/ a partition that is mounted and working but not showing as an icon
[01:47] <lovloss> kitche: Do you think its a good idea to re-enable it after you downloaded stuff?
[01:47] <jvai> hey every1!!
[01:47] <kitche> lovloss: only if you use it it slows down the net if you have it enabled if you don't use ipv6
[01:47] <kudzubane> lovloss: if you don't use it, why re-enable?
[01:48] <mdious> kitche:  apparently disabling ipv6 helps kde networking doesn't it?
[01:48] <kitche> lovloss: for example I have a ipv6 tunnel but I don't use it
[01:48] <lovloss> ogh i always thought it was a firewall
[01:48] <kitche> mdious: it helps in everything firefox any networking stuff
[01:48] <umgan> i need help w/ a partition that is mounted and working but not showing as an icon
[01:48] <lovloss> Righto
[01:49] <anandanbu> is there any GUI app fro the pppoe configuration in the Ubuntu

[01:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xenerama - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:49] <mdious> kitche:  there is a simple way to turn it off right...echo something...do you know it off the top of your head or do i have to go look it up before i go insane thinking about it...ah screw it i'm going to grab it i saw it just the other day hehe
[01:49] <delight> !xinerama
[01:49] <ubotu> xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[01:50] <lovloss> umgan: What it does is looks at your computer's automount and throws things on your desktop so you can access them. Mounting something manually to a oflder somewhere wont do that
[01:50] <miraculix> hi everyone!
[01:51] <Rocito> Hi just coming in to ask
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[01:51] <Rocito> is there a way to just limit the upload/download rate for a single port?
[01:51] <kitche> !ipv6|mdious
[01:51] <ubotu> mdious: To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4

[01:52] <Hexo> I'm having a problem with grub, it gives me "error 22" when I try to start up
[01:52] <jrib> lovloss: did he leave, where is he?
[01:52] <miraculix> ammm, can You tell me some about automatix2? good thing?
[01:52] <lovloss> oh so he did :(
[01:53] <LjL> !automatix | miraculix
[01:53] <ubotu> miraculix: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[01:53] <Hexo> So I google for error 22, but I honestly have no idea how to fix it though
[01:53] <Rocito> !WorksForMe
[01:53] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[01:53] <Hexo> Anyone who knows how it might be resolved?
[01:53] <Rocito> is there a way to just limit the upload/download rate for a single port?
[01:54] <mdious> kitche:  ip -6 addr flush eth0 is what i was thinking of :)

[01:55] <Hexo> Yea, it does seem like that
[01:55] <mumbles> question
[01:55] <kitche> Hexo sicne grub error 22 means No such partition
[01:55] <Hexo> I just reinstalled Ubuntu
[01:55] <Hexo> Shuffled the partitions around a bit
[01:56] <feryana> hi

[01:58] <Hexo> So, I'm actually using the installation atm, cause it worked quite well to put in the ubuntu cd and boot from first hdd
[01:58] <Hexo> but I would really much like to be able to skip that part in the future :/

[01:59] <feryana> thanks :)
[01:59] <Hexo> hrmpfh
[01:59] <kitche> umgan: what do you mean by icon?
[01:59] <Hexo> so no way of fixing this?
[01:59] <mdious> feryana:  hope it works, will be in a text file somewhere but i'm not cool enought to know where that is :P
[01:59] <feryana> mdious it worked :)
[01:59] <umgan> well kitchie for example i have another partition for storage and in places --> computer as well as the desktop there is an icon for that drive
[02:00] <feryana> I was there before but I didn't note it :P

[02:09] <econobeing> this is a good celebration 40
[02:09] <sharp15> has anyone here configured proftpd on ubuntu before?
[02:09] <umgan> kitche well i formatted this drive...it was ntfs and it did show up...i formatted it to ext3 and used fstab to get it permanently mounted....but it wont show a volume icon for it

[02:10] <jvai> question: portmap is for servers not for workstations right? i tried to add ldap yesterday, & port 111 was open i uninstalled it
[02:10] <kapilg_it> has anybody tried installing  java runtime  environment
[02:10] <arrenlex> !java | kapilg_it

[02:11] <jvai> kitche i didnt like that open 111 port
[02:11] <jvai> i didnt feel safe
[02:11] <dodgyville> arrenlex: It comes with .cue and .ccd files
[02:11] <Rprp> <dodgyville> How can I burn a .img cd image in ubuntu?
[02:11] <umgan> ktche i created a "shortcut" to media/hda1 to use onthe desktop but i would like it to work for real
[02:11] <Rprp> dodgyville: you can rename it to .iso
[02:11] <Rprp> And than burn it ;)
[02:11] <jvai> i cant access the shares on active directory
[02:11] <arrenlex> dodgyville: Ah. .cue files come with .bin from my experience, but if it has a .cue those programs should be able to burn it.
[02:12] <usr_rob> Hi, i see that it's only "generic kernel" in the repo. cat /proc/cpuinfo shows only 1 core. Anyone who knows a way to fix support for 2 cores?

[02:12] <Rprp> @ weeks ago, i got the same problem, just rename the .img file to .iso and burn it
[02:12] <Rprp> np :)
[02:12] <agent> what is the recommend fs for a large removable drive? ext2? journaling seems rather useless so ext3 is out... correct?
[02:12] <kitche> umgan: hmm type mount and see if htat drive is indeed mounted
[02:12] <arrenlex> usr_rob: generic kernel includes support for SMP. If you only have one CPU recognised it's because you literally have only one CPU. :)

[02:14] <NineTeen67Come1> I forget .. but how do I fix "timestamp too far in the future" .. when I run sudo apt-get update?
[02:14] <kitche> lovloss: you don't chown a volume
[02:14] <arrenlex> lovloss: You have to mount it with the correct permissions.
[02:15] <umgan> kitche hehe any suggestions for who might know? your the fourth person that hasnt been able to help =(
[02:15] <dodgyville> Rprp: It seems 760mb is a bit big for a blank CD?

[02:16] <lovloss> arrenlex:  oh you mean in ftsab?
[02:16] <umgan> kitche ok thank you =D
[02:16] <bayzider> Does any one know of any linux freindly port scanners?
[02:16] <Rprp> yes, if your cd is 700mb its too big
[02:16] <arrenlex> lovloss: If you're mounting it through fstab, then yes.
[02:16] <lovloss> arrenlex: well it kind of automounts since its an external HD
[02:16] <matju> is there a way to cause the CD/DVD driver to have shorter timeouts upon read errors? i'm trying to recover a scratched data disc
[02:16] <dodgyville> Ideally I would just like to mount the .img, but it does not appear to be an iso9660 file type (according to mount)
[02:16] <arrenlex> lovloss: Ah. I am unfamiliar with whatever gnome does to automount drives. Sorry.
[02:16] <jvai> bayzider nmap & nmapfe & nessus

[02:17] <arrenlex> dodgyville: What's the output of "file <file.img>"?
[02:17] <Rprp> Burn .iso file
[02:17] <bayzider> jvai, I could just find them on google right?
[02:17] <arrenlex> Rprp: Renaming a file doesn't change its filetype. If mount doesn't detect it as an ISO, it's not. You're used to windows, I take it?
[02:17] <lovloss> I can move stuff around, rename and create links on the command line, but these main fodlers on the device wont do that in the gui!
[02:17] <dodgyville> arrenlex: "data"
[02:18] <jvai> nooo, thru synmaptic, built for the dostro
[02:18] <Rprp> arrenlex: i know, but renaming .IMG to .ISO works
[02:18] <arrenlex> Rprp: I can't imagine how or why.
[02:19] <arrenlex> dodgyville: a) what if you try mounting the cue file? b) where did you get this bizarre image?
[02:19] <emosamurai> I was wondering, can you use files that you have stored in Windows in Ubuntu?

[02:55] <kapilg_it> just installed sun-java5-jre but not getting this plugin in firefx
[02:56] <jrib> kapilg_it: you need sub-java5-plugin
[02:56] <php-freak> is ubuntu debain?
[02:56] <zcat[1] > Never done it. USB is just the wrong media for a network connection, even if you can make it work.

[02:56] <kitche> php-freak: ubuntu is based on debian
[02:56] <pappy_> my modem (cable) has both usb and rj45 I coonected 1 pc with usb and other with rj45 both connected me to net automatically
[02:57] <zcat[1] > pappy_: the usb one was Ubuntu?
[02:57] <pappy_> yes welllllllllll kubuntu
[02:57] <zcat[1] > cool...
[02:58] <Madpilot> php-freak, it's related, but not binary-compatible w/ Debian
[02:58] <Chris_H_> should i just unplug and plug back in the modem on ubuntu and see if that works then?
[02:58] <econobeing> is there something like netstumbler for linux?
[02:58] <psyke88>  hi, has anyone noticed that Edgy's intel drivers are much slower than on Dapper?
[02:58] <arrenlex> php-freak: Ubuntu is debian -freedom +branding :)
[02:58] <Toma-> something quirky happened this morning, I performed an update and it said i needed a dist-upgrade?
[02:58] <zcat[1] > Chris_H_: worth a try.. see what /var/log/messages says about it, see if there's a usb anything in the network controls..
[02:59] <zcat[1] > econobeing: kismet
[02:59] <Toma-> Has there been a disturbance in the force?
[02:59] <arrenlex> Toma-: you have to run a dist-upgrade when you need to install new packages in order to upgrade.
[02:59] <wyld> how do i restart in cli mode to install an nvidia driver?
[02:59] <kitche> wyld: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:59] <arrenlex> wyld: why restart? Just shut down X.
[02:59] <Toma-> arrenlex, yeh i know. I did one about 3 weeks ago
[02:59] <zcat[1] > wyld: ctrl-alt-F1, log in, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:59] <Chris_H_> zcat[1] , i did find a guide to getting my particular modem to work
[03:00] <wyld> hmm...
[03:00] <wyld> good points
[03:00] <Chris_H_> but i think i may have to be a more seasoned Linux user before i attempt it
[03:00] <wyld> and i'll do them
[03:00] <Gumby> does anyone here know a graphical way to setup mount points in ubuntu?
[03:00] <Chris_H_> its pretty complex
[03:00] <Toma-> arrenlex, so, the new upgrades are installing/removing packages?
[03:00] <arrenlex> Toma-: If you need to dist-upgrade, then some package needs to install\remove some other package, yes.
[03:00] <Toma-> Gumby, someone will say "gedit" and laugh like an idiot any time now...
[03:00] <Toma-> arrenlex, ok thanks
[03:00] <funkyHat> I'm trying to copy my Evolution settings/mailboxes/etc from one PC to another... where is it all kept? :-S I've copied ~/.evolution and ~/.gconf/apps/evolution but it's still starting up with the evolution account wizard thingy
[03:01] <zcat[1] > Chris_H_: I'm not sure how standard USB modems are.. not very I suspect. Network-based ones generally do nat and DHCP so you just plug them in..
[03:01] <Toma-> Gumby, ive been looking for an fstab gui forever.
[03:01] <jrib> Gumby: pysdm
[03:01] <econobeing> zcat[1] : thanks
[03:01] <Chris_H_> right, from the help options on Ubuntu, i've discovered that it's under the catagory of "Modems using the Analog Devices Inc. eagle-usb I, II or III chipset"
[03:02] <Toma-> jrib, thanks! :D
[03:02] <jrib> Toma-: gedit for you!
[03:02] <Gumby> Toma-: lol.  yes, I'd have no problem with that.  But for some reason the UUID's that are being returned by blkid arent corrent.  I was hoping to see what a gui had to say about it.  Device manager doesnt show the UUID for two of my partitions for some reason
[03:02] <Toma-> jrib, im too lazy for gedit :<
[03:03] <Toma-> Gumby, you can convert all those silly UUIDs back to the good ol' /dev entrys. I did and im so much happier
[03:03] <Toma-> Gumby, i have my doubts that this PySDM has support for UUIDs
[03:04] <wyld> ok, i forgot to write that down. how do i stop xfce?
[03:04] <Toma-> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[03:04] <Toma-> wyld, ^^^
[03:04] <wyld> ok
[03:04] <wyld> thanks

[03:07] <schisms> I need some help.
[03:07] <jrib> schisms: you mean gconf-editor?
[03:07] <Chris_H_> if that helps you at all
[03:07] <schisms> Well, I used the command

[03:27] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: What's your question/
[03:27] <psusi> any testing victims^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hvolunteers feel like testing the new and improved defrag package in feisty?
[03:28] <NoonInSF> is there a mac specific irc channel?
[03:28] <jvai> defrag?? in fiesty?? in ubuntu?? in... linux??
[03:28] <LjL> noiesmo: we were having problems with the bot before, couldn't add that
[03:28] <emosamurai> Could you please walk me through partitioning? There's a lot I don't understand.
[03:28] <LjL> !info defrag | jvai
[03:28] <jvai> no way
[03:28] <ubotu> defrag: ext2, minix and xiafs filesystem defragmenter. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.73pjm1-7 (edgy), package size 66 kB, installed size 208 kB
[03:28] <tonyyarusso> psusi: defrag package?  I thought we didn't need defragging?
[03:29] <noiesmo> LjL, thanks for your help/info :)
[03:29] <tonyyarusso> !pm | emosamurai
[03:29] <LjL> nonsense. ext2/ext3 are probably less affected by fragmentation than FAT/NTFS are, but they are nonetheless. that's unavoidable
[03:29] <ubotu> emosamurai: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[03:29] <RoC_MM_0w> Any idea why a .procmailrc file wouldn't be being read by on dapper drake?  I have postfix&procmailrc installed, and the user owns the directory and it's files.  It's totally not reading the procmailrc at all.
[03:29] <LjL> psusi: since when does defrag work with ext3 though?
[03:29] <psusi> the defrag package is like.... 20 years old, but not used or maintained much because linux doesn't use the worlds worst ( proven time and again ) allocation algorithms like windows
[03:29] <jvai> a defrag package seems similar to an antivirus package in ubuntu
[03:30] <psusi> LjL, since I patched it to ;)
[03:30] <emosamurai> Okay, I'm at the Prepare Mount Points page.
[03:30] <emosamurai> I set a mount point to "/" and the partition to the 25GB one.
[03:30] <crimsun> these FN cloaks are getting crazy
[03:30] <emosamurai> Then I set a mount point to "swap" and I set the partition to the 3GB one.
[03:30] <LjL> psusi: i see =) well, i'm sorry but i don't quite feel like installing feisty to try that out... it's nice to know it'll be there, though. why don't you ask in #ubuntu+1 as well?
[03:30] <psusi> but yea... all filesystems get fragmented... it's just a question of how badly/quickly
[03:31] <psusi> well, except romfs or iso9660 or other read only filesystems
[03:31] <emosamurai> I hit Forward, and the notice tells me that there is "No root file system."
[03:31] <emosamurai> Even though I set a mount point to "/", which the installer tells me is the root file system.
[03:31] <psusi> LjL, should work just fine on dapper ;)
[03:31] <emosamurai> I have no fucking clue.
[03:31] <NoonInSF> I'm mostly concerned about keeping my OSX installed and usable, but also being able to create the partitions requiered to get it to dual boot into ubuntu without kiling my osx. so far i see three differnt ways of doing it. maybe even more.
[03:31] <psusi> err, edgy too
[03:31] <RoC_MM_0w> Anybody had problems with procmail?
[03:31] <LjL> !language | emosamurai
[03:31] <ubotu> emosamurai: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:31] <emosamurai> Sorry.
[03:31] <emosamurai> I have no clue.
[03:31] <emosamurai> Please give me one.
[03:32] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: Did you specify a filesystem?
[03:32] <LjL> psusi: (i'm on edgy) let me rephrase that: i don't feel like installing feisty *or* trying it on my precious edgy filesystem =)
[03:32] <emosamurai> Where do I specify a filesystem?
[03:33] <emosamurai> Please tell me.
[03:33] <JJones0207> Hello
[03:33] <emosamurai> Is it on the preceding "Prepare Partitions" page?
[03:33] <psusi> LjL, hehe... yea... definately don't use it on your real filesystem.... test it on a disposable one
[03:33] <NoonInSF> Is it safer for me to tell the installer to use the free space (does that free space have to be a partition, or can it just be random free space on the drive?) can i then go adn shrink that partition later?
[03:34] <JJones0207> I am trying to install xubuntu
[03:34] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: Should have been on the same page as saying to make it /
[03:34] <hou5ton> in Systems >> Preferences >> Preferred Applications .... I can't seem to figure out how to make the default Mail Reader be GMail in FireFox.  Anyone??
[03:34] <LjL> psusi: i could probably set one up for that. by the way, do you know of any benchmarking tool that would make sense to test with?
[03:34] <peacekpr_> anyone had luck getting beryl to run in edgy amd64? ... i have an ATI Xpress 200M card using fglrx... Xgl is installed successfully - when i open an Xgl session in gnome and run "beryl --display :0" in a terminal, it finds XGL but says "no composite extension"
[03:34] <emosamurai> tonyyarusso: Which page is that?
[03:34] <peacekpr_> anyone know where to go from here?
[03:34] <emosamurai> Is it the "Prepare Mount Points" page?
[03:34] <apokryphos> !beryl | peacekpr_
[03:34] <ubotu> peacekpr_: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:34] <psusi> LjL, hrm... I've never used it but I have heard of bonnie++
[03:35] <RoC_MM_0w> peacekpr what laptop do you have...just curious
[03:35] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: Where you just were, and set the / and swap up
[03:35] <jvai> oo welcome back ubotu
[03:35] <peacekpr_> RoC_MM_0w, Dell Inspiron 1501 with Turion X2
[03:35] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: I don't know the page titles (never actually used the live installer)
[03:35] <dodgyville> Hi
[03:35] <tonyyarusso> Hello dodgyville
[03:35] <peacekpr_> i've been able to get every piece of hardware to work well... but i'd like to run beryl as well... and that's the last thing to get working
[03:35] <RoC_MM_0w> Anybody with procmail experience?
[03:36] <emosamurai> Okay, I'm at the place where they tell me the mount points and the partitions.
[03:36] <emosamurai> I set one to "/".
[03:36] <LjL> psusi: hm, not sure bonnie is good for that though... afaik it *creates* files, and is mostly used to check which parts of the drive are physically faster. not sure there's much else in the repositories though
[03:36] <emosamurai> That's supposed to be the root file system, correct?
[03:36] <psusi> emosamurai, and what filesystem did you choose for /?
[03:36] <emosamurai> I used the hda2 partition.
[03:36] <emosamurai> IDE/ATA1
[03:36] <emosamurai> It's the biggest partition, and it has more than enough space.
[03:37] <psusi> emosamurai, yea.. .but what filesystem did you ask it to format it as?  ext3?  reiserfs?
[03:37] <emosamurai> It doesn't ask that.
[03:37] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: Right, but on the same page you have to tell it to use ext2, ext3, or something.
[03:37] <tonyyarusso> emosamurai: Must be in there somewhere.
[03:37] <emosamurai> Nope, it doesn't ask for ext# or anything.
[03:38] <emosamurai> It just asks for mount point and partition.
[03:38] <tonyyarusso> Can I make a particular user's login always start bash in screen when they ssh in?
[03:38] <kuzmaster> so hey all!
[03:39] <emosamurai> Anyone ever use the live installer?
[03:39] <mitchell> Anyone have an debootstrap experience?
[03:39] <kuzmaster> how can i change the permissions for /var/www so i can delete files in there using SCP?
=== kjalil_ is now known as kjalil
[03:39] <LjL> psusi: ouch, can't try it on a test fs either, i've already got 4 primary partitions :-\
[03:39] <psusi> kuzmaster, scp in as root
[03:40] <econobeing> i used the live installer
[03:40] <econobeing> wait...the liveCD installer? cause if so then yes
[03:40] <emosamurai> Okay, how do you make it work?
[03:40] <psusi> LjL, loopback ;)
[03:40] <mitchell> kuzmaster, Depends.. What are the current permissions and ownership and what user are you using?
[03:40] <tonyyarusso> kuzmaster: Add your user to the www-data group, and use chmod to set group write priviledges
[03:40] <emosamurai> I don't want to reformat my hard drive, even though that would be easiest.
[03:40] <kuzmaster> ummm....... scp as in the ssh thingy for transfering files, as in... "secure copy" i think thats what it stands for......
[03:40] <econobeing> i just double clicked the "install" icon on the desktop
[03:40] <LjL> psusi: right, but that way, the fs image itself will end up, err... fragmented =)
[03:40] <emosamurai> My HD isn't partitioning, though.
[03:40] <econobeing> or wait
[03:40] <emosamurai> That's the problem.
[03:40] <econobeing> to get it to boot?
[03:41] <emosamurai> No, to install.
[03:41] <econobeing> oh
[03:41] <kuzmaster> tonyyarusso: so how, whats the command, im a big of a noob
[03:41] <econobeing> hm
[03:41] <psusi> LjL, possibly.. but defrag will at least defrag the fragmented fragments ;)
[03:41] <mitchell> Anyone had any problems with doing a debootstrap of dapper lately?
[03:41] <econobeing> i don't know, i just double clicked it, went through the menus, and had it erase my whole hard drive and reformat
[03:41] <LjL> heh
[03:42] <psusi> mitchell, what kind of problems?
=== Gonzo_ is now known as Gonzo
[03:42] <RawSewage>  Is it normal to have a lot of kio_file and kio_html slave socket things in the process table?
[03:42] <emosamurai> Yeah, don't wanna do that.
[03:42] <RawSewage> me?
[03:42] <mitchell> psusi, It fails late in the game with a Failure while configuring base packages. This will be attempted 5 times..
[03:42] <econobeing> can you partition it?
[03:43] <emosamurai> I'm trying to, but it isn't doing it.
[03:43] <emosamurai> I'm currently resizing the partitions.
[03:43] <psusi> mitchell, strange...
[03:43] <tonyyarusso> kuzmaster: adduser and chmod
[03:43] <mitchell> psusi, Right after I: Configuring ubuntu-keyring
[03:44] <mitchell> psusi, I have tried a couple of different versions of debootstrap and all have had issues at the same point..
[03:44] <psusi> different versions?  you should install the version that matches your system
[03:44] <mitchell> psusi, It will finally kick out I: Base system installed successfully. But the results are not bootable..
[03:45] <feryana> hey guys
[03:45] <kuzmaster> tonyyarusso: but what do type in, im a bit of a noob, remember ;)
[03:45] <emosamurai> Should I just backup my stuff and reformat my HD?
[03:45] <mitchell> psusi, Well.. I am running 6.06 1 LTS.. Which debootstrap should I use?
[03:45] <feryana> is possible to deactivate a keyboard (I have a keyboard plugged to a laptop and I would like to deactivate laptop's integrated keyboard!!!!
[03:46] <Hexo> so grub is still not working >&
[03:46] <eimajenthat> Hello, having a strange occurrence with my Edgy Eft box.  I have a 60GB root partition (58 might be closer, but you get the idea.)  df and a couple other things tell me the partition is full, but I go to '/' in Nautilus and show hidden files, and highlight everything in there, then click Properties, and it all adds up to about 34GB.  Where's the rest?
[03:46] <mang> feryana why, just dont touch the keys? :P
[03:46] <psusi> mitchell, the one from 6.06... that apt-get install will install if your sources.list are correct
[03:46] <Hexo> Is there a way for me to flash the mbr somehow so I can reinstall grub and install ubuntu again}
[03:46] <feryana> mang I do. but no my cat
[03:46] <econobeing> emosamurai: are you currently using windows?
[03:46] <tonyyarusso> kuzmaster: You can always find full usage info and directions for a command by typing 'man <command>', so in this case 'man chmod' and 'man adduser' will give you all of the information you need (and then some!)
[03:46] <mang> feryana "learn" your cat
[03:46] <econobeing> i mean, is that currently on your computer
[03:46] <emosamurai> I'm using windows, but I'm booting from the live cd as we speak.
[03:46] <kuzmaster> tonyyarusso: k..........
[03:47] <emosamurai> Windows isn't running right now.
[03:47] <psusi> eimajenthat, there are probably parts that you don't have permission to see
[03:47] <feryana> is easier to set down the keyboard!!!! :P is it possible?
[03:47] <mitchell> psusi, Okay..
[03:47] <econobeing> how old is the windows install?
[03:47] <emosamurai> 2 years old.
[03:47] <psusi> Hexo, what?
[03:47] <econobeing> yeah i would most definately back that up
[03:47] <Hexo> grub keeps giving me error 22, even after using the windows cd's recovery mode and doing fixmbr
[03:48] <Hexo> and reinstalling ubuntu isn't doing anything at all
[03:48] <eimajenthat> psusi, ah yeah, I guess that makes sense.  'Nother question.  How can I search for files above a certain size?
[03:48] <emosamurai> Okay, so what do I do without actually erasing my entire hard drive?
[03:48] <mitchell> psusi, All right.. I removed the installed version and did an apt-get install debootstrap.. I will give it another go..
[03:48] <psusi> Hexo, fixmbr will get rid of grub
[03:48] <econobeing> i'd actually suggest backing all the stuff from windows you want, then re-formatting it with windows first, then install ubuntu right after that
[03:48] <Hexo> it didn't though
[03:48] <econobeing> aside from that i'm stumped
[03:48] <Hexo> first thing i saw after doing fixmbr was error 22
[03:48] <emosamurai> What if I don't have my Windows cd?
[03:49] <mitchell> psusi, It would be nice if I did not have to download these packages each time. Is there way to store them for each attempt?
[03:49] <econobeing> are you able to borrow one?
[03:49] <psusi> Hexo, you have more than one hard disk?
[03:49] <LjL> is there a dpkg command/option to verify a single package against the stored md5 (there *is* an md5 stored, right?)?
[03:49] <Hexo> hmm, yes, two
[03:49] <maxkelley> what is the best kernel to use for a P4 HT?
[03:50] <maxkelley> er, with hyperthreading, whatever.
[03:50] <psusi> mitchell, yea... just never done it... but there was something on the wiki about setting up your own repository mirror/cache
[03:50] <emosamurai> Grr...
[03:50] <emosamurai> I shouldn't have to do this!
[03:50] <mitchell> psusi, Yeah.. I read it, but it did not make much sense...
[03:50] <psusi> LjL, apt-get install debsums ; man debsums
[03:50] <jvai> nexo, maybe the hidden partition is giving u the blues.. it can wreck havoc
[03:50] <emosamurai> Can we PM this? We're kinda getting cluttered.
[03:51] <emosamurai> I can't borrow one.
[03:51] <eimajenthat> psusi, I opened Nautilus as root, and I still only have 34GB worth of stuff
[03:51] <LjL> psusi: i know about that, but i meant for checking the *package* itself, not the files. more of a curiosity than anything else though, i can do what i intended to through other means
[03:51] <feryana> is possible to deactivate a keyboard (I have a keyboard plugged to a laptop and I would like to deactivate laptop's integrated keyboard!!!!
[03:51] <psusi> emosamurai, if your windows install is 2 years old you should reformat it as a matter of principal... as for installing ubuntu, just tell it to automatically use the free space on the disk
[03:51] <Hexo> so should i try to unplug the other hdd while I try to fix this maybe?
[03:51] <psusi> eimajenthat, hrm.... odd....
[03:52] <JJones0207> Im trying to install xubuntu it loads up then i click start or install xubuntu it uncompresses linux then while its making the root file system its a error or something on the harddisk I/O errir ib devuce gdc
[03:52] <JJones0207> hdc*
[03:52] <eimajenthat> psusi, glad I'm not the only one that thinks so
[03:52] <psusi> LjL, the package is checked when it is installed, and if you debsum it
[03:52] <hetlemming> eimajenthat, use "find".  e.g.  find / -size +10000k
[03:52] <psusi> LjL, if by package you mean the actual listing of the md5sums of the files in the package
[03:53] <psusi> JJones0207, do the disk test boot option... sounds like you have a bad disk
[03:53] <LjL> psusi: no, i mean checking the md5 of the .deb file (yes, i know it's checked when it's installed)
[03:53] <Pelo> JJones0207,  try looking up the exact msg in the forum,  my guess is it would actualy be  i/o error in device hdc ( learn to type man)
[03:53] <emosamurai> It says "No root file system is defined" whan I try to use the auto-partition.
[03:53] <emosamurai> GAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
[03:53] <JJones0207> I know how lol
[03:53] <emosamurai> ---Hulks out---
[03:53] <JJones0207> its had to believe its a bad disk since a hour ago windows was on it
[03:54] <eimajenthat> hetlemming: thanks, can I have that output to a text file?
[03:54] <psusi> JJones0207, no... the cd... you are booting from a cd right?
[03:54] <emosamurai> Can somebody tell me how to do this?
[03:54] <emosamurai> GRRR!!!!
[03:54] <emosamurai> Somebody?
[03:54] <psusi> emosamurai, try starting over in thei nstaller and just hit enter at each prompt ;)
[03:54] <hetlemming> eimajenthat: sure.  almost any console coommand output can be sent to a text file by following it with >> filename.txt
[03:54] <camonz> hi..., i was wondering how do i install framebuffer support on ubuntu edgy server
[03:54] <emosamurai> Then it'd reformat my hard drive and I'd lose all my stuff.
[03:55] <Pelo> emosamurai,   the live cd has a patition tool in it, otherwise try using gparted or partition magic ,
[03:55] <eimajenthat> hetlemming: thanks much, glad to know
[03:55] <JJones0207> yeah
[03:56] <Pelo> emosamurai, boot live cd,  mount the hdd, mount the cd burner,   backup your important stuff
[03:56] <LjL> psusi: in other words, like "apt-verify somepackage.deb", resulting in "yes, that .deb file is the same as what's listed in /var/cache/apt/something". but again, it's not really important - i thought about this because i was copying a bunch of .debs from my /var/cache/apt/archives to a loopback fs for testing defrag
[03:56] <psusi> emosamurai, iirc, the default options involve automatically shrinking the windows partition and using the free space for ubuntu
[03:56] <JJones0207> well when i try to check for cd defects it has to go though that mounting root file system to check
[03:56] <hetlemming> eimajenthat, happy to help. Here's a good resource:  http://www.linux-noob.com
[03:56] <JJones0207> then it messes up
[03:56] <LjL> psusi: of course, i can just md5sum the files, then the md5sum -c then after the defrag, which is what i'm doing, and which is why what i asked wasn't really important
[03:56] <psusi> LjL, just run md5sum on the original and again on the copy
[03:56] <psusi> yea ;)
[03:57] <emosamurai> Actually, if I used a Windows reinstallation CD that came with another computer, would that work?
[03:57] <Pelo> JJones0207,  hda is a hard drive not a cd/dvd drive,  check the hdd power cable and data strap and check the bio settings
[03:57] <psusi> LjL, better yet, you can md5sum *.deb > ~/sums1, then do it again on the test fs > ~/sums2, then diff sums1 sums2
[03:57] <emosamurai> If I reformatted my hard drive?
[03:58] <tonyyarusso> psusi: Second option iirc, yes (for shrinking hda1)
[03:58] <tictacaddict> camonz: I don't know if this is the case for server, but for xubuntu I just had to add vga=791 to the kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:58] <emosamurai> Or does it check?
[03:58] <mitchell> psusi, It bailed again in the same spot...
[03:58] <tictacaddict> camonz: which gives me 1024x768 framebuffer, there are different numbers for different resolutions
[03:58] <JJones0207> It says Buffer I/O error on device hdc
[03:58] <LjL> psusi: shouldn't need that i think... what i did is md5sum *.deb > sums   and then    md5sum -c sums, it should do just about what you said but automatically, i think
[03:58] <JJones0207> Could it be a shortage on ram
[03:58] <psusi> mitchell, and you are trying to debootstrap into an empty directory right?
=== nicky is now known as neo_rocco
[03:59] <mitchell> psusi, Yep...
[03:59] <JJones0207> I have the exact amount the minimal requirements are
[03:59] <psusi> JJones0207, no... hdc is probably your cdrom drive.... so your cd is bad
[03:59] <JJones0207> ok
[03:59] <Pelo> JJones0207,   sorry , you made so many typos I assumed it was hda
[03:59] <psusi> JJones0207, choose the disk test option when booting it
[03:59] <mitchell> psusi, Like this: debootstrap --arch i386 dapper /mnt/dapper http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
[03:59] <JJones0207> its on Pelo
[03:59] <psusi> LjL, ohh... nice... I didn't know about -c
[03:59] <eimajenthat> hetlemming: I got an error I don't understand from find: http://pastey.net/3270
[04:00] <LjL> psusi: then what i'm doing is    for file in /var/cache/apt/archives/lib*.deb; do ( cp $file /mntpoint & ) ; done   --  i think this should get them... fragmented enough
[04:00] <camonz> tictacaddict: i think i'll have to install vesa-tng and nvidia drivers first
[04:00] <mitchell> psusi, /mnt/dapper is a filesystem I setup just for chroot or a VM..
[04:00] <kyd> need help with makeing a patition on a new drive
[04:00] <kyd> im new to linux ...as you can tell
[04:00] <psusi> mitchell, I'm not sure what the http part is for, I usually just do debootstrap dapper /mnt/dapper
[04:00] <mitchell> psusi, Hmm..Okay.. I will try that...
[04:01] <Pelo> kyd,  I beleive you are suppose to use a tool called gparted, but that is as far as I can take you
[04:01] <tictacaddict> camonz: that maybe true.  I already had my video drivers and X11 working when I tried this
[04:01] <kyd> ok...ty Pelo....anyone else?
[04:01] <mrMister> Hey, guys. I just installed Ubuntu following the FakeRaidHowto. Ubuntu is behaving a bit strangely. I can't log in through gdm most of the time. I just get a clear screen. just the backgroundimage and nothing more.
[04:02] <Pelo> kyd, http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84 , this might help
[04:02] <mrMister> have any of you had this problem?
[04:02] <psusi> LjL, I wrote a ~10 line shell script to randomly create and delete files, filling them with random amounts of random data to REALLY fragment the filesystem ;)
[04:03] <kyd> or if someone can give me the commands in BASH i can get the just of it
[04:03] <psusi> mrMister, what groups did you put your user in?
[04:03] <kyd> RE: partition info
[04:03] <mrMister> psusi: like, all of them.. :)
[04:03] <psusi> heh... ok....
[04:03] <psusi> no idea then
[04:03] <mrMister> damn
[04:04] <psusi> though it has been a long time since I actually did an install and wrote that howto...
[04:04] <psusi> I should try it again
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[04:04] <mrMister> you wrote the howto?
[04:04] <psusi> yea
[04:04] <mrMister> Cool
[04:04] <psusi> spent about 4 weeks trying to get ubuntu installed on my fakeraid right as breezy came out

[04:05] <kyd> help with partition commands in bash
[04:06] <Freyja> #smarty
[04:06] <mrMister> Pelo: I believe you.
[04:06] <mang> kyd google, will give you a better answer then most people here can explain ;d
[04:06] <psusi> the bitch was getting it working... writing the howto was easy ;)
[04:06] <Pelo> kyd,  did you find the command you need ?  type  command --help for the options of that command
[04:07] <kyd> thanks guy's
[04:07] <Pelo> psusi,   you write for a different audiance then I then ,  I write noob oriented guides
[04:07] <kyd> Pelo: yes i got that

[04:08] <denuoweb> loading cache ./config.cache
[04:08] <denuoweb> checking for gcc... no
[04:08] <denuoweb> checking for cc... no
[04:08] <denuoweb> configure: error: no acceptable cc found in $PATH
[04:08] <mrMister> Freyja: slendingur?
[04:09] <denuoweb> how do i install gcc or cc
[04:09] <Renan_s2> denuoweb, sudo apt-get install build-essential
[04:09] <Dial_tone> how do you hide join/parts with x-chat
[04:09] <denuoweb> thank you
[04:10] <mrMister> hmm, I also have a problem with the network settings not sticking.
[04:11] <jvai> aight peepz.. it's tyme 4 me to bounce.. ty all
[04:11] <mrMister> so maybe there's the same problem with the groups
[04:11] <mrMister> I'll have to check it out.
[04:11] <mrMister> next time I boot into ubuntu,
[04:11] <Pelo> brb
[04:14] <wyld> how can I increase my refresh rate on my monitor? i know that it supports at least 75, but it's not going higher then 50

[04:14] <wyld> ah, thanks
[04:17] <Megaqwerty> Wow. A silent Ubuntu Channel...Amazing
[04:18] <arrenlex> Is there a program I might use to modify the contents of .deb packages?
[04:18] <arrenlex> Preferably with a GUI?
[04:18] <lemao> Anybody knows how to access wordpress after installed using aptitude?
[04:19] <lemao> I would expect the site to be automatically available in apache, but I could not find anything.
[04:19] <arrenlex> lemao: use "dpkg -L <package>" to list the files that are part of a package you've installed.
[04:19] <Megaqwerty> what is wordpress?
[04:19] <Megaqwerty> nm
[04:19] <dLinkCrawxor> is it best to use 6.06 or 6.10?
[04:20] <Megaqwerty> I like 6.10 but 6.06 has Long Term Support
[04:20] <mrMister> dLinkCrawxor: do you want a stable and tested system or do you want cutting edge system that might not be so stable?
[04:20] <Megaqwerty> lemao: have you checked wordpress' site? For documentation?
[04:20] <rajiv_nair> i installed 6.10 yesterday.but went back to 6.06:((
[04:20] <dLinkCrawxor> I want a stable system
[04:20] <Megaqwerty> Pelo: lol
[04:20] <lemao> arrenlex
[04:21] <rajiv_nair> my USB cable modem didnt wrk with 6.10
[04:21] <mrMister> 6.06 it is then
[04:21] <rajiv_nair> its strange
[04:21] <rajiv_nair> it worked fine with 6.06
[04:21] <lemao> arrenlex: thanks. I can see the list of files installed, but I didnt see any on the apache2 folder
[04:21] <dLinkCrawxor> Is Ubuntu about making money or producing the best free operating system?
[04:21] <lemao> Maybe that is a todo after the install?
[04:21] <crshburn> wow, greetz all theres lots of folks here:)
[04:21] <arrenlex> dLinkCrawxor: Neither. Ubuntu is a balance between making a free OS and making a useable OS.
[04:22] <rajiv_nair> a perfect balance mind u:)
[04:22] <lemao> Megaqwerty: The reason I am asking it here is that the problem seems to be in the package.
[04:22] <arrenlex> rajiv_nair: For some people. Personally I hate ubuntu.
[04:22] <lemao> Megaqwerty: and not wordpress itself.
[04:22] <dLinkCrawxor> Why do you hate "ubuntu" arrenlex
[04:22] <rajiv_nair> arrenlex: why so??
[04:22] <LjL> psusi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35993/ <- some testing (which would show that, at least under artificial conditions, fragmentation does have a noticeable impact...)
[04:22] <Megaqwerty> arrenlex: then why are you here?
[04:22] <lemao> Megaqwerty: I would expect that the package installer would also automaticallyadd a site to apache2
[04:22] <arrenlex> Megaqwerty: To help people. :) The #debian channel is full of arrogant jerks.
[04:23] <rajiv_nair> hehe
[04:23] <psusi> lemao, there is a default site for a fresh apache install... it has a welcome page and the help files
[04:23] <arrenlex> rajiv_nair: It's an overbranded, overhyped, less-free rehash of what other people have done before. I prefer debian.
[04:23] <rajiv_nair> whoa
[04:23] <Megaqwerty> lemao: can you give me more information than that? I don't run a web server myself, but I would expect that the package would just install the software onto your server, and then you would have to implement it yourself.
[04:23] <psusi> arrenlex, ubuntu is more usable than debian
[04:23] <Zambezi> arrenlex, Would you like to speak to some assholes, please visit pfsense. ;-)
[04:23] <_christian> Hello!
[04:23] <rajiv_nair> :D:D
[04:23] <Pelo> arrenlex,  sounds like you would fit right in at  #debian
[04:23] <noiesmo> how can I create a text file with a list of all directories and the disk space used for each specifically my users home space
[04:24] <_christian> Question... what's the hex-code for 1512?
[04:24] <cemilb_> Did anybody have an issue with using an external mouse instead of a touchpad on a laptop?
[04:24] <mrMister> ubuntu isn't very usable for me in its current state. :)
[04:24] <psusi> arrenlex, different goals... debian stresses stability more ( in the sense that they prefer 12 month+ old versions )
[04:24] <rajiv_nair> mrmisteR: why??
[04:24] <dLinkCrawxor> How big is Marks Penis?
[04:24] <spx2> hello
[04:24] <spx2> are there nice games for ubuntu ?
[04:24] <J-_> eggdrop is tell me i need tcl installed. what package should I install from synaptic?
[04:24] <arrenlex> psusi: the only difference is that debian calls "stable" waht ubuntu calls "serer".
[04:24] <mrMister> If I could configure it easily in text mode, maybe I could use it. :)
[04:24] <Megaqwerty> _christian: %31%35%31%32 is the ascii equivelent
[04:25] <dizzie> Deb 4 is soon to be released, and i cant hardly wait much longer
[04:25] <LjL> dLinkCrawxor: completely irrelevant and bad taste.
[04:25] <mrMister> rajiv_nair: because I can't get into X
[04:25] <LjL> !offtopic
[04:25] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[04:25] <rajiv_nair> ohhh
[04:25] <Pelo> spx2,  look in  the menu   "applications" under add/remove ,  there is a game section
[04:25] <fm-2> Megaqwerty: Erm... I need it in 0x12345678 format
[04:25] <rajiv_nair> spx2: a frnd of mine ran counterstrike succesfully with wine:d
[04:25] <psusi> arrenlex, no... ubuntu server has the same versions of packages as the standard... just different set of packages that is more appropriate for a server
[04:25] <fm-2> Megaqwerty: trying to get my fix_mtrr working again, after upgrading memory :P
[04:26] <Megaqwerty> oh...hold on...
[04:26] <arrenlex> psusi: *shrug* LTS then.
[04:26] <fm-2> Megaqwerty: thanks!
[04:27] <cemilb_> Did anybody using ubuntu have an issue with using an external mouse instead of a touchpad on a laptop?
[04:27] <spx2> cemilb_: yes me
[04:28] <spx2> cemilb_: i asked on ubuntuforums.org i got my problem solved but in 3 or 4 days
[04:28] <psusi> LjL, cool test results
[04:28] <cemilb_> spx2: how did you solve the problem?
[04:28] <jack|ass> Anyone have problems with Edgy where power management decides that 99% is "critical power" and goes to suspend?
[04:28] <crshburn> question plz if i may, on a fresh install, server install, i'm hanging on about 3 seconds into the load is my sata drive doing this
[04:28] <crshburn> hope im not interrupting too much
[04:28] <spx2> cemilb_: i changed xorg.conf
[04:28] <rajiv_nair> crshburn:SATA eh??
[04:28] <crshburn> yes
[04:28] <rajiv_nair> crshburn: dapper??
[04:28] <cemilb_> spx2: what change?
[04:29] <crshburn> stops on hardware discovery
[04:29] <Megaqwerty> fm-2: does this help any? http://www.webelfin.com/webelfindesign/dechex.html
[04:29] <Megaqwerty> fm-2: I don't know hex myself, but that page may be what ur looking for.
[04:29] <crshburn> new to linux box, going to learn to build a gaming server
[04:29] <rajiv_nair> i had dat problem with my SATA when i tried to install breezy way back
[04:30] <spx2> cemilb_: let me find that thread of mine
[04:30] <psusi> applications->accessories->calculator will happily convert between hex and dec
[04:30] <rajiv_nair> but no such issues with dapper
[04:30] <cemilb_> spx2: Thanks... standing by.
[04:30] <Megaqwerty> fm-2: everything else uses some program source code to convert it.
[04:30] <crshburn> rajiv_nair explain dapper plz :P
[04:31] <Megaqwerty> fm-2: but I haven't actually found a formula for it as of yet (I haven't seen it in the source code either)

[04:33] <Megaqwerty> fm-2: so? any good?
[04:33] <LjL> psusi: this (and the site in general) seems interesting for benchmarking fragmentation http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~loizides/reiserfs/agesystem.html
[04:34] <Megaqwerty> fm-2: you still here?

[04:41] <JakeConnor> who started ubuntu?
[04:41] <arrenlex> JakeConnor: Mark Shuttleworth
[04:42] <lupine_85> debian :p
[04:42] <xar0s> anyone know how to run Starcraft with WINE?
[04:42] <mrMister> xar0s: google knows
[04:42] <xar0s> lol
[04:42] <rajiv_nair> hehe
[04:42] <JakeConnor> is debian a black guy?
[04:42] <rajiv_nair> google knows everythin :p
[04:42] <xar0s> followed all the tutorials
[04:42] <crshburn> :\
[04:42] <lupine_85> wine setup.exe is your friend
[04:42] <xar0s> everything runs BUT battle.net
[04:43] <xar0s> crashes every time
[04:43] <lupine_85> JakeConnor: "debian" is in reference to a woman
[04:43] <lupine_85> but she's american, so could have black skin I guess
[04:43] <cemilb_> spx2: yes... I was looking at the post...
[04:43] <lupine_85> is it important?
[04:43] <JakeConnor> what language is that in reference to a woman?
[04:43] <arrenlex> lupine_85: "debian" is in reference to IAN Murdock, the creator of Debian, and DEBra, his wife.
[04:43] <JakeConnor> just wondering since ubuntu is some african word
[04:43] <arrenlex> Ian + Debra
[04:43] <arrenlex> -> debian
[04:43] <lupine_85> "Debbie"-ian
[04:44] <rajiv_nair> yeah:D
[04:44] <[erisco] > kind of a strange question I suppose.. is there a way I can hide all my icons on the desktop?
[04:44] <lupine_85> oh, debra, ok :)
[04:44] <[erisco] > visually hide them, that is
[04:44] <lupine_85> "ubuntu" might be african, but it's a universal concept. Or should be...
[04:44] <nothlit> [erisco] , use gconf-editor, and disable the drive icons from showing up
[04:44] <rajiv_nair> yeah
[04:44] <nothlit> [erisco] , delete the rest
[04:44] <rajiv_nair> "i am coz we are"
[04:44] <lupine_85> Of course us Brits are the Real Humans(tm) :p
[04:44] <JakeConnor> most debras' I know are black
[04:44] <nothlit> [erisco] , or change the mountpoints of your drives from /media to /mnt
[04:44] <lupine_85> everything else is a cheap imitation
[04:45] <lupine_85> like tea... ;)
[04:45] <mrMister> Ubuntu is an old African saying for "I'm tired of compiling Gentoo"
[04:45] <[erisco] > nothlit, isn't gconf really sensitive?
[04:45] <rajiv_nair> jake:wats ur point??
[04:45] <nothlit> debian = deb + ian
[04:45] <nothlit> [erisco] , its just xml files
[04:45] <lupine_85> oh noes! the melatonin's gonna getcha
[04:45] <rajiv_nair> lol@mister
[04:45] <JakeConnor> I have no point
[04:45] <JakeConnor> haha
[04:45] <rajiv_nair> ok :D
[04:45] <[erisco] > nothlit, I heard that messing something up in there could cause a lot of problem
[04:45] <rajiv_nair> oops
[04:45] <[erisco] > nothlit, is this the only way?
[04:45] <rajiv_nair> he left :p
[04:46] <lupine_85> gconf == registry :(
[04:46] <nothlit> [erisco] , lol i said change the mountpoints of drives from /media to /mnt
[04:46] <[erisco] > nothlit, would I want to do that for the same drive that linux boots from?
[04:46] <nothlit> [erisco] , its perfectly safe if you know what you're doing, besides the regular gconf editor, can only bork your user profile, not system stuff unlike windows
[04:47] <Malfist> Does dpkg act the same as apt-get with resolving dependecies?
[04:47] <nothlit> [erisco] , and you can always rm -fr ~/.gconf to reset it
[04:47] <nothlit> no
[04:47] <lupine_85> couldn't you just symlink /mnt/ to /media/ ?
[04:47] <nothlit> it installs individual files
[04:47] <Malfist> can you get it to resolve depencandecies?
[04:47] <nothlit> lupine_85, no because it will still see them in media and auto show them
[04:47] <[erisco] > nothlit, I only wanted to get a pic of my desktop without icons on it =\
[04:47] <lupine_85> ah... gotcha
[04:47] <JJones0207> when i try to install xubuntu how come when i bootup the computer it says their is no free memory bewteen 480K and 640K but there is
[04:47] <[erisco] > nothlit, I suppose I'll just have to live without that heh
[04:47] <JJones0207> its 128 MB
[04:47] <nothlit> [erisco] , no just your extra drives, the ones mounted in media
[04:48] <nothlit> [erisco] , its really simple
[04:48] <citek> Can someone please help me get my microphone to work with ubuntu?
[04:48] <dabaR> [erisco] : just the desktop no icons?
[04:48] <jrib> !icons | [erisco] 
[04:48] <ubotu> [erisco] : Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[04:48] <lupine_85> JJones0207: that's XMS/EMMS RAM, not the system RAM (to use DOS terms)
[04:48] <cemilb_> spx2: Did you ping me?
[04:48] <rajiv_nair> citek: install ALSA mixer
[04:48] <nothlit> jrib, rofl
[04:48] <[erisco] > it isn't worth messing with configurations files..
[04:48] <[erisco] > thanks anyways though, guys
[04:48] <lupine_85> I doubt you need to worry about 160KB of RAM that isn't likely to be used anyway
[04:49] <Malfist> Can dpkg resolve dependancies?
[04:49] <jrib> [erisco] : it's just unchecking a box in gconf-editor
[04:49] <nothlit> [erisco] , its no big deal, if you mess up just enter rm -fr ~/.gconf in your console
[04:49] <dabaR> jrib: I met a guy called jbird today in person, and I kept calling him jrib, wondering where I got the jrib from...
[04:49] <jrib> dabaR: heh
[04:49] <kitche> Malfist: no it jsut installs one deb
[04:49] <kitche> !dpkg
[04:49] <ubotu> dpkg is the Debian package maintenance system, which together with apt forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit.
[04:49] <nolimitsoya> how do i search using apt-cache restricting to installed packages? --installed dont seem to work...
[04:49] <dabaR> Malfist: resolve deps how? like download the dependencies from some repository?
[04:49] <Malfist> how can I get a third party deb file I have resolve dependancies
[04:50] <Malfist> or how to set a SVN
[04:50] <jrib> nolimitsoya: easier to use aptitude search, see /usr/share/doc/aptitude.  The page on search options
[04:50] <lupine_85> Malfist: you have all the fun of finding what .debs it needs, and installing them manually
[04:50] <Malfist> I'm fairly new to linux
[04:50] <Malfist> loevly
[04:50] <dabaR> nolimitsoya: dpkg -l?
[04:50] <nolimitsoya> dabaR, thank you
[04:50] <lupine_85> generally considered to be a bad idea, since you've no idea if the .deb files are compiled appropriately for youe system
[04:50] <dabaR> nolimitsoya: and grep then...
[04:51] <Pelo> Malfist,  this may help some  http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/ , but I am not sure that answers your question
[04:51] <dabaR> Malfist: you want to set up a subversion server?
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> dabaR, grep what?
[04:51] <Malfist> no, I wan't to connect to one
[04:51] <[erisco] > I only see an option to remove the drive icons... I want ALL of my icons to be hidden from view. My folders, links, and files.
[04:51] <JJones0207> so how would i install xubuntu
[04:51] <dabaR> nolimitsoya: dpkg -l | grep <keyword>
[04:51] <lupine_85> svn co <url to svn repo>; cd <directory>; ./autogen.sh; ./configure --prefix=/usr; make; make install
[04:51] <JJones0207> get the alternate installer?
[04:51] <lupine_85> you'll need to install the subversion package
[04:51] <kitche> JJones0207: no get the xubuntu install cd unless you have ubuntu already installed
[04:51] <nolimitsoya> dabaR, thank you :)
[04:52] <nothlit> [erisco] , you'll have to move them temporarily into a folder
[04:52] <Malfist> is it just subversion?
[04:52] <lupine_85> exact procedure after svn co may differ, depending on how it's been set up of course...
[04:52] <jrib> [erisco] : ah then an easy way is to tell nautilus to not handle the desktop
[04:52] <JJones0207> no OS is installed right now
[04:52] <dabaR> Malfist: you want to connect to a subversion repository?
[04:52] <Malfist> dabaR yes
[04:52] <[erisco] > jrib, but I need to be able to see the Desktop... -.- maybe this isn't very practical
[04:52] <JJones0207> I got the install cd
[04:52] <nothlit> [erisco] , you'll have to move them temporarily into a folder
[04:52] <jrib> [erisco] : you will see the background, nautilus just handles the icons
[04:52] <Pelo> JJones0207, pop it in and boot
[04:52] <[erisco] > nothlit, that might take a while =\
[04:53] <jrib> [erisco] : /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop in gconf-editor, try it
[04:53] <Malfist> dabaR: yes I'm a java programmer new to linux
[04:53] <lupine_85> Malfist: you'll need build-essential as well, to actually compile anything
[04:53] <Malfist> I have build-essential
[04:53] <lupine_85> not to mention a java sdk etc
[04:53] <nothlit> [erisco] , just make a temp folder in your home folder and select and and drag them inside
[04:53] <[erisco] > jrib, wow nice
[04:53] <citek> How do I get a C++ Compiler for Linux Ubuntu!!!???
[04:53] <JJones0207> in BIOS it says its 640 reserved
[04:53] <dabaR> JJones0207: install cd being what? alternate or desktop?
[04:53] <jrib> citek: install build-essential
[04:53] <JJones0207> Desktop
[04:53] <JJones0207> xubuntu
[04:53] <lupine_85> citek: install build-essential; g++ will be your C++ compiler
[04:53] <[erisco] > nothlit, jrib's solution was actually pretty good. Thanks though, I appreciate your help greatly.
[04:54] <Malfist> exit thank you
[04:54] <citek> lupine/jrib ty!
[04:54] <dabaR> JJones0207: so you are asking how to install with a cd?
[04:54] <lupine_85> heh, nasty punishmrny :p
[04:54] <JJones0207> I would know if it would even run the CD
[04:54] <dabaR> Pelo:
[04:54] <Pelo> dabaR
[04:55] <JJones0207> hold on
[04:55] <dabaR> JJones0207: so it does not start from your CD?
[04:55] <JJones0207> wait a second
[04:55] <polpak> JJones0207: you need to specify that the boot order should boot from the CD
[04:55] <JJones0207> its starting
[04:56] <JJones0207> im clicking start or install xubuntu
[04:56] <[erisco] > is there a way to kill and reload the desktop? like you would do killall gnome-panel
[04:56] <jerp> killall nautilus
[04:56] <dabaR> [erisco] : the desktop is controlled by nautilus the file manager
[04:56] <Pelo> JJones0207,   start will get you to a live cd desktop , you can also install from there,   install will get you to install directly I beleive
[04:57] <[erisco] > dabaR, yes. I have disabled the desktop and am now trying to enable it again. I have done that, but it is not drawing the icons again.
[04:57] <spx2> citek: use gcc or g++
[04:57] <dabaR> Pelo: it is the same option:P
[04:57] <jerp> get the icons back by going into the config  editor
[04:58] <wastrel> [erisco] :  if you create a new folder on the desktop, does the icon show?
[04:58] <Pelo> dabaR,  then why did he ask ???
[04:58] <jerp> application/system/configuration editor
[04:58] <[erisco] > wastrel, nautilus is currently not handling the Desktop. I cannot even right-click ;) I have purposely disabled it
[04:58] <dabaR> Pelo: bad punctuation?!
[04:59] <jerp> enter icons in the 'find' aand it gives a list in the bottom window
[04:59] <Pelo> damn him and his typing
[04:59] <jrib> [erisco] : start nautilus
[04:59] <[erisco] > jrib, smart idea. Thanks hehe.
[05:00] <[erisco] > well thanks for your help everyone! night!

[05:02] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit

[05:21] <hajiki> splash screen thingy??
[05:21] <Pelo> hajiki,  read the link you gave , there are installation instructions on it
[05:22] <piedoggie> so any suggestions on how to mount a second disk that was created with lvm?
[05:22] <hajiki> yeah, but i dont know how to copy the file to the grub folder...
[05:23] <piedoggie> grub is found in /boot/grub

[05:26] <piedoggie> ah
[05:27] <hajiki> should change the (hd1,0) like the instructions say
[05:27] <piedoggie> never changed the splas and probably never will

[05:27] <wabbit> hi all I'm a newbie to ubuntu... I just dist upgraded my dapper distribution to edgy but the apt/source.list still shows dapper. Do I need to change the source.list myself to point to edgy??
[05:28] <jerp> I found a place today online where you could adopt a penguin for something like $25
[05:28] <piedoggie> I look at it so rarely
[05:28] <wabbit> or am I missing something??
[05:28] <arrenlex> wabbit: How did you manage to upgrade to edgy if your sources.list is dapper?
[05:28] <piedoggie> squewwy wabbit
[05:28] <wabbit> apt-get dist upgrade
[05:28] <wabbit> I ran that command
[05:28] <arrenlex> wabbit: If that upgraded your system, then you have edgy in your sources.list
[05:28] <mdious> that wouldn't have worked...i thought you had to change the source list first
[05:28] <nothlit> !upgrade
[05:28] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:28] <noiesmo> wabbit, unless your sources.list says edgy not dapper then you have not upgraded
[05:28] <arrenlex> mdious: Of course.
[05:29] <wastrel> !upgrade | wabbit
[05:29] <ubotu> wabbit: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes

[05:29] <wastrel> also, welcome to ubuntu :] 
[05:30] <mdious> stupid question...what is the name of that...'new' (i am way behind) thing that replaces initrd images...i just ah can't think of it :(
[05:30] <mdious> remfs or something like that...
[05:30] <kitche> mdious: you mean mkcpio?
[05:31] <wabbit> thanks I will give it a shot
[05:32] <mdious> kitche:  nah I don't think so...it was something starting with r
[05:32] <arrenlex> mdious: initramfs comes to mind. But I'm not sure that's the same thing.
[05:32] <Pelo> hajiki,   just  gksu nautilus that will allow you to move the file into the /boot/grub folder and edit the file you need as well
[05:32] <mdious> That's wha ti am trying to think of thank you!
[05:33] <kitche> mdious: well I know that in the kernel ther eis mkcpio now instead of the old initrd set
[05:33] <hajiki> pelo: done that
[05:33] <mdious> arrenlex:  thank you i will be able to sleep tonight
[05:33] <mdious> kitche:  cheers
[05:33] <hajiki> i want to know if i should change the (hd1,0) like the instructions say
[05:34] <nothlit> no
[05:34] <Pelo> hajiki,  I don'T know if you should or not,  I am gonna try it as is firt and if it doesn'T work my hdd is hda1 so I will try that

[05:37] <hajiki> here
[05:37] <hajiki> splashimage=(hd1,0)/boot/grub/blu.xpm.gz
[05:37] <hajiki> Change the (hd1,0) if you have a different setup.
[05:37] <shiv> how do I resolve this: shiv@shiv-desktop:~$ fsl
[05:37] <shiv> You need to source an FSL setup file - either fsl.sh or fsl.csh in $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf !
[05:37] <Pelo> arrenlex,  nothlit  that line only points to a location for a spalsh image,  do you realy thing it will keep the computer from booting ?
[05:37] <jerp> what possess a person to not write for gnome, a few lines to a file to accommodate the person who would like to have his windows open in the center of the desktop?

[05:50] <ThePub> nothlit: yeah, and ti's a sticky bit
[05:50] <feross> arrenlex: I knowabout sudo, I'm talking about making it so that I can script it and it just runs, but the program has to be run as root

[05:50] <nothlit> ... lol
[05:50] <bruenig> feross, you have to do something with visudo

[05:51] <feross> bruenig: yeah, you're right.. I'll look it up. I think I saw something about that.
[05:51] <ThePub> nothlit: if you have input, say it.  don't just laugh at me.  if I'm wrong, correct me.
[05:51] <manc> uncheck "volumes_visible"
[05:51] <arrenlex> feross: your options are to a) configure sudo so you can run that particular command without a password, or b) set the suid
[05:51] <nothlit> feross, if you need something without user interaction, just run a cron job?
[05:51] <Pelo> manc,  thanks

[05:53] <feryana> is possible to deactivate a keyboard (I have a keyboard plugged to a laptop and I would like to deactivate laptop's integrated keyboard!!!!

[05:53] <feross> arrenlex: ok thanks, lemme look
[05:53] <manc> nothlit, yeah, I read that tip somewhere
[05:53] <Pelo> ok , thanks guys,   gotta go now, it's getting late
[05:53] <Pelo> g'night
[05:54] <nothlit> manc, thats how i mount all my drives
[05:54] <ThePub> what's the difference?
[05:54] <piedoggie> freyana:  probably not.  kbd handling is mediated by the bios
[05:54] <manc> nothlit, where is the line that tells ubuntu to mount them in media?
[05:54] <nothlit>  /media makes gnome shove the drives everywhere
[05:55] <nothlit> manc, you have to edit your fstab and make a mount point
[05:55] <manc> nothlit, thanks, I'll check that out
[05:55] <ThePub> it's pretty convenient then if it's related to how they get placed in the places menu

[05:56] <hendrixski> How can I start up my other partition as a virtual machine in VMware
[05:57] <nothlit> you need to edit the hard drive settings to give it direct access
[05:57] <nothlit> check the properties
[05:57] <Phuzion> Is there a way to open a specific window with Gnome's file browser through the command line?
[05:57] <nothlit> you may have to add it from the begining of the wizard

[06:01] <dav085> hey guys, im new to ubuntu, I just got it installed on my laptop and need a bit of help setting things up, can nyone give me a hand?
[06:01] <czambran> but then I get ohci_hcd Found HC with no IRQ Check BIOS/PCI
[06:01] <czambran> BTW, it is a 64 bit machine
[06:01] <arrenlex> dav085: Why don't you just ask your questions so we can all help you? :)
[06:02] <dav085> sounds good lol
[06:02] <edwardocallaghan> dav085:im me
[06:02] <Phuzion> Is there a way to open a specific window with Gnome's file browser through the command line?
[06:02] <hendrixski> I installed edgy on a really old laptop, got all sorts of errors, but theinstall worked fine, oddly enough. but i don't remember any of them mentioning the BIOS
[06:02] <arrenlex> !pm | edwardocallaghan | dav085
[06:02] <ubotu> edwardocallaghan | dav085: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[06:02] <jrib> Phuzion: nautilus /path/to/whereever
[06:02] <czambran> hendrixski: the thing is that after it shows the error messages it doesn't do anything else
[06:02] <hendrixski> ah, the 64 bit... that's out of my league
[06:03] <czambran> I am desperate to get rid of Windows
[06:03] <h08817> czambran, where did u get ur copy of ubuntu?
[06:03] <edwardocallaghan> I can't read everything at once
[06:03] <czambran> hendrixski: thanks anyway. I really appreciate that you asked
[06:03] <czambran> h08817: ubuntu.com
[06:03] <skmidry> I'm using Intel wireless ipw3945 on my HP laptop - I am unable to enable WEP on dapper
[06:03] <edwardocallaghan> I am coding on the other monitor sorry
[06:03] <hendrixski> czambran, isn't there a separate disc for 64 bit machines?
[06:03] <skmidry> I'm able to use only WPA
[06:03] <h08817> so u made ur own cd im guessing?
[06:03] <czambran> hendrixski: yes there is
[06:03] <hendrixski> is that the one you're using?
[06:03] <czambran> h08817: you will be guessing right
[06:03] <czambran> hendrixski: yes
[06:04] <czambran> h08817: I run the CD check on it
[06:04] <h08817> i had many problems when installing ubuntu
[06:04] <skmidry> Any way of enabling WEP?
[06:04] <Phuzion> jrib:  thanks
[06:04] <h08817> you must be running an older pc
[06:04] <zcat[1] > I would recomend using 32 bit even on a 64bit machine... because all the nonfree stuff (3d drivers, wifi drivers, flash...) is compiled for 32 bit and won't work in 64 bit..
[06:04] <czambran> h08817: It is actually a spanking new computer
[06:04] <h08817> wow thats interesting
[06:05] <czambran> h08817: I got my wife a laptop, so that I could get her Desktop
[06:05] <h08817> so maybe you should try zcat
[06:05] <czambran> zcat?
[06:05] <h08817> try the 32bit and see what happens
[06:05] <czambran> I tried that too
[06:05] <dav085> i am using a ASUS notebook with a clean install of ubuntu and I need to somehow get my wireless to work
[06:05] <czambran> and nothing
[06:05] <h08817> hmm
[06:05] <dav085> i downloaded ndiswrapper
[06:05] <edwardocallaghan> Has anyone seen the Sun Ultra 20M2 Desktops they are amazing
[06:05] <czambran> h08817: it is frustratring not being able to get rid of windows
[06:06] <h08817> well do u have a windows recovery disk?
[06:06] <edwardocallaghan> +They don't have broken ACPI ;0
[06:06] <czambran> h08817: on the new computer, they make a partition of the disk where they store the recovery information
[06:06] <dav085> edward i tried to pm u but i cant coz im not registered :S
[06:06] <dav085> i will register and try again
[06:06] <h08817> yeah with hp its retarded
[06:06] <nothlit> brunner, people are already running bittorrent on there
[06:07] <edwardocallaghan> dav085:hold on there
[06:07] <czambran> h08817: I like HP computers because they have a pretty good CS, which is still on the US
[06:07] <h08817> you might need to use the fdisk utility outside of windows to remove hte partitions
[06:07] <h08817> but then you are out of an OS
[06:07] <h08817> you can run windows and linux together
[06:07] <Willa> can someone help me figure out why my videocard is laggy In Ubuntu?
[06:07] <dav085> yup
[06:07] <czambran> h08817: nop, I am in the US, but they wont give me any support with regard to Linux
[06:07] <h08817> well of course not
[06:07] <czambran> h08817: those sons of a gun
[06:07] <arrenlex> czambran: That's what we're for! What happened, again? xD
[06:07] <Willa> Are there only 1 type of Nvidia drivers out there?
[06:08] <czambran> arrenlex: I can't install Ubuntu on my HP Pavilion 1230n 64 bit
[06:08] <arrenlex> Willa: There is "nv" which is open-source but does not support 3D acceleration, and "nvidia" from the official people which is closed-source.
[06:08] <Willa> hello?
[06:08] <noiesmo> !nvidia | Willa
[06:08] <ubotu> Willa: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:08] <h08817> czambran, how much memory do u have?
[06:08] <arrenlex> czambran: "can't install" is kind of vague.
[06:08] <czambran> h08817: 1Gb
[06:08] <Willa> Right I've done that noiesmo. thx
[06:08] <czambran> arrenlex: My Bad. I get the following errors
[06:08] <h08817> wow u have plenty
[06:08] <Willa> I need more help than just a url.
[06:08] <noiesmo> !envy | willa
[06:08] <ubotu> willa: envy is a Perl script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[06:09] <czambran> arrenlex: MP-BIO bug 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[06:09] <czambran> h08817: I thought it should be enough to at least get it going
=== Kimahri is now known as Tidus
[06:09] <h08817> o definitely
[06:09] <hendrixski> ubotu, is there something similar for ati drivers?
[06:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is there something similar for ati drivers? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:09] <h08817> !ati
[06:09] <czambran> arrenlex: I was able to get past that by adding noapic on the installion options
[06:09] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:09] <emosamurai> Hi, how do I access the console?
[06:09] <arrenlex> czambran: a) when do you get that error? b) what are you trying to install?
[06:09] <x-r00t-x> hello . can anyone tell me how do i convert mpg to 3gp ?
[06:09] <Jordan_U> czambran: Did you try the "noapci" kernel option ?
[06:10] <arrenlex> emosamurai: The command line, or an actual terminal?
[06:10] <bruenig> emosamurai, you can use the terminal?
[06:10] <edwardocallaghan> /etc/X11/xorg.conf is where the config file is
[06:10] <emosamurai> I just installed Ubuntu after formatting my hard drive.
[06:10] <czambran> arrenlex: but then I get the following error message: ohci_hcd Found GC with no IRQ Check BIOS/PCI
[06:10] <edwardocallaghan> back it up before you do anything with new drivers
[06:10] <czambran> Jordan_U: Yes, and that kind of worked
[06:10] <Willa> arrenlex: I installed drivers for my old videocard. Its an nvidia 6800Gt 128mb.   Everything works fine. Things were just a little laggy, So I picked up a 5200 256mb videocard. nvidia as well.. However with the 256mb videocard, everything is very laggy.
[06:10] <emosamurai> Ah, found it.
[06:10] <emosamurai> Sorry.
[06:10] <czambran> Jordan_U: what is acpi anyways?
[06:10] <rubso> VLC sucks in ubuntu, when i enlarge the window, the rest of it hide under the taskbar.
[06:11] <Willa> vlc works fine in ubuntu for moi.
[06:11] <edwardocallaghan> Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
[06:11] <feross> hey guys, 'xhost +localhost' will allow root to run X programs but will it keep those setting after a reboot or do I have to enable it in a config somewhere?
[06:11] <gouki> Willa: Things are 'laggy' probably because the the proprietary drivers are not installed
[06:11] <arrenlex> czambran: power management.
[06:11] <Jordan_U> czambran: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
[06:11] <rubso> Willa, what's your screen resolution?
[06:11] <czambran> I tried looking an answer on the Ubuntu forums, and found several threads with people going through the same things, but somebody has yet to give an asnwer
[06:11] <wapityyy> anyone know how to put the good quotes for thi ?  raid_div.innerHTML += '<a href="" onclick="ShowUser(user,atk,hp); return false;">'+user_node[0] .firstChild.nodeValue+'</a>'; for user atk and hp pls ?
[06:11] <Willa> gouki: Yet they were working fine with the older 128mb videocard ???
[06:11] <bruenig> rubso, an isolated incident occurs on your desktop, and you conclude an application sucks on an entire distro
[06:11] <arrenlex> czambran: what are you installing from?
[06:11] <Willa> rubso 720p
[06:11] <czambran> arrenlex and Jordan_U: Do i need it?
[06:11] <minerale> what is the linux equivalent for windows's ipconfig /flushDNS  ( to clear some outdated dns records ) ?
[06:11] <gouki> Willa: With no drivers installed?
[06:11] <arrenlex> czambran: You have it. It's hardware.
[06:12] <brunner> nothlit: where? on silenceisdefeat.org or on http://66.118.187.72/ ?
[06:12] <emosamurai> What's the best IRC client for Ubuntu?
[06:12] <rubso> Willa: that's explains it all, although it shouldn't be "720p" except if you were using an HDTV.
[06:12] <gouki> emosamurai: irssi
[06:12] <arrenlex> !best | emosamurai
[06:12] <czambran> arrenlex: I am not sure what you mean. I downloaded the 64big alternate edgy cd, and burned on a CD which is what I am using
[06:12] <ubotu> emosamurai: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[06:12] <Willa> gouki: I just swapped the 128mb out, and put the 256mb in. I'm trying to figure out if there is something else I need to do besides a nviida-glx
[06:12] <gop> !house
[06:12] <Jordan_U> emosamurai: irssi or xchat IMHO
[06:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about house - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:12] <x-r00t-x> emosamurai, xchat
[06:12] <nothlit_> brunner, the 66.118
[06:12] <czambran> arrenlex:  so I shouldn't worry about having to use noapic to get a little further
[06:12] <richee> !kill
[06:12] <arrenlex> czambran: Yes, that is what I mean. Try running a liveCD (Desktop CD) and see if it even starts.
[06:12] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[06:13] <x-r00t-x> !xchat | emosamurai
[06:13] <Willa> rubso: 1. Its hooked up to my plasma tv... 2. A low 720p resolution wouldn't have anything to do with anything.
[06:13] <czambran> arrenlex: I tried, but it gets stuck on the splash screen
[06:13] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.6-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 275 kB, installed size 760 kB
[06:13] <czambran> arrenlex:  I tried that first
[06:13] <arrenlex> czambran: ...wow. Nice box. o_O
[06:13] <arrenlex> czambran: what's weird about this machine?
[06:13] <dav085> do i need a virus program installed on ubuntu for protection?
[06:13] <czambran> arrenlex: Tell me about it
[06:13] <nothlit_>  /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/btdownloadcurses.bittorrent America_-_Freedom_to_Fascism_-_XviD.torrent
[06:13] <Willa> 720p is Low for a computer to run anyway.
[06:13] <nothlit_> oops
[06:13] <Willa> gouki: any halp?
[06:13] <arrenlex> !virus | dav085
[06:13] <czambran> arrenlex: Weird? I don't know. It runs Windows just fine
[06:13] <ubotu> dav085: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[06:14] <dav085> !virus
[06:14] <ubotu> A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[06:14] <nothlit_> anyways thats what was running on that server
[06:14] <Jordan_U> czambran: coould you try removing the "quiet" and "splash" parameters and see if there are any notable errors?
[06:14] <czambran> arrenlex: I was hoping somebody here could tell me how to install Ubuntu on it, so that I can use it as my * server
[06:14] <czambran> sure
[06:14] <czambran> give me 1 sec
[06:14] <czambran> don't go anywhere ;)
[06:15] <gouki> Willa: Nahh. Proprietary drivers is all there is needed
[06:15] <dav085> i have downloaded ndiswrapper, will this be able to get me onto the net in ubuntu on my wireless card?
[06:15] <gouki> Willa: You're using GNOME, right?
[06:15] <Willa> gouki: where do I install those?
[06:15] <Willa> gouki: i'm not 100% sure
[06:15] <Willa> I am a total ubuntu n00b.
[06:15] <carlfk_la1> GeForce2 MX/MX 400 - how do I use the s-video port?
[06:15] <Willa> I installed the most recent version ooff of the website like 3 weeks ago.
[06:15] <rubso> yo guys, are you using Flash 9 beta in your web browsers?
[06:15] <czambran> Jordan_U:  Only the quiet option was available, which I took out. I also added the noapic option
[06:16] <gouki> Willa: Man, have you installed nVidia drivers? And no, they don't come with Ubuntu (yet)
[06:16] <arrenlex> rubso: Yes. Why?
[06:16] <Willa> yes
[06:16] <Willa> for ym 128mb videocard
[06:16] <piedoggie> just learned something about lvm.  it you loose/don't backup the /etc/lvm/backup/* file, you are hosed and in for a good long reconstruction session
[06:16] <gouki> Willa: Do those drivers support your new graphics card?
[06:16] <arrenlex> lose *
[06:16] <Willa> gouki ok, I have 2 videocards. 128mb is the old 256mb is the new:   I did nvidia-glx for the 128mb.

[06:27] <Willa> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[06:27] <Emo_Samurai> What's a good all-purpose media player for ubuntu?
[06:27] <Jordan_U> czambran: No, I don't, you could try putting your hardware info in google.com/linux
[06:27] <will_> ..
[06:27] <Emo_Samurai> Something along the lines of Winamp?
[06:27] <czambran> Jordan_U: thanks
[06:27] <Pie-rate> gouki: the DNS stuff is all set up already
[06:27] <zcat[1] > Emo_Samurai: beep-media-player
[06:27] <nothlit> Pie-rate, its a dns record, depends on how much control you over the domain
[06:28] <gouki> Pie-rate: Even MX Record?
[06:28] <Pie-rate> i don't know, actually
[06:28] <Pie-rate> but i've gotten mail working with a different linux box on the same domain before
[06:28] <gouki> Pie-rate: So how can you tell it's "all set up already"
[06:28] <Willa> Jordan_U" Ok, now I have a configuring xserver-xorg window
[06:28] <Jordan_U> Willa: Yes, run that command once you have installed the new card and choose nvidia as the driver
[06:29] <bcstv> what is dbus?
[06:29] <Willa> done
[06:29] <Willa> so select the res now?
[06:29] <zcat[1] > with no MX, mail will probably get delivered to the A record IP anyhow... but still you should have an MX. And then you just install an MTA and open port 25 to the world..
[06:29] <arrenlex> !dbus | bcstv
[06:29] <Jordan_U> Willa: Yes.
[06:29] <ubotu> dbus: simple interprocess messaging system. In component main, is optional. Version 0.93-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 312 kB, installed size 660 kB
[06:29] <Emo_Samurai> zcat[1] : The site says that there isn't a bmpx package for Ubuntu yet.
[06:30] <gouki> zcat[1] : And maybe think about adding an SPF record (=
[06:30] <gotit> isnt help available for novice guys
[06:30] <Rugmonster> Emo_Samurai: you can get it from the bmpx site
[06:30] <Willa> Jordan_U: k.
[06:30] <Willa> now im back to the shell
[06:30] <zcat[1] > Hmm.. not sure how I installed it.. try !seveas ?
[06:30] <gouki> Emo_Samurai: Download and compile the source, or use another player. I recommend VLC or mPlayer
[06:30] <Jordan_U> Willa: run: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[06:30] <nothlit> !search beep
[06:30] <ubotu> Found: players,winamp
[06:30] <Rugmonster> Anyone know how one goes about submitting a patch for a broken package?

[06:30] <Flannel> gotit: what are you trying to do?
[06:30] <gotit> i installed ubuntu, now i want to give internet access to 4 or 8 computer on 4 diff networks what should i do  i am novice and i want to do it with a usb dsl modem
[06:30] <bcstv> arrenlex: why would I get a warning could not initiate dbus
[06:30] <Willa> Jordan_U: actually it gave me an error
[06:30] <zcat[1] > I definately never installed it from source, so someone has a package...
[06:31] <sanityx> WOW my transfer speed is slow. Its never this slow on windows. Broadcom needs to release linux drivers.
[06:31] <Rugmonster> Beep Media Player (BMP) is different from BMPx
[06:31] <Willa> postinst warning: not updating /etc/x11/x file has been customized.
[06:31] <Jordan_U> Willa: The reconfigure or the sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart ?
[06:31] <Rugmonster> sanityx: it's probably where you are downloading from
[06:31] <arrenlex> bcstv: Possibly because you don't have it installed.
[06:31] <Willa> jordan the reconfigure
[06:31] <Willa> Jordan_U: the reconfigure
[06:31] <lockdowNAlex> hey guys i need help acessing my windows XP FAT32 partition through ubuntu
[06:31] <Willa> Not really error, just warnings.
[06:31] <Flannel> Rugmonster: that'd depend on what repository the package was in.  Although, contacting the package manager is a good start (also, see if it has a bugreport in launchpad and upload there)
[06:31] <sanityx> Rugmonster, Yeah, I thought so too. Except that its never goes higher than 20 KB/s no matter what I'm doing. Even plain web surfing is slow
[06:31] <Emo_Samurai> How do I compile the source code?
[06:32] <Flannel> !compile | Emo_Samurai

[06:32] <zcat[1] > hehe, beat me to it :)
[06:32] <bcstv> I guess the question is do I need it?
[06:32] <Jordan_U> Willa: can you pastebin the errors?
[06:32] <BigCanOfTuna> One more question, how would I get the kernel source?
[06:32] <sanityx> kernel.org
[06:32] <nothlit> zcat[1] , b-e = ?
[06:32] <Rugmonster> Flannel: I've put the patch in launchpad and been the primary person tracking it there, but no one has really touched it.
[06:32] <Willa> sorry, they aren't errors. just warnings
[06:32] <zcat[1] > apt-get install linux-something-source
[06:32] <Flannel> Rugmonster: try emailing the maintainer
[06:32] <Rugmonster> Flannel: it's cyrus in universal for edgy
[06:32] <gotit> everybody just f******* asking me wat kind of hell i am in and than no one tells me how to get out

[06:33] <Jordan_U> Willa: a warning like " there was already a configured xorg.conf..." ?
[06:33] <Flannel> Rugmonster: yeah, if it's in universe, definately want the contact the maintainer
[06:33] <Willa> Here let me tell u
[06:33] <nothlit> zcat[1] , elaborate pls?
[06:33] <Sorroww> hey guys
[06:33] <Aversin> I have Beryl installed and can open the manager, but none of the functions seem to be working. Anyone have any ideas?
[06:33] <will_> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh

[06:34] <nothlit> zcat[1] , ahh
[06:34] <gotit> why the hell everyone is ignoring me ??
[06:34] <zcat[1] > *build-essential rather, but yeah...
[06:34] <gouki> gotit: How can we help?
[06:34] <Flannel> gotit: not ignoring, either don't understand, don't know the answer, or whatever.
[06:34] <nothlit> Aversin, glxinfo | grep direct
[06:34] <Rugmonster> Flannel: and where might I find their email address. I can't find any contact info.
[06:34] <Flannel> gotit: so, you want to use your computer as a router? or what?
[06:34] <zcat[1] > gotit: cos some of us missed the question?
[06:35] <gouki> *glrxinfo
[06:35] <Willa> they were just warnings.
[06:35] <Sorroww> can anyone help me out?
[06:35] <Jordan_U> Willa: The second error you said is normal, the first I can't remember seeing before but is probably OK
[06:35] <Willa> I did the restart command.
[06:35] <gotit> Flannel: yeah
[06:35] <Flannel> Rugmonster: Um.  Is it not in the package details?  If not, google... I suppose
[06:35] <Emo_Samurai> What's the build-essential package?
[06:35] <nothlit> gotit, dhcp + router?
[06:35] <nothlit> gotit, if you have a network setup + 8 comps then what are you really asking?
[06:35] <arrenlex> Emo_Samurai: a metapackage that depends on a compiler, assembler, linker, and some basic libraries, so you can compile and build stuff.
[06:35] <zcat[1] > Emo_Samurai: a metapackage that makes apt install the compiler, linker, headers, etc... to compile stuff
[06:35] <gotit> flannel:i want to use is as a router or i can give them access by firewall
[06:35] <arrenlex> xD
[06:35] <Aversin> It says the glx extensions are missing
[06:36] <Willa> Jordan_U: did the restart command. Now im just looking at a blinking _
[06:36] <Emo_Samurai> arrenlex: How do I get it?
[06:36] <Aversin> I will try and reinstall
[06:36] <nothlit> !xgl | aversin

[06:36] <BigCanOfTuna> If I do an apt-get kernel-source, will that give me the source code for the version of kernel I am currently using?
[06:36] <gotit> nothlit:i dont have network setup
[06:36] <Sorroww> is there anyone to test my sound card?
[06:36] <Emo_Samurai> arrenlex: Where do I type that? I'm a total n00b.
[06:36] <zcat[1] > Emo_Samurai: the webpage address has scrolled past three times in 10 minutes. read it :)
[06:36] <BigCanOfTuna> Sorroww: I don't hear it.
[06:36] <gotit> me too
[06:36] <Aversin> Thanks I will go and read. I will let you know how it works out.
[06:36] <Willa> Jordan_U: should I force a power restart?
[06:36] <arrenlex> Emo_Samurai: You should take the synaptic walkthrough.

[06:37] <Flannel> gotit: this page might help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuWirelessRouter  I don't know if it's complete though.
[06:37] <czambran> This may sound like a stupid question, but do I have to use the Ubuntu 64bit, on my 64 bit machine or can I use the 32bit version, since it can support both?
[06:37] <gotit> nothlit: i just installed ubuntu
[06:37] <zcat[1] > gotit: I'd start by installing firestarter. It makes setting up firewall and forwarding/NAT rules really easy.
[06:37] <sanityx> czambran, You can use 32bit, in fact I reccomend it.
[06:38] <arrenlex> czambran: Feel free to use 32-bit :) it's much easier
[06:38] <czambran> arrenlex and sanityx: thanks. I will try that, and see how it goes
[06:38] <czambran> maybe I wont have the install problems
[06:38] <czambran> who knows
[06:38] <Jordan_U> Willa: Ok, to get basic video working reconfigure again but choose "vesa" instead of nvidia

[06:43] <Willa> ..
[06:43] <Willa> So, can anyone see me?
[06:43] <tonyyarusso> Willa: yes
[06:43] <Jordan_U> Willa: Yes
[06:43] <zcat[1] > Willa: no
[06:43] <Amaranth> Willa: Please speak closer to the microphone.
[06:43] <DLB|Maximus> how stupid
[06:44] <Willa> Jordan_U: so I'm back in the GUI now.
[06:44] <DLB|Maximus> god forbid we got off topic for 2 whole minutes
[06:44] <Willa> Jordan_U: I switched it back to vesa and did a ctrl-alt-f2
[06:44] <gotit> can anyone read this
[06:44] <lemonsCC> gotit yes
[06:44] <gotit> :) good ok

[06:45] <zcat[1] > si? !es | stonarmusic
[06:45] <Jordan_U> Willa: Ok, can you pastebin your xorg.conf?

[06:45] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[06:45] <zcat[1] > :)
[06:45] <Willa> Jordan_U: how do I get a xorg.conf ?
[06:46] <gouki> Willa: nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:46] <zcat[1] > Willa: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:46] <lemonsCC> willa run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
=== manuleviking_ is now known as manuleviking
[06:47] <Willa> eh.
[06:47] <Amaranth> Willa: If you want a stock xorg.conf (like it was when you installed) just run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg
[06:47] <lemonsCC> in terminal put in the above command
[06:48] <Amaranth> It might ask one question but I'm pretty sure it just autogenerates everything like it did on install.
[06:48] <Willa> Well.. I just want to update my videocard drivers :\ thats really all.
[06:48] <gouki> Guys, Jordan_U asked Willa to post his xorg.conf
[06:48] <lemonsCC> lol oh
[06:48] <darkangel_> I need help with my sound card It doesn't work

[06:49] <gouki> Willa: Do this on the Terminal: cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf > ~/IRC
[06:49] <lemonsCC> Willa copy/paste
[06:50] <gouki> Willa: Than paste the content of that file, or upload the file, so that Jorgan_U can see it
[06:50] <zcat[1] > !pastebin
[06:50] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:50] <lemonsCC> gouki he may get kicked for flooding
[06:50] <gouki> lemonsCC: Yeah, I forgot to mention pastebin :S

[06:51] <snype> I'm not sure about the difference
[06:51] <arrenlex> snype: Do you mean 3D acceleration, or just direct rendering?
[06:51] <arrenlex> snype: Direct rendering != 3D acceleration. xD
[06:52] <lemonsCC> Willa in terminal type dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:52] <lemonsCC> Willa then answer the questions

[06:59] <arrenlex> Catshrimp: does it not look nice right now? xD
[06:59] <snype_> cause fglrx wont give me aiglx
[06:59] <arrenlex> snype_: your card is too old for fglrx, yeah.
[06:59] <gotit> can any one help me too for God sake guys
[06:59] <Catshrimp> No, it looks horrible ;)  The buttons and input boxes are all 3D (rather than just outlined in a nice light color)
[06:59] <snype_> well i have fglrx and it's pretty good. just no aiglx w/ fglrx
[06:59] <Jordan_U> Willa: I don't know :) at this point I am not sure what the problem is so I am just troubleshooting.
[06:59] <arrenlex> snype_: But it's not an indicator. My card isn't and it still doesn't work... fglrx was coded in notepad by a blindfolded intern.
[06:59] <snype_> hah
[07:00] <snype_> good to know
[07:00] <lemonsCC> wooooo
[07:00] <yanchik> whats going on?
[07:00] <yanchik> why are people dying?
[07:00] <lemonsCC> world just ended
[07:00] <lemonsCC> survival of the fitest
[07:00] <arrenlex> ....this channel is not having a good day, is it.
[07:01] <lemonsCC> is it freenode?
[07:01] <arrenlex> lemonsCC: netsplit.
[07:01] <Flannel> freenode is restarting some servers.  Just, sit back.  It should end in about an hour (http://freenode.net/news.shtml)
[07:01] <manuleviking> waouh !!

[07:02] <yanchik> with sugar on top.
[07:02] <PFA> yanchik: with what
[07:02] <Flannel> We'll probably have constant splitting for an hour or so, unless they finish early.
[07:02] <yanchik> i pray to the wireless gods
[07:02] <lemonsCC> yanchik ask the question again
[07:02] <yanchik> i installed ubuntu on my desktop... wireless linksys card stopped working
[07:02] <yanchik> it worked before
[07:03] <yanchik> when i had XP running
[07:03] <arrenlex> Wow. I'm totally not used to seeing a number less than 800 on the channel listin this channel.
[07:03] <IdleOne> welcome back  all
[07:03] <arrenlex> Ah, that's better.
[07:03] <PWill> ha
[07:03] <wapityyy> i missed you guys :')
[07:03] <fowlduck> am i the only one experiencing this insane split?
[07:03] <wapityyy> i missed you guys :')
[07:03] <Willa> I'm having a problem installing an nvidia videocard driver.
[07:03] <manuleviking> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!
[07:03] <arrenlex> fowlduck: Of course not.
[07:03] <wapityyy> i missed you guys :')
[07:03] <PFA> fowlduck: nope
[07:03] <Willa> where do I put .run files?
[07:03] <Flannel> fowlduck: it's freenode rebooting stuff : freenode.net/news.shtml
[07:03] <PFA> Willa: on the street!
[07:03] <fowlduck> nice
[07:03] <Phuzion> fowlduck:  No, the entire network went down briefly for a code upgrade
[07:03] <PFA> Willa: where they belong!
[07:04] <Willa> ok...
[07:04] <jerp> could someone give some directions to chown the set of codecs they offer with/at mplayerhq
[07:04] <snype> hey  arrenelx
[07:04] <snype> http://pastebin.ca/272726
[07:04] <tonyyarusso> Freenode's restarting guys.  Enjoy the show.
[07:04] <Willa> I'm trying to install this: Nvidia-Linux-x86-1/0-9629-pkg1.run
[07:04] <PWill> jerp: chown /usr/lib/mplayer/vidix/*
[07:05] <snype> oh--- i just copy pasted that cause after all my work on my fglrx, i couldnt bear sitting and redoing that one again.
[07:05] <Jordan_U> Willa: Why?
[07:05] <PWill> jerp: what do you need to chown them for?
[07:05] <Willa> Jordan_U: its a videocard driver for nvidia cards.
[07:05] <yanchik> who was helping me?
[07:05] <yanchik> lol
[07:05] <Willa> I dont get why that wont work
[07:05] <lemonsCC> lol i asked you to repeat
[07:05] <Jordan_U> Willa: But why aren't you using the ones from the repos?
[07:05] <_goofy_> do i need a swap partition if i have 1.5GB of ram
[07:05] <lemonsCC> but i dont know much about ubuntu wireless
[07:05] <Willa> Jordan_U: i dont know why?
[07:05] <Willa> I'm a total noob
[07:05] <jerp> they were the ms codecs he develops and the were in a gunzip if I remember correctly
[07:06] <Willa> I just want to get the thing working So i can watch dvds and leave you guys all alone
[07:06] <zcat[1] > Jordan_U: none of the standard repos have the beta driver (yet)
[07:06] <jerp> they
[07:06] <snype> arrenlex do you mind if i pm you?
[07:06] <MeggaMortY> i have an ATI video card and i get a black screen when trying to boot into GNOME, i dont even hear a welcome sound, can anyone help?
[07:06] <lemonsCC> _goofy _ it is reccomended
[07:06] <arrenlex> snype: You have only one card?
[07:06] <PWill> _goofy_: always good to have one anyways
[07:06] <lemonsCC> !swap
[07:06] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[07:06] <Willa> Jordan_U: should I NOT install this from the nvidia site?
[07:06] <yanchik> lemonsCC i pm'd u
[07:06] <snype> arrenlex yes.
[07:06] <snype> its just the card in my laptop
[07:06] <arrenlex> snype: Hold on, I'll be back in 10 minutes or so... sorry.
[07:06] <lemonsCC> yanchik i don't know anything about ubuntu wireless
[07:06] <sexshun> i installed mplayer but how do i install specific codecs, xvid in particular
[07:06] <Jordan_U> Willa: Yes, there is an easier / more supported way
[07:06] <zcat[1] > Willa: you need that driver, or will the regular one (nvidia-glx) do?
[07:06] <snype> arrenelx its cool
[07:06] <lemonsCC> ROFL!
[07:07] <yanchik> anyone know about ubuntu working with wireless cards
[07:07] <Willa> ...fucking hell
[07:07] <zcat[1] > damn I need to filter parts too
[07:07] <yanchik> anyone at all
[07:07] <lemonsCC> anthony.freenode.net is the best!
[07:07] <zcat[1] > and joins
[07:07] <lemonsCC> no restarts
[07:07] <PWill> sexshun: you need to install the gstreamer libraries
[07:07] <MeggaMortY> i have an ATI video card and i get a black screen when trying to boot into GNOME, i dont even hear a welcome sound, can anyone help?
[07:07] <Willa> Jordan_U: so, what should I install instead?
[07:08] <zcat[1] > MeggaMortY: ctrl-alt-F1 get you a text login?
[07:08] <MeggaMortY> nope, i it doesnt nothing which is annoying
[07:08] <PWill> sexshun: they are in the repos as gstreamer0.10-blahblahblah
[07:08] <lemonsCC> cant display console?
[07:08] <Jordan_U> !nvidia | Willa use these instructions
[07:08] <ubotu> Willa use these instructions: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:08] <_goofy_> well ive never used oner 900 mb that i have seen......i dont game or do anthing like that
[07:08] <zcat[1] > hmm.. boot single user and look in the logs I guess
[07:09] <PWill> MeggaMortY: try booting in recovery mode, and then running `startx'
[07:09] <MeggaMortY> PWill: the second option on the splash screen?
[07:09] <lemonsCC> MeggaMorty yep should be
[07:09] <PWill> MeggaMortY: yes
[07:09] <MeggaMortY> PWill: think i've tried that option with the same outcome
[07:09] <Willa> So
[07:09] <lemonsCC> MeggaMorty in the grub list
[07:09] <Willa> Ubuntu doesn't support Geforce 3 cards?
[07:09] <PWill> MeggaMortY: it shoudl give you some kind of log file, saying why it can't start
[07:10] <jerp> PWill, at present the chown I've got is:  owner/root- rw group/root- none and others- none  (would that be "good to go")
[07:10] <echosystm> guys, i have a wee question to ask
[07:10] <Jordan_U> Willa: Who said that?
[07:10] <MeggaMortY> PWill: hmm ok, i'll see what happens, but i just get a stupid black screen
[07:10] <echosystm> im installing x/gnome on ubuntu server
[07:10] <echosystm> i used aptitude
[07:10] <echosystm> and i got this bs about needing libfam0 or something
[07:11] <PWill> jerp: i still don't know what exactly you're trying to do :-P
[07:11] <echosystm> then it said "keep blah blah blah at current version"
[07:11] <echosystm> and said y/n or quit
[07:11] <echosystm> i just said yeah lets do it
[07:11] <echosystm> but in hindsight i prbably should have checked what "it" actually is
[07:11] <echosystm> :P
[07:11] <echosystm> can anyone help?
[07:12] <lemonsCC> echosystm can you be more specific?  what was the issue?
[07:12] <echosystm> aptitude was checking for dependencies
[07:12] <echosystm> its still downloading the packages now
[07:12] <echosystm> it said i needed libfam0
[07:12] <echosystm> and all this other crap
[07:13] <echosystm> then gave me the option of yes/no/quit
[07:13] <echosystm> i just went ahead with it (yes)
[07:13] <lemonsCC> echosystm it should install it automatically, its normal
[07:13] <jerp> PWill, maybe I'm asking if I need to extend permissions for any reason to the codecs; nevertheless, since I'm not making sense maybe it's accessible for mplayer.
[07:13] <lemonsCC> thats 100% ok
[07:13] <echosystm> what is libfam0?
[07:13] <echosystm> ok cool
[07:13] <echosystm> thats what i thought
[07:13] <echosystm> i just wanted to be sure
[07:13] <Jordan_U> echosystm: It most likely just downgraded another package / set of packages to fix dependency issues, it may have removed some though
[07:13] <lemonsCC> echosystm just a library for the package
[07:13] <echosystm> (linux newbie)
[07:13] <echosystm> ok so everything should be ok?
[07:13] <PWill> jerp: yes, mplayer should be able to use all of the libraries that you have installed, however, you need to install the gstreamer libraries
[07:14] <echosystm> downgrading sounds bad
[07:14] <lemonsCC> Jordan_U cant stop aptitude now...lets see what breaks
[07:14] <Willa> how do I figure out what my kernel is?
[07:14] <lemonsCC> =)
[07:14] <genii> Hello. Anyone know where to find a precompiled kernel with sshd ? I am installing by netboot/tftpd/apt-mirror and want to ssh into the boxes as they are installing to monitor them without needing keyboards/mouse/monitor etc for each
[07:14] <PWill> jerp: which is why I recommend VLC. it comes with all the libs you need preinstalled
[07:14] <lemonsCC> !uname
[07:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uname - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:14] <jerp> ok, thanks for that
[07:14] <Arigato> what is the bash command to copy a folder and all contents in it?
[07:14] <PWill> Willa: run `uname -r' in the terminal
[07:15] <lemonsCC> arigato cp?
[07:15] <Jordan_U> echosystm: Most likely yes, but the fact that you had dependency issues in the first place is a bad sign
[07:15] <jerp> hmmm,  vlc?
[07:15] <iLLf8d> cp -R /foldername /where_you_want_to_copy_to
[07:15] <nothlit> !info libfam0 | echosystm
[07:15] <ubotu> libfam0: Client library to control the FAM daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.7.0-10ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 26 kB, installed size 108 kB
[07:15] <jerp> maybe I'm headed in the wrong direction
[07:15] <PWill> jerp: run `apt-get install vlc
[07:15] <PWill> as root
[07:15] <lemonsCC> Jordan_U i think it was just asking if he wanted to install the dependencies not specifically downgrading anything
[07:15] <jerp> ok
[07:16] <PWill> !vlc
[07:16] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[07:16] <vik> Has anyone had success getting gvim to open a file from the gnome vfs that's on a mounted scp (or sftp) server?
[07:16] <PWill> jerp: check out http://www.videolan.org
[07:16] <holycow> weird
[07:16] <Jordan_U> lemonsCC: Ohh, yes, I forgot he is new and wouldn't recognise that as normall, thanks
[07:16] <Willa> And to figure out device pcid?
[07:16] <Willa> of my videocard
[07:17] <lemonsCC> Jordan_U yep...he said its running now, hopefully all goes well
[07:17] <echosystm> all i did was sudo aptitude x-window-system-core gnome-core firefox synaptics
[07:17] <genii> iLLf8d probably -a to keep permissions is safer
[07:17] <echosystm> ive got nothing on the computer atm other othen lamp
[07:17] <lemonsCC> echosystm thats fine just wait for it to finish
[07:17] <echosystm> ok
[07:17] <iLLf8d> genii, guess I depends on what they're copying
[07:17] <nothlit> vik, just use sshfs?
[07:17] <iLLf8d> s/I/it
[07:17] <echosystm> im just worried something will be wrong, but i dont know due to my lack of knowledge :P
[07:17] <nothlit> vik, i don't like gnomevfs
[07:18] <Jordan_U> echosystm: As lemonsCC pointed out to me I was actually jumping to conclusions, what you described is perfectly normall and should happen when you install most things in fact.
[07:18] <lemonsCC> echosystm i think it was just telling you how much memory the install would take and such (this is normal)
[07:18] <echosystm> oh ok
[07:18] <echosystm> nonono
[07:18] <vik> nothlit: does that require a new kernel?
[07:18] <echosystm> i know that part
[07:18] <echosystm> :P
[07:18] <echosystm> where it says "it will take up Xmb when expanded" or whatever
[07:18] <echosystm> i said yes to that obviously
[07:18] <echosystm> but immediately after i entered the command
[07:18] <genii> iLLf8 - Well stuff in yer home dir to other places would work. But if you're copying stuff like belonging to users "nobody" or "www-data" for instance you could get severely screwed
[07:19] <echosystm> it says
[07:19] <nothlit> vik, no
[07:19] <echosystm> it is dependant on libfam0
[07:19] <nothlit> vik, just the fuse module
[07:19] <lemonsCC> echosystm x-window-system-core has a million things associated with it so all is good
[07:19] <Jordan_U> echosystm: Can you pastebin the output?
[07:19] <echosystm> and will leave two things at their current version
[07:19] <jerp> PWill, do you know if it is capable to use it to rip/encode and movies?
[07:19] <echosystm> how do you page-up in the command line?
[07:19] <vik> nothlit: cool; downloading now
[07:19] <lemonsCC> !pastebin |echosystm
[07:19] <echosystm> i'll get the exact wording
[07:19] <ubotu> echosystm: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:19] <lemonsCC> up arrow
[07:19] <darkangel_> please I have problems with my AC97 Audio Controller
[07:19] <iLLf8d> genii, yeah as in it depends what you're copying =P
[07:19] <echosystm> im on a separate computer guys :P
[07:19] <Jordan_U> echosystm: Ohh, forgot, not in X :)
[07:20] <PWill> jerp: Yes, it can rip/encode from streams and local files
[07:20] <arrenlex> jerp: mencoder is a command line tool which can rip and encode movies.
[07:20] <PWill> jerp: I don't believe that it can rip DVD's though
[07:20] <Willa> Jordan_U, So I fllowed all that
[07:20] <jerp> arrenlex, I'm not good with commandlines
[07:20] <lemonsCC> echosystm  i recoomend waiting til its done and trying startx and see if it worked
[07:20] <echosystm> up arrow doesnt go very far haha
[07:20] <arrenlex> PWill, jerp: MPlayer\MEncoder can. :)
[07:20] <echosystm> just gets to the top of the screen and stops
[07:20] <echosystm> ok
[07:20] <Jordan_U> echosystm: I don't know that there is a way :(
[07:20] <echosystm> no worries
[07:20] <lemonsCC> echosystm no need to troubleshoot non-existant problems
[07:20] <echosystm> its at 97% already
[07:21] <lemonsCC> =P
[07:21] <Willa> Jordan_U: And when I try to enable the glx fonfig, it says " ERROR: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel
[07:21] <jerp> arrenlex, have you used that acidrip frontend for mencoder?
[07:21] <darkangel_> genii? I found which was my audio controller
[07:21] <darkangel_> AC97 Audio Controller
[07:21] <arrenlex> Willa: apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[07:21] <arrenlex> jerp: No, I like command lines.
[07:21] <Willa> i did that under synaptic :\
[07:21] <Willa> do it again?
[07:22] <jerp> arrenlex, how tough are commandlines with mencoder?
[07:22] <nothlit> sudo aptitude reinstall nvidia-glx
[07:22] <arrenlex> Willa: Do it in the command line, please, so you can see what happens.
[07:22] <nothlit> jerp, man mencoder
[07:22] <arrenlex> jerp: Tough enough so that you can't do anything too new without googling :)
[07:22] <genii> dark - Yes but as I was saying, AC97 is not a manufacturer or chipset. It is like saying you have a vga monitor. That doesn't tell you who makes it or what chipset it needs to have recognized
[07:22] <vik> what's a 'nice' way to let arbitrary users mount things (like sshfs, smbfs) in directories they have permissions to?
[07:23] <nothlit> !info pmount | vik
[07:23] <arrenlex> vik: put users in the entry for that device in the fstab.
[07:23] <ubotu> pmount: mount removable devices as normal user. In component main, is optional. Version 0.9.13-1build1 (edgy), package size 39 kB, installed size 588 kB
[07:23] <jerp> thanks lemonCC
[07:23] <lemonsCC> lol
[07:23] <Willa> arrenlex: says could not find package :?
[07:24] <Willa> sorry there was a  -r
[07:24] <Willa> It says they are already the newest version
[07:24] <Willa> :\
[07:24] <arrenlex> Willa: the command is exactly:  sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
=== ttyfscker_ is now known as ttyfscker
[07:24] <arrenlex> Willa: Do not change anything.
[07:24] <genii> vik - use a jail
[07:24] <Willa> It says they are already the newest version
[07:24] <jerp> thanks for the help
[07:24] <arrenlex> Willa: Thats diferent.
[07:24] <Willa> should I install non free 386 moduels?
[07:25] <echosystm> linux always freaks me out becuase i get all these random lines saying "missing" :P
[07:25] <arrenlex> vik: sorry, that's "user" in the options, not user.
[07:25] <echosystm> just thought i'd throw that out there
[07:25] <echosystm> for laughs
[07:25] <lemonsCC> echosystm done installing yet?
[07:25] <arrenlex> Willa: that package IS non-free modules.
[07:25] <echosystm> almost man
[07:25] <echosystm> ok
[07:25] <echosystm> just finished
[07:25] <lemonsCC> type startX
[07:25] <arrenlex> Willa: you've tried following the guide in !nvidia?
[07:25] <vik> nothlit: how do I use that with sshfs? I'm already a member of plugdev; how to let sshfs know to use pmount?
=== Kimahri is now known as Rikku
[07:25] <Willa> yes
[07:26] <Willa> I've tried that thing for the past 2 days
[07:26] <Willa> I'm telling you what it says
[07:26] <arrenlex> Willa: I don't know... sorry.. = /
[07:26] <echosystm> i need to run the x config thing first though right?
[07:26] <nothlit> vik, theres a good article about fstab and pmount on the forums
[07:26] <Catshrimp> Okay, I've edited userChome.css and placed it within /etc/firefox/profiles/chrome, but firefox doesn't seem to recognize the changes
[07:26] <lemonsCC> maybe not try it
[07:26] <vik> nothlit: cool; thanks
[07:27] <Jordan_U> Willa: Is this a fresh install?
[07:27] <Willa> no
[07:28] <Willa> so I reinstalled nvidia-glx
[07:28] <jeff_> hi, Im running 6.06 LTS, was notified I had updates available via notification in  tool bar(?), I clikced ok to install and now gdm/Xorg server is all screwy, any ideas?
[07:28] <Willa> when i go to nvidia-glx-config enable, I get 'Error: unable to load nividia kernel driver'
[07:28] <Willa> if I install nvidia-settings will that wipe out glx
[07:28] <Willa> then I can reinstall it?
[07:28] <lemonsCC> jeff_ in terminal type dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and answer the questions
[07:29] <jeff_> lemonsCC, I tried that already, still the same problem
[07:29] <lemonsCC> what is "screwy"
[07:29] <jeff_> lemonsCC, no widojnw manger borders, text missing untill I move mouse over it
[07:29] <Jordan_U> Willa: So basically the version of kernel you are running does not match the nvidia driver version you have, at least that is what that error usually means, if the other card still works though then that cannot be true.
[07:30] <MrKeuner> hi, why do I see Dec  9 01:24:31 hostname firefox-bin: gethostby*.getanswer: asked for "www.geocities.com.nyud.net IN AAAA", got type "39" in /var/log/auth.log files?
[07:30] <echosystm> ok gnome is up
[07:30] <echosystm> seems to be fine
[07:30] <jeff_> lemonsCC, gdm wont start
[07:30] <encompass> howdy all... I have the savage driver running in edgy and the logs seems to say that DRI is disabled.  Can I enable that?
[07:30] <Willa> the other card works fine
[07:30] <Willa> I get the nvidia splash screen
[07:30] <carlfk_la1> how do I keep gdm from starting ?
[07:30] <Willa> should I set it back to nvidia instead of vesa now?
[07:31] <jeff_> lemonsCC, I run an Ti4200, nvidia was working for long time before the update
=== manuleviking is now known as manuleviking_
[07:31] <lemonsCC> jeff_ sounds like you picked a wrong driver
[07:31] <Jordan_U> Willa: You can try again, it probably still won't work though
[07:31] <Willa> well.
[07:31] <Willa> Is there any reason?
[07:31] <Willa> whats that command to reset everything
[07:31] <encompass> carlfk_la1: why would you want to?  you can jsut un install it
[07:31] <jeff_> some of the packages that were updated were xserver-xorg-i810 and ATI
[07:31] <|thunder> whats a good ftp client for gnome, that does not require gtk libs ?
[07:31] <jeff_> of sorts
[07:32] <Willa> so i got a splash screen.
[07:32] <Willa> eh
[07:32] <Willa> the nvidia screen.
[07:32] <Jordan_U> Willa: :)
[07:32] <encompass> |thunder: why  if you have gnome I think you would want the libs too
[07:32] <Willa> but everything is still scrolling  it seems
[07:32] <jeff_> lemonsCC, can one roll back the screw up?
[07:32] <|thunder> is gtk not for kde ?
[07:32] <Willa> like when I close a window
[07:32] <echosystm> when i exit gnome i get these errors
[07:32] <inuyasharenegade> wtf is with all these notices
[07:32] <encompass> gnome is built on gtk
[07:32] <lemonsCC> jeff_ good question you should be able to
[07:32] <echosystm> "error opening /dev/wacom : success"
[07:32] <|thunder> ohh
[07:32] <echosystm> wtf?
[07:32] <|thunder> dert
[07:33] <encompass> np gftp is nice
[07:33] <jeff_> lemonsCC, do you know how? should I be usign the nv or nvidia driver?
[07:33] <Jordan_U> Willa: Still scrolling like when you close a window? I don't understand.
[07:33] <iLLf8d> lol
[07:33] <echosystm> "could not init font path element /usr/share/fonts/x11/ttf/, removing from list!"
[07:33] <Willa> Jordan_U: like the videocard is so slow
[07:33] <iLLf8d> it was a very successful error apparently
[07:33] <Willa> it is animating the closing of a window
[07:33] <echosystm> jeff_ get the linux driver off the actual nvidia website
[07:33] <lemonsCC> jeff_ what did you pick on the list what you ran dpkg-......-xorg
[07:33] <Willa> like when your computer lags
[07:33] <|thunder> thanks encompass
[07:33] <encompass> yup
[07:34] <Jordan_U> Willa: Did you choose "nv" by accident?
[07:34] <echosystm> and run "sh whatever.run"
[07:34] <Willa> no
[07:34] <Willa> Jordan_U:  no :\
[07:34] <Willa> nv wouldn't bring up an nvidia splash screen would it?
[07:34] <echosystm> you'll get an error saying it needs to dl some crap
[07:34] <encompass> what does mode 666 mean in the dri section fo the Xorg?
[07:34] <echosystm> keep going through that
[07:34] <encompass> can some onw with working dri tell me what number they have?
[07:34] <mista> so whts a good ssh program??
[07:34] <echosystm> and it will do it all itself
[07:34] <jeff_> no, I just did the upgade from the notification sceen and it had some stuff about xorg ati and i810 stuff
[07:34] <Jordan_U> Willa: No, it wouldn't, you'r right
[07:34] <jeff_> which I dont have
[07:34] <Willa> so i restarted, now the nvidia splash is gone.
[07:34] <lemonsCC> 666 means read and write access for everyone.
[07:34] <jeff_> or use
[07:35] <Willa> maybe its just this videocard.
[07:35] <MrKeuner> did anybody install ubuntu dapper or edgy on intel core 1 duo or core 2 duo? I get kernel panic on core 1 duo with both dapper and edgy
[07:35] <encompass> taht is what I figured... but why in the dri section of the xorg?
[07:35] <encompass> MrKeuner:  I did
[07:35] <echosystm> lemonsCC
[07:35] <Jordan_U> Willa: Does it work in windows?
[07:35] <snype> so you back yet?
[07:35] <lemonsCC> not sure
[07:35] <Willa> yea
[07:35] <encompass> MrKeuner: I had to do a bios upgrade
[07:35] <Willa> works fine
[07:36] <echosystm> any idea what these font errors are?
[07:36] <Willa> I think im gunna have to just install windows on this machine.
[07:36] <MrKeuner> encompass: and you did not get kernel panic? or did a workaround?
[07:36] <encompass> MrKeuner: then it worked
[07:36] <Willa> Its taken me 3 days to get this far.
[07:36] <MrKeuner> hmm, what was the problem with the BIOS?
[07:36] <encompass> MrKeuner: try a bios update
[07:36] <Jordan_U> Willa: :(
[07:36] <snype> can anyone help me get my radeon to use dri
[07:36] <encompass> something to do with the seporate northbridge or something like that
[07:36] <kapilg_it> does somebody know about configuring azureus to work behind proxy (not-transparent)
[07:36] <lemonsCC> what font error was that echosystm
[07:36] <snype> i'm making some head way-- but i have an issue. when I try to run glxinfo it crashes x
[07:36] <Willa> im about to pull this videocard out of this machine
[07:37] <Willa> its another 6800gt 128mb
[07:37] <Willa> wonder if it will work fine.
[07:37] <Willa> It should right?
[07:37] <echosystm> "could not init font path element /usr/share/fonts/x11/ttf/, removing from list!"
[07:37] <mdious> Willa:  keep going with it, whatever it is persist...it will be worth it...
[07:37] <Willa> how can I delete nvidia-glx?
[07:37] <MrKeuner> did anybody install ubuntu dapper or edgy on intel core 1 duo or core 2 duo? without any kernel panic?
[07:37] <Willa> and reinstall it
[07:37] <echosystm> i get that when i logout of gnome and return to command line
[07:37] <lemonsCC> what were you trying to do?
[07:37] <mista> whats a good ssh client?
[07:37] <encompass> echosystm: that is ok
[07:37] <echosystm> what does it mean?
[07:37] <holycow> is anyone using aiglx here with metacity instead of beryl?
[07:38] <encompass> what does it say?
[07:38] <echosystm> also
[07:38] <lemonsCC> it couldnt find the font so its ignoring it
[07:38] <sindrum> any ideas on installing flash player 7... i did everything instarucions told me to do and is not working?
[07:38] <kapilg_it> how do i download torrents ?? in windows i do it by running bitcomet and proxifier together??
[07:38] <echosystm> "error opening device /dev/wacom"

[07:38] <mista> um for ubuntu
[07:38] <gouki> mista: ssh ?
[07:38] <mdious> mista:  i always liked openssh heh...
[07:38] <Jordan_U> Willa: Try posing on Ubuntuforums, and if you can't get it to work in Edgy the next release of Ubuntu will have Proprietary drivers built in so they should be better supported.
[07:38] <mista> yea you know something like putty for windows
[07:38] <echosystm> so whats this wacom business?
[07:38] <lemonsCC> you have a wacom connected?
[07:39] <echosystm> nope
[07:39] <echosystm> lol
[07:39] <gouki> mista: Why not the standard, OpenSSH?
[07:39] <lemonsCC> lol
[07:39] <lemonsCC> what is connected to your machine?
[07:39] <echosystm> a keyboard, mouse, monitor
[07:39] <echosystm> :P
[07:39] <mista> so whte the name to install it
[07:39] <Jordan_U> Willa: sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx --purge
[07:39] <gouki> mista: It's already part of your system. Usage: ssh user@host
[07:40] <milo> hi.. does somebody knows a command that tells me how many files i have in a directory??
[07:40] <encompass> echosystm: for wacom tablet
[07:40] <gouki> milo: ls -la
[07:40] <echosystm> i dont have a wacom tablet though
[07:40] <encompass> if youhave one you wouldn't get the error
[07:40] <encompass> warning actualy
[07:40] <echosystm> right...
[07:40] <kapilg_it> milo: ls -la |wc -l
[07:40] <echosystm> so
[07:40] <echosystm> seeing as i dont have a wacom
[07:40] <echosystm> why is that even there? :P
[07:40] <lemonsCC> echosystem in terminal type sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:40] <ajopaul_> how to install entrance display manager on edgy?
[07:40] <encompass> echosystm: don't worry about that stuff it is just fine
[07:40] <lemonsCC> or not
[07:41] <kapilg_it> how do i download torrents ?? in windows i do it by running bitcomet and proxifier together??
[07:41] <encompass> windows has all these same things... they just don't let you look at it
[07:41] <echosystm> rightyo
[07:41] <echosystm> cool
[07:41] <echosystm> :)
[07:41] <milo> nice.. thanks
[07:41] <echosystm> while ive got you here encompass
[07:41] <lemonsCC> they just BSOD....lol
[07:41] <echosystm> i need to ask quickly
[07:41] <encompass> ok
[07:41] <echosystm> when i was using aptitude to get x and gnome
[07:41] <encompass> hurry I want to give my wife breakfast
[07:41] <echosystm> i got this dependencies message
[07:41] <echosystm> said it needed libfam0
[07:41] <Jordan_U> kapilg_it: Double click the .torrent file, bittorrentis installed by default :)
[07:42] <echosystm> and then said two other packages would remain at the current version
[07:42] <IdleOne> kapilg_it:  sudo apt-get install azureus
[07:42] <echosystm> i had no choice but to say yes
[07:42] <kapilg_it> jordan_U: but it doen't work behind proxy ??
[07:42] <echosystm> saying no would give me some scary error level -143 thing
[07:42] <echosystm> any idea what that was all about?
[07:43] <encompass> echosystm: haven't a clue on that one, but if you want gnome and X jsut do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[07:43] <kapilg_it> jordan_U :tried azureus but it demands an open port
[07:43] <echosystm> yeah but
[07:43] <echosystm> i dont want all the applications that come with it
[07:43] <echosystm> there are too many! :P
[07:43] <lemonsCC> encompass he wanted a minimal install
[07:43] <encompass> echosystm: I understand... easy for beginners to just remove them later :)
[07:43] <Jordan_U> kapilg_it: Proxy or NAT ( router ) ?
[07:44] <encompass> xubuntu is rather nice it is what I use
[07:44] <encompass> that is pretty minimal
[07:44] <kapilg_it> NAT
[07:44] <lemonsCC> echosystem you could always sudo apt-get install <that lib package>
[07:44] <encompass> anyway,, I have to go
[07:44] <encompass> sorry
[07:44] <genii> anyone know how to ssh into a system netbooting?
[07:44] <echosystm> ok
[07:44] <lemonsCC> fluxbox is my minimal WM of choice
[07:44] <echosystm> lets see what that does :P
[07:44] <Jordan_U> kapilg_it: All bittorent clients ( including those in windows ) run faster with open ports, none require it though ( azureus will work without it just slower )
[07:44] <lemonsCC> can't hurt
[07:44] <kapilg_it> actually both proxy and NAT are running on same machine
[07:45] <c0> ndfjnkjkmor

[07:47] <snype> yeah i'm in the "about to smash my masterpiece cause i wanna build another one" stage
[07:47] <lemonsCC> lol
[07:47] <echosystm> hahaha
[07:47] <pradeep> !ask | BADWITASH
[07:47] <ubotu> BADWITASH: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:47] <echosystm> i tried to install gentoo once
[07:47] <lemonsCC> you should always be at that stage
[07:48] <snype> im actually dead serious though.
[07:48] <echosystm> on a promise tx2000
[07:48] <echosystm> striped raid
[07:48] <echosystm> i think thats about the epitome of frustration
[07:48] <snype> luckily i have a second one that i'm on right now
[07:48] <BADWITASH> i got a ps3 and i need to know how to install it and if i do would i be able to use it cause im not great with computers
[07:48] <snype> so i can fuck one up
[07:49] <BADWITASH> ive never used this os before
[07:49] <lemonsCC> BADWAITASH that is very new territory, may not be much knowledge out there yet
[07:49] <Jordan_U> BADWITASH: I don't know if Ubuntu works on ps3, I bleive yellow dog linux does though
[07:50] <sindrum> ahh ic im able to get flash player 9  update. How does this work?
[07:50] <BADWITASH> ok heres the thing im not sure if i could use linux, is there a linux version that is friendly for to non programers
[07:51] <gouki> Jordan_U: From what I've heard, the OS on PS3 is an altered version of YDL. Using OtherOS (bootloader) you can install FC5, for example. As for Ubuntu, I don't know
[07:51] <lemonsCC> tons of them are friendly
[07:51] <belfegorash> hello all
[07:52] <gouki> Jordan_U: From what I've heard, the OS on PS3 is an altered version of YDL. Using OtherOS (bootloader) you can install FC5, for example. As for Ubuntu, I don't know
[07:52] <BADWITASH> i heard it on a thread so i think one guy has already but i need to know if i load it am i going to be able to use it
[07:52] <gouki> Well, I'm off! 'night all!
[07:52] <lemonsCC> kernel patches to use ps3 have been release?
[07:52] <BADWITASH> with no real expertise
[07:52] <lemonsCC> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=298256
[07:52] <gouki> BADWITASH: If you want to try GNU/Linux, a PS3 is not the most appropriate place to do it
[07:53] <eneried> hello hello
[07:53] <BADWITASH> i know
[07:53] <gouki> 'night all!
[07:53] <eneried> i have a little question...
[07:53] <lemonsCC> !ask | eneried
[07:53] <ubotu> eneried: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:53] <eneried> there's something faster than the gnome system monitor?
[07:53] <lemonsCC> faster how?

[07:54] <lemonsCC> top is hideous, but it works
[07:54] <BADWITASH> nice thanx for the link
[07:54] <tictacaddict> q
[07:54] <eneried> i'm using it, but it showed me information about processes, but every 3 seconds, so i cannot true determine which proceses are spending my processor
[07:54] <lemonsCC>  np BADWITASH
[07:54] <lemonsCC> can't you change the frequency
[07:54] <eneried> top? what is top?
[07:55] <lemonsCC> open terminal and type top
[07:55] <lemonsCC> you will see
[07:55] <eneried> let me see
[07:55] <gansinho> hello guys, I would really appreciate I someone could help me finding a app that works with ffmpeg or not but convert movies and have GUI, thanks!
[07:55] <eneried> ;)

[07:55] <lemonsCC> !ask | sikumkum
[07:55] <ubotu> sikumkum: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:55] <BADWITASH> so how easy to use is this os

[07:55] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:56] <sikumkum> sorry
[07:56] <lemonsCC> lol no prob
[07:56] <gansinho> sikumkum, just ask it =p
[07:56] <Geoffrey2> I am getting the distinct impression that Flash and Linux just don't play well together......
[07:56] <gansinho> GenNMX, try the new beta... works pretty well
[07:56] <gansinho> (beta 2 I think)
[07:56] <gansinho> Geoffrey2, ^^
[07:57] <noodles12> is putty good to use for xp for ssh from ubuntu to xp?
[07:57] <lemonsCC> BADWITASH go here > http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#lts < and download a LiveCD and try it out
[07:57] <eneried> top is good, but i can't intereact with it to kill or change priority of processes qith ease, another alternatve? i can use top, but when my system become very slow i cannot belive using top and command line will work as fast as i need...
[07:57] <Pie-rate> How do I set up a mail server?
[07:57] <sikumkum> ok, i've installed my box with specific partition (eg; /, /boot, /home, /var, /swap, /tmp); i've read some nice article about implementing "quota". but i figured that the article was only for 1 partition only ( / ), when its told what we have to do with /etc/fstab
[07:57] <lemonsCC> you can kill apps in top
[07:57] <Geoffrey2> gansinho, I've tried the Flash 9 beta, totally unusable
[07:58] <Jordan_U> !kill | eneried
[07:58] <ubotu> eneried: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[07:58] <gansinho> Geoffrey2, beta1 was poor beta 2 is really better the sound issue is fixed
[07:58] <lemonsCC> http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?top+1
[07:58] <belfegorash> i have a question...when i install ubuntu how i make 2 partition like in windows?
[07:58] <eneried> ok, i know how powerfull is the terminal, but what i mean is
[07:58] <Jordan_U> eneried: You can use the kill and killall commands to quickly end a process
[07:58] <sikumkum> how to set the /etc/fstab with quota ? while i got 4-5 partition
[07:58] <sikumkum> is it /home ?
[07:59] <eneried> if i have to search a process and then type to change its priority base, when i cannot kill it or when i don't need to kill it is hjard to do
[07:59] <gansinho> belfegorash, you have windows already installed?
[07:59] <eneried> but ok
[07:59] <noodles12> !ssh
[07:59] <ubotu> SSH is the Secure SHell protocol. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto for usage. Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows; it can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[07:59] <belfegorash> no just ubntu
[07:59] <Geoffrey2> gansinho, I tried beta 2...one again, totally unusable....any attempt to load up anything flash related generally results in Firefox coming to a complete standstill
[07:59] <belfegorash> ubuntu*
[07:59] <eneried> now i know gnome system monitor (very slow), and top... any other alternative? prefferable a graphic alternative?
[07:59] <gansinho> Geoffrey2, here works pretty well, youtube and even banners
[08:00] <sikumkum> which partition i should re-configure for quota-ready on /etc/fstab ?
[08:00] <gansinho> belfegorash, I think the easy way is to install windows first... =/
[08:00] <sikumkum> anyone? please
[08:01] <Geoffrey2> gansinho, I don't know, maybe it's something hardware related over here....but the only way I can go to youtube or myspace over here is to boot in Windows XP...any attempt at all using Flash in Linux causes total lockups
[08:01] <belfegorash> gansinho: to have 2 os on pc?
[08:01] <gansinho> belfegorash, there must be a easy way, but basically you need to create a new partition to install windows, install it there (don't ask me how) and set up grub
[08:02] <Jordan_U> eneried: I have never tried it but xfce4-taskmanager is probably light weight and should also work in gnome
[08:02] <carlfk_la1> how can I stop gdm from starting on boot?
[08:02] <lemonsCC> !dual boot
[08:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dual boot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:02] <belfegorash> gansinho:i dont want to install windows anymore on my pc,i want to partitions on ubuntu
[08:02] <gansinho> Geoffrey2, the sound ends keeps in a loop? like a a a a a a a ?
[08:02] <carlfk_la1> but still be able to start it manualy
[08:02] <eneried> thanks Jordan_U
[08:02] <gansinho> belfegorash, Oh now i understand, sorry
[08:03] <gansinho> you want to "merge" the partitions?
[08:03] <Jordan_U> belfegorash: Boot the Ubuntu liveCD and use gparted: System -> dministration -> gnome partition editor
[08:03] <eneried> thanks lemonsCC too for the help ;)
[08:03] <lemonsCC> belfegorash you name is so long  pop in the liveCD....open gparted....resize your ubuntu partition and make the unused space ext3
[08:03] <Geoffrey2> gansinho, for the most part, I can't even get the stuff to load in the first place....I go to a page with Flash content, and the browser basically dies...nothing loads up at all
[08:04] <lemonsCC> eneried sorry i only know of top and gnome's default
[08:04] <carlfk_la1> Geoffrey2: it is a new xorg setting - search the .. everywhere ubuntu :)
[08:04] <belfegorash> when i install ubuntu i had like this:1 partition primary...1 logical...and 1 logical:D
[08:04] <Jordan_U> lemonsCC: Tab completion is nice for long nicks :)
[08:04] <belfegorash> i should make 2 primary?
[08:04] <lemonsCC> im using x-chat aqua (mac)
[08:05] <lemonsCC> not sure if it has that feature
[08:05] <eneried> but top is ok for me in some situations :) i remembered that i can use the virtuakl ttys, then for kill is ok, and when i need to change priority i'll use other :)
[08:05] <lemonsCC> got it!!!
[08:05] <lemonsCC> Jordan_U, ha thats nice
[08:05] <belfegorash> so this is the solution?.2 primary partition?
[08:06] <Geoffrey2> carlfk_la1, a new xorg setting, ok....search for what?
[08:06] <Jordan_U> belfegorash: Yes
[08:06] <belfegorash> ok thank you
[08:06] <carlfk_la1> Geoffrey2: flash, firefox, xorg.. search launchpad maybe
[08:08] <Phuzion> Anyone here run their own DNS with BIND9?
[08:08] <Geoffrey2> carlfk_la1, launchpad.net?
[08:08] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: In the mean time the flashblock will keep firefox from crashing on every page with ads
[08:09] <Pie-rate> is there any way to simply and easily set up something that will accept incoming mail?
[08:10] <econobeing> what's with black themes....they never work right
[08:11] <TheRatKing> yo
[08:11] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: * the flashblock firefox extention I meant to say :)
[08:11] <TheRatKing> where can I find gpg keys to add to my keyring so my apt mirror works?
[08:12] <Jordan_U> TheRatKing: Usually on the same site you got the repo name from or even the same domain as the repo.
[08:12] <Phuzion> Pie-rate:  Are you looking to run your own in-house mail server?
[08:13] <TheRatKing> any particular file it's stored in?
[08:13] <TheRatKing> thanks
[08:13] <MrKeuner> did anybody install ubuntu dapper or edgy on intel core 1 duo or core 2 duo? without any kernel panic?
[08:13] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: Yes
[08:13] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: Core 1 duo
[08:14] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: needed an extra kernel parameter though, let me find it for you ...
[08:14] <MrKeuner> Jordan_U: waiting thank you
[08:15] <echosystm> hmmm
[08:15] <echosystm> wheres the thing to adjust colour depth?
[08:15] <echosystm> :(
=== Rikku is now known as Tidus
[08:16] <eneried> thanks 4 all, i have to go to leave some rsources free
[08:16] <eneried> take care :)
[08:16] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: lpj=8000000 but that may be specific to the macbook pro so if it still doesn't work with that try noapci
[08:17] <econobeing> man, ktorrent sucks hard
[08:17] <arrenlex> econobeing: why so?
[08:18] <econobeing> i don't know what's with it, i'm using the same ports as azureus, but i can't get above 1k down, in azureus i've gotten a steady 35k down on the same torrent
[08:18] <arrenlex> econobeing: I've had over 100k using ktorrent.
[08:19] <Jordan_U> MrKeuner: I am urious to know if this is an intel mac specific problem or just core duo specific so if you don't mind could you come back and tell me if it worked when you are done?
[08:19] <Jordan_U> *curious
[08:19] <econobeing> i saw over 100k in ktorrent before i reformatted
[08:20] <MrKeuner> Jordan_U: i do not have the machine with me, it's a friend's but I will as soon as I learn
[08:20] <econobeing> i did everything i could think of to get it going fast, nothings working
[08:20] <MrKeuner> but his machine is not macbook
[08:20] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, that's all well and good, but when I'm trying to go to a page that has flash content, and everything freezes...I can't even get Windows Flash/Crossover to work properly with my linux browser...this is truly frustrating
[08:21] <echosystm> anyone want to help me install nvidia drivers? :P
[08:21] <Himura> echosystm, what's the problem ?
[08:21] <echosystm> well
[08:21] <echosystm> i downloaded the package
[08:21] <echosystm> did sh filename.run
[08:21] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: Windows Flash/Crossover ?
[08:22] <echosystm> and it went into the installer
[08:22] <Himura> echosystm, why don't you use the ubuntu package ?
[08:22] <echosystm> and then said it cant get something for my kernel?!
[08:22] <echosystm> does the ubuntu package have the control panel?
[08:22] <Himura> yep
[08:22] <echosystm> ok well
[08:22] <echosystm> when i tried to install the ubuntu package earlier
[08:22] <echosystm> it said
[08:22] <echosystm> the driver and kernel had a missmatch
[08:23] <behdad> Hi everybody , i have Xserver problem with edgy i dont know what is the problem it dosnt start in my labtop , anybody faced the same problem ?
[08:23] <echosystm> or some total bs like that!
[08:23] <Himura> hum
[08:23] <_goofy_> im having trouble streaming off a usb hdd anyone have a clue....it wont let me set read premissions for group or "other"
[08:23] <sikumkum> does quota has to be writen on "/" only?, i've create /home before
[08:23] <Himura> echosystm, maybe you have to update your kernel
[08:23] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, installing Codeweavers Crossover, and then using that to install the Windows version of Flash 9, at which point you're supposed to be able to use that version with your linux browser....sounds great, but I can't even get THAT to work
[08:24] <echosystm> ok
[08:24] <echosystm> how do i do that? haha
[08:24] <echosystm> im assuming thats more complicated than apt-get upgrade :P
[08:24] <econobeing> i am under the impression ktorrent doesn't like me looking at it
[08:24] <Himura> behdad, did you see the logs ?
[08:24] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: You don't need crossover, regular wine works fine for that.
[08:24] <echosystm> oh sorry
[08:24] <echosystm> i think
[08:24] <echosystm> it meant there was a missmatch between
[08:24] <echosystm> nvidia-kernel-core
[08:24] <echosystm> and nvidia-glx
[08:24] <echosystm> possible?
[08:25] <Himura> maybe
[08:25] <_goofy_> im having trouble streaming off a usb hdd anyone have a clue
[08:25] <econobeing> every time i focus on the window i see my torrent at around 5 or 8 k, then it drops back down to 0. go do something else, come back it's around 5-8k, drops down to 0 again...
[08:25] <econobeing> bleh...maybe i should just use azureus, but from my previous install, ktorrent > azureus
[08:25] <behdad> Himura , its about a month ago and no i didnt , the thing is me and other 4 of my friends we all have this problem with edgy , what should i look for in logs ?
[08:26] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, really?  I was under the impression that if you installed wine, you'd need to install the Windows version of Firefox along with the Windows version of Flash, that wine wouldn't support using Windows flash on the linux version of a browser
[08:26] <Himura> behdad, grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[08:26] <_goofy_> econobeing: i use utorrent emulated with wine and i get great dl speads.....its a little glitchy but it works for me
[08:27] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: that is incorrect; you can hackishly embed an instance of the chrome of the windows firefox into your linux browser.
[08:27] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: sudo apt-get install wine then download the windows installer for firefox, double click the installer and run it as normall, then open firefox and go to a page that requires flash and let firefox install the plugin for you, ahh I just read your other comment, I didn't know that that was possible.
[08:27] <arrenlex> Geoffrey2: As for how well it works... not well.
[08:27] <Himura> echosystm, I cannot find "nvidia-kernel-core"
[08:27] <Pie-rate> phuzion: basically, i have an ubuntu box (jon.pmtech.com) and i want to be able to send mail to/from jschall@jon.pmtech.com
[08:28] <_goofy_> im having trouble streaming video off a usb hdd anyone have a clue
[08:28] <econobeing> _goofy_: how hard was it to get that working?
[08:28] <econobeing> because utorrent is my favorite
[08:28] <echosystm> sorry
[08:28] <echosystm> nvidia-kernel-common
[08:28] <echosystm> sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common
[08:28] <echosystm> sudo nvidia-xconfig
[08:28] <behdad> Himura , ok , did they rewrite Xserver for edgy version ?
[08:28] <echosystm> apparently
[08:28] <echosystm> that is all you need
[08:29] <sikumkum> why no one asnwer my question :(
[08:29] <echosystm> but i tried that on ubuntu desktop and it died
[08:29] <Himura> behdad, I don't know
[08:30] <_goofy_> its just like any wine install...the only problem is when you minimize the window you will get a blank screen when you go back ang you have to right click on the task bar icon and seclect hide/show utorrent
[08:30] <behdad> Himura , ok , so with that command that u just told me i should track the problem , isnt it ?
[08:31] <_goofy_> anyone have any trouble streaming .avs files with a usb hdd
[08:31] <Himura> behdad, yep: sudo grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[08:31] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: Could you start Ubuntu from the terminal ( so you can see what is outputs to stout ) and go to a flash site to mabie get a better idea as to what is causing the crash?
[08:31] <Geoffrey2> sigh....days like this make me wonder if I was better off staying with XP......
[08:31] <behdad> Himura , god bless you ;)
[08:31] <Himura> :p
[08:32] <arrenlex> Jordan_U: You mean, start FIREFOX from the terminal? XD
[08:32] <TheRatKing> don't go back to XP!
[08:32] <Himura> Jordan_U, you can use strace if you want :p
[08:32] <Jordan_U> arrenlex: Yeah, that was an interesting typo indeed :)
[08:32] <_goofy_> geroffrey....im just a nosy basterd and havent been paying any attenchin to the convio but what is the grep command do
[08:33] <arrenlex> _goofy_: It only prints the lines that match the string you give it.
[08:33] <feross> anyone doing 802.1x WPA2/EAP authentication with ubuntu?
[08:33] <_goofy_> ok...still kinda nobb
[08:33] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, lesse, I guess I should go back to the Beta 2 version of Flash for this?
[08:33] <_goofy_> but im gittin there
[08:34] <arrenlex> _goofy_: i.e. say you have a file that consists of three lines: "hello", "goodbye" and "go away". If you grep "hello" this file, the output is hello. if you grep "g" this file, the output is "goodbye" and "go away". Understand?
[08:34] <Jordan_U> sikumkum: It may be that simply nobody knows the answer, but try rewording your question as people might have just not understood.
[08:35] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: Sure.
[08:35] <echosystm> has anyone here experience with nvidia drivers?
[08:35] <_goofy_> yeah... i was just saying i didnt know what the command did... i got it after that...but thanks

[08:45] <econobeing> Jordan_U: ktorrent was giving me d/l problems :/ the same torrent ran at .5k in ktorrent, and 25k in utorrent <_> same ports too
[08:45] <Bearcat> in other words, i have installed the 64-bit version. can i run 32-bit binaries on it?
[08:46] <Jordan_U> echosystm: sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
[08:46] <echosystm> cool
[08:46] <echosystm> thanks man!
[08:46] <echosystm> :D
[08:46] <Jordan_U> Bearcat: Only in a 32 bit chroot
[08:46] <echosystm> you guys are going to hate me by the end of this week :P
[08:46] <echosystm> if not already
[08:46] <Bearcat> Jordan_U: darn. How do other distros do it?
[08:46] <echosystm> haha
[08:47] <Bearcat> echosystm: i've only known you for 1 minute and 30 seconds and i can't stand you already :P
[08:47] <echosystm> haha
[08:47] <echosystm> <3
[08:47] <Bearcat> lol
[08:47] <Jordan_U> echosystm: People probably hated me when I started ( I was in the forums daily with new questions ) :)
[08:48] <echosystm> that command
[08:48] <echosystm> removed nvidia-glx
[08:48] <echosystm> isnt that bad?
[08:48] <echosystm> "{
[08:48] <echosystm> :P
[08:48] <Jordan_U> Bearcat: I don't know
[08:48] <dthomas> Bearcat: fedora has the 64-bit libs in stuff like /usr/lib64, 32-bit in /usr/lib, for example.
[08:48] <dthomas> Bearcat: i believe that's what is meant by "multilib."
[08:49] <Bearcat> dthomas: gotcha.
[08:49] <echosystm> x wont start now
[08:49] <echosystm> :(
[08:50] <Bearcat> dthomas: my main box is sourcemage. I'm tempted to set up this laptop 32-bit just so i can have flash. I havent' had flash in 2 years :(
[08:50] <Jordan_U> echosystm: install nvidia-glx again
[08:50] <arrenlex> Bearcat: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1799553
[08:50] <dthomas> Bearcat: it's unfortunate that flash is so pervasive that i feel sad for you.
[08:50] <dthomas> Bearcat: i ran 64-bit for maybe a month tops before deciding that it was completely not worth it for a desktop.
[08:51] <arrenlex> Bearcat: more directly: http://gwenole.beauchesne.info/en/projects/nspluginwrapper
[08:51] <Bearcat> arrenlex: thank you
[08:52] <arrenlex> Bearcat: I've heard it's not very stable, but it should at least work...
[08:52] <dthomas> crossover office (which includes the crossover plugin) is also supposed to run windows 32-bit flash in a 64-bit browser, but i never got that working.
[08:52] <Jordan_U> echosystm: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
=== [JAPS] nuG[z]  is now known as nugz
[08:52] <Bearcat> dthomas: well, i'm doing some programming and i wanted to experiment
[08:53] <Bearcat> arrenlex:  i'll play with that. Thanks again
[08:53] <_goofy_> in looking to do a clean install with just the basic utilities to run ubuntu smothly....will the alternate intall package do the trick
[08:53] <echosystm> Jordan_U, in ubuntu desktop that panel gave me access to the colour depth of the desktop
[08:53] <echosystm> at the moment its only running 16bit
[08:53] <echosystm> do i have to edit the xconfig?
[08:55] <Bearcat> and with that, i'm off to bed
[08:55] <Bearcat> thanks folks
[08:55] <Bearcat> *scampers off*
[08:55] <arrenlex> _goofy_: Yes. It will start you off without a GUI, though. Can you take things from there?
[08:55] <Jordan_U> echosystm: In Section "Screen" of your xorg.conf there should be a list of resolutions and color depths, try changing 16 to 24
[08:56] <_goofy_> yeah...that what i wanted
[08:56] <nugz> i need help with getting mp3 to work with ubuntu
[08:56] <nugz> anyone?
[08:57] <nugz> im new to linux also
[08:57] <rastilin> nugz, Use mplayer or install the gstreamer codecs for mp3
[08:57] <nugz> where can i get that?
[08:57] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, ok, I should start firefox from the terminal, and then what should I be checking for?
[08:57] <Jordan_U> echosystm: Or just add another Display subsection like the others with a depth of 24
[08:57] <rastilin> nugz, you know there are faqs for this
[08:57] <ubuntu-cholic> <nugz> i need help with getting mp3 to work with ubuntu  >>> u need to install w32 codec or install xmms
[08:58] <rastilin> Does win32codecs provide mp3 support.
[08:58] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: I don't know, I'm just troubleshooting see if there is anything that looks relevent and/or pastebin the output
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[08:59] <rastilin> I suspect it's flurendo-mp3 that does that.
[08:59] <Jordan_U> rastilin: No, you don't need win32codecs for mp3 support
[08:59] <nugz> damn i dont know where to find this stuff
[08:59] <nugz> though
[08:59] <nugz> im brand new to linux

[08:59] <Alamar> hello
[09:00] <echosystm> its on 24bit already sorry
[09:00] <echosystm> i wanted it on 32
[09:00] <echosystm> is that not possible? :S
[09:00] <Jordan_U> echosystm: 24 and 32 are the same.
[09:01] <ubuntu-cholic> !network
[09:01] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:01] <rastilin> echosystem, there's no difference on linux you know, why on 32 bit?
[09:01] <echosystm> they are? how so?
[09:01] <rastilin> 8 bits for transparency, but that's handled elsewhere
[09:01] <echosystm> those extra bits have to go somewhere
[09:01] <echosystm> oh
[09:01] <echosystm> i see
[09:02] <ubuntu-cholic> !ping
[09:02] <ubotu> ping: network unreachable
[09:02] <Alamar> I am trying to install 6.10 but it hangs during install, is there a way to turn of the splash screen and see the error messages?
[09:03] <ubuntu-cholic> !HP deskjet
[09:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about HP deskjet - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:03] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, Segmentation fault

[09:03] <Jordan_U> Alamar: Yes, remove the "splash" kernel parameter
[09:03] <ubotu> hpijs: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - gs IJS driver (hpijs). In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.9+1.6.9-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 337 kB, installed size 712 kB
[09:03] <vorpal_> ubuntu-cholic: what's up?
[09:04] <ubuntu-cholic> my deskjet 3535 doesnt work in ubuntu
[09:04] <arrenlex> ubuntu-cholic: Install hpijs
[09:04] <arrenlex> ubuntu-cholic: and cupsys, of course.
[09:05] <ubuntu-cholic> i alredy have hpjis and cupsys
[09:05] <ubuntu-cholic> but still not work
[09:05] <MeggaMortY> hi all, i have an ATI video card and i get a black screen when booting into GNOME on the liveCD, can anyone help? PS. im noob :P
[09:05] <arrenlex> !doesn't work
[09:05] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[09:05] <echosystm> i have a usb mouse, what should the protocol be in my xorg.conf?
[09:06] <Jordan_U> ubuntu-cholic: Did you try: System -> Administration -> Printing ?
[09:06] <_goofy_> MeggaMortY: boot in to safe video mode
[09:06] <MeggaMortY> _goofy_: tried it :P
[09:06] <rastilin> Interestingly I've never seen that actually make a difference.
[09:07] <rastilin> I've had the same problem.
[09:07] <MeggaMortY> rastilin: any hints?
[09:07] <rastilin> What you need to do is change the xorg.conf driver to "vesa" and restart the x server.
[09:07] <ubuntu-cholic> <Jordan_U> ubuntu-cholic: Did you try: System -> Administration -> Printing ?  >> yes
[09:07] <MeggaMortY> rastilin: yea thats what another guy told me to do but i cant even get into text view mode...
[09:07] <rastilin> Ctrl + Alt + F2 does nothing?
[09:08] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, ok, I removed Crossover, and reinstated Flash 9 Beta 2...checked about:plugins to make sure it's there, and it is....started Firefox 2 from the command line, loaded page loaded with flash content....Firefox crashes, error message in terminal simply says 'Segmentation fault'
[09:08] <ubuntu-cholic> my problems is...when i print in black color theris nothing happen
[09:08] <MeggaMortY> rastilin: i can hit ctrl-alt-f1 when the loaidng bar is up but i can only see the command line for a second or 2 after it's loaded and it goes black
[09:08] <Jordan_U> Geoffrey2: I don't have any more ideas then :(
[09:08] <rastilin> But if you hit it after, still nothing?
[09:09] <_goofy_> anyone ever set up a server to stream video over the web
[09:09] <MeggaMortY> nah once i get to the black screen, ctrl-alt-f1 or ctrl-alt-f7 or ctrl-alt-backspace all do nothing
[09:10] <rastilin> Ok, I'd give it two possible reasons.
[09:10] <Geoffrey2> Jordan_U, ok, thanks for the effort.....
[09:10] <rastilin> 1. The drivers are so bad they're locking up the system with your card. The nv drivers can hammer bash is using a geforce 6xxxx.
[09:10] <rastilin> 2. The card is damaged or caked with dust so that any advanced operations cause it to lock. Had this happen once.
[09:10] <rastilin> *If using
[09:10] <MeggaMortY> hmm dam
[09:10] <rastilin> You will need to do a text install.
[09:10] <Jordan_U> MeggaMortY: You could try the Alternate install CD ( ncurses )
[09:10] <Geoffrey2> I guess I just keep dual booting with XP for the time being
[09:11] <MeggaMortY> Jordan_U: where can i find that?
[09:11] <genii> anyone know how to access a netboot installing box by way of ssh?
[09:11] <Jordan_U> MeggaMortY: It is under "alternate install options " on the downloads page
[09:11] <MeggaMortY> jordan_U: thanks i shall give it a go
[09:12] <luke_> Easy Question!  I have / and /home partioned seperately.  After some file corruption problems, I just reloaded /
[09:12] <Pie-rate> in terms of security, which is better: imap or pop3?
[09:12] <m0dY> if i did $rm -f /etc/* !! is there anyway to reverse back the shit after that ?
[09:12] <luke_> however, it's asking for a Username and password, but it never had me put any in during install.  I'm confused.
[09:12] <pitti> Pie-rate: none
[09:12] <pitti> Pie-rate: you want pop3s or imap/ssl :)
[09:13] <pitti> Pie-rate: and in terms of features and comfortable handling you want imap (thus: imap/ssl)
[09:13] <Pie-rate> ok, so how do i set that up?
[09:13] <rastilin> luke_, so, what's the question
[09:13] <genii> m0dy no
[09:13] <Pie-rate> !imap
[09:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about imap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:14] <genii> Pie pop3 is more secure since it doesn not use shared folders
[09:14] <luke_> rastilin: I just did a fresh installation of /.   For some reason it never prompted me to create a new username and password.  However it wants one to log in.  The old one doesn't work.  I'm completely confused.
[09:14] <Jordan_U> m0dY: AFIK It is impossible to recover deleted files from ext3, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a -phigh MIGHT get things working again though
[09:14] <vorpal_> anyone know who is resposnible for ubotu? i think it really should have something on IMAP
[09:15] <vorpal_> how do we add stuff?
[09:15] <genii> !dovecot
[09:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dovecot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:15] <tonyyarusso> !bot | vorpal_
[09:15] <ubotu> vorpal_: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[09:15] <roryy> luke_: try booting into recovery mode, and setting the password there (run 'passwd <username>', replacing <username> with your user's login name)
[09:15] <Pie-rate> ok, so how do i get a pop3s server?
[09:15] <vorpal_> :)
[09:16] <m0dY> Jordan_U, u'll find this odd but im on a fedora system so im totaly fucked up
[09:16] <genii> you can also append -s to the grub line which drops you to single user mode where you can do the same thing
[09:17] <floating> installing a screen. install says: Rename config.status to reflect the architecture
[09:17] <m0dY> i have only ssh access to the abused box
[09:17] <floating> (hostname) where it was built. To reconfigure quickly for that architecture
[09:17] <floating> just run that config.status file.
[09:17] <luke_> roryy: "known user"
[09:17] <genii> m0dy you may need to get some fedora-specific info
[09:17] <floating> do I run config.status or rename it to something,  to what ?
[09:17] <luke_> roryy:  err, "unknown user"
[09:17] <genii> m0dy - wait...you can ssh into it?
[09:18] <m0dY> genii, room is dead also google got not much to say about the hell im in
[09:18] <roryy> luke_: sounds like the user account doesn't exist.  How did you install Ubuntu ?
[09:18] <owh> m0dY: What have you done?
[09:18] <m0dY> yeah,, im in a session now,, actually i can't open a new one so if its gone then it's all dead
[09:18] <m0dY> owh, $rm -f /etc/*   < human stupidity
[09:19] <luke_> roryy:  previously it was   /, /home, and swap.   I just reinstaled / from the alternate cd
[09:19] <owh> Hmm
[09:19] <owh> m0dY: Any backups?
[09:19] <m0dY> no :(
[09:19] <Pie-rate> ok, is courier-pop-ssl a good pop3 server? is it simple to get working? why can no one seem to help me with mailserver related things? why are there no simple online tutorials on getting a mail server working?
[09:19] <owh> m0dY: What have you done since that command?
[09:19] <genii> I'd have to say unfortunately you are screwed
[09:19] <m0dY> touched the passwd/shadow files and tried to replace as much as i could back
[09:20] <owh> genii: Not necessarily :-)
[09:20] <owh> m0dY: From where?
[09:20] <genii> Pie I wouldn't use courier
[09:20] <roryy> luke_: did you do a server or expert install?
[09:20] <m0dY> owh, my current machine
[09:20] <owh> m0dY: Is it running the *same* OS?
[09:20] <_goofy_> is there a way to remove unused programs without going in and finding them and uninstaling them manualy
[09:20] <Jordan_U> m0dY: There is probably a fedora equivilent of dpkg-reconfigure -a
[09:20] <luke_> roryy:  expert maybe.  I had to use that disk for my RAID array.  However, I think that passwd command you gave me may have fixed it enough to get into the UI
[09:20] <Pie-rate> ganii: what WOULD you use?
[09:21] <m0dY> not exaclty, dead one is FC4 and im on FC5
[09:21] <owh> m0dY: Is the machine multi-user, or is it a computer in your home without users?
[09:21] <m0dY> Jordan_U, what does dpkg-reconfigure -a does exactly ?
[09:21] <roryy> luke_: it might happen anyway (especially if you only had one user) but you'll need to make sure the UID of the new user matches the UID of your user's $HOME directory
[09:21] <luke_> roryy: nope false alarm... lol.
[09:21] <owh> m0dY: At this stage that is all pre-mature.
[09:21] <m0dY> owh, noth machines have somehow the same installation steps and tweaks
[09:21] <genii> dovecot-pop3d
[09:22] <Jordan_U> m0dY: Reconfigures all of the config files for all the packages on the system
[09:22] <roryy> luke_: use 'adduser' to create a new user (again, in recovery mode)
[09:22] <owh> m0dY: I don't understand what you just said.
[09:22] <m0dY> the difference is one have a lot of users and other not and the difference in pkgs
[09:22] <genii> Pie - sorry for lag. Had to ssh into a linux box to check apt-cache
[09:22] <Pie-rate> k
[09:22] <owh> Jordan_U: That will only work if the base system is running. It's not.
[09:22] <luke_> roryy: ok rebooting again.  thanks much for the help
[09:22] <owh> m0dY: So, they are not the same at all.
[09:23] <m0dY> owh, i meant that both machines have the same installed pkgs, and same added users somehow
[09:23] <yakumo> hello i have problem using open office word processor , when i copy something and paste it to yahoo compose mail my open office crush... any idea why??
[09:23] <Jordan_U> owh: I thought you were sshed into it, did you reboot after rming?
[09:23] <owh> m0dY: Now, or in the past?
[09:23] <m0dY> owh, not totaly the same but i could take the configs from the current one and put it in the empty one
[09:23] <m0dY> now
[09:23] <owh> Jordan_U: No, I am helping m0dY, who is ssh in, currently.
[09:23] <rajiv_nair> is it possible to network a DSL box with a dapper box and play mp3's in the dapper box over the LAN no the DSL box??
[09:23] <rajiv_nair> :-?
[09:23] <owh> m0dY: No, I don't want you to do anything at the moment.
[09:23] <m0dY> Jordan_U, im on ssh now
[09:24] <luke_> roryy: "only one or two names allowed"   lol
[09:24] <owh> m0dY: I'm trying to figure out how much worse you made it.
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> rajiv_nair: Look into mpd perhaps
[09:24] <rajiv_nair> mpd??
[09:24] <rajiv_nair> wazzat?? :D
[09:24] <roryy> luke_: what command are you running?
[09:24] <m0dY> owh, deep ***t
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> rajiv_nair: 'apt-cache info mpd' :)
[09:24] <owh> m0dY: The reason you now have extra users is because you copied the groups and passwd file.
[09:24] <rajiv_nair> okay
[09:24] <luke_> roryy: adduser
[09:24] <tonyyarusso> rajiv_nair: Doh.  apt-cache show I mean
[09:24] <roryy> luke_: the exact command
[09:24] <m0dY> yeah i removed the exta users when putting the new passwd & shadow files
[09:25] <avis> apt-cache search <string>
[09:25] <mdm1000> Hello.  Just installed Edgy.  Where did Disk Manager go?
[09:25] <owh> m0dY: So, at this point, if you want me to attempt to help you, I strongly urge you to treat the machine as if it has gold-dust on the HDD platter and that every command causes you to loose money, lots of money.
[09:25] <m0dY> what important files should i start cloning now at this stage?!
[09:25] <owh> m0dY: So, for the moment, don't do anything.
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[09:25] <luke_> roryy:  heh... that was the exact command.  I just tried adduser luke though too
[09:25] <roryy> luke_: ah, i see
[09:25] <m0dY> owh, exactly what im in now
[09:25] <owh> m0dY: Have you stopped typing?
[09:25] <rajiv_nair> xactly what i needed...........thanx tony>:D<
[09:25] <m0dY> im not totaly touching the ssh session now
[09:25] <luke_> roryy: opps, nm that worked
[09:26] <roryy> luke_: ok, now do 'ls -l /home' -- you should see that /home/luke is owned by 'luke'
[09:26] <tonyyarusso> owh, m0dY: If you're going to need to go pretty involved, we have #ubuntu-classroom for people to go do extended one-on-one help
[09:26] <owh> m0dY: Not totally, or totally not.
[09:26] <m0dY> i even check all cables and made sure there will be no network failures :(
[09:26] <roryy> luke_: I presume that 'luke' was your old username
[09:26] <luke_> roryy: correct
[09:26] <owh> Thanks tonyyarusso, that's a good idea.
[09:26] <luke_> roryy:  what should I put for "room number?"
[09:26] <m0dY> tonyyarusso ?!
[09:26] <genii> LOL
[09:26] <roryy> luke_: just press enter
[09:27] <owh> Anyone who wants to assist m0dY, head on over to #ubuntu-classroom
[09:27] <luke_> roryy:  rofl... oh I see
[09:27] <luke_> roryy: I outsmarted myself on that one
[09:27] <echosystm> lol
[09:27] <echosystm> ubuntu only lets me log out with a terminal window open
[09:27] <echosystm> wtf have i done
[09:27] <m0dY> owh, should i join this room now ?
[09:27] <Pie-rate> genii: so should it install and just work or do i need to do anything else to get a decent mail server going? so far i have postfix and dovecot-pop3d
[09:27] <owh> If you're not sure how to do that, type "/join #ubuntu-classroom" on your IRC client.
[09:28] <echosystm> any ideas guys?
[09:28] <echosystm> all ive done is install the nvidia drivers
[09:28] <echosystm> :(
[09:28] <echosystm> i even tried disabling it
[09:28] <m0dY> owh, ok im in now
[09:28] <rastilin> echosystem, what?
[09:28] <echosystm> ubuntu only lets me log out with a terminal window open
[09:28] <echosystm> when i go system->exit or whatever
[09:28] <genii> pie you should be ok with the default install but maybe check stuff like the conf files where you may need to put specific info for your location
[09:28] <echosystm> the window only opens
[09:28] <rastilin> echosystem, you mean you have to log out from a terminal window or you need to have it open or what
[09:28] <echosystm> if i have a terminal open
[09:29] <rastilin> echosystem, strange.
[09:29] <echosystm> tell me about it
[09:29] <Pie-rate> genii: well apparently it doesn't "just work," since getting mail with thunderbird gets a refused connection message
[09:29] <rastilin> I doubt it's something to do with nvidia though, what distribution are you running.
[09:29] <luke_> roryy:  uh oh.  It doesn't see my /home
[09:29] <echosystm> ubuntu server
[09:29] <echosystm> 6.10
[09:29] <roryy> luke_: is your old partition mounted?
[09:29] <rastilin> With what desktop?
[09:29] <roryy> luke_: run 'mount' to see what's mounted
[09:29] <genii> pie you should try removing postfix and using sendmail and smtpd instead
[09:29] <echosystm> gnome
[09:30] <genii> postifx is a PITA
[09:30] <luke_> roryy: nope, looks like only MD0 is mounted.  I'm not seeing anything about MD1
[09:30] <rastilin> echosystem, well have you ever run Ubuntu 6.10 on that hardware and had the System>Quit work?
[09:30] <echosystm> yeah it was working just before i installed the drivers
[09:30] <genii> the dovecot-pop3d is just a frontend to whatever client you use. exim is installed usually by defauly now I believe
[09:30] <echosystm> working 100% fine
[09:30] <rastilin> echosystem, that's very strange. Are the drivers running?
[09:31] <echosystm> yep
[09:31] <echosystm> also
[09:31] <echosystm> when i go to exit gnome
[09:31] <roryy> luke_: hrm. Are you using software raid?
[09:31] <echosystm> the logout window appears in the bottom right hand corner
[09:31] <echosystm> rather than in the center like it should
[09:31] <luke_> roryy:  yuppers.  MD0, MD1 and Swap

[09:32] <echosystm> i completely reset my x config
[09:32] <echosystm> so i dont think thats the problem

[09:32] <luke_> roryy: nope, but I assume it's probably something I can find how too's on pretty easily.  so unless it's just a command or two don't bother and I'll go research it

[09:33] <rastilin> Hail the ignore command
[09:33] <roryy> luke_: i'd rather not risk remembering those; I don't have a RAID system running here
[09:33] <roryy> luke_: it shouldn't be very difficult
[09:33] <genii> fucking bots
[09:33] <Pie-rate> genii: it still refuses the connection
[09:33] <luke_> roryy:  np.. thanks enough for getting me in.  I can work from here.  Appreciate it man
[09:33] <Pie-rate> its a pop3 problem not smtp
[09:33] <roryy> luke_: cool. good luck.
[09:34] <genii> pie telnet please to port 10 and tell me what it says to you
[09:34] <genii> port 110
[09:34] <echosystm> im gonna reinstall the nvidia kernel + glx
[09:34] <_goofy_> are there any advantages in upgrading to edgy
[09:34] <echosystm> if that doesnt fix it i'll just reinstall haha
[09:35] <Pie-rate> telnet: could not resolve localhost:110/telnet: Name or service not known
[09:35] <rastilin> echosystem, hold on, why use xgl?
[09:35] <echosystm> glx
[09:35] <echosystm> nvidia-glx
[09:35] <genii> pie are you trying to use a fully-qualified domain name as the url when using thunderbird?
[09:35] <rastilin> _goofy_, numerous changes and updates, nothing too massive
[09:35] <Pie-rate> genii, yes
[09:35] <rastilin> echosystem, ah, my mistake
[09:36] <Pie-rate> port 110 is not open
[09:36] <genii> pie does your internet connection come with a fixed ip?
[09:36] <echosystm> nope
[09:36] <echosystm> not working
[09:36] <echosystm> ugh!
[09:36] <echosystm> time to reinstall :P
[09:36] <rastilin> echosystem hold on
[09:36] <echosystm> gonna be fun downloading those packages all over again
[09:36] <rastilin> What's the problem now?
[09:36] <echosystm> same problem
[09:36] <rastilin> Which is?
[09:37] <echosystm> exit screen wont open unless i have a terminal window open in gnome
[09:37] <Pie-rate> yes. port 110 is not open so it doesn't even matter.
[09:37] <rastilin> Is that really that big of a deal. There's a shutdown button on the top right.
[09:37] <echosystm> the screen with logout/switch user/hibernate etc.
[09:37] <echosystm> no
[09:37] <echosystm> the shut down button doesnt work either
[09:37] <echosystm> lol
[09:37] <rastilin> Besides, why not use the console for shutdown, logout, etc.
[09:37] <genii> pie the dovecot conf file likely needs to be checked to make sure it is setup right.
[09:38] <econobeing> how would i configure wine to use the native wintab32 library when running photoshop?
[09:38] <echosystm> well
[09:38] <echosystm> this is a server
[09:38] <echosystm> i'd like it to work properly
[09:38] <echosystm> if possible :D
[09:38] <rastilin> If it's a server why not use the command line only?
[09:38] <genii> but also secure doesn't use 110 ..lemme look up the port # and then telnet into that
[09:38] <echosystm> because im using it to learn on aswell
[09:39] <rastilin> How did you install gnome?
[09:39] <Pie-rate> port scan shows ports 22, 80, 631, 2208, and 3306 open
[09:39] <Pie-rate> genii
[09:39] <genii> pie I think if memory serves 631 is it
[09:39] <echosystm> sudo aptitude x-window-system(or whatever) gnome-core
[09:40] <Pie-rate> i believe 631 is internet printing protocol
[09:40] <porter> morning folks
[09:40] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: Yes, 631 is cups
[09:40] <echosystm> thanks for trying to help
[09:40] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: 22 is ssh
[09:40] <echosystm> but im just gonna format it
[09:40] <echosystm> its cool
[09:40] <echosystm> (Y)
[09:40] <genii> Well it wouldn't be a number over 1024 and 22 is ssh
[09:40] <porter> 631 is cups
[09:41] <econobeing> this guide says i can skip having to type in " WINEDLLOVERRIDES="wintab32=n" " by doing winecfg and adding photoshop to the applist and configureing wine to use the native wintab32 lib when trying to run it
[09:41] <econobeing> where to i config wine to use the native wintab32 library?
[09:41] <genii> pie do you have sendmail or exim installed?
[09:41] <vorpal_> !Ping is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network. Ping works by sending ICMP echo request packets ("Ping?") to the target host and listening for ICMP echo response replies. Using interval timing and response rate, ping estimates the round-trip time and packet loss rate between hosts.
[09:42] <IceTox> hm.. how do you search using apt-get? wasn't it apt-get cache ?
[09:42] <TheRatKing> apt-cache search <search term>
[09:42] <IceTox> aight
[09:42] <IceTox> tnx
[09:42] <TheRatKing> np
[09:42] <arrenlex> XD
[09:42] <arrenlex> OMG
[09:42] <IceTox> hmm
[09:42] <arrenlex> xDD
[09:42] <Pie-rate> well, i installed exim and there're still no pop3 ports open
[09:42] <arrenlex> NO! YOU KILLED IT
[09:42] <arrenlex> You're NOT ALLOWED to use words! :(
[09:42] <arrenlex> Now it's over.
[09:42] <IceTox> so, anyone knows where I can find this libdvdcss2?
[09:43] <genii> pie it may be running out of inetd try telnetting to 110 again
[09:43] <guivho> how could I use locale be_BE.utf-8, but still have english as language (use locale for number and date formats etc, not for language)
[09:43] <Pie-rate> telnet: could not resolve localhost:110/telnet: Name or service not known
[09:44] <tonyyarusso> !libdvdcss2 | IceTox
[09:44] <ubotu> IceTox: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages

[09:44] <_goofy_> im looking to stream .avi video files over the internet to some friends to acess whenever thay what to......any suggestions
[09:44] <genii> pie does ps ax|grep exim  show anything?
[09:45] <Pie-rate> 29307 pts/1    S+     0:00 grep exim
[09:45] <arrenlex> _goofy_: Suggestions for what?
[09:45] <_goofy_> on how to do it
[09:45] <genii> pie so exim is not running
[09:45] <_goofy_> on how to stream the avi's
[09:46] <Pie-rate> no, and going to /etc/init.d and running "sudo ./exim start"
[09:46] <Pie-rate> does nothing
[09:46] <TheRatKing> gstreamer?
[09:46] <econobeing> wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Adobe/Photoshop\ 7.0/Photoshop.exe <--- that works in the terminal, but not when i try to make a launcher
[09:46] <rastilin> _goofy_, they could mount your filesystem with nfs and access them directly
[09:46] <sparr> Just encountered the debian mailing list posting from ten years ago where someone pointed out that bashisms are a problem when using another provider of sh.  Always interesting how problems like this seem inconsequential to people with no forward vision.  Wish I could send a smack to the head back in time a decade.
[09:46] <arrenlex> econobeing: define "a launcher".
[09:46] <rastilin> sparr, all consoles provide a set of basic commands that people are supposed to support. Scripts should only use those commands
[09:47] <_goofy_> rastiln how would thay mount them oner the internet
[09:47] <genii> pie Check /etc/default for a file called exim. open it and change the setting so it is allowed to run
[09:47] <econobeing> right click desktop > create launcher
[09:47] <rastilin> sparr, if people use additional commands, it's their fault
[09:47] <sparr> rastilin: preaching to the choir.
[09:47] <econobeing> i made launchers that work for sunbird and utorrent, but photoshop doesn't want to go
[09:47] <econobeing> it doesn't give me an error, it just doesn't go
[09:47] <rastilin> It's like people complaining vista breaks some programs when the programs use weird hacks to work.
[09:48] <Pie-rate> there's no file called exim in /etc/default
[09:48] <rastilin> _goofy_, it's tricky. You need to read up on it.
[09:48] <rastilin> _goofy_, I was referring to nfs btw.
[09:48] <genii> pie are you sure it's installed??
[09:49] <sparr> rastilin: i already know these things.  im pointing out that people knew them 10 years ago, and reported the problem, and the PTB didnt care
[09:49] <Pie-rate> yes
[09:49] <_goofy_> rastilin: you know any good wed pages
[09:49] <TheRatKing> only if your friends run linux too
[09:49] <rastilin> _goofy_. Not as such. I know the redhat networking manual details this.
[09:49] <TheRatKing> good luck if they run windows
[09:49] <Pie-rate> i removed it and i'm trying "exim4" instead of "exim"
[09:49] <tonyyarusso> sparr: Might be a fitting rant for #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[09:49] <genii> pie OK
[09:49] <rastilin> True. You could use windows file sharing through a private network.
[09:50] <rastilin> Something like openvpn or hamachi.
[09:50] <sparr> tonyyarusso: nah, its already happened in all the places that matter.  the important thing is ubuntu switched to dash, and now we can have a witch hunt for all the bashisms
[09:50] <Pie-rate> there we go, now port 25 is open
[09:50] <Pie-rate> but that does nothing about pop3
[09:50] <genii> ok so smtpd is working :)
[09:50] <genii> try installing sendmail
[09:50] <econobeing> anybody know how to get this wine launcher/shortcut working?
[09:50] <TheRatKing> _goofy_: just upload your videos to youtube :)
[09:50] <genii> !sendmail
[09:50] <ubotu> sendmail: powerful, efficient, and scalable Mail Transport Agent. In component universe, is extra. Version 8.13.8-2 (edgy), package size 191 kB, installed size 248 kB
[09:51] <Pie-rate> that removes exim4.
[09:51] <genii> pie At home I am using dovecot sendmail smtpd
[09:51] <IceTox> tonyyarusso: that source doesn't seem to work :|
[09:51] <_goofy_> i have around 200 fell movies at 700mb a movie
[09:51] <_goofy_> fell=full
[09:51] <TheRatKing> yeowch
=== crass_ is now known as crass
[09:52] <gavintu> how do i restore the gaim taskbar applet if i remove it? it doesn't appear under "add panel"
[09:52] <OberonBerlage> ..
[09:52] <kuto> who is OberonBerlage
[09:52] <TheRatKing> _goofy_: just searching around... maybe gstreamer can do it?
[09:52] <tonyyarusso> IceTox: How so?
[09:52] <OberonBerlage> kuto: thats me?
[09:52] <_goofy_> that was was what i was going to try next
[09:53] <genii> pie the dovecot-pop3d should use whatever backend but I'm pretty sure you need to poke in the conf file for it
[09:53] <IceTox> tonyyarusso: I tried to add the sources from the weblinks, but it worked out bad for me with everyone of the sources.. :/ no public key availble
[09:54] <aljabry> i had big problme so i cant enter to ubuntu
[09:54] <tonyyarusso> IceTox: Ah, right.  The key is on that site somewhere; not sure which page.  Poke around a bit and you'll find it.  I think the wiki page has instructions for adding it actually
[09:55] <aljabry> its look like freeze
[09:55] <Pie-rate> i'm gonna go ahead and try courier
[09:55] <genii> OK lemme know how it goes
[09:55] <kyja> why cant edgy play midi files ?? I thought I installed all the codec there was.
[09:55] <IceTox> yeah, Im going for the wiki tonyyarusso :)
[09:56] <kuto> does anyone know how to use mounting with UUID it seems cool
[09:56] <Pie-rate> genii: well i would've had this working 30 mins ago if i'd just installed courier
[09:56] <kuto> and safe to say the least in copying my files to a specific hdd without folder hassles
[09:57] <Darst> genii got a moment for another problem ?
[09:57] <Pie-rate> next problem! "Sending of password did not succeed. Mail server jon.pmtech.com responded: chdir Maildir failed"
[09:57] <genii> pie LOL sorry then ... tho I had many issues with t relating to my webmail
[09:58] <genii> pie thats where you need to poke in the conf file and look at the different mbox: maildir: stuff
[09:58] <genii> pie thats definitely dovecot
[09:58] <genii> darst well sure
[09:59] <_goofy_> whats the commant to tell me what release of ubuntu im running
[09:59] <genii> goofy uname -ar
[09:59] <kuto> set `uname -r` echo $@
=== atlas_ is now known as Atlas
[09:59] <IceTox> but hey tonyyarusso.. I want to rip a movie.. not play it :P
[09:59] <Darst> genii having crashing issues in x whenever i try to play a media file (either audio or video) in either toetm or vlc
[09:59] <_goofy_> thanks
[09:59] <tonyyarusso> IceTox: Oooh, no idea.
[09:59] <kuto> ok i take a break then
[09:59] <kuto> so linux is cool
[09:59] <kuto> so cool
[09:59] <Pie-rate> what a f***ing headache, why cant there just be a "mailserver" package with some default configuration?
[09:59] <kuto> kewlies
[09:59] <genii> darst anything enlightening in the error msgs it spews out?
[09:59] <IceTox> aight.. fair enough tonyyarusso :)
[10:00] <kyja> why cant edgy play midi files ?? I thought I installed all the codec there was.
[10:00] <Darst> genii mp3s play fine in rhythmbox buy trying them in either totem or vlc...crash
[10:00] <kyja> please
[10:00] <roryy> _goofy_: try 'lsb_release -a'  -- uname is for the kernel
[10:00] <kyja> tell me why
[10:00] <Darst> no error msg just reboots x back to the login screen
[10:00] <Darst> genii no error msg just reboots x back to the login screen
[10:01] <Darst> genii btw am 4 days new to linus so i am prolly going to sound like a newbie in many responses... sorry in advance :)
[10:01] <Darst> linux*
[10:02] <genii> darst thats OK. I am not so familiar with where the error msgs are going with X server unfortunately. I think perhaps /var/log/xserver.log or someplace similar
[10:02] <roryy> /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:02] <genii> you could try dmesg|tail
[10:02] <roryy>  /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:03] <genii> roryy thx :)
[10:03] <Phuzion> What is this "search domain" thing in the network configuration utility?
[10:04] <Phuzion> Like, what is it for?
[10:04] <genii> phuzion if you are connected to multiple networks it specifies which nameservers are for which domains
[10:04] <ompaul> Phuzion, your local domain's zone - where your computer should search for
[10:05] <genii> darst are you still there?
[10:05] <Phuzion> so, mine says clvdoh.adelphia.net

[10:06] <MeggaMortY> hi guys, i'm getting a black screen when i boot off the liveCD after the loading bar screen, can anyone help?
[10:06] <Flannel> ronartos: alright.  You have a problem? or just looking for instructions? or what?
[10:06] <Phuzion> Well, I'm running my own DNS, and I want to make sure that I'm not using external right now
[10:06] <ronartos> !ask How to install Ubuntu directly from windows 98 and using ISO image
[10:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask How to install Ubuntu directly from windows 98 and using ISO image - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:07] <xiaoyi> how many people use ubuntu?
[10:07] <Phuzion> apparently 856
[10:07] <Phuzion> or more
[10:07] <genii> darst unfortunately nothing enlightening there about the crashing
[10:07] <ompaul> Phuzion, you can't connect to the internet from that box if you don't ask machines on the internet where they are
[10:08] <ompaul> xiaoyi, lots and lots
[10:08] <Darst> genii wondering if it might have something to do with codecs or the video card drivers...
[10:08] <xiaoyi> why I can't see all of your message?
[10:08] <Darst> genii used easy ubuntu to install the codecs - any way you know to check if they installed fine ?
[10:08] <genii> darst If it's kicking you out of X then likely some video issue
[10:08] <ompaul> xiaoyi, it was very short, and only two people answered
[10:08] <Phuzion> xaioyi:  are you talking about the elipsis (...) at the end of Darst's message, or something else?
[10:09] <Darst> genii as for the video install - got an ati card, but the google searches i have done are pointing to using either glxgears or google earth to check the install
[10:09] <Darst> genii gears runs fine as does google earth
[10:09] <ompaul> Darst, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:10] <ompaul> Darst, is X falling over on you regularly for no reason?
[10:10] <genii> darst yes it would help to refresh your X I think
[10:10] <Darst> ompaul does that effectively reset my xorg? not falling over regularly, only on running media through either totem or vlc
[10:10] <emma> wat
[10:10] <genii> you may want to use vesa driver for video especially if your ati is a later radeon
[10:11] <emma> 345678828 n.o
[10:11] <Darst> genii x800 card
[10:11] <emma> hey goldfish
[10:11] <Darst> genii vesa driver as opposed to the ati driver ?
[10:11] <xiaoyi> I think I know what happened......
[10:11] <ompaul> Darst, it starts to do a reset you then get to choose what you are doing - vesa might be a useful card to choose
[10:11] <genii> darst yes
[10:11] <kaur> I have an offtopic question, but i really hope someone can help
[10:11] <ompaul> emma, what are you at
[10:11] <gotit> CAN anyone plz help me installing my modem
[10:11] <emma> how old r u all
[10:11] <blekos> hi, is it possible to write/edit to win partitions?
[10:11] <gavintu> i recently installed gnome using aptitude, now i cant install anything else with aptitude or else it will try to delete most of the packages from gnome that it thinks aren't being used, even while im running it. what's wrong here?
[10:11] <Flannel> kaur: #ubuntu-offtopic for offtopic questions
[10:12] <kaur> ok
[10:12] <Darst> ompaul am running on a 40 lcd (meaning non std res - 1366x768) if i do this am i going to lose the res settings and head to the garage for the crt monitor ?
[10:13] <genii> darst If it can multisync you should not have probs
[10:13] <thirdalbum> In Ubiquity, where you have the slider that is labelled "New partition size", does that refer to the new size of the original partition, or the size of the new Ubuntu partition?
[10:13] <Darst> genii google for vesa ubuntu to find the instructions on installing vesa?
[10:13] <gotit> can anyone see this
[10:13] <gotit> CAN anyone plz help me installing my modem
[10:13] <ompaul> Darst, it should be okay - worst case you end up running the command again
[10:13] <ompaul> gotit, read help.ubuntu.com/community and search in there for modem

[10:14] <genii> darst vesa is just a driver you can choose to use insetad of the recommended one when X sets up. The card ID to use if it asks is 0 (zero)
[10:14] <gotit> already did but it does not work its dsl modem
[10:14] <Darst> ompaul genii thanks for the advice will go and try the suggestions hopefully be back in a bit with good news
[10:14] <gotit> usb dsl modem actually
[10:15] <ompaul> gotit, get a non usb modem - with a few ports it is more fun - that kind of debugging is not fun
[10:15] <gotit> aah i cant , right now i have to configure this one
[10:16] <ompaul> gotit, if it does not work out of the box then system administration networking is your only hope
[10:16] <rxkaffee> how do I findout what package a specific file belongs to?
[10:17] <ompaul> gotit, from the menu
[10:17] <erryko> hello everyone. i just bought a wacom pen tablet. its name is "penpartner". does anyone know what can i do to let it work?? i'm on ubuntu 6.10 32 bit. thanks everyone
[10:17] <Darst> ompaul genii suggestion on using kernel framebuffer device interface yes/no?
[10:17] <gotit> ompaul:didnt get it
[10:17] <ompaul> rxkaffee, apt-cache search File is one way
[10:17] <ompaul> Darst, no
[10:17] <Darst> ompaul thx
[10:17] <kyja> please tell me why edgy wont play midi files
[10:17] <Flannel> rxkaffee: packages.ubuntu.com has a search function (scroll down)
[10:18] <ompaul> gotit, you have a strange piece of hardware I can't give any more advice than I already have
[10:18] <ompaul> gotit, you could try plugging it into another usb connection and trying that item again
[10:19] <gotit> i cant apply the command sudo ppoeconf
[10:19] <genii> erryko Is this tablet an USB tablet or does it use another interface?
[10:19] <erryko> it's usb
[10:19] <gotit> wat is that system administration networking
[10:19] <ompaul> gotit, funny that is not what I suggested from the menu
[10:19] <thirdalbum> kyja: Do you have the timidity package installed?
[10:19] <sacater_> users
[10:19] <marginoferror> I'm an experienced Linux user trying to install Edgy Eft, and I'm being foiled by the graphical installer
[10:19] <Darst> ompaul v4l option y/n (i seem to recall something about v4l and my tv card - which i havent thought about setting up yet)
[10:20] <marginoferror> Despite assigning a partition to server as root, it refuses to install because I don't have a root partition
[10:20] <marginoferror> err, serve, not server
[10:20] <genii> erryko Sorry then :( If it was an old serial port type I could have helped
[10:20] <gotit> wat menu i dunno
[10:20] <kyja> thirdalbum, timidity. hmm I am not sure. I will see if apt-get can help me there thx
[10:20] <ompaul> Darst, you are using a "lower end spec" just to get yourself running consitant to go and research your problem (or at least that was my take on it)
[10:20] <sacater_> * is there a scandisk kind of app for ubuntu
[10:20] <erryko> genii, don't worry ;)
[10:20] <riam> hi sacater
[10:20] <thirdalbum> marginoferror: There is a text-based installer on the Alternate CD; I maintain that it's easier to use than the Live CD installer
=== RiNG is now known as [RiNG] 
[10:20] <sacater_> riam: hi
[10:20] <marginoferror> Alternate CD?
[10:20] <genii> erryko Tho you may want to check the xorg.conf file for wacom entries
[10:21] <gotit> i just installe ubuntu
[10:21] <riam> hmm no blocking out just the way i like it lol
[10:21] <kyja> thirdalbum, installing =]  thank you very much.
[10:21] <sacater_> is there a scandisk app for ubuntu
[10:21] <nothlit> marginoferror, then use the alternate disc
[10:21] <kuto> are there any how tos to make deb packages from source tar balls?
[10:21] <kuto> !deb
[10:21] <ubotu> deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[10:21] <genii> kuto man makedeb
[10:21] <nothlit> !checkinstall | kuto
[10:21] <ubotu> kuto: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[10:21] <nothlit> !info pbuilder
[10:21] <ubotu> pbuilder: personal package builder for Debian packages. In component main, is extra. Version 0.155ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 77 kB, installed size 436 kB
[10:21] <marginoferror> sacater_, there is, but what exactly do you want to do?
[10:21] <kuto> hmmm they have check install for debian?
[10:22] <riam> sacater wat is every one on about lol i have no idea
[10:22] <rastilin> You can use alien.
[10:22] <kuto> for ubuntu? since when
[10:22] <kuto> it was in redhat first i saw
[10:22] <erryko> genii, i read this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wacom but when i restart x, the video output becomes too slow
[10:22] <kuto> the checkinstall
[10:22] <ompaul> sacater_, no - there is a different tool which you don't use on mounted partitions - it is called fdisk - (if you do it will most likely break your software in strange and very interesting and non functioning ways)
[10:22] <thirdalbum> marginoferror: On the Ubuntu website, when you choose a download mirror, you will be able to see the Alternate CD. This has a text-installer which is more powerful, and more tested.
[10:22] <marginoferror> ompaul, ?  How is fdisk similar to scandisk?
[10:22] <Darst> ompaul genii done - just restarting x - bbiab thx
[10:22] <blekos> how can i see if the correct graphic card is installed?
[10:22] <gotit> hello guys i need to install my usb dsl modem
[10:23] <riam> sacater:this is way to boring lol for some one who has no idea about computers
[10:23] <genii> erryko if that is happening I would suspect the irq for video and the irq for your video card are interfering somehow
[10:23] <marginoferror> thirdalbum, all right, thank you.
[10:23] <ompaul> marginoferror, they both tidy up filesystems - but fdisk is much nicer :-) and works better too
[10:23] <sacater_> ompaul: so how can i run it on my major partition
[10:23] <genii> sorry irq for usb/irq for video
[10:23] <belfegorash>  does anyone knows a program that replace skype on ubuntu 5.04?
[10:23] <frogzoo> ompaul: fdisk? or fsck ?
[10:23] <ompaul> sacater_, you don't need to it will work automatically in our about thirty restarts
[10:23] <gotit> ompaul:i didnt understand wat you were sayin
[10:23] <genii> belfeg gizmoproject
[10:23] <marginoferror> ompaul, fdisk fixes filesystems?  I thought that was the job of fsck?  Or are we talking about a different kind of problem?
[10:24] <belfegorash> ok thanks
[10:24] <riam> :sacater: cya i have no idea watsa goin on
[10:24] <sacater_> ompaul: will it correct errors?
[10:24] <ompaul> frogzoo, marginoferror fsck - yeap I should get coffee
[10:24] <Pie-rate> i think i broke apt-get following a guide for getting a mail server to work. every time i try to do anything with apt-get now it gives me this: http://pastebin.ca/272813
[10:24] <frogzoo> ompaul: cheers, enjoy
[10:24] <marginoferror> sacater:  If you are just concerned about maintenence, then it is done automatically every so often as mentioned
[10:24] <Pie-rate> how do i fix it?
[10:24] <erryko> genii thank you anyway, i'll wait for another one's help ^_^
[10:24] <marginoferror> sacater:  If you have a specific problem you need to fix, you can run it manually
[10:24] <gotit> ompaul:i didnt understand wat you were sayin
[10:24] <ompaul> sacater_, sorry fsck is the program it will but you better tell people what the errors are cos ehh you can and WILL do damage if you dont do it right
[10:25] <genii> erryko I'm sure it can be solved
[10:25] <NineTeen67Comet> Hi all .. does anyone have a good suggestion for a monitor for a server that I can have on my workstation? Like gkrellm or something similar? (headless server) ..
[10:25] <ronartos> how can i install KDE on ubuntu with gnome already?
[10:25] <ompaul> gotit, if you don't get it from the tool on the menu you are not going to have much success, if it fails put the modem in a different usb slot and start with that tool again
[10:25] <Flannel> ronartos: you want to install kubuntu or kde?
[10:25] <ronartos> kde
[10:25] <NineTeen67Comet> ronartos: sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
[10:25] <ronartos> i already got ubuntu with gnome
[10:25] <Pie-rate> i think i broke apt-get following a guide for getting a mail server to work. every time i try to do anything with apt-get now it gives me this: http://pastebin.ca/272813
[10:25] <kuto> wow ps3 supports linux
[10:26] <Flannel> ronartos: then you'll need universe enabled, and then install the "kde" package
[10:26] <Flannel> ronartos: right, but kubuntu and kde have different programs associated with them, just like ubuntu and gnome do.
[10:26] <genii> pie Try apt-get remove --purge sasl2-bin && apt-get install sasl2-bin
[10:26] <ronartos> oh
[10:26] <gotit> ompaul: there is no tool here
[10:27] <gotit> i am connected through windows with the same modem
[10:27] <marginoferror> Hmm
[10:27] <marginoferror> I got the graphical installer to work by instructing it to delete the offending partition and remake it
[10:27] <Darst> ompaul genii well we are definitely closer now
[10:27] <marginoferror> But the whole partition selection part of the installer is a bit broken.  Maybe next version.
[10:27] <genii> darst Is it doing something new now ? LOL
[10:28] <ronartos> Flannel can I talk to you in room?
[10:28] <Flannel> ronartos: yep
[10:28] <Darst> ompaul genii i am able to play the files now without a crash but i now need to modify the res back to 1360x768 and for some reason the graphiocs arent smooth anymore... clunky...
[10:28] <gnoraz> gutn morgen ;)
[10:28] <nothlit> marginoferror, did you try selecting the format partition checkbox?
[10:28] <Pie-rate> thanks genii
[10:28] <ronartos> I mean in private
[10:28] <Darst> genii error when i ran gears...Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[10:29] <marginoferror> nothlit, yes, I did
[10:29] <marginoferror> It didn't work when "format partition" was just a checkbox that I selected
[10:29] <genii> pie I hope it helps
[10:29] <marginoferror> But once I removed the partition and remade it, that checkbox was checked and greyed out by default
[10:29] <marginoferror> And then it worked
[10:29] <gotit> i have 115gb hard drive and i installed ubuntu on it do i need to make swap drive
[10:29] <ronartos> I just want to install UBUNTU without burning the ISO image or using floppy
[10:29] <gotit> its only one partion in it
[10:29] <genii> darst Yeah the DRI stuff won't always work with vesa
[10:29] <marginoferror> gotit, how much memory do you have?
[10:30] <gotit> 1 gb
[10:30] <gnoraz> 2 gb swap
[10:30] <Darst> genii is that why i am not getting smooth scrolling now ?
[10:30] <ronartos> Flannel: can we talk on room
[10:30] <marginoferror> gnoraz, that memory x 2 advise has been out of date for like eight years
[10:30] <gotit> do i need to make a 2 gb sawp
[10:30] <genii> darst Most likely, yes
[10:30] <marginoferror> gotit, a swap partition is helpful but not strictly required
[10:30] <marginoferror> I don't have one
[10:30] <gnoraz> oh relay ? damnit xD
[10:30] <reverseblade> ronaldo, install kde-desktop
[10:30] <marginoferror> >.>
[10:31] <genii> darst Is there another resolution setting you could try instead of that odd one?
[10:31] <reverseblade> ronartos, kubunutu-desktop or kde-desktop
[10:31] <gotit> marginoferror: hou much memory do you have
[10:31] <Darst> genii ompaul thanks for the help tonight... i am seriously thankful to the both of you... at least i have got a start now
[10:31] <marginoferror> 1gb, same as you
[10:31] <marginoferror> I suggest you do not make a swap partition - installation will work without trouble - and if you need swap later, make a file instead
[10:31] <marginoferror> But that is my preference.  Most linux users would suggest otherwise, I think
[10:32] <Darst> genii native res on the tv (lcd monitor) is 1366x768 (or 1360x768)
[10:32] <gotit> ok ,,installation is working fine ,
[10:32] <ronartos> How can I install UBUNTU using ISO image only (without CD burning or floppy booting)
[10:32] <gotit> you can ronartos
[10:32] <gotit> cant
[10:32] <Pie-rate> yeah you can but you'd have to use network boot
[10:32] <ronartos> There's a guide on this GOTIT
[10:33] <marginoferror> ronartos, I don't think it is impossible but it sounds very difficult
[10:33] <marginoferror> What OS are you using now?
[10:33] <Haitao> ronartos: you have a USB memory stick?
[10:33] <genii> mount -t iso9660 -o bind /some/iso/abc.iso /some/mount/point
[10:33] <gavintu> hello. i'm having troubles with aptitude trying to delete stuff that's actually being used in gnome. how can I stop it from doing this? I'm trying to use it to install other stuff.
[10:33] <gotit> now i have to install my usb dsl modem in ubuntu, which i am using right now , so i cant plug it off
[10:33] <nothlit> loop
[10:33] <rastilin> ronatos, you need to use vmware or qemu
[10:34] <nothlit> gavintu, please paste the output of aptitude into a pastebin
[10:34] <rastilin> ronatos, set it to use the hard drive as it's disk
[10:34] <nothlit> !pastebin | gavintu
[10:34] <ubotu> gavintu: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:34] <genii> darst 1 minute
[10:34] <grrr> okay so I tried a dual boot of ubuntu and windows xp just to try it out after a week or so i decided to remove ubuntu. i did this simply by formating the partition it was on from withen windows. but now when i restart, grub still tries to load but comes into an error and doesn't do anything. how can i get it back to just loading windows stright up? running off of live dvd right now
[10:34] <Darst> genii k
[10:34] <marginoferror> rastilin: Interesting suggestion.
[10:34] <rob> grrr: you need to restore your mbr using your xp cd
[10:35] <gotit> now i have to install my usb dsl modem in ubuntu, which i am using right now , so i cant plug it off
[10:35] <rob> grrr: boot from it, at the dos prompt type fdisk /mbr (I think)
[10:35] <marginoferror> grrr, if you have the original Windows XP cd it is very easy
[10:35] <gotit> how can i install my usb dsl without pluging it
[10:35] <grrr> well okay i don't exactly have that i can make one but only if there is some way to get the ububtu live cd to burn iso's
[10:35] <genii> darst 1360 should give a little better than 1366
[10:35] <nothlit> !grub | grrr
[10:35] <ubotu> grrr: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:36] <Darst> genii just adding it now to the xorg.conf
[10:36] <marginoferror> grrr, do you have two CD drives?
[10:36] <grrr> marginoferror: yes
[10:36] <rastilin> Right click on the image and select "write to disk".
[10:36] <marginoferror> If so, then all you have to do is right-click on the ISO and select "write to disc" or somesuch option, near the bottom of the menu
[10:36] <rob> grrr: you will need to enter the recovery console on boot
[10:36] <grrr> okay will try thank you
[10:36] <marginoferror> Then, reboot into the recovery console and "fixmbr".  If that doesn't work, try again with "fixboot" instead
[10:36] <marginoferror> Good luck
[10:36] <gavintu> nothlit: Thanks. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36025/
[10:37] <noido-san> what's the best way of having dual boot with ubuntu and windows, having partitions that must be shared with both?
[10:37] <gotit> now can any one plz help me installing my usb dsl without pluging in
[10:37] <rob> noido-san: let grub set it up (during install)
[10:37] <marginoferror> noido, I have two drives - one contains separate partitions for windows and for linux, and one is a gigantic data partition that both can use
[10:38] <nothlit> gavintu, hooolly...
[10:38] <nothlit> gavintu, output of aptitude -s install
[10:38] <marginoferror> gotit: That sounds very difficult
[10:38] <gavintu> nothlit: I installed gnome using aptitude, so it's just listing all of those packages.
[10:38] <gavintu> Ok.
[10:38] <noido-san> marginoferror in the gigantic dp what filesystem do you use?
[10:38] <Flannel> !install | ronartos, instructions are here, for some setups.  it all depends on what you have currently.
[10:38] <ubotu> ronartos, instructions are here, for some setups.  it all depends on what you have currently.: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[10:38] <marginoferror> I used to use FAT32.  However, FAT32 does not support files larger than 4gb
[10:39] <noido-san> that's no problem
[10:39] <jengc0il> hi rob
[10:39] <marginoferror> So now that I need support for that, I am (right as we speak) attempting to change over to NTFS
[10:39] <marginoferror> I will use a captured NTFS driver in ubuntu
[10:39] <gotit> marginoferror: i cant plug it in cause  i am using it
[10:39] <marginoferror> FAT32 is much easier to set up and use
[10:39] <jengc0il> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[10:39] <noido-san> yeah, I know
[10:39] <Seveas> !compiling | jengc0il
[10:39] <ubotu> jengc0il: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[10:39] <noido-san> how about reading ext3 with windows?
[10:39] <Darst> genii restarting x again... bbiab
[10:39] <nothlit> gavintu, it sounds like you've removed a package that depended on all of those packages, or you installed a program that broke said metapackage
[10:39] <noido-san> wouldn't that be easier?
[10:39] <jengc0il> hi Seveas
[10:39] <gavintu> nothlit: Give me a few minutes. It's telling me now that there's broken packages and stuff, I'll see if I can fix it.
[10:40] <genii> darst OK
[10:40] <rastilin> noido-san Not all that reliable.
[10:40] <rob> noido-san: it is possible, probably not that easy though
[10:40] <jengc0il> how i can compile tor under ubuntu
[10:40] <marginoferror> noido-san: I don't know of a way to do that very safely
[10:40] <nothlit> gavintu, thats great, more info to work on :)
[10:40] <grrr> well that's crap it won't let me open my drive with the live cd in it: and there is not enough room to put the iso on the temp space: anybody know of just a boot disk i could put to floppy, or cd, that would only fix the mbr?
[10:40] <marginoferror> noido-san: I am certain there are professional software tools, if you are willing to pay the money, but it is definitely not easier
[10:40] <cantona> i installed flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78.2ubuntu1~edgy1_i386.deb but my firefox still cant view flash, however mozilla does, why?
[10:40] <Seveas> jengc0il, read what ubotu said and/or just install the tor package

[10:40] <noido-san> there's a software that allows windows to read on ext3
[10:40] <rob> oops sorry jenda :)
[10:40] <rastilin> grr, reboot and put in the windows disk?
[10:40] <Seveas> rob, ;)
[10:40] <rob> heh
[10:40] <noido-san> and they're free
[10:40] <rastilin> noido-san. But it sucks.
[10:41] <marginoferror> grrr, Windows 2000 at one point supported the option to make a four-floppy install disk set
[10:41] <marginoferror> The Windows 2000 version of fixmbr *should* work
[10:41] <nothlit> noido-san, they're really reading ext2
[10:41] <jengc0il> tq rob
[10:41] <marginoferror> If you can find a working Win2k install and make those floppies
[10:41] <noido-san> http://www.boingboing.net/
[10:41] <rastilin> You could reinstall grub and use it to boot windows.
[10:41] <noido-san> ups, wrong paste, sorry
[10:41] <noido-san> http://www.fs-driver.org/
[10:41] <grrr> is there a way to fix it from inside ubuntu live
[10:42] <marginoferror> grrr:  Well, yes
[10:42] <rastilin> Grub?
[10:42] <noido-san> http://www.fs-driver.org/faq.html#acc_ext3
[10:42] <marginoferror> grrr:  The best thing to do is set up grub to work its magic invisibly
[10:42] <gotit> marginoferror: i cant plug it in cause  i am using it
[10:42] <marginoferror> grrr:  Ideally that will be as good as fixmbr
[10:42] <Flannel> grrr: there's a grub boot disk.  But, you need a windows boot disk if you want to fix the windows bootloader
[10:42] <marginoferror> gotit, I heard you, but you will have to work around that somehow
[10:42] <nothlit> Flannel, i think the windows xp disk has a recovery mode
[10:43] <rob> Flannel: no, you can do it with the xp install cd
[10:43] <grrr> marginoferror: as long as you can get it to boot windows i can burn a xp disk from there
[10:43] <nothlit> grrr, i think the windows xp disk has a recovery mode
[10:43] <Flannel> rob: right.  that's effectively a windows boot disk.
[10:43] <marginoferror> grrr, Well, if you can boot windows then there is nothing more to fix =)
[10:43] <rastilin> Why not burn a windows boot disk from ubuntu, you DO have two drives right?
[10:43] <grrr> rastilin: as i said it won't let me open the drive with the live cd
[10:43] <nothlit> a grub or gujin boot disk can boot windows from cd
[10:43] <gotit> marginoferro: i guess i should have the commands ready when i do that cause i will not be able to get help than
[10:43] <grrr> so i can't burn an disk
[10:44] <nothlit> but using grub to chainload boot windows isn't a bad idea
[10:44] <rob> Flannel: yes, so why make another?
[10:44] <marginoferror> grrr, you said you had two drives?  I don't understand.  Store the ISO file on your hard drive, which you should still be able to access from the live CD, and burn with the 2nd drive?
[10:44] <Flannel> rob: who said anything about making another?
[10:44] <grrr> marginoferror: my drive is ntfs i can't write to it
[10:44] <marginoferror> grrr, there are ways around that, but I'm not sure if any of them work with the live cd.  Let me see.
[10:44] <grrr> and the temp space it makes is only 400MB which doesn't fit the iso
[10:45] <rastilin> grrr, but can you read to it?
[10:45] <marginoferror> grrr, that is the only partition you have at all?  You completely wiped out your old ubuntu partition?
[10:45] <gotit> can any one plz give me a walk through for installing my usb dsl
[10:45] <nothlit> grrr, you can resize the ntfs disk inside the livecd
[10:45] <grrr> yeah i know that's why the live cd is a problem so how do i get grub to do what you said earlier without installing ubuntu again. I guess i could try that
[10:45] <rastilin> gotit, you'll have to get the dsl plugged in
[10:45] <echosystm> is it possible to increase the resolution of the command line? :P
[10:45] <marginoferror> gotit, I'm sorry, I don't really know how
[10:45] <rastilin> echosystem, yes
[10:45] <Flannel> !grub | grrr
[10:45] <ubotu> grrr: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:45] <echosystm> how does one do that?
[10:45] <rastilin> echosystem how? It's tricky.
[10:46] <Flannel> grrr: read the first link, it'll walk you through t
[10:46] <rastilin> No clue
[10:46] <echosystm> oh
[10:46] <gotit> rastilin: ok than what
[10:46] <marginoferror> gotit, I suggest you find some other way to connect to the internet - an old modem, if necessary - so you can get help and plug it in at the same time
[10:46] <echosystm> tricks arent good with me
[10:46] <echosystm> :D
[10:46] <echosystm> bb.

[10:46] <gotit> rastilin: wat will be the next step
[10:46] <nothlit> echosystm, sudo nano -w /boot/grub/menu.lst... append vga=791 after splash in the kernel line
[10:46] <rastilin> Not sure, give me a second
[10:46] <grrr> marginoferror: one drive two partitoin, was three when i had ubuntu installed becuse of swap. decided i wanted the space in windows instead so loaded windows from grub then formatted the two partitoins ubuntu and the swap back to one. then restarted , grub tried to start gave me an error. reloaded with live cd
[10:46] <jengc0il> !root |
[10:46] <nothlit> echosystm, i'm assuming you have a 1024x768 display
[10:46] <ubotu> : sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:46] <rastilin> There's a reason I only use ADSL and a router. Because it's easier to set it up quickly.
[10:46] <grrr> now i have two partitions
[10:47] <marginoferror> grr, that partition you formatted
[10:47] <marginoferror> That is empty, no?
[10:47] <marginoferror> I mean, still empty
[10:47] <grrr> one with windows and blank one that i originally split in two and had ubuntu on
[10:47] <mista> how can i find out where my firefox 2.0 was installed too?
[10:47] <gotit> wait a min
[10:47] <rastilin> misa, just whack in "firefox" into command line
[10:47] <gavintu> 	mista: whereis firefox
[10:47] <gotit> that adsl too
[10:47] <marginoferror> grrr, I recommend you follow Flannel's advice above (ubotu gave you a link) - however, if you want
[10:47] <kuto> mista: whereis firefox
[10:48] <kuto> but there are libs and stuff that it gets installed
[10:48] <marginoferror> grrr, you can use the live cd tools to re-reformat that empty partition to FAT32 and then put the ISO on there
[10:48] <marginoferror> And then burn it
[10:48] <marginoferror> If you want to go through grub, check the bot's links
[10:48] <rastilin> gotit, when you're set up to send private messages, message me.
[10:49] <gotit> i cant do it why not
[10:49] <kuto> thats what happens to the stuff missing in us
[10:49] <kuto> hmmm
[10:49] <kuto> odd
[10:50] <marginoferror> grrr, good luck.  My install is complete so I'm rebooting.  I am pretty sure either the above link from the bot will help you to fix grub, or reformatting that partition will allow you to burn a WinXP CD and fix it that way.
[10:50] <ironfroggy> what is the absolute simplest smtp server i can install?
[10:50] <davidef> hi, i have a problem within beryl/server-xgl, in the shutdown menu the shutdown and reboot buttun are present can anyone help me ?
[10:50] <ironfroggy> i dont want to do anything but send
[10:50] <mista> im trying to find my firefox plugin folder
[10:50] <davidef> aren't prenent
[10:50] <Flannel> davidef: try #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl or #xgl
[10:50] <davidef> thanks
[10:51] <rastilin> davidef, you can shutdown and reboot with the "shutdown" and "reboot" console commands. Otherwise, I have no clue.
[10:52] <davidef> rastilin, i know that, but why the button should be there !!
[10:52] <davidef> rastilin, anyway i'm asking in #ubuntu-xgl i hope there someone can help me...
[10:53] <nothlit> davidef, thats because you're using the session method of using xgl
[10:53] <nothlit> davidef, you'll have to use ther methods
[10:53] <grrr> well thanks but that link it gave me says it's for doing it after losing grub after installing windows not the other way around, this is lame guess i'll try reinstalling it then see if that lets me boot xp where i can burn a disk and restore mbr that way or is there another way
[10:53] <grrr> everything on that page is to get linux to work in this case not windows
[10:53] <worldjam> has anyone here got dreamweaver or flash 8 working with wine(or anything else) on edgy eft?
[10:54] <Flannel> grrr: that page title makes nod ifference.  It's a tutorial on how to reinstall grub, regardless.
[10:54] <nothlit> grrr, once you've restored grub you can edit the menu.lst to be windows centric
[10:54] <mojojojo_> hi! My Ubuntu is terribly sloooooow compared to windows for example. Do you know what might be the cause??
[10:54] <nothlit> mojojojo_, you haven't installed your graphics drivers
[10:54] <nothlit> mojojojo_, describe where this slowdown is
[10:54] <nothlit> mojojojo_, are you running off the livecd?
[10:55] <gotit> rastilin: i am there in private
[10:56] <mojojojo_> nothlit, no, it's from hard drive. First programs work very slow and secondly there is a time when entire system doesn't respond
[10:56] <VigoFusion> I am unable to get Recommended Updates, is a 'this is not set right, and that is not set right. re-install? or is there a way to set it to default?
[10:56] <nothlit> !terminal | mojojojo_
[10:56] <ubotu> mojojojo_: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[10:57] <nothlit> mojojojo_, open a terminal and type top and hit enter
[10:57] <genii> mojojo If you have less than 256Mb ram it may be painfully slow
[10:57] <nothlit> genii, he said his windows was faster
[10:57] <kuto> hmm this is what i really dont like
[10:57] <kuto> thinking for myself
[10:57] <genii> nothlit Well 95 still can run on 16Mb :)
[10:58] <mojojojo_> nothlit, well it says firefox takes about 60% of cpu and xmms about 15%
[10:58] <gotit> rastilin: i am there in private . can you see me
[10:58] <rajiv_nair> dnt compare it with da likes of win95/98
[10:58] <nothlit> mojojojo_, what windows are you comparing it to and whats your ram/cpu speed
[10:58] <kuto> where can i find how to make deb pkg
[10:58] <arune> has there been improvments in the edgy-upgrade process? Im about to upgrade but Im scared
[10:58] <genii> rajiv LOL
[10:58] <rajiv_nair> :D
[10:59] <mojojojo_> nothlit, winx XP. about 700 MB of RAM, CPU 1,8 AMD Athlon
[10:59] <rajiv_nair> arune: if i were u id go for a reinstall
[10:59] <nothlit> mojojojo_, is it net applications that are slow, or everything
[10:59] <gotit> it been a whole week and nobody is helping me to install my usb adsl , IT REALLY SUCKS
[10:59] <genii> 60% cpu for firefox seems a bit much. What speed is your cpu mojojojo
[10:59] <mojojojo_> nothlit, everything
[10:59] <arune> rajiv_nair: :/
[10:59] <mista> why in ubuntu trying to instal intel and ati drivers when i have a nvidia card
[10:59] <rajiv_nair> arune: yeah...........
[11:00] <nothlit> genii, read 5 lines above your question
[11:00] <rajiv_nair> arune: alwats safer:D:D
[11:00] <rajiv_nair> always*
[11:00] <ronartos> How
[11:00] <genii> nothlit Sorry need coffe
[11:00] <ronartos> How can upgrade the firefox?
[11:00] <nothlit> mojojojo_, was the livecd just as slow?
[11:00] <gotit> it been a whole week and nobody is helping me to install my usb adsl , IT REALLY SUCKS
[11:00] <gavintu> nothlit: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36026/ . It's still trying to delete everything, I've updated the packages it says here are "broken", but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
[11:00] <nothlit> mojojojo_, what res are you using
[11:00] <mojojojo_> nothlit, sometimes even terminal hangs. I haven't used livecd
[11:00] <gotit> can any one read this
[11:00] <arune> rajiv_nair: sure is but there is no time
[11:01] <CyberT3> <CyberT3> what is wrong with following line in xsupplicant configuration:
[11:01] <CyberT3> <CyberT3> first_auth_command=<BEGIN_COMMAND>dhclient %i<END_COMMAND>
[11:01] <CyberT3> thanks
[11:01] <mojojojo_> nothlit, what is "res"?
[11:01] <gotit> rastilin: where are you
[11:01] <arune> cant reinstall every 6 month
[11:01] <nothlit> gavintu, it looks like a failed upgrade
[11:01] <grrr> okay i did what that page said at the end it says readonly file system
[11:01] <CyberT3>  what is wrong with following line in xsupplicant configuration:
[11:02] <nothlit> mojojojo_, resolution
[11:02] <CyberT3> first_auth_command=<BEGIN_COMMAND>dhclient %i<END_COMMAND>
[11:02] <rajiv_nair> arune: my cousin upgraded from dapper to edgy(not reinstall)
[11:02] <gotit> guys now i am really getting tired and sucked up
[11:02] <gotit> it been a whole week and nobody is helping me to install my usb adsl , IT REALLY SUCKS
[11:02] <marginoferror> I have upgraded without reinstalling several times
[11:02] <rajiv_nair> arune: now he cant strt X
[11:02] <VigoFusion> !ugrade
[11:02] <gavintu> nothlit: lol, I didn't upgrade anything though. I think apt-get and aptitude are just fighting each other. I think I'll just escape out to console and reinstall gnome from scratch.
[11:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ugrade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:02] <rajiv_nair> there is always a "marginoferror":D:D
[11:03] <nothlit> grrr, the livecd doesn't mount partitions with write access, you'll have to do that with a command
[11:03] <gavintu> gotit: Try asking on the forums instead.
[11:03] <VigoFusion> whoops
[11:03] <CyberT3>  what is wrong with following line in xsupplicant configuration:
[11:03] <CyberT3> first_auth_command=<BEGIN_COMMAND>dhclient %i<END_COMMAND>
[11:03] <marginoferror> rajiv_nair: x_x
[11:03] <VigoFusion> !upgrade
[11:03] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:03] <worldjam> has anyone here got dreamweaver or flash 8 working with wine(or anything else) on edgy eft?
[11:03] <rajiv_nair> :)
[11:03] <arune> yeah, all you hear is that it wont work to upgrade, seems like ubuntu fail at its mission
[11:03] <gotit> forums does not answer in a month
[11:03] <mojojojo_> nothlit, you mean of the screen? it's 1024x768 75Mhz
[11:03] <gotit> even
[11:04] <marginoferror> gotit: we are out of suggestions.  You either need to install the DSL yourself without internet assistance, or find a way to access the internet while the DSL modem is plugged into the computer to be set up
[11:04] <rob> gotit: thats because most do not work with Linux, you need to google it maybe, or buy one with ethernet
[11:04] <marginoferror> gotit:  Good luck.
[11:04] <rajiv_nair> by the way...USB cable modems dont work with edgy
[11:04] <nothlit> gavintu, basically what its saying is that there aren't new enough versions of certain apps to fulfill the requirements of apps currently installed
[11:04] <marginoferror> gotit: Yes, purchasing a DSL modem with ethernet support is definitely the best option
[11:04] <marginoferror> rajiv_nair: all of them?
[11:04] <nothlit> gavintu, did you edit your sources.list lately?
[11:04] <rajiv_nair> i found that out the hard way yesterday
[11:04] <marginoferror> That is unfortunate
[11:04] <rajiv_nair> dunno about that
[11:04] <gotit> marginoferror: no its not
[11:04] <nothlit> gavintu, take a look at it, and make sure you sudo aptitude update
[11:05] <rajiv_nair> my modem works fine in dapper(im on dapper now)
[11:05] <gotit> marginoferror: you dont know wat i have to do latter with it
[11:05] <cantona> how can I have flash in firefox2 ???????????
[11:05] <rajiv_nair> i installed edgy yesterday
[11:05] <nothlit> mojojojo_, have you run linux before? any livecds? do you have any esoteric hardware?

[11:06] <rajiv_nair> it was listed in device manager.......but i couldnt connect.......many people have poesten the same problem at ubuntuforums
[11:06] <gotit> marginoferror: at least give me some thing that i can try when i will not be connected/pluging adsl in ubuntu to install
[11:06] <VigoFusion> ubotu is our friend
[11:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is our friend - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:06] <VigoFusion> :)
[11:06] <gavintu> nothlit: I changed it when I freshly installed dapper, that's it. I'm going to guess that it's either because I forgot to update aptitude once or twice when I was installing something, or because I removed some libraries using synaptic while aptitude still believed that they were installed. Thanks for your help anyways!
[11:06] <marginoferror> Anyone know a lot about X and monitors?  This is really stumping me:
[11:07] <nothlit> gavintu, updating happens every day, or as soon as possible if it wasn't on
[11:07] <marginoferror> Using the exact same resolution and the exact same refresh rate, Linux and Windows shift the monitor about a centimeter in different directions
[11:07] <genii> margin I MAY be some help
[11:07] <marginoferror> So when my (LCD) monitor is centered properly in Windows, it is uncentered in Linux
[11:07] <marginoferror> And vice versa
[11:07] <nothlit> gavintu, it shouldn't be that, and all the packaging programs put a lock, it shouldn't be able to interfere
[11:07] <marginoferror> There is an automatic centering function which works very well, but it is bizarre that it would need to be recentered every time I switch OSes
[11:07] <gotit> at least give me some thing that i can try when i will not be connected/pluging adsl in ubuntu to install
[11:08] <nothlit> marginoferror, you could try installing your graphic card drivers
[11:08] <mojojojo_> nothlit, yup, slackware - it ran really nice... no, I don't have any... apart from Pen Drive, which isn't esoteric, I guess. Looking at top, I am under impression that kernel is dividing cpu time strangely, for example a while ago xmms consumed 95% percent of its usage!!
[11:08] <genii> margin likely display device (not video card settings but monhitor settings) in xorg.conf
[11:08] <marginoferror> nothlit: Oh, you mean the nvidia binary drivers?  I was going to skip those because I don't play games on linux, but it is good advice.  I will try that.
[11:08] <arune> Im gonna try to upgrade to edgy, which me luck
[11:08] <nothlit> good luck
[11:09] <marginoferror> genii: I'll look over that section in the config files and see if I can find anything.  Thanks.
[11:09] <nothlit> i mean it
[11:09] <gavintu> nothlit: But if i installed "gnome" with aptitude, it thinks things like gaim and evolution are part of the same package, so if apt-get removes one of them, it reports gnome as a broken package. Doesn't that make sense?
[11:09] <arune> thanks, bye
[11:09] <gotit> http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
[11:09] <rajiv_nair> best of luck arune:d
[11:09] <nothlit> and remember the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:09] <rajiv_nair> yeah
[11:09] <gotit> i tried it but  i am not able to do it
[11:09] <rajiv_nair> write that down
[11:09] <daroma> hay algun espaol/a?
[11:09] <rajiv_nair> saved me many times
[11:09] <genii> margin Best luck :)
[11:09] <nothlit> gavintu, if you installed gaim/evolution explicitly, then aptitude would not have marked them as automatic
[11:09] <genii> did darsh return yet?
[11:09] <gotit> unzip SpeedTouch330_firmware_3012.zip &&
[11:09] <gotit> chmod +x firmware-extractor &&
[11:09] <gotit> ./firmware-extractor KQD6_3.012
[11:10] <mojojojo_> I'll try rebooting it with different kernel
[11:10] <gotit> is this one command
[11:10] <nothlit> gavintu, are you not running the ubuntu-desktop install?
[11:10] <marginoferror> Thanks to both of you =)
[11:10] <MeggaMortY> can anyone help me with fixing my video settings in the xorg.conf? need to explain my situation by pm as it is long winded :P
[11:10] <rajiv_nair> hehe
[11:10] <nothlit> gavintu, you could always let aptitude remove all of it, and then reinstall it... as long as you don't purge
[11:10] <gavintu> nothlit: No. fluxbuntu. it's basically a server install. evolution and gaim come with gnome, among a lot of other things that I wasn't expecting.
[11:10] <rajiv_nair> meggamorty: which card do u hv??
[11:10] <gavintu> nothlit: Yes, that's what I'm going to do now.
[11:11] <MeggaMortY> rajiv_nair: RAEDON 9800 pro
[11:11] <rajiv_nair> aaaaah
[11:11] <rajiv_nair> PM me
[11:11] <rajiv_nair> :D
[11:11] <MeggaMortY> ok
[11:11] <nothlit> gavintu, why aren't you in the fluxbuntu channel
[11:11] <kuto> i got big problems i think my psychologist would really call me crazy
[11:11] <gavintu> nothlit: I usually am. I'm leaving now, lol.
[11:12] <nothlit> gavintu, oh you removed evolution and gaim? that would break gnome
[11:12] <vorpal_> if i've ssh'ed into a remote machiene how do i copy something from my current  box to the remote one?
[11:12] <nothlit> gavintu, you need to reinstall them lol
[11:12] <genii> MeggaMortY might be some useful stuff here for you:
[11:12] <genii> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=190133
[11:12] <marginoferror> vorpal_: You need to use "scp" or "sftp"
[11:12] <gavintu> nothlit: I just did, and I showed you the report after I reinstalled them. Why the heck are programs like that depended on by gnome?
[11:12] <marginoferror> vorpal_: Typically you can't do this from within the shell you've already opened
[11:12] <nothlit> vorpal_, man scp, its relatively confusing, so you'd need to ask somewhere else
[11:13] <nothlit> gavintu, sudo aptitude reinstall gnome?
[11:13] <genii> uucp
[11:13] <gavintu> yeah
[11:13] <marginoferror> I can explain scp or sftp to you if it is a simple task
[11:13] <vorpal_> i thought scp was only for pulling stuff of the remote box
[11:13] <nothlit> vorpal_, as in get help for it not in this channel
[11:13] <marginoferror> Nope, it goes both ways
[11:13] <marginoferror> Or even from one remote box to another
[11:13] <marginoferror> Very handy
[11:13] <vorpal_> oh well off to the man page i go
[11:13] <gavintu> nothlit: Anyways, it's getting kinda late so I'll go start that now. THanks for you help.
[11:13] <marginoferror> Good luck.  I recommend sftp if you are already familiar with ftp commands, though
[11:13] <nothlit> one of the boxes needs the ssh server though
[11:14] <vorpal_> thanks
[11:14] <rajiv_nair> meggamorty: u might find this useful too http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu
[11:14] <nothlit> vorpal_, you could use scp from your current box btw
[11:14] <nothlit> vorpal_, there are also graphical tools, like gftp
[11:15] <MeggaMortY> rajiv_nair: sorry i was pming you without being registered XD, hold on
[11:15] <Darst> genii ompaul got it working with the ati drivers now
[11:15] <marginoferror> The way I always do it is to, from the directory containing the files I want to copy, run sftp exactly as I would run ssh (same arguments)
[11:15] <echosystm> how do you install webmin on an ubuntu server?
[11:15] <rajiv_nair> come to think of it.......i aint registered
[11:15] <marginoferror> And then once I'm logged in, cd to the destination directory and "put (files)"
[11:15] <marginoferror> Not hard
[11:15] <echosystm> is it in the repositories?
[11:15] <Darst> genii ompaul dont know what the issue was but putting it onto vesa and then back again to the ati ones worked fine
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[11:16] <Darst> genii ompaul now the next challenge is getting the digital audio out port on the sound riser to work so that i can get sound working as well :)
[11:16] <marginoferror> I forget, what is scrollkeeper and why does it make updating gnome packages take forever?
[11:16] <marginoferror> I know I've investigated this before
[11:17] <nothlit> echosystm, just install your apache'php'mysql and place webmin in the htdocs and follow the install instructions

[11:22] <KenSentMe> Has anyone been able to play commercial dvds on Ubuntu? (don't need to open !dvd, because i already know that one)
[11:22] <crimsun> witless: flash 9 beta 2 has been backported
[11:22] <jengc0il> ok readning database
[11:23] <witless> which appears to be 7
[11:23] <nothlit> witless, then you need to update flash

[11:23] <KenSentMe> nothlit: what do you want me to do with that?
[11:24] <crimsun> one_black_eye: it's called a forkbomb. Don't do it without setting proper ulimits.
[11:24] <marginoferror> one_black_eye: Unless you have taken precautions, I believe your system will come to a crawl or even a stop
[11:24] <nothlit> KenSentMe, the penguin liberation front has packages of libdvdcss which the official ubuntu repos cannot have for legal reasons
[11:24] <one_black_eye> neat, can someone show me?

[11:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wins - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:25] <marginoferror> Okay, bedtime.  Later all.  Thanks for all the help!
[11:25] <one_black_eye> omg

[11:25] <marginoferror> It's 2:30
[11:25] <nothlit> KenSentMe, have you tried using vlc and mplayer

[11:25] <recu> Edgy doesn't openGL on my nVidia nForce. Cannot find anyone with same problem.
[11:25] <rastilin> Weekend though right?
[11:26] <rastilin> recu, because most people install their drivers?
[11:26] <rastilin> recu, did you install drivers?
[11:26] <marginoferror> Yeah, but I'll never wake up on time Monday if I get way off schedule today - not that it's not already way too late
[11:26] <nothlit> recu, try installing nvidia drivers manually
[11:26] <recu> after installing Edgy?
[11:26] <recu> Thought Edgy has any driver...
[11:26] <rastilin> recu, yeah....
[11:26] <marginoferror> recu, OpenGL requires drivers *from nVidia*, which we cannot package in Ubuntu for legal reasons
[11:27] <marginoferror> We have "a" driver, and it is a good one - it is just not an OpenGL-supporting one
[11:27] <recu> marginoferror: ok
[11:27] <rastilin> Although that won't stop us come the next version
[11:27] <marginoferror> rastilin: ??
[11:27] <rastilin> marginoferror, ah WRONG
[11:27] <marginoferror> Eh?
[11:27] <rastilin> THE NV DRIVER SUCKS.
[11:27] <rastilin> It crashes on the 6xxx and 7xxx series and stuff bash with it
[11:27] <rajiv_nair> rastilin: try gettin an ATI..............ull chng ur mind:d
[11:27] <rastilin> *stuffs
[11:27] <recu> marginoferror: exact. And the one from nVidia is. Hope it is 64-bit too.
[11:28] <rastilin> No, nvidia is awesome
[11:28] <rastilin> Next Ubuntu version, we'll include the binary nvidia driver
[11:28] <marginoferror> Really??
[11:28] <ryan> nothing beats my via onboard
[11:28] <rastilin> Yes, check launchpad
[11:28] <rajiv_nair> ATI drivers==hell
[11:28] <marginoferror> How will we manage that?  Change in nVidia's licensing scheme?
[11:28] <rastilin> Yeah right, I can play Oblivion at full speed on my computer, good luck with that
[11:29] <recu> rastilin: everyone I talk to: Edgy  on my ATI works great
[11:29] <Stork> help.. i installed the latest nvidia driver and now X wont start.. it says 'Error API mismatch the NVIDIA kernel module has the version 1.0-7184, but this X module has the version 1.0-9629'. How can i fix this?
[11:29] <rastilin> Simple, ignoring the gpl.
[11:29] <marginoferror> rastilin: I smell revolution
[11:29] <rastilin> You'll need to upgrade your version of the restricted drivers package.
[11:29] <marginoferror> rastilin: But I won't believe it until I see Richard Stallman's head on a pike
[11:29] <echosystm> Stork i had the same problem with nvidia
[11:29] <crimsun> marginoferror: we already include it by default.
[11:29] <recu> marginoferror: better not
[11:29] <[swb] > marginoferror, hahaha
[11:29] <crimsun> marginoferror: it's just not _enabled_ by default.
[11:29] <rastilin> I still like the gpl. But I'm also sick of X not working with any distribution.
[11:29] <echosystm> apt-get update seemed to help
[11:30] <echosystm> then reinstall
[11:30] <[swb] > we need the stallmans of this world to backtalk against all the other reactionaries
[11:30] <echosystm> or remove + purge first
[11:30] <CyberT3> rastilin, you are talking, forgive me like an idiot
[11:30] <echosystm> then reinstall :P
[11:30] <marginoferror> crimsun: Weird.  I'll look into it more tomorrow when I install it myself (usually I do it manually, this time I will do it within ubuntu)
[11:30] <marginoferror> Anyway, good night.  (for real this time)
[11:30] <mista> how do u i upgrade from 6.06 6.10

[11:31] <CyberT3> rastilin, first of all *you* wont include nothing
[11:31] <mista> why
[11:31] <rastilin> Because it'll stuff up your system.
[11:31] <CyberT3> rastilin, second of all dont spread FUD
[11:31] <rastilin> CyberT3, how am I spreading FUD?
[11:31] <mista> dam should i just do a new install?
[11:31] <grrr> okay so i just reinstalled ubuntu to fix it. it worked i am in windows now. got the directions to get it to work after i uninstall ubuntu agian, however i cannot burn my xp cd because i only have dvd-r's not cd-r's i can easily solve this buy getting a blank cd-r and just waiting, but if not too much troble anybody got an solution either under xp or ubuntu(installed this time not live) without the xp cd? if not i'll just wait
[11:31] <recu> a colleague of mine asked me if you can do a complete backup of your running ubuntu... (i.e.   listing all packages being used and so on...)
[11:32] <rastilin> Burn the cd image onto a dvd.
[11:32] <rastilin> recu, Not that I know of.
[11:32] <grrr> rastilin: can't will not work. is a .nrg file. nero won't let me burn to dvd
[11:32] <rastilin> Select, "Burn to DVD" and run the .nrg. Should work?
[11:32] <rastilin> CyberT3, well?
[11:32] <recu> grrr: nero... no. use GPL tools!
=== spunk__ is now known as spunk
[11:33] <grrr> recu: it came free with my dvd burner. so why not
[11:33] <CyberT3> rastilin, you are not developer, therefore your claims that ubuntu will ship with nvidia binary drivers is FUD
[11:33] <recu> grrr: on ubuntu, or we're talking another crappy OS?
[11:33] <rastilin> Right, a challange.
[11:33] <rastilin> CyberT3, firstly, you don't read slashdot.
[11:34] <CyberT3> rastilin, dude, slashdot sucks so much
[11:34] <grrr> rasiilin: did it doesn't work nero will not let you burn a cd iso to a dvd
[11:34] <rastilin> One second
[11:34] <rajiv_nair> CyberT3 and rastlin..........peace guys:D
[11:35] <grrr> either way i appreciated it but is ther a way without a windows disk. either a command from withen ubuntu or xp, like i said not a big deal to wait but would rather not 2:35 am here and nothing better to do

[11:36] <rastilin> CyberT3, Quote "We are installing non-Free drivers by default,"
[11:36] <CyberT3> rastilin, that spec is nonsense, and nobody is sure it'll get implemented
[11:36] <CyberT3> rastilin, specs mean nothing and can mean a lot, lol
[11:37] <rastilin> CyberT3, Priority "High" Definition "Approved"

[11:38] <rastilin> grrr, why did you give up on ubuntu
[11:38] <recu> wow. new 64-bit drivers on Dec4
[11:38] <elkbuntu> rastilin, please stop trolling this. the spec isnt a matter of finality, it was to define an idea to be discussed

[11:39] <jenda> hehe... np, rob ;)
[11:39] <boink> /clear
[11:39] <rastilin> elkbuntu, have it your way. Nevertheless I believe Approved means something. You can't use Composite X without this.
[11:39] <rob> :)
[11:39] <crimsun> rastilin: the approved means that the spec has been approved as implementable, nothing more.
[11:39] <grrr> mainly becuse i installed it to my download partition just to try it out. not enough space on my windows partition with all my games apps and what not. so it was a pain to boot to ubuntu just to download things,
[11:39] <grrr> i'm going to install it agian once i get a second hdd
[11:39] <gavintu> Is there a (more) minimal gnome installation? one that leaves out all the extra applications...
[11:40] <philipp__> guten morgen
[11:40] <rastilin> I give up. I don't see how it's trolling to mention this, or FUD. Hardly fear and doubt.
[11:41] <elkbuntu> rastilin, fear and doubt is precisely what you seem to be aiming for
[11:41] <kuto> checkinstall is in ubuntu?
[11:41] <rastilin> elkbuntu, how?
[11:41] <kuto> i thought it was for redhat
[11:41] <kuto> or for rp,
[11:41] <kuto> rpm
[11:41] <crimsun> kuto: you're thinking of 'alien'.
[11:41] <roryy> !info checkinstall
[11:41] <rastilin> Because I buy a $800 graphics card since I enjoy having the nv drivers give a black screen.
[11:41] <ubotu> checkinstall: installation tracker. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.6.0-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 88 kB, installed size 392 kB
[11:41] <kuto> crimsun alien is not good
[11:41] <grrr> rastilin: like if i wanted to watch something i downloaded because windows can;t read ext3 i had to boot to ubuntu. then to play a game i had to go back and load windows. then to watch somehting or to even download something i had to boot to ubuntu. see wehre i'm going with the annoyance factor
[11:41] <crimsun> kuto: neither is checkinstall.
[11:41] <elkbuntu> rastilin, "<rastilin> Because it'll stuff up your system"
[11:42] <roryy> checkinstall makes debs, doesn't it ?

[11:42] <rastilin> I lost three installs to updating 6.06
[11:42] <kuto> id rather use checkinstall for rpm but checkinstall for ubuntu is same as alien?
[11:42] <rastilin> So did MANY others. It's a good warning.

[11:42] <rastilin> If this is fear and doubt I'll get my Windows disc
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[11:43] <elkbuntu> rastilin, there was many reasons why upgrades failed
[11:43] <rastilin> elkbuntu, you're claiming they didn't fail
[11:43] <rastilin> elkbuntu, it's not fear and doubt to mention that your update will probably fail if statistically it will. Or while it may be FUD, it's also true
[11:43] <crimsun> Can we punt the confrontational tone somewhere else, please?
[11:44] <rastilin> It's an offensive accusation
[11:44] <elkbuntu> rastilin, nothing of the sort, however having repositories other than the official ones is the fault of the person who put the non-official repos in their sources.list
[11:44] <MeggaMortY> hey can anyone help me out? im in the middle of fixing the video drivers for my install and a guide says to "Make sure the restricted repository is enabled in /etc/apt/sources.list or this guide will not work!"... can anyone tell me what to do to ensure this?
[11:44] <rastilin> elkbuntu, where do unnoffical repositories come into it
[11:44] <grrr> i agree wih elkbuntu it even warns you of this
[11:44] <crimsun> MeggaMortY: restricted is enabled by default.
[11:44] <elkbuntu> rastilin, that was what was stuffing up the install
[11:44] <elkbuntu> rastilin, 99.9999% of cases
[11:45] <rastilin> I didn't have unnofficial repositories and I still lost my install
[11:45] <grrr> but thank you all for your help even though i eventually just did what i was going to do anyway but it's the thought that counts
[11:45] <elkbuntu> rastilin, did you use automatix?
[11:45] <jengc0il> !tell nothlit about make install
[11:45] <rastilin> elkbuntu, I would believe you if I didn't KNOW otherwise
[11:45] <rastilin> No
[11:45] <elkbuntu> rastilin, what about easyubuntu
[11:45] <rastilin> No
[11:45] <MeggaMortY> crimsun: ah ok, well i run "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(username)" and it says it cant find linux-restricted-modules or something
[11:45] <elkbuntu> rastilin, what about seveas' repo
[11:45] <rastilin> Give me some credit
[11:45] <rastilin> I used to have that, but not for the second and third computers
[11:46] <rastilin> Still, how would that make X fail and the kernel not detect
=== aceZ is now known as acez
[11:46] <crimsun> MeggaMortY: it's linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r), and it's already installed by default
[11:46] <elkbuntu> rastilin,  so every single one of your repos were official mirrors of ubuntu.com repositories?
[11:46] <MeggaMortY> crimsun: ok so i should just skip those 2 steps? :P
[11:46] <rastilin> Pretty much
[11:47] <crimsun> MeggaMortY: paste me the output of ``dpkg -l linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)|grep ^ii''
[11:47] <rastilin> The kernel didn't detect properly, how is that a repo problem?
[11:47] <elkbuntu> rastilin, then are you referring to the accidental x.org updates that broke dapper?
[11:47] <MeggaMortY> crimsun: sorry im a noob here, every time i get an error i reboot into windows XD

[11:48] <grrr> later
[11:49] <rastilin> elkbuntu, I like the non-free drivers. How am I blaming them?

[11:50] <rastilin> MistaED, never having used the screen command myself, I don't know.
[11:50] <rastilin> Stork, dist-upgrade to get the latest restricted-drivers package.

[11:51] <crimsun> MistaED: (or use nohup)

[11:52] <Stork> Raskall, what do you mean?
[11:52] <MistaED> crimsun: how do i detach?
[11:52] <rastilin> The fact that I was called a troll for saying Non-Free drivers would be included in Feisty Fawn.

[11:53] <Stork> rastilin, how do i dist upgrade to the latest restricted drivers?
[11:54] <rastilin> mc44, how come it's so seldomly the people I'm talking to that answer.
[11:54] <rastilin> "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[11:54] <elkbuntu> rastilin, thats still just an idea, not definate. ... now what was your grievance with dapper and xorg breakage, what were you blaming that on?
[11:54] <rastilin> Untested packages. Really the kernel not loading and X not running aren't the result of binary drivers.
[11:54] <mc44> rastilin: because you dont adress most of your questions with a name
[11:55] <Stork> Raskall, it says there's nothing to upgrade
[11:55] <rastilin> mc44, I never asked a question
[11:55] <Stork> rastilin, it says there's nothing to upgrade
[11:55] <rastilin> Stork. Hmm, hold on.
[11:55] <mc44> rastilin: questions/statements. whatever. its impossible to see who is talking to who without using someones name as a prefix
[11:56] <rastilin> Stork, I see. You don't have the latest driver.
[11:56] <kenkku> weird. my xorg.conf (I'm in livecd mode btw) has proper screens and devices and a monitor
[11:56] <kenkku> but it still says no device found
[11:56] <rastilin> Stork. You need the 9774 driver or some such, your driver is an older version and the restricted driver kernel thing isn't loading into it properly.
[11:56] <Stork> rastilin, don't i? i downloaded the installation file from nvidias website and run it
[11:57] <rastilin> Stork, run it?
[11:57] <Stork> rastilin, yeah, executed it and it said it installed
[11:58] <rastilin> Stork. Then either I must be reading it the wrong way around. It's possible that it is your kernel patch that's out of date. But which distribution are you running?
[11:58] <kenkku> is there any text mode browser on the livecd?
[11:58] <Stork> rastilin, edgy
[11:59] <drach> kenkku: maybe w3m?
[11:59] <rastilin> Stork, interesting. Well, something in your system is out of date. Check the name of the driver file, what does it say?
[12:00] <Stork> rastilin, how can i do that?
[12:00] <kenkku> drach: thanks. I didn't know any other textmode browsers than links and lynx
[12:01] <elkbuntu> kenkku, if the computer has the internet, you should be able to download your choice of browser pretty quickly. you can install things on the livecd, the only thing is they're temporary for the one session
[12:01] <rastilin> Stork, the file you downloaded, what's it called?
[12:01] <rastilin> elkbuntu, You're still here, what's your response?
[12:02] <elkbuntu> rastilin, response? you asked me a question?
[12:02] <Stork> rastilin, NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run
[12:02] <rastilin> elkbuntu, yeah, nevermind though
[12:02] <kenkku> elkbuntu: ok. thanks. I wonder what's wrong with this, why doesn't X find the device if it's properly in the xorg.conf.. :S
[12:02] <kuto> later guys
[12:02] <rastilin> Stork, ok, the file is TOO recent. Uninstall it and use the nvidia-glx drivers provided.
[12:03] <Stork> rastilin, why is that?
[12:03] <rastilin> Stork, because you need two things to use a binary driver. You need the driver and you need a kernel plugin that communicates with the driver and the kernel. The driver doesn't communicate with the kernel properly. The Ubuntu version does.
[12:04] <elkbuntu> kenkku, what is your video card? (presuming that's what you mean by 'the device')
[12:04] <rastilin> Because the little bridge thing is the wrong version.
[12:04] <Stork> but rastilin, i had the drivers working before.. they just broke when i restarted
[12:05] <david83> how difficult is it to connect a system with an Firewire harddisk vs. a USB harddisk is it harder to connect? how can i find out if it's just plug in the hd and it runs?
[12:05] <rastilin> Stork, yeah, they do that. I'm sure someone, who shall remain nameless, will consider it FUD. But it's true nevertheless. If you use binary drivers and the ubuntu ones simultaneously, they do tend to hammer your system.
[12:05] <Stork> so there's no way to use the latest drivers?
[12:05] <rastilin> Stork, uninstall the nvidia driver and re-install the Ubuntu driver.
=== RiNG is now known as [RiNG] 
[12:06] <rastilin> Stork, there is, just make sure the Ubuntu driver isn't already installed.
[12:06] <rastilin> Stork, or that you don't update the restricted driver package in the meantime.
[12:06] <crimsun> david83: it is that simple.
[12:06] <elkbuntu> Stork, im presuming you've done dpkg-reconfigure xserver.xorg to swap between drivers
[12:06] <rastilin> elkbuntu, does anyone do that?
[12:07] <Stork> elkbuntu, no, they're both called 'nvidia'
[12:07] <david83> crimsun can i check if my system has the firewire all set up correctly?
[12:07] <elkbuntu> rastilin, i should hope so
[12:07] <crimsun> david83: for mass storage, it is.
[12:07] <rastilin> elkbuntu, I still prefer editing xorg.conf manually.
[12:07] <elkbuntu> Stork, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the best way to make sure you dont miss parts in reconfiguring your video card
[12:08] <Stork> rastilin, how can i completely uninstall the ubuntu driver then?
[12:09] <rastilin> Stork, run the ubuntu file and select "yes" to removing the driver. Then run "sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx" to get rid of Ubuntu's files. Then just pick one you like and install that.
[12:09] <MeggaMortY> rajiv_nair: are you there?
[12:09] <rastilin> Although removing nvidia's might remove Ubuntu's kernel plug. Not sure how it's set up.
[12:09] <elkbuntu> Stork, you dont need to remove it. you just need to get the config switched over properly.
[12:10] <rastilin> elkbuntu, How? It already reads Driver "nvidia", what more is there?
[12:11] <elkbuntu> rastilin, i let dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg handle it, that way i know it has all of it
[12:11] <Stork> crazy stuff
[12:11] <Stork> i think i might install gentoo on my spare partition
[12:12] <bass> @find bass
[12:12] <rastilin> elkbuntu, But you don't. That's why you need to do stuff by yourself.
[12:12] <rastilin> elkbuntu, There's no guarantee it's set up properly.
[12:12] <MeggaMortY> is gentoo still a very good linux distribution? i heard it took a bit of a slide lately?
[12:12] <rastilin> It's still an excellent distribution. I used to use it. I got sick of all the configuring.
[12:13] <rastilin> But, it might not install at all. After hours of tweaking too, you're better off using Sabayon or another derivative.
[12:13] <elkbuntu> Stork, you could always *try* dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg just to see if it fixes it
[12:14] <rastilin> Stork, you might as well try it anyway
[12:14] <rastilin> Stork, although I still suspect the problem is an overwritten file somewhere.
[12:14] <rastilin> Stork, since I've had the same problem before.
[12:15] <wsjunior> is it possible to run gnash in edgy?
[12:16] <gotit> ok i am on the modem now and my usb adsl is pluged in ubuntu how do i install it
[12:16] <iami89> how do i install vga driver for ubuntu{my card is Nvidia geforce 4 mx 440}
[12:16] <wbpb_ubuntu> Bom dia
[12:16] <kenkku> elkbuntu: I have a Club3D radeon X800XL (pcie)
=== gotit is now known as angry
[12:17] <elkbuntu> kenkku, so did x break or just never work?
[12:17] <wsjunior> wbpb_ubuntu: try #ubuntu-br
[12:17] <kenkku> elkbuntu: never worked
[12:17] <kenkku> the first time I opened the livecd, it just said X couldn't start
[12:17] <El_Che> het, can the regular install cd create a raid 0 (stripe) or doe I need the alternate cd?
[12:17] <rastilin> imami89, it's already installed
[12:17] <elkbuntu> kenkku, did you get to a command line?
[12:18] <rastilin> kenkku, or rather, CAN you get to a command line
[12:18] <kenkku> elkbuntu: I'm actually using the command line now with irssi and some other stuff in a screen
[12:18] <angry> rastilin: i am have pluged in my usb adsl in ubuntu what should i do now
[12:18] <rastilin> angry, aside from not use usb adsl?
[12:18] <wsjunior> is there any edgy package for gnash?
[12:19] <angry> rastilin: why not
[12:19] <elkbuntu> kenkku, cool. try what i said above for the other guy, and try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and see if the driver is selected, or if it's dropped to Vesa
[12:19] <angry> rastilin:wat?
[12:19] <kenkku> elkbuntu: will do.
[12:20] <rastilin> angry, you mean aside from the fact that you need some wierd and godforsaken driver to make it work instead of just giving it an ip and gateway address
[12:20] <kenkku> elkbuntu: do you mean the select video driver -catalog_
[12:20] <psycho78> Beatz2006
[12:21] <baastrup> Hi, i would like to try out the newest kernel, is there any easy way for that? (nividia rapich card debug testting)
[12:21] <angry> rastilin:i dont know i dont have a choice
[12:21] <elkbuntu> kenkku, i mean, type the command 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[12:21] <rastilin> angry, Though if you have to do it this way. You need the pppoe package.
[12:21] <kenkku> elkbuntu: yeah, done it already actually
[12:21] <rastilin> kenkku, or just edit xorg.conf
[12:21] <elkbuntu> kenkku, what driver was it using?
[12:21] <kenkku> elkbuntu: ati
[12:22] <angry> rasilin its already installed i guess
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[12:22] <kenkku> I've checked the unmodified generated xorg.conf, it used ati too
[12:22] <elkbuntu> kenkku, swap down to the vesa and see if you can start gdm, you may have to kill gdm first
[12:22] <rastilin> elkbuntu, so this proves my point that the default nv and ati drivers don't work with the latest cards.
[12:22] <[swb] > hmm
[12:22] <elkbuntu> rastilin, then why are you so for them?
[12:22] <rastilin> I'm not, I despise them.
[12:22] <iami89> rastilin > i mean 3d acclerator { some thing like openGL...}
[12:23] <A3n> my internet isnt working and i still cant figure out why !
[12:23] <nikin> hy
[12:23] <jamesbrose> Can sombody help me install my webcam on edgy, it keeps saying Could not connect to video device in camorama, but its in the device list
[12:23] <rastilin> elkbuntu, the binary drivers are different, they work. That's why I think the people who complain about their inclusion are being needlessly cruel.
[12:24] <rastilin> iami89, ?
[12:24] <angry> rastilin: pppoe package is installed in my ubuntu
[12:24] <elkbuntu> rastilin, you actually made the point earlier, there's the matter of the GPL, but political discussion is for another channel, #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:25] <[swb] > I got me 3d acceleration working on ATI with ease
[12:25] <A3n> here is what i tried to do to get my internet to work (wireless card, chipset Intersil ISL Prism Javelin/Xbow) : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35792/
[12:25] <kenkku> elkbuntu: how do I restart gdm? gdm-stop doesn't work
[12:25] <[swb] > it didnt work by default, but I just needed to apt-get the restricted modules
[12:25] <elkbuntu> kenkku, killall gdm
[12:25] <elkbuntu> kenkku, then just start gdm
[12:25] <elkbuntu> err
[12:25] <[swb] > elkbuntu, more like /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[12:25] <Olgiata> question: i have one desktop user and one admin, i want to log in right as desktop user without the login screen, how do i set up that?
[12:25] <elkbuntu> just type, gdm
[12:25] <[swb] > or ctrl alt backspace
[12:25] <nikin> i ame managing a server with ssh and mostly i use command line apps. I prevent stopping started processes on disconnect using screen, but when i run an X program when i disconnect it shuts down, coz it loses the X server, any idea how to slove that?

[12:45] <[swb] > nikin rather

[12:46] <angry> A3n:there is an extractable file , how i extract it
[12:46] <nikin> newby: there should be plenty of groups, like floppy, cdrom, tape, audio
[12:46] <roryy> newbie: well, it's very odd for any normal user to be in the 'root' group
[12:46] <angry> A3n:Extract the files: tar xzvf speedtouchconf-dd-mm-yyyy.tar.gz
[12:46] <angry> A3nis this the commmand
[12:46] <Seveas> [swb] , please keep the offtopic talk for #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:46] <nikin> swb: that isnt so far away
[12:46] <newbie> no...even if i log-in as "a" user i am unable to do admini operation,,
[12:46] <nikin> Seveas: sry
[12:46] <[swb] > Seveas, I am sorry
[12:47] <A3n> angry:ow thats just right click on the file and open with archive manager :p
[12:47] <angry> A3n: it says Change into the speedtouchconf directory: cd speedtouchconf-dd-mm-yyyy
[12:47] <newbie> roryy....so i should be in admini groups ah...instead of root
[12:48] <A3n> angry:you once you extracted the files into a directory you just go into that directory
[12:48] <angry> A3n: ok
[12:48] <[swb] > kenkku_, if you want me to try and help you, best get that machine booted quickly, my gf will be back for lunch soon

[12:49] <roryy> newbie: what does 'id a' say?
=== kenkku_ is now known as kenkku
[12:49] <roryy> newbie: make that 'id -u a'
[12:49] <nikin> i ame managing a server with ssh and mostly i use command line apps. I prevent stopping started processes on disconnect using screen, but when i run an X program when i disconnect it shuts down, coz it loses the X server, any idea how to slove that?
[12:49] <newbie> uid=1000(a) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
[12:50] <newbie> roryy...
[12:50] <roryy> newbie: your system setup is unusual
[12:50] <roryy> newbie: about about 'groups karthik' ?
[12:50] <newbie> karthik : karthik root
[12:51] <newbie> roryy
[12:51] <roryy> newbie: and 'getent group admin' ?
[12:51] <newbie> wht man?
[12:52] <roryy> newbie: please run that command
[12:52] <newbie> yeah..i did
[12:52] <genii> nikin use disconnect
[12:52] <roryy> newbie: and the output was?
[12:52] <newbie> admin:x:112:
[12:52] <genii> or detach
[12:52] <nikin> genii: what does disconnect do?
[12:52] <ADminS> i want download manager by under command line
[12:53] <ADminS> like prozilla
[12:53] <genii> I think -detach or --detach
[12:53] <newbie> roryy......its admin:x:112:
[12:53] <ADminS> but ubuntu not support prozilla pakages any more
[12:53] <roryy> newbie: ok. What i recommend doing is this: reboot into recovery mode, run 'adduser god admin', then run 'telinit 2' -- this will make 'god' an administrator user, and 'telinit 2' gets you to graphical login
[12:53] <genii> What these do is detach or disconnect the process you just ran from the terminal/console you ran them from so they can keep running without having to be daems
[12:53] <genii> daemons
[12:53] <BlackHawk> hi
[12:53] <roryy> newbie: then 'god' will be able to run synaptic, and so on
[12:54] <newbie> thans roryy...i will do it
[12:54] <ADminS> !download
[12:54] <ubotu> Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[12:54] <angry> A3n:Save the microcode (either speedmgmt.tar.gz, mgmt.o, alcaudsl.sys, or the .zip file) into the speedtouchconf-dd-mm-yyyy/ directory
[12:54] <roryy> newbie: however, something is odd with your system; in a typical ubuntu setup, no users will be in the 'root' group.  Also, adminstrative users are typically in other groups too
[12:54] <angry> A3n: wat does this mean
[12:54] <ADminS> !d4x

[12:55] <roryy> newbie: anyway, good luck. I must be going.
[12:55] <angry> A3n: how should i do that?
[12:55] <newbie> roryy....i made that mistake man
[12:55] <A3n> well you probably had to download one of those files and you just need to get them in the directory you extracted
[12:55] <angry> gotit :)

[12:56] <SHan`> hi
[12:56] <nikin> genii: i see, and how do i get back them?
[12:56] <SHan`> I've installed ut .. but its running too slow
[12:56] <pluma_> Is there a way to set up a program to be executed when the shell (e.g. tty1-6) idles for longer than a minute? Basically like blank, except it runs a program in the foreground (screensaver, basically) rather than blanking the screen.
[12:56] <SHan`> graphics are real slow
[12:57] <angry> A3n:# ./speedtouchconf.sh  what does this mean
[12:57] <pluma_> SHan`: Did you install the OpenGL drivers for your card?
[12:58] <rajiv_nair> pluma_: can ur question be rephrased as "how do i make a screensaver??":D
[12:58] <peace> ??
[12:58] <SHan`> i installed the latest ATI drivers 32 bit
[12:58] <genii> rajiv More like a cronjob of some sort
[12:58] <SHan`> used the graphical installer
[12:58] <pluma_> rajiv_nair: No. My question can be rephrased as "how do I get a better console screensaver thank blank?"
[12:58] <A3n> angry: double click on speedtouchconf.sh
[12:58] <rajiv_nair> console.....srry:d
[12:59] <pluma_> SHan`: Are you sure it's set up correctly? Did you try glxgears?
[12:59] <genii> pluma_  I may be able to assist please hangon
[12:59] <SHan`> pluma_,  no i havent yet
[12:59] <pluma_> genii: It seems to be possible for FreeBSD...
[12:59] <SHan`> pluma_, but i did now.. and i see em
[12:59] <pluma_> SHan`: Slow or normal?
[01:00] <genii> nikin Well I think there likely is not a way to reenter the process once it is detached. You would likely need to kill it from a second session etc
[01:00] <SHan`> pluma_, normal
[01:00] <pluma_> SHan`: are you running Compiz or a similar OpenGL window manager? If so, try running UT in vanilla GNOME.
[01:00] <genii> yes there is usually a rc file for tty or console etc
[01:00] <genii> respawn options etc
[01:00] <nikin> genii: :( than that is no solution for me... ty anyway
[01:01] <SHan`> pluma_, i'm not running UT in anything.. :S
[01:01] <Arastoo> A3n: i was disc , nothing happened
[01:01] <kling0n> quick question for a cvs wizzie out there: how do i do a cvs update that overwrites my own changes?
[01:01] <A3n> Arastoo: huh?
[01:01] <genii> nikin You may be able to specify a shared desktop for X ...vnc had this before and you could have many users fighting over the mouse etc
[01:01] <pluma_> SHan`: Oh, sorry. Mixed up people ^^
[01:01] <SHan`> lol
[01:02] <genii> pluma_ 1 minute trying to find the file you need to put something in brb

[01:04] <SHan`> well.. anyone else?
[01:04] <A3n> gotit:you know how to open terminal right?
[01:04] <pluma_> manmadha: If you want Flash for Firefox, try installing Firefox 2 and then getting the Linux plugin via its "Install missing plugin" dialog, then replace the file with the one from the 9.0 beta for Linux.

[01:06] <shan10> yes i downloaded but dont know how to install firefox 2
[01:06] <gotit> A3n:  i am there
[01:07] <pluma_> genii: Do you know which files I would have to edit to set up a program as screensaver, then?
[01:07] <shan10> some1 pls help me
[01:07] <diogo> No pluma_; When I first installed Firefox2 after an upgrade to edgy, i hadn't installed flash, and this site asked me "no flash detected".
[01:07] <Balachmar> Because at this moment I am trying to install edgy on my new HTPC, but it isn't able to read the HD
[01:07] <A3n> gotit:type 'su' hit enter and type root password
[01:07] <pluma_> shan10: Isn't it an executable? If so, set its permissions (chmod +x filename) and run it.
[01:07] <gotit> it says authentication failure sory
[01:07] <gotit> A3n: *
[01:07] <diogo> It's OK, but after I installed, the message appears anyway, I always have to click "continue anyway" or something and things go fine
[01:07] <shan10> ill try
[01:07] <diogo> but it's just annoying
[01:08] <Balachmar> Says something about hda: ide_intr: huh? expected null handler on exit
[01:08] <genii> pluma_ Sorry.. trying to find something equivelent to ttys setup which has respawn rates etc for each tty but I am currently stumped
[01:08] <gotit> A3n:i didnt creat any accounts
[01:08] <genii> I had to get mgetty previously to run this way
[01:08] <A3n> gotit: change the root password using 'sudo passwd root'
[01:08] <Skyrail> Anyone know of a program that can be installed on ubuntu that can convert .flac files into .ogg files?
[01:09] <A3n> gotit: look at this: http://www.steve-parker.org/speedtouchconf/script.shtml it must say 'root@' in your terminal
[01:09] <biskvitka> how can I install Samba on ubuntu 6.10?
[01:09] <biskvitka> how can I install Samba on ubuntu 6.10?
[01:09] <gotit> A3n: did it
[01:10] <A3n> gotit:does it say 'root@' now ?
[01:10] <gnomefreak> !samba | biskvitka
[01:10] <ubotu> biskvitka: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[01:10] <pluma_> shan10: I think Firefox has a setup which lets you install it automagically in the right places and everything. If so, make sure to run it as root (sudo ./filename). Otherwise, you may need to move it into the right places or try and compile it from source
[01:10] <gnomefreak> biskvitka: please dont repeat like that
[01:10] <gotit> A3n: no
[01:11] <biskvitka> 10x
[01:11] <A3n> gotit:have you set the root password then?
[01:11] <pluma_> diogo: That sounds like a problem of the website, not of you. It probably screws up when trying to determine whether you have Flash. Also, check what version your plugin is -- if it's the normal 6.0 version, the problem may stem from 9.0 being checked for.
[01:11] <gotit> A3n: i changed it but gave it the old one
[01:11] <A3n> gotit: ok try 'su' again
[01:11] <A3n> gotit:with the password u just set
[01:12] <genii> bleh /etc/default/devpts not it but something like it
[01:12] <gotit> A3n: its on the root :)
[01:12] <A3n> gotit ok folow the instructions on here : http://www.steve-parker.org/speedtouchconf/script.shtml
[01:13] <A3n> gotit:but start at the .sh
[01:13] <A3n> gotit:you probably did all the other stuff before that
[01:13] <genii> pluma_ Sorry I can't find it for you :(
[01:13] <pluma_> genii: no worries
[01:14] <gotit> A3n: i dont know
[01:14] <A3n> gotit:you extracted the tar.gz already right?
[01:15] <gotit> A3n: yes
[01:15] <A3n> gotit: wel type "pwd" first in terminal
[01:15] <genii> OK it would likely go in /etc/init.d/console-screen.sh
[01:15] <shan10> the .bin files in linux are usually the equivalent of setup.exe in windows, right?
[01:16] <diogo> pluma_: It's 9.0, just checked. Yes it might be a glitch from the website itself, I was just hoping it wasn't :) Thanks.
[01:16] <A3n> gotit: print out what it says , ok?
[01:16] <shan10> in installing

[01:41] <angry> A3n: leme try again
[01:42] <bigbro> k-osh: Not that I'm aware of. AFAIK, the filesystem is loaded at that point.
[01:42] <Bo1> hey guys.. I've somehow managed to end up with non working audio.. last time I installed it worked fine out of the box.. so I assume it was working this time.. but anyway.. I spent most of the day getting the rest of the stuff on this laptop working.. and just discovered sound is not working.. so I'm loathe to reformat.. plus I've probably jsut done something dumb little.. anyone be able to give me abit of a checklist of things to check ove
[01:42] <bigbro> k-osh: Just make sure you install grub in the right place and put stage 1.5 somewhere it can access, and point at the right place.
[01:43] <new2u> how to login in GUI as root
[01:43] <jerp> why can't the makers of mplayer and vlc make their product capable of watching archived dvd movies.  Archived by 3rd party products such as 123Studios, XCopy, and I Copy DVDS that rip and encode.
[01:44] <k-osh> bigbro: Do you also recall why /boot can't be on an lvm? It does have something to do with contigous blocks, I'm sure of it. And my machine broke after a kernel upgrade... :-/
[01:44] <bigbro> k-osh: LVM abstracts a filesystem - to put /boot on an LVM you'd have to load the LVM filesystem driver prior to finding the kernel.
[01:44] <Arastoo> A3n: the log says C compiler cannot create executables
[01:44] <bigbro> k-osh: So it's almost nothing got to do with contiguous block, or lack thereof, AFAICS.
=== Arastoo is now known as gotit
[01:45] <bigbro> k-osh: I am completely open to correction of course :)
[01:45] <jerp> all of those makers make it capable to watch on a standard stand-alone dvd player that hooks to the television
[01:45] <Varjat_by> new2u: You cann't login as root to system.. You anly can run some programs as root
[01:46] <gotit> A3n: the log says C compiler cannot create executables
[01:46] <A3n> Arastoo: do you have "make" installed and "build-essential" ?
[01:46] <bigbro> new2u: Open up a terminal and run something like   'sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'
[01:46] <ulisse> 'lo people
[01:46] <delight> Varjat_by ... well thats not true ... but its a bad idea to login as root
[01:46] <jerp> new2u, you need to set up root access
[01:46] <gotit> A3n: dont know anything about them :(
[01:46] <delight> true ... just set a password for root
[01:46] <delight> but as said before no good idea
[01:47] <Bo1> just use sudo
[01:47] <echosystm> new2u, sudo -H -s, then startx
[01:47] <delight> to login to system as root
[01:47] <ulisse> is there any known problem using microsoft USB wireless mouse/keyboard with Ubuntu?
[01:47] <olgiata> hi all, i need some help to set the character type in edgy eft: i need to set up ISO 8859-15 but i can't find any option to do this
[01:47] <k-osh> bigbro: You're probably more educated than me in these matters so I'll just trust you.  But if the problem is just the lvm driver couldn't you just load the minikernel with lvm-support and then load the correct kernel? (It's probably not as easy as it sounds or someone would have done it)...
[01:47] <echosystm> ulisse no
[01:47] <echosystm> the only problem is you wont get any of the battery status tools etc.
[01:47] <gotit> A3n: its me angry :)
[01:47] <briquero> good morning
[01:47] <new2u> thanks
[01:47] <echosystm> and some buttons might not work out of the box - gotta set them up manually
[01:48] <bigbro> k-osh: You could put it in the initrd, yes - but why bother? You really don't ever need LVM support for where you're going to put your kernel, IMHO.
[01:48] <echosystm> ie. horizontal scroll etc.
[01:48] <ulisse> echosystm: no problem at all, in that case :) thanks
[01:48] <david83> how difficult is it to connect a system with an Firewire harddisk vs. a USB harddisk is it harder to connect? how can i find out if it's just plug in the hd and it runs?
[01:48] <new2u> how to run programs that run in Windows Xp
[01:48] <gotit> A3n: or Arastoo
[01:48] <briquero> someone use fire fox for brusing?
[01:48] <A3n> gotit:run "apt-get install build-essential"
[01:48] <david83> briquero: yes me why?
[01:48] <echosystm> new2u, you can use wine
[01:48] <jerp> new2u, with a app called Wine
[01:48] <echosystm> BUT
[01:48] <atlef> briquero : yes
[01:48] <echosystm> like, seriously don't bother
[01:49] <k-osh> bigbro: I think i'll go with your solution and shrink and copy though. I was thinking in the same paths myself.
[01:49] <echosystm> most things don't run fantastically
[01:49] <bigbro> k-osh: LVM has a huge number of capabilities - to fit all of them in the mini-kernel would make it not-so-mini - which would mean the initrd would need to be accessible - which might mean someone would like to put it in an LVM, which would mean the boot stage couldn't read it - rinse, repeat :)
[01:49] <echosystm> and it takes a lot of dicking around
[01:49] <A3n> gotit:.. in terminal
[01:49] <echosystm> try and find a linux alternative first
[01:49] <gotit> A3n: it says couldnt find package build
[01:49] <new2u> my printer is not working its Xerox 3117. i have installed its driver but its not printing
[01:49] <jerp> nick, 'linux wine' in google will take you there to the page
[01:49] <A3n> gotit: build-essential
[01:49] <bigbro> david83: Both firewire and USB should just work - assuming the disk is partitioned and formatted with something the OS can read.
[01:49] <olgiata> hi all, could you help me set the character encoding to ISO 8859-15 ? otherwise my italian loacted edgy eft installation wont show me all the charcaters
[01:50] <k-osh> bigbro: sigh.... ok. thanks for the answer. You've been most helpful.
[01:50] <A3n> !build-essential | gotit
[01:50] <ubotu> gotit: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[01:50] <bigbro> k-osh: np :)
[01:50] <[San] > Hey guys
[01:50] <gotit> A3n: yeah build-essential ,
[01:50] <gotit> A3n: it couldnt find it
[01:50] <bigbro> k-osh: You will have to 'reinstall' grub to point at the new location of the stage 1.5, assuming you've moved it.
[01:50] <[San] > is there any way to mount a NTFS drive on a Live CD of Ubuntu 5.10?
[01:50] <A3n> gotit: you have internet in ubuntu right?
[01:50] <bigbro> [San] : Yes - use the mount command.
[01:51] <[San] > was writable though?
[01:51] <gotit> A3n: how could i , i am installing my modem there :)
[01:51] <bigbro> [San] : It will only be mounted read-only though. NTFS writing is not supported under Linux - and will largely NOT be until Microsoft document it and release that documentation.
[01:51] <A3n> gotit: ow ok lol, you have the ubuntu cd there somewhere?
[01:51] <gotit> A3n: yep inserted :)
[01:51] <[San] > I tought there was a patch for it though?
[01:52] <briquero> I have a problem with Fire Fox, it collapse after 15 minutes running. Anyone match the same problem. I use Ubuntu as Operating system.
[01:52] <bigbro> [San] : There are methods of writing to an NTFS formatted drive, but there are many caveats, limitations and it is not something you want to even attempt unless you really REALLY know what you are doing and can afford to lose all the data on the drive.
[01:52] <new2u> Printer not working
[01:52] <bigbro> [San] : IMHO :)
[01:52] <A3n> gotit:does it ask you to open  in synaptic package-manager ?
[01:53] <delight> is the xinerama the right method to expand my laptops view to a external screen ?
[01:53] <gotit> A3n: no :()
[01:53] <[San] > ah, ok. My problem is that I have a drive, which has something like 100bites left on it, and of course, Windows cant see it because it is too full (for some reason) and ubuntu sees and I can read all the files
[01:53] <bigbro> delight: Depends on what release. If it's pre-edgy, yes.
[01:53] <siloe> Hello. What way (directory) to get favorites, in firefox (is old partition)
[01:53] <A3n> gotit: no problem, just open the cd directory
[01:53] <delight> bigbro no its edgy
[01:53] <[San] > I just need a way of deleting one file, or backing all the files up
[01:53] <gotit> A3n: i am there
[01:53] <A3n> gotit: there should be a directory called "peer" or "peers" in it
[01:53] <bigbro> delight: Then there's something else (I've been told) ... but I've not tested it myself.
[01:53] <A3n> gotit: go there
[01:53] <delight> bigbro whats the name ?
[01:54] <gotit> A3n: there where :)
[01:54] <A3n> gotit: to the directory called "peer" or "peers"
[01:54] <bigbro> delight: Don't remember - just asked a friend of mine who was the one who mentioned it to me.
[01:54] <bigbro> delight: All my workstations are either pre-edgy or different distros, so I'm using xinerama.
[01:55] <new2u> :)
[01:55] <A3n> gotit: once there click on "b" => "buid-essential"
[01:55] <gotit> A3n: there is no such directory i searched it
[01:55] <A3n> gotit:on the cd ?
[01:55] <delight> bigbro ... ok ... i will try looking into xinerama and get it working ... i just asked because i also read something about twinview and could not distinguish whats the right method
[01:56] <[San] > Can ubuntu write to fat 32?
[01:56] <gotit> A3n: yeah no such dir on the cd
[01:56] <A3n> gotit: well what directories are there on your cd ?
[01:56] <delight> bigbro meaning the descent method ... thank u so far
[01:56] <bigbro> delight: It might be that twinview is the 'new' thing.
[01:56] <atlef> [San]  : yes
[01:56] <[San] > I think I might be saved then
[01:56] <delight> bigbro .. fine then I'll google both
[01:57] <[San] > thanks... and thank you iRiver H300
[01:57] <[San] > :D
[01:57] <gotit> A3n: i found it , there are two build essential and build essential 11.3 i386.deb
[01:57] <atlef> [San]  : good for you
[01:57] <bigbro> delight: And IIRC he mentioned that xinerama no longer works - but as I say, I've not tested myself.
[01:57] <delight> bigbro .. oh thats not to good info
[01:57] <delight> well I will see ;) .. can give u reports later if you like and still on
[01:58] <phos> hi, just done a nasty upgrade from dapper to edgy
[01:58] <echosystm> god damnit!
[01:58] <echosystm> its doing it again
[01:58] <phos> sorted most of the problems out
[01:58] <echosystm> whenever i install the nvidia drivers
[01:58] <echosystm> i cant exit gnome anymore
[01:58] <bigbro> delight: He's said "Dualview" is the name of the new 'thing'
[01:58] <echosystm> using the menu
[01:58] <echosystm> i have to go via terminal
[01:58] <bigbro> delight: Let me know how you get on with it.
[01:58] <echosystm> wtf?!
[01:58] <phos> though the new linux kernel wont configure as vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 cannot be found
[01:58] <A3n> gotit: copy them to desktop , go in terminal and "cd /home/[username] /Desktop"
[01:58] <phos> any idea how to go about getting this?
[01:59] <delight> bigbro ok ;)
[01:59] <delight> !dualview
[01:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dualview - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:59] <A3n> gotit: then "dpkg -i packagebuildessentialwathever.deb"
[01:59] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, i have the same problem. im thinking ditching nvidia for nv...
[01:59] <gotit> A3n: i just run them from the cd, and now it says installation is finished
[01:59] <echosystm> nolimitsoya
[01:59] <echosystm> what i think we need to do
[01:59] <gotit> A3n: build esential 11.3 was installed
[01:59] <echosystm> is get the nvidia drivers from nvidia
[01:59] <echosystm> rather than from the depositories
[02:00] <[San] > Last question, (I promise) is it possable to transfare files from a read only ntfs drive to a fat32 trive?
[02:00] <[San] > *driv
[02:00] <[San] > e
[02:00] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, what difference would that make? have you tried?
[02:00] <echosystm> im going to try it now
[02:00] <echosystm> after i reinstall
[02:00] <echosystm> :P
[02:00] <bigbro> [San] : Yes - but you will lose file permissions and potentially meta information. You probably might not care about this.
[02:00] <echosystm> removing the nvidia driver
[02:00] <nolimitsoya> [San] , yes. since you can read you can copy
[02:00] <echosystm> and going back to nv
[02:00] <A3n> gotit: good, do that for "make" too
[02:00] <echosystm> didnt fix the problem for me
[02:00] <bigbro> [San] : Also, remember that FAT32 has a 2GB maximum filesize limit, IIRC.
[02:00] <phos> hey, any idea where i could get vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386?
[02:00] <echosystm> so it looks like it really messes with some settings
[02:00] <[San] > ok, thanks for all the help guys
[02:00] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: echosystm are either of you using the 9xxx drivers on edgy or runing compiz/beryl/xgl by chance?
[02:00] <k-osh> bigbro: Sorry to bother you with this lvm-thingy but one thing bothers me. How come it did work flawlessly when I installed it but broke during the upgrade. The problem you described should have been there from the start, shouldn't it?
[02:00] <gotit> A3n: lemme find it first :)
[02:01] <nolimitsoya> [San] , since you can read ext2/3 from windows id suggest using ext2 instead of fat
[02:01] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, no xgl, no
[02:01] <lehaid> why does the "eclipse" package need the "mozilla-browser" package ?!?
[02:01] <rastilin> k-osh, Second, do you mean upgrading from 6.04 to 6.10?
[02:01] <bigbro> k-osh: I'm not sure - I kinda joined the conversation mid-flow - so I don't know what your setup is.
[02:01] <echosystm> im just using the one from apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common
[02:01] <echosystm> whatever that is
[02:01] <[San] > I dont have a choice on what i can use nolimitsoya
[02:01] <bigbro> k-osh: It may be nothing at all to do with LVM.
[02:01] <nolimitsoya> same as echosystm
[02:02] <bigbro> k-osh: But I can guarantee that my described solution will work and will give you a bootable system. There are, of course, other ways of doing it.
[02:02] <gnomefreak> what is it doing when you try to log out?
[02:02] <echosystm> nolimitsoya, are you running ubuntu server or desktop?
[02:02] <k-osh> bigbro: the setup is just one big lvm all over the disk with everything on it.
[02:02] <gotit> A3n: in which directory i should look for make
[02:02] <A3n> gotit: dunno lol
[02:02] <A3n> gotit: probably "m"
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, it kicks me back to gdm instead of rebooting/shuting down. echosystm, cli install with xfce4
[02:02] <lehaid> why does the "eclipse" package need the "mozilla-browser" package ?!? <-- is it a must ?
[02:02] <echosystm> right
[02:02] <echosystm> what packages did you install?
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, so custom desktop, i guess :)
[02:03] <echosystm> yeah same
[02:03] <echosystm> i did server install
[02:03] <k-osh> bigbro: I'm going for your solution right now. I just want to understand some more things about why it broke. It doesn't quite make sense to me.
[02:03] <gnomefreak> lehaid: yes it is removing it from depends screws things up
[02:03] <echosystm> with gnome
[02:03] <lehaid> why is that dep made ?
[02:03] <echosystm> i bet you, it is something to do with x-window-manager-core
[02:03] <lehaid> in windows eclipse doesn't need anything :)
[02:03] <gnomefreak> echosystm: gnome or ubuntu-desktop?
[02:03] <echosystm> or whatever i installed
[02:03] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, gdm xfce4 nvidia-glx (plus all the kernel module stuff)
[02:03] <gotit> A3n: i searched it and it didnt find "make" file
[02:03] <A3n> weird
[02:04] <A3n> well try the .sh again maybe it works now
[02:04] <gotit> A3n: ok
[02:04] <Pie-rate> why can't anything else use sound while World of Warcraft is running?
[02:04] <gnomefreak> echosystm: you and nolimitsoya both installed with server install than installed the gui packages?
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, yes, and everything works fine till i install nvidia-glx
[02:04] <echosystm> nuby the look of things yes
[02:04] <bigbro> k-osh: I generally set systems up with a ~100MB /boot ext2/3, some swap and then, if using LVM, the rest of the disk(s) LVM'ed.
[02:04] <echosystm> ok
[02:04] <echosystm> clearly
[02:04] <echosystm> the server kernel
[02:04] <echosystm> doesnt like it
[02:04] <gnomefreak> i wondering something
[02:04] <echosystm> haha
[02:04] <bigbro> k-osh: Trying to debug issues with semi-virtualised filesystems is a trap :)
[02:05] <phos> any idea what package contains vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386?
[02:05] <gnomefreak> echosystm: and nolimitsoya did either of you install the -desktop packages for your GUI?
[02:05] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, no, just xfce4 and gdm
[02:05] <atlef> phos : linux-image
[02:05] <bigbro> Pie-rate: WoW runs on Ubuntu?
[02:05] <gotit> A3n: sofware configaration success HURRAH
[02:05] <Pie-rate> bigbro: if you use wine, yes
[02:05] <Pie-rate> can alsa only support 1 application at a time?
[02:05] <A3n> gotit: nice going :)
[02:06] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, if it comes to reporting a bug, ill make sure to reproduce the bug with ubuntu-desktop first :) as of right nog, i just want it to work :)
[02:06] <bigbro> Pie-rate: Excellent - that's another reason for me to ditch my Windows partition :)
[02:06] <gotit> A3n: thankyou very much A3n, that was really appriciatable , I dont know how to thank you :()
[02:06] <frogzoo> phos: try: linux-image-2.6.17-10-386
[02:06] <bigbro> Pie-rate: No - ALSA is completely multi-channel, multi-application capable. But WoW / wine may be using OSS / ESD or some other interface - which may be single connection only.
[02:07] <motin> apt-get says packages are held back, preventing upgrade - but how do I find out WHY?
[02:07] <gotit> A3n: you solved the problem , i was askin here for a week
[02:07] <k-osh> bigbro: I get that. Thanks for your patience and help. And I'll do the same now. I had a setup where everything was lvm. Both the rootdisk (everything) and swap. That way I thought I could just change things whenever I wanted. Obviously it doesn't work like that.
[02:07] <phos> frogzoo: says that its already the newest version
[02:07] <luka> hello
[02:07] <phos> so i need to force reinstall i suppos
[02:07] <phos> e
[02:07] <frogzoo> phos: well there ya go
[02:07] <bigbro> k-osh: np :)
[02:07] <Pie-rate> WoW is using OSS
[02:07] <echosystm> i am certain the linux driver will fix our problem nolimitsoya
[02:07] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, but im not running the server kernel :)
[02:07] <gnomefreak> motin: held back packages are held back so you dont break your system normally a depends issue
[02:07] <A3n> gotit: no , you solved it yourself mainly :p
[02:07] <frogzoo> phos: did you configure grub to boot that kernel?
[02:07] <gotit> A3n: wat was that build essential anyway
[02:07] <echosystm> but you have to install some extra packages to get it to work
[02:07] <luka> I'm having some problems with programs I compiled.... I download the source, compiles ok, when I try to use it, it fails.
[02:07] <phos> frogzoo: but vmimage doesnt exist, so the new image wont configure properly
[02:07] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, the driver from nvidia.com should be the same as nvidia-glx
[02:08] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: ? are you sure?
[02:08] <Hannibal> so before I go off telling lots of stuff in here which might be potentially useless, are there known problems with wpa_supplicant in upgrading from dapper to edgy?
[02:08] <echosystm> "should" :P
[02:08] <luka> is there some problem with gcc in ubuntu?
[02:08] <luka> 6.10?
[02:08] <gnomefreak> luka: no
[02:08] <Otacon22> Hi all, I want to unistall xgl to reput aiglx, but when i call apt to do that.... see here please http://rafb.net/paste/results/393lp711.html
[02:08] <HymnToLife> luka, not that I'm aware of, what is the error you get ?
[02:08] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, im sure about what kernel im running, yes. alternate install
[02:08] <gotit> A3n: not without a right direction , cant be done
[02:08] <luka> HymnToLife, wait.. im going to paste the output
[02:08] <A3n> gotit: to be able to make executeables
[02:08] <frogzoo> phos: you mean initrd.img... ?

[02:08] <motin> gnomefreak: thought so, but how do I find out exactly why? ie what depencies are conflicting?
[02:08] <k-osh> bigbro: In IRIX/Solaris and such there aren't any problems with putting everything in virtual filesystems. :-/
[02:08] <usr_rob> Nice that adobe made flashplugin 9 for linux :)
[02:08] <gnomefreak> motin: try to install them
[02:09] <k-osh> bigbro: I thought I could do the same in linux.
[02:09] <gnomefreak> motin: be careful and use apt-gete not aptitude
[02:09] <Pie-rate> so why can't WoW use sound at the same time as adobe flash?
[02:09] <lehaid> how do i get flash 9 to run on my firefox in ubuntu 6.06 ?!?
[02:09] <phos> frogzoo: Internal Error: Could not find image (/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386)
[02:09] <mixo8114> try sudo apt-get install flash
[02:09] <gotit> A3n: do i need to do this every time i am connecting to internet
[02:09] <HymnToLife> lehaid, download it from adope and copy the lib to your firefox plugins dir
[02:09] <motin> gnomefreak: aha - yes when installing one on one there is an explanation..
[02:09] <gnomefreak> lehaid: install it from adobe
[02:09] <motin> gnomefreak: thanks
[02:09] <mixo8114> it'll get the latest one

[02:09] <HymnToLife> adobe*
[02:09] <phos> frogzoo: after aptitude dist-upgrade
[02:09] <nolimitsoya> lehaid, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[02:09] <k-osh> mixo8114: That's probably not flash9. Just flash7
[02:09] <frogzoo> phos: dunno, it should be there
[02:09] <mixo8114> ok
[02:09] <gnomefreak> motin: make sure you dont remove anything you need
[02:10] <lehaid> nolimitsoya, : that will get flash 9 beta 2 ?
[02:10] <echosystm> nolimitsoya, what else did you install?
[02:10] <A3n> gotit: no now it should do it itself each time you restart
[02:10] <phos> frogzoo: lol, yeah i know... very messy upgrade
[02:10] <HymnToLife> k-osh, Flash 9 beta forks perfectly for me
[02:10] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, i can give you the full list on pastebin. mom
[02:10] <mixo8114> try sudo apt-get install flash9
[02:10] <usr_rob> lehaid: Just copy the *.so plugin to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
[02:10] <lehaid> k
[02:10] <gnomefreak> lehaid: no dapper doesnt have flash 9 in repos
[02:10] <nolimitsoya> lehaid, in edgy with backports it will
[02:10] <bigbro> k-osh: It's quite possible you can - but I've not tried it - and there would be significant limiations, as I kinda described earlier.
[02:10] <k-osh> HymnToLife: But it's not in the standard repos yet, is it...
[02:10] <echosystm> ok
[02:10] <HymnToLife> k-osh, so ?
[02:11] <motin> gnomefreak: hmm this is strange. it says 5 packages is going to be removed, but then the same packages are going to be installed again
[02:11] <gnomefreak> motin: python?
[02:11] <bigbro> delight: Apparently my friend made up the word 'DualView' - he actually meant 'TwinView'.
[02:11] <jrib> gnomefreak: flash9 is in dapper-backports
[02:11] <gnomefreak> motin: are they all python packages being held back
[02:11] <gotit> A3n: it says the modem run command failed code 253 modem not foundwhere expected , failed because of moem run error , i think thats because telephone line is currently busy with this windows system
[02:11] <k-osh> HymnToLife: Someone asked about flash9 and was asked to do a aptitude-install. That wouldn't ahve given him/her flash9. Just flash7... That's what.
[02:11] <motin> gnomefreak: nope - mplayer
[02:11] <gnomefreak> jrib: it is?
[02:11] <lehaid> btw, i just checked
[02:11] <echosystm> nolimitsoya, this is what i have: install x-window-system-core gnome-core gdm firefox synaptic xubuntu-system-tools gnome-app-install
[02:11] <lehaid> i have flash 9 on my 6.06
[02:11] <bigbro> delight: I have mocked him and applied appropriate derision ;-)
[02:11] <gnomefreak> motin: go ahead and install it than
[02:11] <lehaid> with flash-nonfree
[02:11] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, gnomefreak, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36044/ <- list of all installed packages
[02:12] <motin> gnomefreak: yeah I will it is just a bit weird behaviour
[02:12] <motin> scary
[02:12] <motin> ooohhhh
[02:12] <A3n> gotit: probably :p
[02:12] <BSDnux> is there any linux software that is capable of converting a primary partition to an extendet one? i heard partition magic can do that, but that's only available for win32 afaik.
[02:12] <luka> HymnToLife, here you go: this is the output http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/5RXqdx63.html
[02:12] <usr_rob> lehaid: download flashplugin 9 here http://www.adobe.com/go/fp9_update_b2_installer_linuxplugin
[02:12] <bigbro> delight: Also, he has now pointed out that it might only be something to do with nVidia chipsets only... http://www.killminus9.net/index.php?article=16#updates
[02:12] <jrib> gnomefreak: yep, ubotu claims so and it is in the Packages.gz for dapper-backports multiverse
[02:12] <k-osh> bigbro: Yep. I get it. Assumption is the mother of all fckups... :-) I should't assume that things would work the same...
[02:12] <echosystm> perhaps it is sopmething to do with the system tools?
[02:12] <echosystm> i think it started for me after installing that
[02:12] <echosystm> :S
[02:12] <boise> bye
[02:12] <gotit> A3n:ok cya than i am trying to logoff here to chech it, is there any manual way from terminal to apply if it does not do it auto

[02:13] <echosystm> not sure why that would affect anything though
[02:13] <nolimitsoya> x restart, bbs
[02:13] <luka> HymnToLife: any Ideas? why would my program fail when its called from within some other script, but if I run it directy I can?
[02:13] <A3n> gotit:cya
[02:13] <gnomefreak> jrib: packages.ubuntu.com says its not
[02:13] <luka> HymnToLife: my program = Omnet++ (its online)
[02:13] <lehaid> i've installed googleearth by hand, how do i remoev it ?
[02:14] <HymnToLife> I guess that's because the other one uses a wrong syntax
[02:14] <gotit> A3n: thanksyou cya
[02:14] <gnomefreak> it says dapper-backports has edgys flashplayier
[02:14] <frogzoo> is there an Edgy DVD image ?
[02:14] <Pie-rate> bigbro: dualview IS a valid nvidia dual screen mode... on Windoze
[02:14] <luka> HymnToLife, this worked on 6.06 (on a previous computer) and it doesn't work on another computer running 6.10
[02:14] <jrib> gnomefreak: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper-backports/web/flashplugin-nonfree ?
[02:15] <gnomefreak> hmmm why wouldnt my search do it
[02:15] <bigbro> Pie-rate: That won't stop me mocking him ;-)

[02:15] <mixo8114> brb
[02:15] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, echosystm, disabling triple buffring seems to have solved things...
[02:16] <echosystm> oh?
[02:16] <gnomefreak> triple buffereing is something to be used with beryl
[02:16] <WAYNE_> I need world of warcraft.......in ubuntu......
[02:16] <gnomefreak> with no beryl why would you have it?
[02:16] <rob> WAYNE_: cedega
[02:16] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, yes, i dont know why that was even enabled >_<
[02:16] <Pie-rate> WAYNE_: appdb.winehq.com
[02:16] <echosystm> how do you disable triple buffering?
[02:16] <echosystm> and more to the point
[02:17] <echosystm> what is tripple buffering? haha
[02:17] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: unless you both used someones /etc/X11/xorg.conf file from someone that ran beryl
[02:17] <jrib> gnomefreak: yeah strange, I put in dapper-backports and it says it searched "edgy"
[02:17] <nolimitsoya> echosystm, look through xorg.conf and put a # before any line containing it
[02:17] <WAYNE_> It's a good idea.......
=== Hannibal_ is now known as Hannibal
[02:17] <rob> either or (cedega/wine), cedega is made specifically for supporting games though and is a bit nicer for it
[02:17] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, nope itsmy own... must have used it for something and forgot about it...
[02:17] <rob> but cedega isn't free, $5/month
[02:17] <echosystm> i made xorg.conf from dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:17] <gnomefreak> echosystm: go into /etc/X11/xorg.conf file where it says triple buffering and change true to false save and restart X
[02:18] <echosystm> using the nv driver
[02:18] <echosystm> i dont understand why tripple buffering would ever be in there?
[02:18] <nolimitsoya> different question: how can i make the firestarter applet start on boot without having to gksudo a password after logon?
[02:18] <gnomefreak> triple buffer is not ever put into your conf file without you doing it by hand
[02:19] <salah> which editor is recommend for php?
[02:19] <luka> HymnToLife: any ideas?
[02:19] <WAYNE_> I can't see the last word here.......
[02:19] <Samuel> #ubuntu-it
[02:19] <WAYNE_> why.....
[02:19] <HymnToLife> luka, nope sorry, that's beyond my knowledge :/
[02:19] <echosystm> then tripple buffering must not be my problem
[02:19] <echosystm> hmm
[02:19] <jrib> nolimitsoya: you know that you don't need firestarter on for the firewall to work?  Firestarter just lets you configure settings
[02:20] <nolimitsoya> jrib, i know, but i like the reporting
[02:20] <luka> HymnToLife, where could I post this? I don't want to switch back to 6.06?
[02:20] <nolimitsoya> jrib, it lets me monitor thing realtime :)
[02:20] <Pie-rate> WAYNE_: first, go to winehq.com, add the repository for ubuntu to synaptic, download wine using synaptic, make sure your 3d drivers are working, copy the World of Warcraft folder from a windows WoW install, change the config file to include "set ffxglow "0"" and "set gxapi "opengl"", run winecfg, click on audio, switch the sound to OSS, then run wine WoW.exe
[02:21] <Hannibal> ok, here's a story. Yesterday evening, I was connecting to the wireless network at my parents (ssid KruitboschWiFi) on a machine I'd recently tried to take to Edgy, but was technically running something half-broken between Dapper and Edgy
[02:21] <Hannibal> it worked. I fixed the half-broken install
[02:21] <WAYNE_> I can't see the last word here.......Like you say:hello~~Wayne. I only can see hello~~way
[02:21] <Hannibal> then ran apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
[02:21] <Richard2me> hello
[02:21] <Hannibal> then went to bed.
[02:21] <Hannibal> this morning, connecting to the same wireless network failed
[02:21] <luka> HymnToLife, acutally I figured out that if I run the program in SH (instead of bash) it breaks
[02:21] <Hannibal> I checked dpkg logs and it upgraded wpa_supplicant
[02:21] <Hannibal> (but not my wifi drivers, madwifi, afaict)
=== arnducky is now known as QuackToJoy
[02:22] <nolimitsoya> Hannibal, if an upgrade borked, just backup and reinstall. itll save you time
[02:22] <Hannibal> the network in question uses WPA-PSK, TKIP
[02:22] <Hannibal> wpa_supplicant output is here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36047/
[02:22] <Hannibal> nolimitsoya: well, in theory, everything is working fine again.
[02:22] <Hannibal> nolimitsoya: and backing up without a cd writer or network connectivity is sort of impossible
[02:23] <WAYNE_> I can't see the last word here.......Like you say:hello~~Wayne. I only can see hello~~way

[02:23] <frogzoo> why is there no DVD for Edgy ???
[02:23] <Hannibal> (I broke the hardware part of my ethernet connection, and it's a laptop)
[02:23] <Hannibal> so I'm doomed to use wireless forever.
[02:23] <Hannibal> *anyway*
[02:23] <Hannibal> I'm wondering why wpa_supplicant is so unhappy
[02:23] <WAYNE_> oh no......If I choose the word......the word start to move.......
[02:24] <Hannibal> this windows xp laptop (shudder) is doing fine in connecting to the same AP, network, etc.
[02:24] <Hannibal> it seems to find the AP fine, too
[02:24] <Hannibal> but then some weird instruction fails and I have no clue what that is or how to fix it :)
[02:24] <WAYNE_> The last question: where can I find the tool:MyEclipse.......I will use it to work tomorrow...
[02:24] <Hannibal> ioctl[IEEE80211_IOCTL_SETMLME] : Operation not supported
[02:24] <nolimitsoya> jrib, thank you, though that wasnt at all what im looking for. :) ive put 'gksudo firestarter' in autostart, but then i (of course) have to type a password on every logon. id like to do away with that :)
[02:24] <Hannibal> like, what? :)
[02:25] <jrib> nolimitsoya: that's what that bug report explains in the comments
[02:25] <echosystm> gnomefreak, what else could cause this problem?
[02:25] <phos> hey, im getting Internal Error: Could not find image (/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386)
[02:25] <WAYNE_> come on~~~
[02:25] <echosystm> i did nvidia-xconfig first
[02:25] <phos> after upgrading
[02:25] <echosystm> then normal xconfig
[02:25] <phos> any idea how i can fix this
[02:25] <echosystm> neither worked
[02:26] <WAYNE_> OHchinese can view very good.....but English.......no
[02:26] <jrib> nolimitsoya: grep for "admin ALL=" and continue reading all the comments after that.  I linked you to the bug, because the usualy answer to your question is, "add the app to sudoers", but firestarter needs more
[02:26] <Hannibal_> though I can't say wifi connectivity is perfect, as you might notice:|
[02:26] <nolimitsoya> jrib, found it, thank you :)

[02:28] <echosystm> i need faster internet :P
[02:28] <WAYNE_> No body help.......
[02:29] <gnomefreak> Hannibal: packages.ubuntu.com download it than install it (whatever version it worked on
[02:30] <frogzoo> atlef: thx m8
[02:30] <Hannibal> gnomefreak: what about dependencies, and how would it cope with the version already installed?
[02:30] <luka> anyone knows why BASH would run a file and SH wouldn't? Ubuntu 6.10
[02:30] <soundray> phos: how are you running now -- live CD?
[02:30] <gnomefreak> Hannibal: remove the one you have installed and on the page you will see the red dots they are the depends you may need. it depends was it an upgrade or was it a dapper > edgy upgrade?
[02:31] <soundray> luka, because /bin/sh links to /bin/dash by default
[02:31] <phos> soundray: running on an old kernel
[02:31] <soundray> luka: change this with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash'
[02:31] <Hannibal> gnomefreak: afaict, it was an upgrade after going to edgy
[02:31] <A3n> why isnt my internet working ? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36040/
[02:31] <soundray> phos: does /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 exist?
[02:31] <WAYNE_> 
[02:31] <Hannibal> but I'm not sure anymore, since I don't know how broken the dapper->edgy upgrade really was.
[02:31] <phos> soundray: no
[02:32] <WAYNE_> Thank you
[02:32] <phos> soundray: and i dont know how to get it
[02:32] <WAYNE_> see you~~~
[02:32] <phos> as all the packages seem up to date

[02:33] <nolimitsoya> *it to a usb flash
[02:33] <gnomefreak> Hannibal: you would need to use a pc with a net connection download it to a disk/usb drive or something than try to install it no it wont grab depends for you withotu a net connection
[02:33] <espenel> Hello
[02:34] <nolimitsoya> Hannibal, you could check depends beforehand and put them on that same usb flash as well, installing them first

After putting the password in, it let me connect to the network - but in some kind of partial way - so even when I manually set an IP address, it wouldn't actually talk to the net.

[02:48] <jrib> cmweb: ok, see the beginning? d means directory, rwx is for the owner, r-x is for the group and, the last r-x is for others.  You group odes no have write permissions
[02:48] <soundray> gnomefreak: ls -l $(which mplayer) returns -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8212848 2006-10-13 02:25 /usr/bin/mplayer

[02:50] <cmweb> jrib so 775
[02:50] <HymnToLife> gbw, to use mplayer from console, you need to tell it the file you want to play
[02:50] <jrib> cmweb: yes
[02:50] <gbw> gnomefreak, oh you are right, there is one there
[02:51] <gbw> HymnToLife, it is a liitle bit complicated, since i want to play m3u file, which has such contents http://pastebin.ca/272985
[02:51] <wilstar> does anyone have problems with spamd?
[02:51] <unimatrix9> where can i find ubuntu packages?

[02:53] <gnomefreak> my mplayer opens fine
[02:53] <gbw> gnomefreak, yes, i see the title Totem Media Player
[02:53] <unimatrix9> let me ask again, i got edgy install, now everything is ok, ecept for the fonts in audacity wich are plain ugly...
[02:53] <xdx> why i got that error when i want to play a movie with mplayer: request audio codec family. afm=mp3lib not available ?
[02:54] <gnomefreak> gdb: what does help>about say?
[02:54] <gbw> Totem Movie Player 2.16.2
[02:54] <unimatrix9> and i cant change that, unless i got an package that his hte newer audacity for edgy
[02:54] <gnomefreak> xdx: you dont have mp3 codecs by the looks of it
[02:54] <unimatrix9> wich i hope will solve this issue
[02:54] <HymnToLife> gbw, try 'gmplayer' from command line to launch the mplayer GUI
[02:54] <epod> Anyone know how I can change my default media player to mplayer?

[02:55] <frandavid100> is it safe to remove the autouninstallable packages in synaptic?
[02:55] <Hannibal> wifi on this xp machine is pretty much a disaster too, but I can't be bothered to fix that since it ain't mine.
[02:55] <unimatrix9> is there some one over here that has audacity installed on edgy and has got bad fonts on this program too?
[02:55] <gbw> now, has anybody experience playing stream from .m3u which has .nsv url?
[02:55] <jrib> frandavid100: what packages exactly?
[02:55] <Hannibal> anyway...
[02:55] <unimatrix9> who has edgy in this room?
[02:56] <HymnToLife> nobodyt, we're all using Hoary

[02:57] <Hannibal> * :), even
[02:58] <unimatrix9> my problem, ok , audacity has terrible fonts when running on egdy,
[02:58] <richee> unimatrix9: only audacity ?
[02:58] <unimatrix9> yes
[02:58] <richee> ok
[02:59] <unimatrix9> you got it right
[02:59] <jrib> Is there a way to make synaptic do something similar to 'apt-get autoremove'?
[02:59] <richee> unimatrix9: not idea, I use msttcorefonts for my whole desktop
[02:59] <unimatrix9> so i was wondering if every one has this on edgy and audacity
[02:59] <unimatrix9> ps ; got the fonts you mentioned too
[02:59] <chugga> do you cats have VLC?
[02:59] <richee> unimatrix9: hmmm
[02:59] <gnomefreak> jrib: not sure never seen anything that would do that in synaptic
[02:59] <richee> unimatrix9: which fonts?
[03:00] <unimatrix9> richee, you run edgy?
[03:00] <Hannibal> hrm. So suppose I wanted to run a dist-upgrade, since synaptic has finally found out that I'm actually still missing a bunch of packages since it thinks I'm still on dapper
[03:00] <assasukasse> i have another problem, on a machine which has ubuntu i need to install also winxp, but it hangs during installation..maybe doesnt like reiserfs partitions, what can i do
[03:00] <richee> unimatrix9: yes edgy
[03:00] <richee> unimatrix9: on my laptop
[03:00] <atlef> unimatrix9 : that was really ugly, i must say
[03:00] <unimatrix9> would you be so kind and try audacity on your machine
[03:00] <Hannibal> however, I want to hold back the wpa_supplicant package
[03:00] <unimatrix9> is it the same thing?
[03:00] <epod> assasukasse, XP insists on being on the first partition on the drive, if I recall correctly.
[03:00] <richee> unimatrix9: hang on...let me check for you
[03:00] <Hannibal> what would be the easiest way to do that?
[03:00] <unimatrix9> thnx
[03:01] <assasukasse> epod it is the first partition
[03:01] <HymnToLife> assasukasse, had the same poroblem too, only solution I found is to wipe the drive out completely and reinstall XP furst
[03:01] <gnomefreak> brb i think you need to look for settings for font in audicy if its not using system fonts
[03:01] <assasukasse> HymnToLife that sucks...i don't want to do that..
[03:01] <DiscoStu> surely vista won't have that problem ..
[03:02] <unimatrix9> maybe there is an other program then audacity that does just about the same?
[03:02] <unimatrix9> that could be an solution too

[03:33] <NeverMore1> mypapit i suppose is because reiserfs
[03:33] <new2u> my printer is identified correct . but it does not work
[03:34] <eseu> I'm currently using Parallels for Windows/Linux, and I was wondering is the current kernal at 2.4 or 2.6?
[03:34] <enyc> basvg: the real problem is the ipod is not a generica portable audio player. the firmware needs/wants the itunes database thing nonsense and it wont play normal vorbis(.ogg) files
[03:34] <lixx> hi
[03:34] <ssam> basvg, have you checked if the ipod plugin is enabled in rhythmbox music player
[03:34] <basvg> I'll follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto first..
[03:35] <basvg> ssam: no, I just expected to see a pop-up saying that I can drag 'n drop mp3s to my ipod ;)
[03:35] <A3n> whats "depmod -a" for?
[03:35] <epod> I have a weird issue with frostwire being totally blank when I'm running Beryl.  Anyone know how I might fix that?

[03:38] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[03:38] <Karthi1> tell me how to get that

[03:42] <nicola> instead of mounting the whole window  partition I'd like to mount just a directory. is it possible ?
[03:42] <nicola> I tryed /dev/hdb1/audio/ /home/nicola/mp3/ ntfs umask=0222 0 0
[03:42] <benny99> how can I disable the agpgart module to load at startup ??
[03:42] <nicola> but there's some problem
[03:42] <LjL> nicola: no
[03:42] <epod> umarmung, hm no dice.  Still blank.
[03:42] <A3n> islsm is preventing me to be able to configure my wireless with ndiswrapper
[03:42] <nicola> ockei LjL , thanks
[03:42] <LjL> nicola: /dev/hdb1/audio/ makes no sense, /dev/hdb1 is a file (specifically, a device node), not a directory
[03:43] <benny99> how can I disable the agpgart module to load at startup ??
[03:43] <nicola> so it's impossible to mount a specific directory, righ ?
[03:43] <LjL> nicola: that i know of, yes, it's impossible. you could always mount the entire drive and make a symlink to the wanted directory though, no?
[03:44] <nicola> you're right
[03:44] <nicola> thanks
[03:44] <A3n> how do i unload a module *forever* ?
[03:44] <richee> Karthi1: apt-cache search xine
[03:44] <A3n> i cant load ndiswrapper successfully because stupid prism54 with islsm is always in the way
[03:44] <richee> Karthi1: or use synaptic
[03:44] <Regnus> does Ubuntu server install GNOME by default?  I've installed desktop before, but last night I installed server for the first time and it looks like it is CLI only?
[03:45] <Terminus> Regnus: yes, it's CLI only.
[03:45] <erUSUL> Regnus: right, a server does not need gui
[03:45] <codo> why is gnome rendering horrible after installing kubuntu :( ?
[03:45] <escargot> Hello. I'm having trouble starting the installation. When I boot from the CD, the installer shows a beige screen and a weirdly distorted-looking window in the middle (looks like it has lines running through it). But I can't click or do anything. Could someone help me if you have time, please?
[03:45] <codo> anybody has an idea ?
[03:45] <LjL> codo: probably because of the gtk2-qt wrapper
[03:45] <codo> so how to i restore the previous rendering :( ?
[03:45] <codo> i hate the way it is looking now
[03:46] <codo> gnome
[03:46] <erUSUL> A3n: blacklist it... /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist*
[03:46] <air0day> Hey... The autoupdate thing upgraded a bunch of stuff on my machine and now everything is screwed up. aiglx and beryl don't work right anymore, gnome itself is behavng oddly. the whole system is a mess visually. is there any way to rollback to the last version of the packages that were installed?
[03:46] <sindrum> escargot: what is your gpu?
[03:46] <LjL> codo: go into KDE, run System Settings, go to Appearance (under Look and Feel), GTK Styles and Fonts, and unselect the various "Use my KDE style"
[03:46] <escargot> sindrum: Nvidia 7800
[03:46] <codo> cool.
[03:46] <codo> :)
[03:47] <A3n> erUSUL:so i just add it in blacklist and it wont load ever again?
[03:47] <Malfist> Hello, I have a question about using java
[03:47] <erUSUL> A3n: that's the idea (of blacklisting it)
[03:47] <we2by> guys, when editing files over ftp, I can save. any fix for this?
[03:48] <Malfist> when I try to run a jar using java -jar name.jar it says Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bunnies/Main
[03:48] <we2by> I'm using gedit and mounted a ftp account over my lan
[03:48] <A3n> erUSUL: cant i just somehow totaly delete it?
[03:48] <sindrum> escargot: Did you try running it in safe graphics?
[03:48] <erUSUL> A3n: you will get it back the next time you upgrade the kernel package...
[03:49] <sindrum> escargot: Dont no if that will matter wortha try
[03:49] <escargot> sindrum: no, because I can't use my keyboard on the selection screen. I have to wait 30 seconds, then it starts the installer...
[03:49] <escargot> sindrum: But I don't know if that's an ubuntu problem. It's a USB keyboard.
[03:49] <codo> my bad .. can you paste it again ? LjL ?
[03:49] <LjL> codo: go into KDE, run System Settings, go to Appearance (under Look and Feel), GTK Styles and Fonts, and unselect the various "Use my KDE style"
[03:49] <A3n> erUSUL: ok i'll just blacklist all the islsm and prism54 shit
[03:49] <ubuuuu> sindrum: can u help on printer! I cant understand why my printer is not printing ! please reply
[03:49] <codo> Danke! :)
[03:50] <LjL> codo: if that fails, you could perhaps try just removing the gtk2-engines-gtk-qt package
[03:50] <codo> okay
[03:50] <sindrum> ubuuu: probably not. what is your printer?
[03:50] <cjuner> Hi there... I got a problem with XDMCP using GDM. It works locally but not over network. Trying to connect from another computer I only get an empty screen with a cursor. What can I do?
[03:50] <air0day> firefox won't start up normally anymore either. these updates COMPLTELY destroyed my system. how do i roll back?
[03:50] <ubuuuu> sindrum: i m using Xerox phaser 3117! i m new2u
[03:51] <sindrum> Ohh right that one
[03:51] <LjL> air0day: no, you can't roll back automatically. and it isn't easy manually, either
=== thorian is now known as diogosales
=== diogosales is now known as diogo
[03:51] <sindrum> na sorry. check over at ubuntu forums there good at helping out if not here
[03:51] <air0day> LjL, how do i do it manually then?  I have no choice.  The system is unusuable.  if I can't roll back, I'm wiping ubuntu and putting windows back on.  This is garbage.
[03:51] <ubuuuu> OK! sindrum wats the link
[03:52] <LjL> air0day: note that if you have Beryl and stuff installed and their repositories enabled, those messy updates probably didn't come from the Ubuntu repositories, but from the repositories of those things
[03:52] <sindrum> ubuuu: http://ubuntuforums.org/
[03:52] <air0day> beryl and the like isnt what got updated, xserver and a bunch of gnome stuff did
[03:52] <LjL> air0day: if you are willing to put your system into the hands of third party repositories, that possibly contain experimental stuff (and labelled as such), yes, they can make your system garbage
[03:53] <basvg> crap, banshee doesn't see the ipod
[03:53] <air0day> okay, how do i check what repositories my stuff came from?
[03:53] <LjL> air0day: remove the packages that were updated, unselect the repositories (edgy-updates, whatever) they came from, and install them again
[03:53] <LjL> air0day: "apt-cache policy packagename"
[03:54] <air0day> okay hang on
[03:54] <air0day> i have to start the terminal program
[03:54] <air0day> it takes about 2 minutes to come up now
[03:54] <LjL> air0day: that will probably mean you'll be left without an X server and GNOME and all after you uninstall them, though, so you'll have to install them back using only a textmode terminal
[03:56] <air0day>  500 http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy-updates/main Packages
[03:56] <air0day> is that the third party unsafe one?
[03:56] <LjL> air0day: no, that's an ubuntu repository
[03:56] <A3n> erUSUL: cant i rmmod prism54 ?
[03:56] <air0day> okay then
[03:56] <apokryphos> air0day: the ubuntu.com is a clue :P
[03:57] <A3n> instead of blacklist
[03:57] <air0day> thats what i thought
[03:57] <A3n> you know what i'll do both
[03:57] <air0day> that means, these updates came from the official repo
[03:57] <LjL> air0day: can you obtain a list of all packages that were updated?
[03:57] <air0day> not some third party one
[03:57] <air0day> ljl, yeah, im looking at it right now
[03:57] <LjL> air0day: yes, though they could still conflict with third party stuff possibly
[03:57] <air0day> beryl is not running on the system ljl
[03:57] <air0day> i had to kill it to make the system run at all
[03:58] <LjL> air0day: so the symptoms right now are, exactly?
[03:58] <air0day> 1. all of my programs take forever to start up. starting the terminal takes about 2 minutes now
[03:58] <kira> Hi all! Some body has the same phenomenon like me? Ubuntu 6.06 WLAN Card detectet all right, Card findes the ESSID it is the right WeP Key but i can get network connection?
[03:58] <air0day> 2. starting firefox is impossible. if the window ever comes up, it has no controls on it, and it cannot be used
[03:58] <kira> hi
[03:58] <air0day> 3. ktorrent adds its system tray icon to my desktop in the upper left corner, rather than the tray
[03:59] <hoelk__> kira: have a similar problem, thoug only tested it in a network without wep
[03:59] <air0day> and 4, WHEN BERYL IS RUNNING (which it is not right now) things are all wacky and nothing works right
[03:59] <hoelk__> didnt find any solution till now though
[03:59] <hoelk__> :(
[03:59] <air0day> meaning, shadows blink on and off, the caption bar wont drag, min/max/X buttons are missing, etc
[04:00] <LjL> air0day: sounds irritating enough. let's forget about Beryl for a moment... slow starting of programs is weird. do text-mode programs also take long to start?
[04:00] <raghu206> i am using edgy when i turnoff the system the process is going well but atlast i shud manually turnoff the powerbutton why so ?
[04:00] <kira> is there a better tool the then networkadmin of gnome?
[04:00] <Daynah> I just moved in with someone who has a logitech mouse, and so do I. The mice are interfering. We can't figure out how to reset them so they're sync up to the right computers. Does anyone know how? (I have a mediaplay, I don't know what he has)
[04:00] <air0day> no, text mode stuff seems fine
[04:01] <LjL> air0day: can you pastebin the list of updated packages? (though i'm using KDE, so i'm not sure i can be of too much help)
[04:01] <bic> giorno a tutti
[04:01] <LjL> !it | bic
[04:01] <ubotu> bic: Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[04:01] <air0day> what is pastebin?
[04:01] <bic> ^^
[04:01] <LjL> Ubotu, tell air0day about pastebin | air0day, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:01] <air0day> no, i cannot use pastebin
[04:02] <air0day> because i cannot launch a web browser.
[04:02] <codo> hmm better now
[04:02] <codo> but still uglier :(
[04:02] <codo> slightly
[04:02] <codo> LjL If i remove that wrapper
[04:02] <codo> KDE looks will suffer ?
[04:02] <LjL> air0day: well, you could install Dillo or something. but just paste in a query with me
[04:02] <codo> you suggested removing a package right ?
[04:02] <LjL> codo: no, KDE apps will still look fine
[04:02] <tom47> kira hoelk this helped me through my probs https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager?highlight=%28manager%29%7C%28network%29

[04:06] <air0day> my hunch is the libgtk* packages screwed up the slow-running program stuff, and *xorg screwed up beryl
[04:06] <willskills> and the only way to do it is by /dev/sda
[04:06] <willskills> and I dont know what my headset is

[04:09] <air0day> my system is hosed. why did these packages get made public?
[04:10] <frogzoo> air0day: ordinarily a package can't hose your system - very strange behaviour
[04:11] <we2by> looks like my gnomepanle just hang
[04:11] <we2by> :(
[04:11] <air0day> this is really frustrating.. im trying so hard to switch to linux permanently, in spite of a multitude of problems with it, most of which have been related to something linux is supposed to be good at (file networking), but i kept with it... now this happens
[04:12] <air0day> i feel like linux is actively pushing me back to windows
[04:12] <roler> how do I get metacty's composite manager to work?
[04:12] <nolimitsoya> air0day, what has happend, exactly?
[04:13] <air0day> nolimit: upgraded a bunch of packages and it completely hosed the system. its unusable right now. i cant even start a web browser
[04:13] <nolimitsoya> air0day, upgraded how? define hosed. :)
[04:14] <LjL> nolimitsoya: GUI applications are extremely slow to start up, and some show strange behaviors (Firefox doesn't start, and doesn't show GUI controls even when it does starts; KTorrent puts tray icon outside of the tray) - this after an automatic update as described at  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36054/
[04:14] <air0day> upgraded by clicking the orange star in my tray and saying "install"
[04:14] <tom47> airOday were you only using official ubuntu repositories?
[04:14] <Daynah> holy cow. I cannot use a mouse ><  does anyone know how to fix the crosstalk between a Logitech Mediaplay mouse and a Logitech Mx1000?
[04:14] <Evdawg> yo; noob question: i wiped my windows partition and reformatted it reiserfs, how do i mount it with full acces for normal users WITHOUT editing /etc/fstab?
[04:15] <nolimitsoya> air0day, id say something has gone terribly wrong...
[04:15] <air0day> tom47: i have beryl installed, but thats not what got upgraded
[04:15] <nolimitsoya> air0day, beryl is experimental
[04:15] <LjL> my suggestion was to try a downgrade using the command line at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36056/ , but somehow i'm not optimistic on this
[04:15] <Johansson> http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=2487095
[04:15] <Johansson> any idea with that?
[04:15] <LjL> nolimitsoya: he doesn't have Beryl running right now though
[04:15] <air0day> nolimit: thats fine, which is why i disabled it
[04:16] <air0day> i think its still running aiglx though
[04:16] <air0day> could that be the problem?
[04:16] <Daynah> air0day: did you do anything to your system before you upgraded? Or was it the rare-as-a-unicorn clean install, you didn't change a thing?
[04:16] <nolimitsoya> air0day, are the packages fully configured? what happens if you try 'sudo apt-get -f install'?
[04:16] <cjuner> Hi there... I got a problem with XDMCP using GDM. It works locally but not over network. Trying to connect from another computer I only get an empty screen with a cursor. What can I do?
[04:16] <dfcarney> Evdawg: type "man mount" to read about the mount command.  You'll also want to read up on file permissions (in order to allow normal users to read/write from it).
[04:16] <Sandman32> did you install aiglx as a different session?  If so reboot, and choose a different session when you log back in
=== igor is now known as igcek
[04:16] <nolimitsoya> air0day, are you still running accelerated, or vesa?
[04:16] <air0day> daynah: ive been using the system for a month, so ive changed all sorts of stuff. however,  i hadnt changed anything in weeks, then did this upgrade, then got hosed
[04:16] <air0day> sand: ive rebooted twice
[04:16] <air0day> nolimit: i have no idea
[04:17] <Sandman32> did you choose a different session on reboot?
[04:17] <air0day> i went with the same session i always run
[04:17] <nolimitsoya> air0day, check :) since you have an xserver upgrade there, id think youre in vesa right now
[04:17] <air0day> i don't know what you're talking about nolimit, where do i check that
[04:17] <LjL> air0day: grep vesa /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:17] <nolimitsoya> air0day, check /etc/X11/xorg.conf, or run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[04:17] <dabaR> can I chat to people using skype through ekiga?
[04:17] <tom47> airOday have you checked, using top, what is using yr resources?
[04:18] <air0day> the grep doesnt return anything
[04:18] <Daynah> air0day: a long long time ago, I tried to install something or another with my mouse (this mouse gives me issues, as you see) then, like two months later, there was an update to the file I attempted to mess with (I didn't even accomplish what I meant to, and I THOUGHT I had reverted back) some big huge deal happened. It was bad.
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> tom47, lets do one thing at a time, should we :)
[04:19] <air0day> i ran dpkg-reconfigure and its hanging in the terminal
[04:19] <air0day> is it a gnome app?
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> air0day, no, its a cli app
[04:19] <air0day> tom: my resources are almost nothing.
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> air0day, hanging is it? did you do the 'sudo apt-get install -f'?
[04:20] <air0day> oh, of course. sudo apt-get install -f... when do i runt his?
[04:20] <nolimitsoya> now, in a terminal
[04:20] <kuja> How can I change the behavior or update-grub to not add hdd as the root, but instead add hdb?
[04:20] <kuja> Because hdd is NOT my root.
[04:20] <kuja> s/or/of/
[04:20] <nolimitsoya> kuja, /etc/fstab
[04:20] <air0day> okay what am i looking at it to do?
[04:20] <dabaR> kuja: so it does hd(4,X)?
[04:20] <nolimitsoya> air0day, press enter and see what falls out :)
[04:21] <kuja> nolimitsoya: Okay, what do I do in /etc/fstab?
[04:21] <air0day> libgpgme6
[04:21] <kuja> dabaR: No, it does root=/dev/hdd2, when it should be root=/dev/hdb2
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> kuja, sudo nano /etc/fstab <- now change the / mount to the partition you want
[04:21] <kuja> nolimitsoya: I already did.
[04:21] <nolimitsoya> kuja, then reboot
[04:21] <dabaR> kuja: in menu.lst?
[04:21] <kuja> nolimitsoya: I never had a problem booting (I just had to alter the GRUB line)
[04:22] <kuja> I want to change the root device that GRUB finds.
[04:22] <air0day> libgpgme6 is the only thing it mentions
[04:22] <kuja> err, update-grub finds
[04:22] <minimec> Hi folks. Anyone of using imwheel? unfortunally the #imwheel channel is empty.
[04:22] <kuja> nolimitsoya: If I reboot, will update-grub see it as hdb?
[04:22] <saladin> i have been struggling for the past few weeks trying to install ubuntu. this will be my last week trying unless someone can help me. the error i am getting is "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"
[04:22] <nolimitsoya> kuja, i dont follow you... do you have several installed systems?
[04:22] <kuja> Yes, I do.
[04:22] <nolimitsoya> air0day, getting anywhere?
[04:22] <dabaR> saladin: your installation fails?
[04:22] <kuja> The problem of this occurred because I installed Ubuntu while my harddrives were on the second IDE cable.
=== morphir_ is now known as morphir
[04:23] <LjL> air0day: apt-get -f install? it shouldn't mention *anything*, unless you have broken packages. run it again and see if it still complains
=== Sakarias__ is now known as Sakarias
[04:23] <air0day> nolimit? what? i ran the thing you said and told you what it spit out...
[04:23] <dabaR> kuja: grub reads the /boot/grub/menu.lst file, afaik.
[04:23] <air0day> The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
[04:23] <air0day>   libgpgme6
[04:23] <kuja> dabaR: Yes, now what does update-grub read?
[04:23] <nolimitsoya> air0day, i was asking if it fixed anything :)
[04:23] <air0day> no
[04:23] <kuja> I need to change whereever it's getting hdd from to hdb
[04:23] <air0day> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[04:23] <Daynah> Does anyone know how to help me reset my mouse :( it's getting cross talk and I can't control it
[04:23] <LjL> air0day: ah, nevermind, that one is alright actually
[04:23] <dabaR> kuja: the man page does not talk about it?
[04:23] <saladin> yes with the above error.  i googled this error and even found this to be a known bug on the ubuntu website,but no one can say what the solution is. just hit and miss
[04:23] <kuja> dabaR: I've been searching for an hour (and I've read the man page)
[04:24] <air0day> oh wait
[04:24] <air0day> what the shit
[04:24] <kuja> I figured this must be some Ubuntu-specific update-grub thing.
[04:24] <frogzoo> kuja: /boot/grub/menu.lst
[04:24] <minimec> so my question is about @priority in .imwheelrc I would like to have some mouse buttons in irssi, but this is not working as I want.
[04:24] <air0day> firefox just started
[04:24] <dabaR> kuja: afaik also, it should also not read device nodes, but devices
[04:24] <air0day> in a reasonable amount of time
[04:24] <kuja> frogzoo: Yes, I know what it is, grr
[04:24] <kuja> frogzoo: Read carefully: I want to change the default hdd that update-grub generates to make it generate hdb from now on.
[04:24] <nolimitsoya> air0day, day tro 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall xorg xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-input-all xutils x11-common xbase-clients && sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[04:24] <frogzoo> kuja: that's where update-grub gets the device name
[04:24] <air0day> ktorrent, however, appeared for one second and then died
[04:25] <kuja> menu.lst isn't very helpful in that department.
[04:25] <frogzoo> kuja: yes it is
[04:25] <air0day> E: Couldn't configure pre-depend x11-common for xserver-xorg, probably a dependency cycle.
[04:25] <dabaR> frogzoo: actually, it writes that file...
[04:25] <LjL> dependency cycle? nice
[04:25] <dabaR> kuja: when you run update-grub, do you have hdd mounted as root? you need to chroot, then.
[04:25] <nolimitsoya> kuja, wich drive is hdb or hdd depends on where it is connected. things could be just right the way they are. if you dont have severalinstalls on diffrent drives, and it boots ok, you shouldnt change anything
[04:25] <kuja> frogzoo: So where is it?
[04:26] <frogzoo> kuja: look for a line with 'kopt='
[04:26] <ValMarko> How can I change from Gnome desktop to KDE desktop?
[04:26] <air0day> ktorrent is starting normally now too
[04:26] <air0day> what the hell did install -f do?
[04:26] <kuja> frogzoo: Do I edit the comment-looking directive of it? Or do I add one without a hash?
[04:26] <gop> !kde
[04:26] <ubotu> KDE (http://kde.org) is the K Desktop Environment. To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop", or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE for other ways to get KDE
[04:26] <Daverocks> ValMarko: have you installed kde?
[04:26] <LjL> air0day: nothing
[04:26] <dabaR> ValMarko: you install kubuntu-desktop, and choose from gdm.
[04:26] <LjL> air0day: can you exclude hardware problems? i.e. bad RAM, bad HD...?
[04:26] <nolimitsoya> LjL, counsil here, would you think itd be a good idea to flush (--purge) xorg, and autoremove, to then reinstall ubuntu-desktop?
[04:26] <saladin> can anyone me with my question ?
[04:27] <wheels3572> How can I change my time in Xubuntu It seems to not to wanna click when I click on the time in the panel
[04:27] <ShereKhan> Hello, please help me, what is the name for a channel for absolute begginer with Ubuntu and Linux
[04:27] <air0day> ljl: the timing of my problems combined with the timing of the upgrades makes the upgrades the obvious culprit
[04:27] <ValMarko> From synaptic. Where do I go to change it?
[04:27] <wheels3572> Is there  a CLI command to change the time and date that way tha twill bring up a GUI?
[04:27] <dabaR> saladin: what cd do you have? the desktop? have you tried alternate?
[04:27] <LjL> nolimitsoya: i think it could be worth trying, but perhaps not right now, since it'll take quite long. i think i'd try other routes first
[04:27] <frogzoo> kuja: leave the comment in - that's needed for how it works - just set the root=  to whatever
[04:27] <dfcarney> saladin: at the end of one of those googled sites, someone claims to have the answer in that they state that Grub has been improperly setup (re: the swap partition).  Did you see that?
[04:27] <Sandman32> Val-marko: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop   Then restart, on the bottom left you will have sessions, choose kubuntu
[04:27] <air0day> programs are starting normally now, and i have no idea why
[04:27] <dabaR> wheels3572: your gui does not start cause of wrong time and date?
[04:27] <kuja> frogzoo: Thank you. I will try that.
[04:28] <wheels3572> dabaR, Yeah the GUI for the clock itself I cant access
[04:28] <saladin> dabaR:will that make a difference
[04:28] <LjL> nolimitsoya: like a memtest and perhaps using VESA, and also a run of debsums to see if any files might be corrupted
[04:28] <gop> !time
[04:28] <kuja> frogzoo: Yes, that's what it was. It was the "commented" kopt.

[04:28] <kuja> I would have never figured.
[04:28] <dabaR> wheels3572: date changes time. I forget the syntax... something like sudo date -S "Jan 4, 2005"
[04:29] <dabaR> wheels3572: -s
[04:29] <LjL> air0day: it would help if you were able to pastebin stuff to us. if your firefox still can't run reliably, can you try "sudo apt-get install dillo" (that's a lightweight web browser that will hopefully work)?
[04:29] <air0day> i have firefox working now
[04:29] <air0day> what do you want me to paste?
[04:29] <dabaR> saladin: it may, you used the desktop CD?
[04:29] <kuja> frogzoo: Thank you.
[04:29] <saladin> dabaR:yes
[04:30] <LjL> air0day: nothing for now. what i suggest is "sudo apt-get install debsums", then "debsums -v OK", and pastebin the output of that
[04:30] <air0day> whoa! beryl is working normally now too
[04:30] <air0day> seriously, install -f didnt do anything at all?
[04:30] <LjL> air0day: sorry, bad command. i meant "debsums | grep -v OK"
[04:30] <dabaR> saladin: try the other one, if you want, no harm in trying, you said you spent quite a bit of time on it already. dfcarney maybe has a point too..
[04:30] <LjL> air0day: from what you've said it output, i'd say no
[04:30] <air0day> well.. im very confused then
[04:30] <randytuggle> how can i successfully instal wine on 6.10?
[04:30] <LjL> air0day: you didn't execute my command line for downgrading, did you?
[04:30] <air0day> everything is behaving correctly now
[04:31] <air0day> ljl: no
[04:31] <LjL> air0day: well, it's precisely the fact that the problems are so intermittent that makes me think you could have something with the hardware
[04:31] <nolimitsoya> air0day, install -f should have tryed to fix any problem you where having with incomplete installations. are you sure the only output was what you said?
[04:31] <air0day> well, i dont think so
[04:31] <air0day> what was it
[04:31] <wheels3572> hmmmmmmmm
[04:31] <air0day> nolimit: pretty sure
[04:31] <LjL> air0day: can't paste it here, it is long. it was the very long one i pasted in a query to you
[04:31] <air0day> ljl: i really, really, really doubt its hardware
[04:31] <LjL> air0day: this one http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36056/
[04:31] <LjL> air0day: but don't run it anyway
[04:31] <air0day> oh that. no, i didnt do that
[04:32] <LjL> air0day: well do the debsums thing for now, "sudo apt-get install debsums ; debsums | grep -v OK", that will tell us if there's any corrupted files

[04:36] <Sandman32> air0day sometimes that happens to me, but if I right click on the beryl icon and choose reload window manager it fixes it

[04:40] <ryanpg> LjL, 1 didn't work and 2 reports: "This module is already enabled!"
[04:40] <LjL> tom47: probably not. some FAILED are normal (not sure why, probably the files get modified by postinst scripts...), and unfortunately there are a few packages that come with no checksums

[04:49] <dfcarney> saladin: sorry for all of the questions; i'm just trying to narrow things down
[04:49] <tom47> !ubuntuguide
[04:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntuguide - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:49] <j0wbl4ck> u have links, books etc?
[04:49] <johndoetje> search google for 'ubuntu guide'
[04:49] <saladin> dfcarney: no , i just download knoppix and i am going to try that.the problem is i was so happy with dapper and this issue is forcing me to another distro
[04:49] <treepio> LjL: thanks, just I can't see version 5.1 anywhere.. I'll boot and see :)
[04:49] <A3n> how do i make items in a directory show as a list instead of icons ?
[04:50] <meggamorty> is there any way to make Freenode indentify you automatically when you connect?
[04:50] <LjL> treepio: it's called 5.10, not 5.1, and it's also known as "Breezy Badger". and it's old.
[04:50] <LjL> !breezy | treepio
[04:50] <ubotu> treepio: breezy was the third release of Ubuntu. Version 5.10, codename "Breezy Badger"
[04:50] <saladin> dfcarney: is debian as good as ubuntu  in terms of useability
[04:50] <A3n> i got 1800 songs in a directory and i want it to show as a list because its not that fun trying to find something if they are all icons
[04:50] <LjL> treepio: it's not obsoleted yet, but it'll be in April. the current versions are 6.06 (Dapper Drake) and 6.10 (Edgy Eft)
[04:51] <dfcarney> saladin: well, Ubuntu is based off of Debian's packages...but there's a lot more manual configuration involved.
[04:51] <treepio> LjL: ok didn't know that, I have 2 shiny new original RED CD's here Version 5.10 for your PC. just wondered if I could boot from it and compile stuff.
[04:51] <air0day> alright everything seems okay.  i'm sure i'll be back when it all breaks again though. thanks everyone
[04:51] <tom47> A3n are you using gnome?
[04:51] <A3n> i think i am
[04:51] <A3n> shipped cd
[04:51] <dfcarney> saladin: i think i missed something you said before.  you say that you were happy with Dapper?  When did you use it?  On this system?
[04:52] <dfcarney> saladin: I'm confused.
[04:52] <j0wbl4ck> thanks johndoetje
[04:52] <LjL> treepio: you won't be able to compile stuff out of the box, because the compiler is not installed. i believe it's on the CD, however, so you can just type "sudo apt-get build-essential" to have it working (you need a decent amount of RAM, though).
[04:52] <saladin> dfcarney: i do not have the time to do alot of configuring. what will be the closest distro to ubuntu. simplymepis
[04:52] <saladin> dfcarney: dapper is running off an old laptop i have
[04:52] <LjL> treepio: still, if you're going to compile programs that require various libraries, you'll need to fetch those libraries' headers from the internet
[04:52] <treepio> LjL: thanks, but I needed a CD to boot and compile stuff with for a different system..
[04:52] <tom47> A3n then the file browser is called nautilus and on the rh-ish sdie you sill probbaly see a drop down box that is showing "View as Icons" ... change this to "View as List"
[04:52] <mike1o> i want to make a bootable usb stick with syslinux but i cant load my kernel...
[04:53] <treepio> LjL: Thanks for your help
[04:53] <LjL> treepio: that might work, if the other system doesn't have too different versions of libc6
[04:53] <treepio> 2.5
[04:53] <johndoetje> thanks tom47
[04:53] <LjL> treepio: well, i don't know, you can try
[04:53] <dreamer> damnit, I can't open my cdrom-tray :/
[04:54] <treepio> LjL: thank you
[04:54] <dfcarney> saladin: i'm not sure about edgy or dapper, but I believe that there's an 'expert mode' for installation purposes.  I think that you'll need to use that if you want to check out/tweak the GRUB configuration.
[04:54] <LjL> dreamer: not with a mounted CD in, no :)
[04:54] <nolimitsoya> dreamer, have you tried the eject command?
[04:54] <treepio> dreamer: unmount your cdrom
[04:54] <A3n> ow right tom47, *stupid* of me :p
[04:54] <A3n> just didnt see it
[04:54] <saladin> dfcarney: how do enable this feature ?
[04:54] <dreamer> how can I easily unmount it?
[04:54] <dfcarney> saladin: if you want to try another distro, then i suggest Fedora Core.  I don't like it too much (I prefer Debian and Ubuntu), but it may work out for you (if you're unwilling to read up on the expert-mode installation procedures).
[04:54] <wheels3572> dabaR, Ok no matter waht I do I cant change my time or date on my computer.
[04:54] <nolimitsoya> dreamer, either rightclick on the desktop icon and select 'eject', or type 'eject <mount point>' in a terminal
=== acez is now known as aceZ
[04:54] <dfcarney> saladin: i'm looking into that right now.
[04:55] <wheels3572> it's like it's the clock and calendar are locked down
[04:55] <treepio> wheels3572: is using vista :))
[04:55] <dfcarney> How does one enter 'expert mode' when installing Ubuntu?
[04:55] <johndoetje> which other good ubuntu irc channels there are?
[04:55] <dreamer> thank you nolimitsoya
[04:55] <wheels3572> treepio, Im using Xubuntu
[04:55] <tom47> A3n you could also try using rhythmbox which has quite a good music organising caability
[04:55] <nolimitsoya> dfcarney, there is none. though, there is an alternate cli install cd for advanced installs
[04:56] <nolimitsoya> !alternate | dfcarney
[04:56] <LjL> dfcarney: you need the Alternate CD for that
[04:56] <ubotu> dfcarney: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[04:56] <nolimitsoya> dreamer, np :)
[04:56] <dfcarney> saladin: there you go.
[04:56] <treepio> wheels3572: No, I installed ubuntu once, and before I know it my entire harddsike were repartitioned.. never tried it since :)
[04:56] <dfcarney> LjL: thanks!
[04:56] <kzv> !wine
[04:56] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:56] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: thanks also.
[04:56] <wheels3572> treepio, I LOVE ubuntu actually it's awesome :).  Just waiting for more support on my Network card
[04:57] <finalbeta> Could I make this "arecord -D hw:1,0 -r 32000 -c 2 -f S16_LE | aplay -" use ESD?
[04:57] <LjL> treepio, it *does* ask you wether you want to erase the entire drive, resize partitions or use the free space only (if any)... then if you just click "OK" without looking, that will happen ;)
[04:57] <saladin> dfcarney: thanks , i really want to stick with ubuntu, i hope there is torrent file ,thanks again
[04:57] <treepio> wheels3572: more support?. not working ?
[04:57] <dfcarney> saladin: from what i was able to find about your problem, it seems that the standard installation procedure misconfigures GRUB and points it to the wrong partition.
[04:57] <h08817> I installed the old hoary edition just because I have it (I know its old) and then when the installation was done it couldn't make its first boot. I got grub 17 error any idea what I can do?
[04:57] <h08817> !grub
[04:57] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[04:57] <treepio> LjL: it's evil I tell you, EVIL ! :)
[04:57] <wheels3572> treepio, not under Ubuntu no.  It's the bcm 43xx series that's needs reverse engineering to get it to work correctly
[04:58] <dfcarney> saladin: if that doesn't work out then please try this forum again.  i'd hate to think that you'd be forced into another distro.
[04:58] <treepio> wheels3572: buy a cheap nic on ebay, less that a $.
[04:58] <LjL> treepio: ok, granted, perhaps "Erase the entire drive" shouldn't be the option that's checked by default
[04:58] <treepio> wheels3572: + shipping offc
[04:58] <r3dbranh> can anyone help me configure lirc please
[04:58] <treepio> LjL: No it shouldn't.
[04:58] <wheels3572> treepio, Yeah but I gotta make sure it's not running the bcm43xx series chipset otherwise im back in the same boat again lol
[04:58] <saladin> dfcarney: i will start downloading now and will come back again. thanks for your help
[04:58] <nolimitsoya> LjL, id prefer it was impossible to press ok/continue without making a conscious choice...
[04:59] <nolimitsoya> LjL, perhaps a bugreport? :)
[04:59] <treepio> wheels3572: buy some 8139 nic, old , cheap and reliable.
[04:59] <dfcarney> saladin: no problem.  sorry that we couldn't solve your problem right away.
[04:59] <LjL> nolimitsoya: well, pressing OK is supposed to *be* a conscious choice :P perhaps it's worth a bugreport, but i'd have to re-check the installation process before submitting one, i don't entirely remember what it looks like
=== aceZ is now known as acez
[04:59] <wheels3572> treepio,  this is for my laptop though not my desktop that I need the correct working Nic card

[05:00] <treepio> wheels3572: get an old nic.. a 3com almost always work.
[05:00] <AnAnt> how do I set a label of an *existing* ext3 partition ?
[05:00] <wheels3572> treepio, ok ty
[05:00] <wheels3572> brb got an idea on something
[05:00] <nolimitsoya> LjL, me neither :) clicking ok by accident o not understanding what the diffrent options are thinking the default must be ok, is an issue imo, if its layed out the way that erase entire drive is default...
[05:00] <reddragon3668> is there a way to change the fonts in a terminal? With the exception of gnome-terminal, all my terminals (xterm, aterm, Eterm) have fonts that are way too small. In some, shift/+ works, but not near enough.
[05:00] <treepio> wheels3572: make sure it's 1 or 2 years old, then your 99% sure you have a driver with no problems
[05:01] <nolimitsoya> AnAnt, tried gparted?
[05:01] <AnAnt> nolimitsoya: nope

[05:02] <AnAnt> thakns
[05:04] <LjL> nolimitsoya: i think it's either erase, or resize by default, i don't remember. but even if it's resize, well, resizing partitions is still dangerous
[05:04] <susscorfa> what to do if my acer won't boot from life cd (tryed no apic and save grafics)

[05:35] <Johansson> but i'm confused now
[05:35] <Johansson> i can't seem to figure out which driver my system is using
[05:35] <nolimitsoya> Johansson, ubotu is a bot. dont talk to it ;)
[05:35] <tom47> Johansson maybe you can blacklist the rtl8180 driver as an interim measure to be sure its not being used
[05:35] <dfcarney> Johansson: lsmod will tell you
[05:35] <Johansson> ops, sorry
[05:35] <dfcarney> Johansson: along with 'dmesg'
[05:35] <Johansson> dfcarney, yep
[05:35] <Johansson> but it's not consistent dmesg with lsmod
[05:36] <sindrum> ubotu: guns
[05:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about guns - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:36] <Johansson> lsmod says it's not loaded

[05:36] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[05:36] <Johansson> dmesg says that
[05:36] <Johansson> rtl8180: Card successfully reset
[05:37] <dfcarney> Johansson: well, that's weird.  one way to check for sure is to try and remove the driver.  if it's not being used then you should be able to remove it.
[05:37] <Johansson> i've remode rtl8180
[05:37] <Johansson> but i have also ieee80211_rtl

[05:37] <Speshul_ED> yeah, when someone starts their post with the word anyone or anybody, it does seem to come off as vaguely asked yet excessively probative

[05:39] <xi_> hi
[05:39] <xi_> i have a strange problem
[05:39] <xi_> when i setup my nic to dhcp
[05:39] <xi_> it works fine
[05:39] <xi_> when i give it a fix ip
[05:39] <xi_> it doesn't
[05:39] <nolimitsoya> xi_, please confide you question to one message, please
[05:39] <Speshul_ED> if someone just posted "I would like to find out how to ..... "  it wouldn't put the responder in a bind, appearing as if he has engaged in the lame brained idea you have.
[05:40] <xi_> when i set my nic to dhcp it works fine but if i give it a fix ip it doesn't work. has somebody an idea?
[05:40] <xi_> sorry!
[05:40] <nolimitsoya> xi_, what do you mean by 'doesnt work'?
[05:40] <Kiongku> how do i install new icon themes in ubuntu?
[05:41] <nolimitsoya> !synaptic | Kiongku
[05:41] <ubotu> Kiongku: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[05:42] <fdr> hello. I'm installing a program i've just compiled, but instead of make install I would like to make a package (so that I can easily remove it later...). Can you point me at some docs please?
[05:42] <Kiongku> not really helpful. I'm currently looking in gnome-look.org
[05:42] <johndoetje> make deb?
[05:42] <nicola> trying to compile a program I got checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables

[05:42] <dfcarney> Johansson: ugh.  i can't find much that's better than lsmod and dmesg
[05:42] <nolimitsoya> xi_, if 'doesnt work' means 'i cant get on the internet no more' thatd mean you forgot dns/gateway setting, and you nicis working fine. btw, there it never any reason to use hard ip when you have a dhcpserver. you should set your dhcp server to reserve an ip for your nic:s mac adress instead
[05:42] <jrib> nicola: install the build-essential package
[05:42] <nicola> thanks jrib
[05:43] <fdr> johndoetje, no, there is no make deb rule :)
[05:43] <xi_> hmmm... i always prefer to use fix ips instead of letting my router do that
[05:43] <nolimitsoya> Kiongku, then use the install routine cited in the readme for that icon set
[05:44] <dothazard> Bonsoir

[05:44] <xi_> a the dns / gateway is setup too.  when i try to ping the router with a fix ip it doesn't work. he doesn't even try. the problem is some games / ts / icq-file-transfer need port forwarding which i have to set to a specific ip in my router

[05:47] <jerp> since no one knows if XChat allows the suer to make popups, does ubuntu have a package download of an IRC client that allows the user to make popups ?

[05:50] <nicola> what's a "build-dep" ?

[05:54] <gephalt> Hi, folks. I was able to successfully setup the twin view on an old nvidia card. problem is, when I want to watch some movie on the TV screen, half of it is on the tv screen (in full screen mode) and the other half on my monitor.
[05:54] <gephalt> Is this what twin-view is supposed to be?
[05:54] <wasabi> gephalt: You probably need to set up twinview so it uses xinerama
[05:55] <Raskall> I simply love NX. :)
[05:55] <gephalt> wasabi: how do i do that? don't i need to seperate graphics card to use xinerama (as I understand it) in the first place?

[06:06] <nolimitsoya> eltese, cfg:s are created in a hidder folder in your /home. make sure you have that folder, and that nofile is writeprotected
[06:06] <johns^> any ideas where I can change that?
[06:06] <nolimitsoya> eLfReaKz, please, ive told you already.

[06:08] <nolimitsoya> dfcarney, im using edgy
[06:08] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: yeah, but i'm willing to bet that Edgy uses 2.0 also :)
[06:08] <nolimitsoya> eLfReaKz, software is searched and installed through synaptic. there is no list of software, nore do you want one. you couldnt possibly overlook all the software you can run in ubuntu
[06:09] <eLfReaKz> nolimitsoya: like maybe yahoo messenger doesnt have ubuntu version.. but have something else.. so i want to know if there's a website giving me choices of software for me to use with ubuntu
[06:09] <nolimitsoya> dfcarney, how do i check?
[06:09] <nolimitsoya> eLfReaKz, search synaptic
[06:09] <eLfReaKz> nolimitsoya: so synaptic is update to date with latest software for ubuntu?
[06:09] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: i'm trying to look into that myself right now :)
[06:09] <bruenig> eLfReaKz, on the absolute beginner part of ubuntuforums.org they have software equivalents for windows to linux
[06:09] <nolimitsoya> eLfReaKz, yes
[06:09] <tom47> eLfReaKz if you run synaptic you should find all the sftware listed there including brief descriptions .... warning though, the list is maybe 20,000 paclages long so you may want to use the search facility to reduce the number somewhat to a smaller subject area

[06:13] <Lynoure> Baxter_Kylie: dpkg-query -W --showformat='${status} ${Package}\n'  does something like that

[06:17] <Garito> anyone can help me to configure direct rendering on a intel 82885, please?
[06:17] <rw> sergevn: the upcoming ubuntu release?
[06:17] <rw> reddragon3668: moment
[06:18] <HuibertGill> willskills: brb, just
[06:18] <nolimitsoya> dfcarney, build-dep solved it. thank you :)
[06:18] <francisco> mark: more specific help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo
[06:18] <max_> it could be damaged, perhaps, but when I check the about:plugins page of mozilla they seem fine.
[06:18] <Mark45> fransico: will that help me connect to ckip
[06:18] <dfcarney> nolimitsoya: glad i could help
[06:18] <HuibertGill> willskills: try with the chmod command
[06:18] <max_> I know the file can't be amaged in fact, because I can view video outside of mozilla
[06:18] <tom47> !permissions

[06:18] <sergevn> rw, ah yes wanted that clear ;), probably it will configure automatic to 'vesa' mode if it doesnt recognice your videocard e.g. driver
[06:19] <eltese> how do I change so I got the rights to write in my quake3 folder? :p
[06:19] <HuibertGill> willskills: recursivly for a dir named TEST: chmod -R o+rw TEST/
[06:19] <francisco> garito what error are you getting?
[06:19] <francisco> Garito, run glxinfo
[06:19] <HuibertGill> willskills: this will let OTHERS read and write to the files.
[06:19] <Garito> francisco: I don't know (complet newbie)
[06:19] <dfcarney> eltese: something like "sudo chown -R eltese.eltese .quake3" should work
[06:19] <HuibertGill> willskills: or, if you want access for one user unly, use the chown command
[06:19] <Garito> I only don't have direct rendering
[06:20] <Garito> then beryl go slooooow
[06:20] <dfcarney> eltese: then, follow that with a "chmod ugo+rw" command
[06:20] <willskills> ye thats great hx
[06:20] <francisco> oh you are running beryl :D

[06:20] <aleutian> I know that Ubuntu currently supports the dual core capability of Inte Core 2 Duo processors now, but I am curious to know if the latest Core 2 Duo processors can run the 64-bit version of Ubuntu.  Does anyone know this?
[06:20] <Garito> yes
[06:20] <Garito> but slooooooow
[06:21] <rw> sergevn: the thing is - if you change your stuff to f.e. "nvidia" and something doesent work, maybe one could override the "nvidia" setting so people would get "something" on their screen
[06:21] <francisco> Garito, I use beryl on 855 but it works best in 16bit
[06:21] <nolimitsoya> aleutian, they can
[06:21] <francisco> especially for running video
[06:21] <Garito> but how can I activate direct rendering?
[06:21] <seiya> ih, does anyone know about how to disable the touchpad on a laptop ?
[06:21] <francisco> just a sec I will find my xorg.conf
[06:21] <Garito> it go slow with normal windows
[06:21] <rw> max_: do a right-click on the mplayer-screen in mozilla and change video-out to x11
[06:21] <Garito> ok
[06:21] <Garito> thanks!
[06:21] <sergevn> rw, yes i think it's already implented in 6.xx, i just had it with my notebook, default my driver was vga.
[06:21] <nolimitsoya> seiya, remove it from the inputs section of xorg.conf
[06:22] <aleutian> nolimitsoya:  Thanks!
[06:22] <seiya> thank you nilimitsoya

[06:25] <rw> reddragon3668: maybe you could use gnome-terminal or the stuff from xfce4, it's a bit easier there (IMHO)
[06:25] <OmniColos> Garito, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36078/
[06:25] <rw> cjuner_: you need to open youre xdmcp-port

[06:33] <Pelo> elfreakz,  it is a matter of choice,   format has little to do with the app itself it's a made of codecs

[06:52] <borg> TGPO: duh, that's why i'm asking about this stuff
[06:52] <HuibertGill> TGPO: do you a good howto to compile from source the ubuntu/debian way? like with checkinstall, or dpkg build source??
[06:52] <Trini_Man> can anyone help me
[06:53] <Trini_Man> mysql server not accepting web connections
[06:53] <Toma-> !alien
[06:53] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[06:53] <Trini_Man> it ony works onlocal host
[06:53] <yeti> new2u: that's because you seem to need gtk1.2 for whatever you're trying to do.
[06:53] <sirbijan> anybody interested in my hard drive problem?
[06:53] <Trini_Man> need help with setting up mysql server
[06:53] <new2u> yeti:  than how can i use gtk1.2  whats the way out
[06:53] <TGPO> borg apt-get install build-essential bin86
[06:53] <Trini_Man> mysql server not accepting web connections
[06:53] <borg> Toma- : i already know about alien, as said before they advice against installing rpm's in ubuntu
[06:54] <leviathan> my system is freezy when active my NIC Wi-Fi with chip rtl8185l, somebody know why?
[06:54] <yeti> new2u: install it...
[06:54] <TGPO> borg that will deal with nearly everything you need to compile normally
[06:54] <Toma-> borg: ok, sorry, just joined
[06:54] <marginoferror> sirbijan: Well, I don't know what could have happened there
[06:54] <Trini_Man> ddfd
[06:54] <leviathan> help me please...
[06:54] <new2u> borg can u help me
[06:54] <borg> TGPO: so if i install that package i'll be able to compile anything?
[06:54] <marginoferror> sirbijan: But the question to ask is, is your computer functioning?  Does everything work when you reboot?
[06:54] <borg> new2u: sry cant
[06:54] <Trini_Man> mysql server not accepting web connections
[06:54] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: I'm looking into it...
[06:55] <sirbijan> yes, i only hope it's not really that i have to change my hard drive!
[06:55] <TGPO> borg no, just almost anything, that wont give you everything you need for a kernel compile and you still may need gcc
[06:55] <sirbijan> everything is fine in /dev/hda6, it just gives that error message
[06:55] <nolimitsoya> sirbijan, whats the problem?
[06:55] <borg> TGPO alright
[06:55] <sirbijan> i get the error message that there are differences between boot sector and its backup
[06:55] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: it is a fat32 partition? have you tried the microsoft checkdisk thing?
[06:56] <sirbijan> when i try fsck, i get this:
[06:56] <sirbijan> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/4X7q6T88.html
[06:56] <nolimitsoya> borg, 'sudo apt-get install build-essential kernel-headers-`uname -r`' should give you what you need to comppile
[06:56] <sirbijan> yes HuibertGill , i tried
[06:56] <sirbijan> it gets fixed
[06:56] <leviathan> help me please...
[06:56] <leviathan> my system is freezy when active my NIC Wi-Fi with chip rtl8185l, somebody know why?
[06:56] <Toma-> new2u: make sure the package libgtk1.2 is installed
[06:56] <sirbijan> but when i boot into ubuntu and restart again, it's broken again
=== neuro|irssi is now known as neuro_
[06:56] <elfreakz> i wanted to install vlc
[06:56] <Garito> hi again!
[06:56] <julianx> i didn't follow your hard-drive problem
[06:56] <sirbijan> somehow it gives me the feelin that linux destroys something in here!
[06:56] <julianx> i'm sorry
[06:56] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: and later it get screwed up again?
[06:56] <sirbijan> i thought it's coz of Ubuntu's gparted
[06:56] <Toma-> new2u: that means running 'sudo apt-get install libgtk-1.2.so.0'
[06:56] <elfreakz> to download vlc should i download i386?
[06:56] <sirbijan> yes HuibertGill
[06:57] <sirbijan> but it's not gparted, coz in Fedora core i get the same error
[06:57] <marginoferror> sirbijan: More likely, linux is detecting a problem (or falsely reporting one!) that Windows does not detect properly?
[06:57] <Toma-> new2u: that means running 'sudo apt-get install libgtk-1.2' << revised
[06:57] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, just type'sudo apt-get install vlc' in a terminal
[06:57] <Garito> some help about enable direct rendering with an intel 82855, please?
[06:57] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: it is in the repos
[06:57] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: after windows repair, reboot, is it imidialty broken again? or after the second reboot?
[06:57] <sirbijan> maybe marginoferror
[06:58] <sirbijan> after rebooting into ubuntu, rebooting and then going into windows i see it's broke again
[06:58] <marginoferror> Hmm
[06:58] <sirbijan> so, first i go to windows to fix it, then if i go to windows again, it's ok
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> sirbijan, what is?
[06:58] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: maybe it is not umounted cleanly? (wildguess)
[06:58] <sirbijan> but if after fix, i go to linux (ubuntu/fedora), restart again, i see the problem at both linuxes boot up
[06:58] <sirbijan> it can't be in both linuxes
[06:59] <sirbijan> and lemme tell ya sth
[06:59] <nolimitsoya> sirbijan, you should never let windows mess with your linux hdds, or vice versa
[06:59] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya: it say could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (ll resource temporarily unavailable)
[06:59] <sirbijan> but after fsck ing it and choosing copy the original to backup, it got fixed
[06:59] <Music_Shuffle1> Yeh...bad idea.
[06:59] <sirbijan> but as for as this /dev/hda5, it never works
[06:59] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, close all synaptic windows you might have open
[06:59] <sirbijan> it just says leaving the file system unchanged
[06:59] <sirbijan> they used to live happily together nolimitsoya
[06:59] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: so fsck is not able to perform the copy?
[07:00] <Garito> anyone can help me to enable direct rendering with an intel 82855, please?
[07:00] <sirbijan> no, for /dev/hda5 no
[07:00] <sirbijan> but for /dev/hda6, it definitely did HuibertGill
[07:00] <nolimitsoya> sirbijan, doesnt matter. windows should never be alowed to touch your linux filesystems
[07:00] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, : now it say could not find vlc

[07:01] <mauro_> we uaj
[07:01] <mauro_> 
[07:01] <sirbijan> i don't remember, but i think Windows
[07:01] <mauro_> no you can create a partition with linux
[07:01] <mauro_> whit gpart
[07:01] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, enable repository in synaptic packagemanager?
[07:01] <lemonsCC> nolimitsoya: does he have the other repos uncommented?
[07:01] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: yes
[07:02] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, i see channels
[07:02] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: then run the command again
[07:02] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: is there something in the syslog when you try the copy in fsck?
[07:02] <gop> can't get networking to work with sheepshaver
[07:02] <gop> any one here know how
[07:02] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: dapper or edgy?
[07:02] <sirbijan> i never checked HuibertGill
[07:02] <gop> dapper
[07:02] <sirbijan> i don't know what syslog is
[07:03] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: might be interessting to do a tail -f on it, and then run the fsck
[07:03] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, eerrkk i dont know, im newbie .. now is my first experience with ubuntu
[07:03] <HuibertGill> sirbijan: syslog is in /var/log the kernel writes his messages there,
[07:03] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: go to system > about ubuntu and see if it is 6.06 or 6.10
[07:03] <HuibertGill> !syslog

[07:06] <Garito> some intel 82855 direct rendering help please?
[07:06] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: no adding extra repos just gives you access to more software

[07:06] <elfreakz> ok ok
[07:06] <elfreakz> lemonsCC,  will try now
[07:06] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: ok
[07:07] <gop> it sucks
[07:07] <ibert> rw: i solved it via iftab :-)
[07:07] <gop> sheepsaver won't work with networking
[07:07] <shiv> what program in linux can make use of external USB pen drive as extra RAM?
[07:07] <lemonsCC> what is sheepsaver?
[07:08] <sirbijan> thanks guys
[07:08] <sirbijan> see ya
[07:08] <HuibertGill> shiv: why would you want to use an usb stick as ram?? (unless you are from the microsoft sales department)
[07:08] <shiv> lol
[07:08] <HuibertGill> shiv: thats what a swap partition/file is for
[07:08] <shiv> vista does it now and I heard they copied the trick from linux
[07:09] <HuibertGill> shiv: ?? what.....
[07:09] <lemonsCC> shiv: if vista jumped off a cliff would you?
[07:09] <shiv> HuibertGill: Microsofts new OS vista has that feature
[07:09] <SilverDrake> what feature?
[07:09] <MrRio> realplayer flikers green in firefox
[07:09] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, after doing all that it say reading package list DONE
[07:09] <corevette> how do i uninstall xgl without getting errors in the xserver?
[07:09] <lemonsCC> ok
[07:09] <HuibertGill> shiv: but to answer your question, just create a swapfile on the stick...
[07:09] <shiv> lemonsCC: no but I sure would push you
[07:10] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: now in terminal type "sudo apt-get install vlc"
[07:10] <lemonsCC> shiv: lol
[07:10] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, it say could fine package vlc
[07:10] <shiv> HuibertGill: I got that
[07:10] <shiv> HuibertGill: thats neat
[07:10] <corevette> how do i uninstall xgl without getting errors in the xserver?
[07:10] <HuibertGill> shiv: but , don't do that, usb sticks are not made for many read/write operations
[07:10] <Music_Shuffle1> shiv, its really not designed as such.
[07:10] <Music_Shuffle1> the drive*
[07:11] <shiv> Music_Shuffle1: I see
[07:11] <Music_Shuffle1> Its not so much a bad idea as a horrible, terrible, no-good, very-bad idea.
[07:11] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: open up synaptic (system > administration > synaptic) and search for  vlc"
[07:11] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, ok then?
[07:11] <HuibertGill> Music_Shuffle1: but the idea sells well :-)
[07:11] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: did it find anything?
[07:11] <Music_Shuffle1> Yeah def.
[07:11] <elfreakz> nope
[07:12] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, nope
[07:12] <corevette> how do i uninstall xgl without getting errors in the xserver?
[07:12] <SilverDrake> hey, would anyone like to help me get my network going on the live CD?  I can't get connected to the internet or the rest of the computers in my house when I'm running the kubuntu CD
[07:12] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, do i need to update everything? cos there's like 64 update to download?
[07:12] <corevette> SilverDrake, wired or wireless?
[07:12] <SilverDrake> corevette: wired
[07:12] <Music_Shuffle1> elfreakz, only 64? Won't take long at all.
[07:13] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: try "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get upgrade"
[07:13] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, ok wait
[07:13] <corevette> how do i uninstall xgl without getting errors in the xserver?
[07:13] <cjuner> corevette, you shouldn't get any errors.
[07:14] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, do u mind typing the code again
[07:14] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, sudo get whut?
[07:14] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: the first thing is "sudo apt-get update"
[07:14] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: after its done "sudo apt-get upgrade"
[07:14] <SilverDrake> if anyone wants to give me suggestions on how to get connected to my network using the kubuntu live CD, please pm
[07:15] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, ok its upgrading
[07:15] <lemonsCC> =P
[07:15] <cjuner> Is that a question?
[07:15] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: do you see an error msg?
[07:15] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, get used with xp, i see ubuntu like something weird :p
[07:16] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: you aren't used to the control i assume.  XP forces you to do things one way and one way only....
[07:16] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: with almost everything I do, it just says it can't connect to anything.. even though my current OS can connect
[07:17] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I wish I could have it up at the same time as I'm talking to you, but I have to be connected to my network to be connected to the internet
[07:17] <lemonsCC> XP = lemmings?
[07:17] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, yeah like my case there is something on my taskbar for upgrade.. but there's also other way to upgrade using terminal... looks cool
[07:17] <bclough> Hi all, I am trying to install Ubuntu on my desktop (asus Deluxe motherboard & NVIDIA PCI express) but for some reason when I boot from cd and try to install, I can't do anything...it just sits there and I think it is having problems with my video card...can anyone help?
[07:17] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: the terminal is good because if something goes wrong you can see the error
[07:17] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: so you do reboots? to get to irc?
[07:18] <atlef> bclough : noapic
[07:18] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: might be hard to diagnose....
[07:18] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, ic ic, is it always start with sudo?
[07:18] <bclough> atlef: could you clarify, sorry I am pretty new to linux
[07:18] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: what network card do you have?
[07:18] <lemonsCC> !sudo | elfreakz
[07:18] <ubotu> elfreakz: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:18] <will_> Hey all.
[07:18] <bluefox83> has anyone experienced any trouble with the latest edgy updates in apt? just checking before i go updating xorg and such >.>
[07:18] <sorush20> ho wdo I find out if my computer is prescott or a pentium 4?
[07:18] <will_> How do I change my refresh rate? its stuck on 75 I need it on 60hz for my tv.
[07:19] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: not everything starts with sudo
[07:19] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: how can I check that?
[07:19] <will_> lemon hi.
[07:19] <atlef> bclough : at the boot prompt, press F6 and add noapic to that line and hit enter
[07:19] <Music_Shuffle1> bluefox83, its working fine for me, but I fresh-installed Edgy 64 off a CD.
[07:19] <lemonsCC> bluefox83: none here
[07:19] <ViViD> i have a debian sarge server that i want to upgrade to dapper.  i was wondering if theres a wiki or how-to on the web to aid people with this, or if theres a preferred or official method of performing this upgrade
[07:19] <lemonsCC> will_: hi
[07:19] <bclough> atlef: thanks!
[07:19] <Music_Shuffle1> sorush20, Prescott is a pentium 4 core, as is Northwood.
[07:19] <ViViD> does it work to simply change my sources.list?
[07:19] <lemonsCC> !hi | will_
[07:19] <ubotu> will_: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[07:19] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: is it onboard or a pci card? post the output of "sudo lspci" in the pastebin
[07:19] <bluefox83> no, i mean the updates from a regular apt-get dist-upgrade or synaptic update >.>
[07:19] <will_> lemonsCC, : how do i change my refresh rate to 60hz instead of 75. there are no options
[07:19] <bluefox83> not updating from dapper
[07:20] <sorush20> I'm trying to use a swiftfox but I don't know whether I have prescott or pentium 4
[07:20] <Music_Shuffle1> bluefox83, You mean just apt-get update is working fine or not?
[07:20] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I can't really sudo right now... my current OS is slackware
[07:20] <Music_Shuffle1> sorush20, you can have both.
[07:20] <sorush20> Music_Shuffle1:
[07:20] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: in slackware the card works? but in ubuntu it doesn't?
[07:20] <lemonsCC> will_: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=83973
[07:20] <lemonsCC> will_: may help
[07:20] <Music_Shuffle1> If you have a Pentium 4, it is either a Northwood core, or a Prescott core.
[07:20] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: essentially...
[07:20] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, i feel weird, people say if im using ubuntu, i cannot access my XP partition, but i can see my XP in ubuntu??
[07:21] <Music_Shuffle1> So it can be both.
[07:21] <frogzoo> !ntfs | elfreakz
[07:21] <ubotu> elfreakz: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:21] <Music_Shuffle1> elfreakz, yeah that's annoying. You have to mount the XP part's.
[07:21] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: you can READ from your XP partition but writing is very experimental
[07:21] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: what kernel version do you have in slack (uname -a)
[07:21] <atlef> bclough : there could also be an error with the cd you are trying to boot.
[07:21] <elfreakz> Music_Shuffle1, lemonsCC : dont u think its cool i can access my XP partition? so i can edit any file in it?
[07:22] <bclough> atlef: good point, i ran a check and it passed
[07:22] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: is your xp a fat32 partition?
[07:22] <Music_Shuffle1> Well, writing is not something I would do, but you can read i, yeah.
[07:22] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, should be ntfs
[07:22] <billytwowilly> so if I get a "can't read superblock" error when I try to mount a windows share does that mean the hard drive is toast?
[07:22] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: one weird thing I noticed was that when I went to network configure and told it what the default gate computer's IP was, then closed the window (after hitting apply in sudo), it would be blank again when I got back
[07:22] <atlef> bclough : good
[07:22] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: 2.4.31
[07:22] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: i would be careful writing ntfs and linux dont agree
[07:22] <bclough> atlef: so what does noapic do?
[07:22] <will_> Ok.
[07:22] <atlef> !noapic
[07:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about noapic - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:23] <will_> I'm done with ubuntu. All that to change a refresh rate?
[07:23] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: hmmm, ubuntu uses the 2.6 kernel versions.
[07:23] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, so ur point is, never go to XP partition?
[07:23] <conreyt> anyone help me with gnomebaker? I installed it a min ago and I'm getting odd errors trying to burn dvd's.  CDs work fine.  error Here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36086/
[07:23] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: but I can't believe harwardware _not_ being suported that has been suported.

[07:23] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: you can read (ie: look at pictures, listen to music) but writing is not reccomended
[07:23] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: so what does that mean?
[07:24] <DanglyBits> will automatix2 for ubuntu amd64 install the 32 bit firefox with 32 bit flash 9 player?
[07:24] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, aarrr ic ic yet i still can see the XP partition there.... where else when im using xp, i cannot see ubuntu partition
[07:24] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: i got around this by making a fat32 partition and using it to transfer from XP to ubuntu
[07:24] <corevette> after i uninstalled xgl, it said i have an error in the xserver......now i'm stuck in recover mode and i don't want xgl...how do i fix this?
[07:24] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: you could try to start the network in ubuntu manually, do you have DHCP in your network ?
[07:24] <nomin> conreyt: it looks like you have the wrong dvd type
[07:24] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, yeah i have another partition, which is for shared = the partition is on fat32
[07:24] <nolimitsoya> conreyt, are you using dvdram for a drive that can only write dvd-r, or using dvd-r for a drive that can only write dvd+r?
[07:24] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I'm not sure... I'm really a newbie to the inner workings of computers
[07:25] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: there is something that will allow your to use your ext3 on windows
[07:25] <julianx> the problem with a fat32 partition is only the limit of capacity and the right access... i think
[07:25] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, www.fs-driver.org
[07:25] <nomin> conreyt: is your drive dvd+r or dvd-r?  you can only use matching dvd types with the drives.
[07:25] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, something allow me to use my ext3 on windows - like?
[07:25] <Emo_Samurai> Do you know where I could find drivers for a network card I just bought?
[07:26] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: see nolimitsoya above

[07:26] <corevette> after i uninstalled xgl, it said i have an error in the xserver......now i'm stuck in recover mode and i don't want xgl...how do i fix this?
[07:26] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: if the netowrk is automaticly configured (ipadress, gateway, dns) you have dhcp,

[07:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about codec - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[07:26] <ivoks> we need you!
[07:26] <lemonsCC> !hi | ivoks

[07:26] <ivoks> if you are edgy user, help us build DVD for all
[07:26] <conreyt> nomin nolimitsoya: it's a dvdrw +/- drive and the media is DVD-R .. is there something else I can check?
[07:26] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: If you manually put the the network info somewhere you don't have dhcp.
[07:27] <ivoks> come to http://www.ubuntu-hr.org/ningi/ and upload your packages list

[07:27] <julianx> you can use eassy-ubuntu for install the realplayer
[07:27] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I guess it is... essentially, if the gate computer has my IP address, I can connect to it and the internet
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> conreyt, try k3b instead of gnomebaker. make sure you a re using good branded dvd-r:s, make sure the brand of disc and writer are compatible
[07:27] <conreyt> nomin: I just reloaded this computer (it's my wife's) and I'm using the same spindle that I was using when it was loaded with windows...
[07:27] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, thanks for the ext2 ifs for windows link :)
[07:27] <nolimitsoya> julianx, never recommend anyone to use easyubuntuor automatix
[07:27] <Music_Shuffle1> !automatix
[07:27] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:28] <lemonsCC> ivoks: what is the point of this project?

[07:28] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, if i wanted to move files from xp to ubuntu partition, so i need to go to fat32 partition first, or i can directly move and copy it between 2 ext3 partition?
[07:28] <nolimitsoya> !msgthebot | Emo_Samurai
[07:28] <ubotu> Emo_Samurai: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[07:28] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: good, then in ubuntu in a terminal try "sudo ifconfig eth0" , then "sudo ifconfig" again, to see if the network adapter is up.
[07:28] <BlueLaguna> Is there any way I can prevent this?
[07:28] <conreyt> nolimitsoya: it's not a hw issue, I'd rather try to fix it rather than load up a different package to work around it.
[07:28] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: not sure.. i never use the ext2fs thingy
[07:28] <ivoks> lemonsCC: ignore 'Breezy Badger'; it's for Edgy acctually :)
[07:28] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I'll try that... I think I did before, but I'll try again
[07:29] <lemonsCC> ivoks: i am using edgy..will upload give me a minute
[07:29] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, you can use ext2/3 as any other partition
[07:29] <Emo_Samurai> Does anyone know where I could get network card drivers?
[07:29] <nolimitsoya> Emo_Samurai, for wifi or wired?
[07:29] <Emo_Samurai> nolimitsoya, for wifi.
[07:29] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: then "sudo dhclient3 " to get dhcp.
[07:29] <corevette> after i uninstalled xgl, it said i have an error in the xserver......now i'm stuck in recover mode and i don't want xgl...how do i fix this?

[07:29] <ubotu> Emo_Samurai: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[07:29] <SilverDrake> alright
[07:29] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, you can use ext2/3 as any other partition
[07:30] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: you need to  know at which step it goes wrong.....
[07:30] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, that will sure no data corrupted?
[07:30] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: if it goes wrong, I'll write it down and come back here
[07:30] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: after all that is done, first try to ping your gateway (e.g. ping 192.168.1.1)
[07:30] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, its reasonably safe
[07:30] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, thanks :)
[07:30] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: if you can ping ypur gateway, the network is up and running :-)
[07:31] <Music_Shuffle1> There's a degree of risk associated with anything really.
[07:31] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, unlike ntfs, ext is very well documented and open source, so its easy toprogram drivers for
[07:31] <ivoks> lemonsCC: great, thanks
[07:31] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: thanks!  I'll try that.
[07:31] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: for kicks, try to ping google.com after that.
[07:31] <devils_son> hi all... my usb keyboard is never detected on startup.. i have to unplug the usb cable and replug it and then starts working... i am running kubuntu... any help will be appreciated!
[07:31] <nolimitsoya> +1 Music_Shuffle1
[07:31] <SilverDrake> hehe, okay
[07:31] <ironfroggy_LT> is there anything extra i need to do to open the cups web server?
[07:32] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, but my XP partition is already NTFS... so i cant copy/move files from ubuntu ext3 to XP or vise versa?
[07:32] <nolimitsoya> ironfroggy_LT, a browser
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[07:32] <ironfroggy_LT> nolimitsoya: yeah i got that part
[07:32] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, hasnt this been clarified a number of times? ntfs writing from linux is dangerous, and ext3 acces from windows is perfectly fine
[07:32] <freakytux> devils_son: maybe a driver? there are many on the net..
[07:33] <devils_son> hmm... i thought i wasn't missing any drivers since when i replug it, it starts to work... but i'll check for them.. thanks!
[07:33] <elfreakz> nolimitsoya, so if i use xp, i can get ubuntu file.. but NO/DONT when i use ubuntu to get something from XP NTFS.. am i right?
[07:33] <jori> nolimitsoya, there is a tabel same where whit you're change of succes its samewhere around the line's of 70 / 30 not damaging you're data
[07:34] <nolimitsoya> elfreakz, its perfectly simple realy, and i cant explain it better than has already been explained. jori, such tabels are ogus
[07:34] <nolimitsoya> *bogus
[07:34] <corevette> after i uninstalled xgl, it said i have an error in the xserver......now i'm stuck in recover mode and i don't want xgl...how do i fix this?
[07:35] <freakytux> devils_son: it can work without, but if you have problems, you should try a driver
[07:35] <nolimitsoya> corevette, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:35] <lemonsCC> ivoks: holy god thats a long list of packages...=)
[07:35] <cjuner> corevette, you probably have modified your gdm config, right?
[07:35] <lemonsCC> ivoks: uploaded
[07:35] <ivoks> lemonsCC: 2-3 thousand? :)
[07:35] <lemonsCC> ivoks: not numbered so idk but its looong
[07:35] <MrKeuner> hi, is it possible to have xgl or aiglx support without non-ubuntu repositories?
[07:35] <corevette> nolimitsoya i did that, do you think it should have any different results? i didn't change anything
[07:36] <corevette> cjuner, not that i know of...gdm config?
[07:36] <devils_son> freakytux: ok, i'll try that.. thanks
[07:36] <ivoks> lemonsCC: don't worry, it's not that much
[07:36] <ivoks> lemonsCC: everything bellow 2000 is normal :)
[07:37] <cjuner> corevette, gdm is your login manager (if you use ubuntu, in kubuntu that would be kdm). How do you start XGL usually?
[07:37] <lemonsCC> ivoks: 26 pages printed at size 10 font...lol
[07:37] <corevette> cjuner usually i just login...i never used xgl...i dont' even know why i had it
[07:37] <corevette> cjuner i don't want xgl anymore, thats the whole problem
[07:37] <cjuner> corevette, hm... that's weird.
[07:38] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: did you ever get vlc installed?
[07:38] <ivoks> lemonsCC: spread the word, so we can get even better results
[07:38] <corevette> cjuner how come?
[07:38] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, im still waiting for the upgrade to finish
[07:38] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: k
[07:38] <corevette> nolimitsoya do you think the dpgk-reconfigure would do anythign?
[07:38] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, still say 25minutes :(
[07:38] <lemonsCC> ivoks: will try
[07:38] <ivoks> lemonsCC: thanks
[07:38] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, and its like 2:40AM SUNDAY here
[07:38] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: slow internet or lost of updates?
[07:39] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: i went to bed at 4am last night =)
[07:39] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, i believe the connection is slow, im using 3G via phone as modem
[07:39] <lemonsCC> lots*
[07:39] <ironfroggy_LT> do i need to change some configs so that cups will allow other boxes on the network to access it?
[07:39] <cjuner> corevette, the ubuntu xgl package doesn't modify anything. You should just login to normal Xorg.
[07:39] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, where from?
[07:39] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: EST @ NJ, USA
[07:39] <ivoks> elfreakz: looks like DVD repo is something what you need :)
[07:39] <corevette> cjuner but it says theres an error and i can't log in
[07:39] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, I was so excited with ubuntu, thats why i stay up late :p
[07:39] <lemonsCC> ivoks: you silly silly man...he is updating
[07:40] <ivoks> lemonsCC: :)
[07:40] <elfreakz> ivoks, dvd repo?
[07:40] <lemonsCC> ivoks: you will include fluxbox and such or no?
[07:40] <ibert> anybody knows why wol is turned off while halting the machine?
[07:40] <ivoks> elfreakz: most popular packages on DVD
[07:40] <ivoks> lemonsCC: if it's popular, yes
[07:40] <elfreakz> ivoks, what can i do with it?
[07:40] <lemonsCC> ivoks: you want all my machines running ubuntu?
[07:41] <ivoks> lemonsCC: sure
[07:41] <ivoks> elfreakz: install from DVD, not from internet - faster, cheaper
[07:41] <lemonsCC> ivoks: will do....the pentium MMX may take a second..lol
[07:41] <elfreakz> ivoks, aaarrr ic ehehehe now i know
[07:41] <ivoks> ummm... i sound like those tv commercials :)

[07:42] <david83> i heared about gpl graphics drivers is it possible to start the 3d enhancer with them?
[07:42] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, i was like asking around about ubuntu, everybody is like giving me weird face :p as if im a nerd :p
[07:43] <corevette> ivoks, not taht i know of, all i did was a complete removal of xgl

[07:44] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, yea they all run xp, even in my college run with xp
[07:44] <ghoul83> fat32 :D
[07:44] <corevette> ivoks, # kills it.  10 seconds should be long enough for X, but Xgl may need 20 or 25.
[07:44] <lemonsCC> ivoks: thanks
[07:45] <ivoks> corevette: kills?
[07:45] <ivoks> corevette: that's grep :)
[07:45] <ortega10> UbuntuCE: it used to be fat32, but now with full ntfs compatibility through ntfs-3g, pick the one you like
[07:45] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, upgrades still 66%
[07:45] <corevette> ivoks, huh?
[07:45] <ivoks> corevette: just run that command and paste output
[07:45] <corevette> i did
[07:45] <ivoks> corevette: grep Xgl /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
[07:45] <wajig> is there a channel for ppc users?

[07:45] <ivoks> corevette: oh... :)
[07:46] <ortega10> UbuntuCE: yes it can, and although that support isn't as old and stable as fat32, everyone says it works like a charm
[07:46] <lemonsCC> wajig: dont think so
[07:46] <Bakefy> Does anyone have a suggestion for an HTML editor?
[07:46] <corevette> ivoks, any idea?

[07:47] <ivoks> lemonsCC: ok :)
[07:47] <soulfreshner> it works fine if I restart my machine
[07:48] <ivoks> corevette: so, when you boot ubuntu, gdm doesn't start?
[07:48] <ortega10> UbuntuCE: but you can install it easily with synaptic
[07:48] <soulfreshner> is there some service I need to restart (other than networking?
[07:48] <nolimitsoya> UbuntuCE, dont use ntfs3g for sharingfiles
[07:48] <Bakefy> corevette, I found it
[07:48] <corevette> ivoks, no
[07:48] <UbuntuCE> nolimitsoya: why not?

[07:53] <UbuntuCE> nolimitsoya: thanks. is there a windows programm to transfor ntfs partiotion into ext2(3)?
[07:53] <corevette> ivoks should i put it in pastebin?
[07:53] <Bakefy> fatsheep, system > Preferences > Preferred Applications
[07:53] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I tried what you suggested, and I got errors
[07:53] <nolimitsoya> UbuntuCE, no thats impossibe
[07:54] <ivoks> corevette: yeah, that would be ok
[07:54] <Volstrup> anybody who knows when the mozilla-mplayer will be working together with Firefox 2.0?
[07:54] <nolimitsoya> Volstrup, it is as of right now
[07:54] <superjon> Volstrup: Use mozplugger
[07:55] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: when I sudid dhclient3, it did some pinging to 255.255.255.255 and said "No DHCPOFFERS received  No working leases in persistent database - sleeping"
[07:55] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: what did it say?
[07:55] <lemonsCC> anyone know if its possible to regenerate EXIF thumbnails?  I rotate, crop, redeye pictures and the thumbnail never changes
[07:55] <fatsheep> Bakefy: thanks but I'm looking for where *all* the file-program association rules are stored
[07:55] <Volstrup> superjon: mozplugger?
[07:55] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: then I tried to ping the gateway anyway, it said "connect: Network is unreachable"
[07:55] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: but eth0 is up
[07:55] <fatsheep> Preferred Applications is just for the web browser, email, text editor and a couple other things
[07:55] <nikin> fatsheep: that stuff depends on the file managger
[07:56] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: and eth0 has an ip adress
[07:56] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: it was actually trying with both eth0 and eth1
[07:56] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: ok, but do they have an ip?
[07:56] <corevette> ivoks anything specifically i should be looing at in that file...while it loads to pastebin??
[07:56] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: I don't see why they shouldn't... I wonder why it tried to connect to 255.255.255.255 though
[07:56] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: that's not my gateway
[07:57] <Volstrup> superjon: how do I configure mozplugger?
[07:57] <ivoks> corevette: 'EE' strings
[07:57] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: the dhcp client "pings"/broadcasts on the complete net available, for an dhcp offer
[07:57] <fatsheep> nikin: you mean nautilus?
[07:57] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: it is normal behaviour

[07:58] <nikin> fatsheep: i think so, i use ROX-filer and it has not he same assoc as i had with nautilus
[07:58] <superjon> Volstrup: Look in the wiki or google. Its not that hard

[07:58] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: yes, it will try "forever" until an dhcp offer is recieved
[07:58] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: alright... I don't suppose I can tell it the IP of my gateway, though...
[07:59] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: have you tried to assign an ip manualy?
[07:59] <ivoks> corevette: upload whole file
[07:59] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: yes, but it keeps resetting when I close the window

[07:59] <nolimitsoya> swami, no

[08:00] <nolimitsoya> swami, i was just being a smartass, instead of giving you the proverbial !anyone
[08:00] <SilverDrake> conreyt: because k3b rawks
[08:00] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: do "ifconfig" and write down the ipadress and default gateway.
[08:00] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: okay..
[08:01] <ivoks> corevette: according to this, everything is ok
[08:01] <swami> hmmm i have some problems with my sata...i activate the package...but it gives me an error
[08:01] <corevette> ivoks let me try restarting..please please stay on, your my only hope
[08:01] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: then loook in /etc/resolv.conf and write down the nameserver entries (not needed if you can access the slackware filesystem from ubuntu)
[08:01] <lemonsCC> is there a way to see the ip of everything on your network?
[08:01] <ivoks> i'm here
[08:01] <ivoks> lemonsCC: yes
[08:01] <lemonsCC> ivok: do tell please....
[08:01] <ivoks> lemonsCC: nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24 for example :)
[08:01] <ironfroggy_LT> has anyone here even used CUPS?
[08:02] <ironfroggy_LT> or am i wasting my time?
[08:02] <ivoks> don't leave your home without nmap
[08:02] <corevette> ivoks, unless you had another idea
[08:02] <lemonsCC> ivok what is the /24 for
[08:02] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: wait, you wanted me to do ifconfig now?  if so, the command isn't found in slackware
[08:02] <ivoks> lemonsCC: your network
[08:02] <ivoks> lemonsCC: what's your network?
[08:02] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: then in ubuntu in open 2 terminals

[08:02] <lemonsCC> nmap is the package name?
[08:03] <ivoks> yes
[08:03] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: then ifconfig should be available... (/sbin/ifconfig)
[08:03] <lemonsCC> ivoks: you never know it could have been nmap-common =)
[08:03] <HuibertGill> SilverDrake: try again please
[08:03] <corevette> ivoks, ok the error came up
[08:03] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: okay, okay, there we go
[08:04] <lemonsCC> ivoks: what do you mean whats my network?

[08:06] <SilverDrake> HuibertGill: nothing against you
[08:06] <ivoks> lemonsCC: your network is 192.168.1.0/24, not 192.168.0.0/24
[08:06] <corevette> ivoks, should i try to configure GDM to make it so it doesn't use XGL?
[08:06] <ivoks> corevette: remove that file and try again

[08:13] <KarboN> LjL, thanks! :)
[08:14] <KarboN> \o
[08:14] <ivoks> corevette: so, X starts, but gdm doesn't
[08:14] <james296> well, I get a feeling because of how fast ppl send messages on this ppl wont get my question
[08:14] <ivoks> corevette: then your gdm is misconfigured
[08:14] <corevette> ivoks, yes...because it's looking for xgl
[08:14] <ivoks> corevette: are you sure? how do you know that?
[08:14] <yhanno> I installed windows on a second partition and now i need help installing grub
[08:14] <LjL> james296: it's possible, but then repeating "well?" won't help much with that. myself, i've seen your question, and i simply don't know the answer
[08:14] <yhanno> my boot partition is located in /dev/sda1
[08:15] <corevette> when i do the gdm restart thing, it says GDM: XGL not found /usr/bin/xgl
[08:15] <yhanno> anyone_
[08:15] <ivoks> yhanno: eh...
[08:15] <james296> damn, I JUST instaled this again...and now I need to do it again just because of this? or is there a way to reset the default settings??
[08:15] <ivoks> yhanno: grab an install CD
[08:15] <ivoks> yhanno: you have rescue option on it
[08:15] <LjL> corevette: erm... perhaps if you've installed and later removed Xgl, you should modify back your config files accordingly ;)
[08:15] <ghoul83> how can i reactivate an linux system after a Windows Installation wiped out the bootloader infos?
[08:16] <LjL> Ubotu, tell ghoul83 about grub | ghoul83, see the private message from Ubotu
[08:16] <yhanno> cant i use the live cd?
[08:16] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, done but at the end it say E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
[08:16] <yhanno> ivoks:
[08:16] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: thats find run "sudo apt-get install vlc"
[08:16] <PSP-Center> http://pspcenter.c.la/
[08:16] <ghoul83> LjL thx
[08:16] <LjL> james296: there certainly is a way, you just need to know what gconf key you changed :-P and i don't know that
[08:17] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, i think its working, asking me type Y/N
[08:17] <lemonsCC> y
[08:17] <lemonsCC> lol
[08:17] <ortega10> how do i play midi files in gstreamer-based players or vlc ?
[08:17] <yhanno> ivoks: can i use tge live cd?
[08:17] <ivoks> corevette: add your gdm.conf to pastebin
[08:17] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: you didnt have the right repos enabled (translation: it didn't know where to look)
[08:17] <james296> well, when I move windows, it actually automatically puts a grid like box in place of the window itself
[08:18] <ivoks> yhanno: i think so, yes
[08:18] <yhanno> how?
[08:18] <james296> but, is there a way to reset all of the settings to default?
[08:18] <Music_Shuffle2> Yeah.
[08:18] <Music_Shuffle2> Reinstall.
[08:18] <Belter_> anybody managed to get a Belkin FSD7000 wireless nic going in v6.10
[08:18] <Music_Shuffle2> There should be another, more educated way, but I prefer to just start anew.
[08:18] <nikin> ortega: is it a must to use gstreamer or VLC?
[08:18] <james296> besides reinstalling theres no point in doing that for one stupid thing
[08:19] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, so the thing i copy and paste from u, will get everything work now?
[08:19] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: most things
[08:19] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, what seem to be the problem just now?

[08:30] <ghoul83> Elendil  did you check the cheatcodes?
[08:30] <Elendil> no
[08:30] <Elendil> where are these cheatcodes?
[08:30] <lemonsCC> hmm
[08:30] <igor> no....the small buttons....do you knows that king of keyboards that have some buttons to control de volume, play, etc....

[08:32] <webmaren> i'm on i686
[08:32] <ghoul83> Elendil  there you will have to press F1 - F9 to get some commandline options that you can you
[08:32] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: your data should be fine...BUT you can never backup enough
[08:33] <macozz> Anyone kown how to fix the samba upgrade problem in edgy?

[08:35] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: well you dont want to UNmount do you...i thought you wanted to mount
[08:36] <borg> if ubuntu is debian based, why i dont get why it's not recommended to not use other debian repositories
[08:36] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, vlc cant import the whole folder to the player
[08:36] <lemonsCC> can it open a single file?
[08:36] <lemonsCC> elfreakz: it may just want a playlist of someform

[08:37] <Elendil> ghoul: i got a nvidia geforce 7800 GT
[08:37] <yeti> borg: it's not that hard to understand, is it? italian is also "latin-based", you could say. nevertheless you wouldn't speak latin when visiting italy
[08:37] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, maybe i should try other player...
[08:37] <lemonsCC> corevette: locate gdm.conf will show you

[08:38] <jobs> butr it cam the error The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly
[08:38] <yeti> borg: nobody's saying that debian repositories will not work, it's just that serious problems might occur and nobody has the time to help you with these problems then. so: do it, but you're on your own with it.
[08:38] <ghoul83> Elendil  i see :D

[08:46] <Belter_> anybody using a Belkin BCM4306 wireless network card with Ubuntu 6.10

[08:46] <anchor> Hey guys what's the better purchase: 74 gig raptor drive with 8mb cache or 36.7 gig raptor drive with 16mb cache?
[08:46] <Ashura> !interfaces
[08:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about interfaces - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:46] <anchor> same price  for both.
[08:46] <xibalba> what's the main diff betwen ubunutu and say..fedora? or any other linux distro really
[08:46] <darius> ubuntu is debian
[08:46] <ghoul83> Elendil but maybe you could just unplug the second monitor?
[08:46] <xibalba> anchor, dont get raptors
[08:46] <darius> slightly different commands
[08:47] <elfreakz> lemonsCC, still there?
[08:47] <xibalba> they price/performance is no longer worth it
[08:47] <vero> i can see No valid modes for "1680x1050_75.00"; removing.
[08:47] <anchor> any reason why?
[08:47] <Elendil> hmm i tried ghoul] 
[08:47] <darius> little things like sudo
[08:47] <vero> do yiou know about it?
[08:47] <darius> performance fedora is better than ubuntu
[08:47] <xibalba> they're only like 2-3% faster tan a sata drive now
[08:47] <anchor> hmmm, what do you recommend then?
[08:47] <xibalba> 16mb cache wd cavier
[08:47] <corevette> gdm is looking for the old xserver (xgl) which i uninstalled, and theres an error everytime i start onto ubuntu, so i'm stuck in recovery mode....any help please?
[08:47] <ghoul83> Elendil :/
[08:47] <xibalba> sata
[08:47] <susscorfa> when i cant boot with the live cd, do i have change when i install with a alternate cd for having a working system
[08:48] <xibalba> i dont see any difference between the linux distros
[08:48] <meefs> hey guys, how can I determine which version (LTS, EDGY) of ubuntu I'm running?
[08:48] <Belter_> Belkin BCM4306 wireless nic, anubody installed one yet?
[08:48] <darius> some faster some better different=ce in commands
[08:48] <xibalba> i've been using bsd too long
[08:49] <sanders> Can someone talk me through setting up wireless on ubuntu, am having a nightmare (am on ubuntu now wired connection)
[08:49] <corevette> xibalba some are better with different desktop gui, like ubuntu is mainly gnome unless you get kubuntu....but like SuSe uses KDE by default
[08:49] <xibalba> that's it?
[08:50] <dthomas> doesn't recent suse use gnome now?
[08:50] <corevette> gdm is looking for the old xserver (xgl) which i uninstalled, and theres an error everytime i start onto ubuntu, so i'm stuck in recovery mode....any help please?
[08:50] <deejoe> oh, so why the heck would 'aptitude install postfix' want to bring in emacs21?
[08:51] <dthomas> xibalba: there are other differences, like different package management systems, differences in what packages they include by default, support lifetimes, how up to date they are, etc.
[08:52] <dthomas> xibalba: but, yeah, that's pretty much it.  they've all got basically the same kernel.
[08:52] <xibalba> and same userland software
[08:52] <xibalba> im diggin linux for the desktop, but definetly not a server.
[08:52] <xibalba> been thinking of trying desktopBSD though
[08:52] <dthomas> xibalba: largely, yes.  some have different management interfaces, like suse has yast.
[08:53] <xibalba> yast == yum == pkg_add (BSD)
[08:53] <xibalba> it's all the same
[08:53] <dthomas> well, yast does a lot more than package management last time i used it, like various kinds of configuration (f.e. networking).
[08:54] <meefs> xibalba, ubuntu is probably one of the best desktop linux distro's I've ever used
[08:54] <lemonsCC> elfreakz leave?
[08:54] <meefs> its very integrated
[08:54] <dthomas> xibalba: it's actually pretty hard for me to sit here and think up significant differences.  i guess fedora and rh have selinux by default, and you might consider that significant.
[08:54] <ashmo> Okay... Hypothetical situation: the user who is also the admin and main user of a system wishes to mount a harddisk for porn^H^H^H^Hprivate data. What would be an apropriate mount point under the hierarchy standard?
[08:55] <meefs> can anyone tell me how to determine *which* ubuntu version I'm running?
[08:55] <killer> kkk
[08:55] <meefs> uname -a doesn't have it
[08:55] <xibalba> SE Linux I think came from the TrustedBSD project
[08:55] <ashmo> meefs: Are you on GNOME?
[08:55] <meefs> yes
[08:55] <lemonsCC> ashmo: you can set any mount point
[08:55] <killer> meefs really?
[08:55] <meefs> yes
[08:55] <ashmo> meefs: menu -> System -> About Ubuntu?
[08:55] <meefs> ok
[08:56] <lemonsCC> ashmo: media and mnt are the normal places
[08:56] <ashmo> lemonsCC: but that seems so upcluttering and random.
[08:56] <meefs> ok
[08:56] <meefs> cool
[08:56] <ashmo> Not to say non-semantic
[08:56] <lemonsCC> ashmo: howso?
[08:56] <meefs> like I had thought, drapper LTS 6.06
[08:56] <meefs> thanks
[08:56] <ashmo> OTOH, /porn may be a bit too blunt =P
[08:56] <thonisas> s
[08:56] <thonisas> #xbins
[08:57] <lemonsCC> ashmo: /media/private is better
[08:57] <lemonsCC> or /media/files, /media/dont_touch
[08:57] <ashmo> lemonsCC: isn't /media for CDs, etc?

[08:58] <mnoir> !ask
[08:58] <ghoul83> cristi just ask don't as to ask
[08:58] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:58] <lemonsCC> ashmo: media gets an icon on the desktop and mnt doesnt is the difference
[08:58] <cristi> my question is:how to install an aplication from the web?
[08:58] <pantalaimon_> damn.. configuring parallel port joystick on ubuntu is too complicated
[08:58] <ashmo> lemonsCC: ah, so mnt makes more sense if most users won't have access.
=== aceZ is now known as acez
[08:59] <nunod> cristi, whats the app?
[08:59] <lemonsCC> ashmo: well they will still have access...IF they know where to look
[08:59] <ghoul83> pantalaimon why even use it? :D
[08:59] <cristi> opera
[08:59] <lemonsCC> ashmo: have it mount in YOUR home folder
[08:59] <mnoir> cristi: is it in source, exec, deb form?
[08:59] <ashmo> Not if it's -r, right?
[08:59] <cristi> it is an archive

[08:59] <ubotu> cristi: opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[09:00] <lemonsCC> ashmo: you could mount it with nouser
[09:00] <neobyte420> hello all
[09:00] <neobyte420> i need some help
[09:00] <lemonsCC> ashmo: then only root can mount it
[09:00] <cristi> oke...i will lok over that
[09:00] <FirstStrike> neobyte420: ask your question
[09:00] <lemonsCC> ashmo: assuming you have the only root access
[09:00] <neobyte420> im tring to get around this NAT problem m having
[09:00] <ghoul83> !ask
[09:00] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:00] <ashmo> I do. It's mostly a private system.
[09:00] <neobyte420> im using Azureus
[09:00] <hanasaki> wehre is the "Reset passwd" on the forums?
[09:01] <neobyte420> i want to allow connections to get a better download speed
[09:01] <neobyte420> it says i have a NAT error
[09:01] <cristi> but??? what does root means and how i login to root???
[09:01] <mnoir> !root
[09:01] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:01] <neobyte420> do i need to change my iptables or portforwarding?
[09:01] <Jhuri> ))
[09:01] <neobyte420> and if so...how do i do that?
[09:01] <lemonsCC> ashmo: so you could a) mount it in your home folder b) -r c) nouser
[09:01] <Jhuri> nat is arouter thing
[09:01] <ghoul83> neobyte420 portforwarding!
[09:01] <ghoul83> neobyte420 in your router
[09:02] <neobyte420> im on DSL
[09:02] <FirstStrike> neobyte420: your modem probably has a builtin firewall
[09:02] <FirstStrike> turn on UPnP in azureus
[09:02] <neobyte420> my ubuntu box connects to the modem
[09:02] <neobyte420> i checked the modem
[09:02] <ashmo> lemonsCC: Hm... nouser sounds sensible. For some reason my NTFS drives are already mounted readable for root only, too.
[09:02] <brussel> I have a non standard keyboard and many basic keys aren't right. like the Escape key or the alt-tab. How do I fix it?
[09:02] <javaJake> Who here is running ndiswrapper, and is willing to do a small thing for me?
[09:02] <sparkling> did someone have tried xgl with nvidia board?
[09:02] <sc0tt> brussel: system > preferences > keyboard
[09:03] <neobyte420> the UPnP is running
[09:03] <ashmo> lemonsCC: That's "nouser" in fstab instead of "defaults", right?
[09:03] <brussel> I've played with system/preferences/keyboard, no luck
[09:03] <hexdream> Could anybody assist with an Evolution/gpg problem?
[09:03] <cristi> how to install a open source as SSH?
[09:03] <lemonsCC> ashmo: i think nouser would require you to "sudo mount </dev/blah>"
[09:03] <lemonsCC> ashmo: yes
[09:03] <ashmo> Aye. I'll do that then.
[09:03] <javaJake> Can someone check /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper and /etc/modprobe.d/options to see if there's an ndiswrapper "options" entry in either?
[09:03] <blue-frog> sparkling: yes
[09:03] <lemonsCC> ashmo: you can always tweak it

[09:04] <ghoul83> how can i register with this irc server? :D
[09:04] <lemonsCC> isnt ntfs passwordable anyway?
[09:04] <sparkling> blue-frog what howto have you used? or can you tell me what i have to do? i've tried a lot of howtos without results
[09:04] <javaJake> !register
[09:04] <ubotu> Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[09:04] <dthomas> ok, i did another install, and i guess server installs no mta by default.  which is kind of, uh... weird, since mdadm starts by default and is set to e-mail root when there's a problem.
[09:04] <blue-frog> javaJake: got my nick since 1998...
[09:04] <cristi> how to install a open source as SSH?can u tell me???

[09:06] <recu> i have no shared library ld-linux.so.2. What can replace it? (I have  ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)
[09:06] <javaJake> Can someone check /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper and /etc/modprobe.d/options to see if there's an ndiswrapper "options" entry in either?
[09:06] <mnoir> dabju: have you tried #gimp?
[09:06] <brussel> I have a non standard keyboard and many basic keys aren't right. like the Escape key or the alt-tab. How do I fix it? Keyboard just gives you default layouts. I have a keyboard not supported by it though so it doesn't help. Keytouch is just as worthless. I need to find and edit the system file by hand.
[09:06] <dabju> thanks
[09:06] <javaJake> recu, I highly doubt you'll get an answer here with such a big question. :(

[09:08] <KNY> Arwen, no
[09:08] <recu> javaJake: let me check how it was solved in my laptop...
[09:08] <dabju> mnoir, I'm not getting an answer in #gimp
[09:08] <Arwen> KNY, do I have to specify a size?
[09:08] <javaJake> recu, OK, so it may be Ubuntu's fault, but that doesn't matter - what matters is that people here are probably not going to know. This channel is really more or less useful only for common problems.
[09:08] <beetlejuice> when i try to boot it says kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs...
[09:08] <javaJake> Can someone check /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper and /etc/modprobe.d/options to see if there's an ndiswrapper "options" entry in either?
[09:08] <KNY> Arwen, what file structure?
[09:08] <Arwen> KNY, ?
[09:08] <SniZ> root@sniz:/home/sniz# modprobe nvidia
[09:08] <SniZ> FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/volatile/nvidia.ko': No such file or directory
[09:08] <xibalba> can someone nmap me on port 62806?
[09:08] <KNY> fat? ntfs?
[09:09] <SniZ> i installed restricted modules
[09:09] <Arwen> KNY, fat32
[09:09] <SniZ> why its not work?
[09:09] <webmaster> join #ubuntu-fr
[09:09] <KNY> mkfs.vfat

[09:09] <KNY> mkfs.vfat --help
[09:09] <Justy-> ops
[09:09] <Justy-> Sorry i forgot to type /join
[09:09] <hexdream> I have followed the instruction to use gpg with evolution, and all looks good until I try send a signed mail. When I try send it gives an error about not being able to connecty to seahorse
[09:09] <Arwen> KNY, if I mkfs.vat /dev/sdb1, will that format the whole drive?
[09:09] <recu> javaJake: i SHOULD know all about shared libs.. i'll learn more
[09:09] <KNY> Arwen, yes
[09:09] <javaJake> recu, heheh
[09:09] <Arwen> KNY, thanks
[09:10] <javaJake> Can someone check /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper and /etc/modprobe.d/options to see if there's an ndiswrapper "options" entry in either?
[09:10] <Arwen> KNY, last thing, do I need root?
[09:10] <Justy-> bye
[09:10] <KNY> Arwen, np
[09:10] <KNY> Arwen, IIRC, no
[09:10] <Reilithion> My friend has a network interface that is working under slackware but not under Ubuntu.  Can someone help us discover the correct settings to use under Ubuntu?
[09:10] <javaJake> Come on guys, it's a simple favor.... :P
[09:10] <Reilithion> She is running Kubuntu from the Live CD
[09:10] <Arwen> KNY, oh wait... last thing, should I use fat16 or fat32 for a 1 Gig?
[09:10] <nido> Hello
=== nido is now known as Nido_Media
[09:10] <dabju> My Wacom drawing tablet is working, but the gimp don't find it as an extended device. What should I do?
[09:10] <javaJake> No one here knows how to run cat or grep? :D
[09:10] <lemonsCC> javaJake: i dont have wireless so i cant help
[09:10] <neobyte420> javaJake, how did u fix that nat error?
[09:10] <KNY> Arwen, fat32
[09:11] <Arwen> JavaDeveloper, I do, but what are you trying to do?
[09:11] <blue-frog> Arwen: do you want to boot from usb flash?
[09:11] <javaJake> lemonsCC, ok
[09:11] <neobyte420> i think i need to enable port forwarding
[09:11] <Arwen> blue-frog, no
[09:11] <blue-frog> Arwen: then 32 is fine
[09:11] <Arwen> blue-frog, well actually, yes
[09:11] <javaJake> neobyte420, it's going to be your router, probably.
[09:11] <javaJake> I had that too
[09:11] <javaJake> And it was
[09:11] <neobyte420> im getting alitlle download rate of 1 to 2 KB/s
[09:11] <ghoul83> lol i can send me a PM :)
[09:11] <Nido_Media> javaJake: cat and grep are terminal programs; you most likely use them in a piped construction. IE: iwconfig | grep ath0
[09:11] <Arwen> blue-frog, does the type matter when booting?
[09:11] <lemonsCC> javaJake: figured i would tell so you wouldn't get too angry =)
[09:11] <javaJake> Nido_Media, yep.
[09:11] <blue-frog> Arwen: according to howto i followed yes
[09:11] <neobyte420> javaJake, im connected to the modenm
[09:12] <Nido_Media> I'm from gentoo
[09:12] <javaJake> lemonsCC, lol... just can't imagine no one here wouldn't have ndiswrapper. :P
[09:12] <xibalba> anyone ever try bittorrent over tOr?
[09:12] <beetlejuice> when i try to boot it says kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs...
[09:12] <lemonsCC> most of the 950 ppl are not "here"
[09:12] <javaJake> neobyte420, ah, ok. it could be your ISP... they sometimes block/slow down this stuff.
[09:12] <Arwen> xibalba, nobody else here is a script kiddy
[09:12] <javaJake> neobyte420, or your firewall
[09:12] <beetlejuice> anyone know?
[09:12] <neobyte420> wtf...my ISP is caping my bittorrents?
[09:12] <Nido_Media> Anyway; is there a way I can tell ubuntu it should be using my Sound Blaster Live card rather then my ICH5 motherboard chipset to play back audio?
[09:12] <xibalba> uhh, script kiddy?
[09:12] <Arwen> xibalba, and DOS attacks aren't funny
[09:12] <neobyte420> how can this be
[09:12] <xibalba> who the fuck is trying to DDOS?
[09:13] <lemonsCC> neobyte420: rofl its possible
[09:13] <LjL> !language | xibalba
[09:13] <ubotu> xibalba: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:13] <xibalba> i'm just asking if someone had run BT over THE ONION ROUTER
[09:13] <xibalba> you dumb fuck
[09:13] <neobyte420> is there anything i can do to work around that
[09:13] <ghoul83> neobyte420 in a azureus irc channel you would be much better supported i guess :D
[09:13] <neobyte420> ok
[09:13] <Arwen> <xibalba> anyone ever try bittorrent over tOr?
[09:13] <javaJake> neobyte420, anything that could block port 6667 (that is the port set, right?) needs to be checked.
[09:13] <lemonsCC> who was banned?
[09:13] <Arwen> oh well, a bit late
[09:13] <Arwen> lemonsCC, xibalba
[09:13] <lemonsCC> for?
[09:14] <mnoir> !language
[09:14] <lemonsCC> i wasn't watching
[09:14] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:14] <lemonsCC> ahh
[09:14] <LjL> lemonsCC: xibalba, for swearing
[09:14] <ghoul83> cut himself the op-status?
[09:14] <javaJake> ghoul83, hmm?
[09:15] <lemonsCC> yes
[09:15] <ghoul83> * LjL entfernt Op-Status bei LjL funny
[09:15] <lemonsCC> op status attracts questions/issues
[09:15] <graham_100> can i have macromedia flash player on firefox 2??
[09:15] <Lynoure> Arwen: it does not a script kiddy make, automatically. I could see other uses for it, like the common downloading of stuff of guestionable copyright. But as far as I know, it does not work well, not designed for Torrenting.
[09:15] <LjL> like these ones
[09:15] <Erudition> hi
[09:15] <lemonsCC> lol
[09:15] <Arwen> Lynoure, it's a DOS attack on the tor network
[09:16] <lemonsCC> there should be invisible ops
[09:16] <Erudition> Is there a way i can disable ipv6 globally
[09:16] <Cpudan80> Hello
[09:16] <Cpudan80> Anyone know where I can find a 6.10 DVD?
[09:16] <Lynoure> Arwen: Maybe as the result, but probably not by intent.
[09:16] <ghoul83> Erudition why?
[09:16] <Lynoure> Arwen: and no scripts involved.
[09:16] <LjL> Lynoure, the tor network has limited bandwidth resources, and people using it for p2p are the main reason why it's so slow
[09:17] <neobyte420> javaJake, i have turned off my firestarter firewall
[09:17] <Arwen> Lynoure, the torrent app would be the script
[09:17] <Arwen> LjL, and the latency
[09:17] <Erudition> ghoul83 my router doesn't support it and I can't query the dns with v6
[09:17] <javaJake> neobyte420, ah, that was probably doing it.
[09:17] <NaDy> Could anyone tell me how do I install an DHCP network on Ubuntu?
[09:17] <neobyte420> nothing that i am aware of should be causing this NAT error
[09:17] <Lynoure> Arwen: Like I said, probably not by intent.
[09:17] <LjL> Lynoure: well, i think the tor FAQ or something make it clear that it should not be used for p2p
[09:18] <Erudition> NaDy: ubuntu sets devices up as dhcp detect automatically
[09:18] <neobyte420> maybe if i turn on the firewall...and enable it to forward the TCP & UDP packects it will work
[09:18] <javaJake> neobyte420, um, wait, turning off Firestarter doesn't turn off the firewall. Firestarter itself isn't the firewall - it merely lets you control the firewall built into Linux.
[09:18] <Lynoure> Arwen: but sorry, this is getting off-topic, we can continue on #ubuntu-offtopic
[09:18] <Arwen> I've got a weird issue, whenever I plug in a flash drive, a link appears on my desktop to /media/cdrom - what's with that?
[09:18] <Cpudan80> Anyone...?
[09:18] <Cpudan80> Ubuntu DVD on a mirror?
[09:18] <Cpudan80> No torrent - too slow
[09:18] <recu> NaDy:easy: the network preferences
[09:18] <graham_100> *can somebody tell me if i can get macromedia flash plyer on my firefox2*
[09:18] <javaJake> neobyte420, you need to run Firestarter, and click the "Stop" button
[09:18] <ghoul83> Erudition but ipv6 isn't the only ip you got normaly you should have ipv4 and ipv6 at the same time so you router can use the ip4v stuff
[09:18] <Lynoure> LjL: Not the first person here not to read FAQs before asking :)
[09:18] <Arwen> Cpudan80, pssh, I could dcc it to you over dialup, that'd be slow
[09:18] <LjL> Cpudan80: only torrent i'm afraid
[09:18] <neobyte420> javaJake, how do i turn off the linux firewall then
[09:18] <hexdream> My evolution is throwing an error trying to connect to seahorse (gpg). is anybody able to assist?
[09:19] <neobyte420> ok
[09:19] <NaDy> but still not works, I only have IPv6 but I need IPv4
[09:19] <graham_100> *can somebody tell me if i can get macromedia flash plyer on my firefox2*
[09:19] <javaJake> neobyte420, you need to run Firestarter, and click the "Stop" button
[09:19] <graham_100> *can somebody tell me if i can get macromedia flash plyer on my firefox2*
[09:19] <LjL> !repeat | graham_100
[09:19] <Cpudan80> LjL: Well - you know of a high-speed torrent?
[09:19] <ubotu> graham_100: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[09:19] <Arwen> I've got a weird issue, whenever I plug in a flash drive, a link appears on my desktop to /media/cdrom - what's with that?
[09:19] <lemonsCC> graham stop spamming
[09:19] <neobyte420> ok i did that
[09:19] <neobyte420> now what
[09:19] <Arwen> graham_100, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[09:19] <neobyte420> restart azureus
[09:19] <Nido_Media> !patience
[09:19] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[09:19] <javaJake> graham_100, if you want version 9, let me know.
[09:19] <LjL> Cpudan80: the only torrent i know of is the official one. those are usually very fast here, but i've only ever tried the CDs
[09:20] <neobyte420> never mind
[09:20] <hexdream> graham_100: firefox should support flash. have you tried enabling the extra repositories?
[09:20] <neobyte420> there it goes
[09:20] <neobyte420> :)
[09:20] <neobyte420> ty javaJake
[09:20] <javaJake> Nido_Media, we should change that to "your attidude and how difficult your question is will determine..."
[09:20] <javaJake> :)
[09:20] <graham_100> javajake i don't know which i want
[09:20] <neobyte420> i have a green :-)
[09:20] <neobyte420> ty so very much
[09:20] <javaJake> graham_100, 9 is latest, works with all sites, but can crash. (Hasn't for me yet.)
[09:20] <neobyte420> i have learned something
[09:20] <graham_100> hexdream i dont know how to get into the repositaries for firefox
[09:20] <javaJake> graham_100, 9 also requires a manual installation
[09:20] <nokrev> Hey all. I've been working on getting WPA-PSK working with a WUSB54Gv4 (Linksys, Wireless USB network adapter), and a Netgear router. I've been trying to use ndiswrapper, and I've come really close, but I can't seem to make the connection.
[09:20] <graham_100> javajake i guess that would be the one i would want then
[09:21] <Reilithion> Do the Live CD's come with the tulip kernel module?
[09:21] <Arwen> !repositories | graham_100
[09:21] <ubotu> graham_100: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[09:21] <NaDy> I get pingreply from my network server but can't do anything else, help?
[09:21] <graham_100> javajake i would rather not manual install though so the older would be a better option for me
[09:21] <Arwen> graham_100, follow the instructions to add the multiverse and universe repositories
[09:21] <ghoul83> is it possible to connect to this irc server with SSL on?
[09:21] <redduck676> any tips on how to get a tap to behave like a click on G4?
[09:21] <lemonsCC> anyone know about nmap?
[09:21] <Arwen> then install flashplugin-nonfree
[09:21] <nokrev> Has anybody here gotten a WUSB54Gv4 to work with WPA?
[09:21] <Arwen> manual install is actually easier though
[09:21] <hexdream> graham_100: The repositories are for Ubuntu, not firefox. Try googling "easy ubuntu". It's a script that installs all the extras like codecs and useful restricted packages.
[09:21] <KNY> lemonsCC, Google does
[09:21] <Erudition> grr wrong button
[09:22] <graham_100> hexdream kkk
[09:22] <lemonsCC> kny google doesn't give good help, i tried
[09:22] <javaJake> graham_100, manual is easy to install.
[09:22] <recu> NaDy: the ifconfig tells you have an ip?
[09:22] <LjL> !flash9 | graham_100, javaJake
[09:22] <ubotu> graham_100, javaJake: flash9 is available from dapper-backports and edgy-backports now, see !backports
[09:22] <bigbro> lemonsCC: Indeed - if you had some questions regarding nmap and asked them, perhaps those of us who do know about it could answer them :)
[09:22] <Nido_Media> Okay; I've got two sound cards in my computer; the standard motherboard card; ICH5; and a Creative Sound Blaster Live. Right now, ubuntu wants to play back audio with the ICH5 soundcard; but I want it to use the Sound Blaster instead.
[09:22] <Erudition> anyway can anyone tell me if I can disable ipv6 for a certaindevice or even globally?
[09:22] <Cpudan80> Is Feisty stable?
[09:22] <javaJake> LjL, thanks!!
[09:22] <LjL> Cpudan80: no
[09:22] <lemonsCC> KNY:  the howto's are more confusing than nmap is
[09:22] <Cpudan80> LjL: So I guess I'll go with Dapper then...
[09:22] <javaJake> graham_100, ok, so you CAN install v9 quickly!
[09:22] <Music_Shuffle2> Nido_Media, System -> Preferences -> Sound
[09:22] <LjL> Cpudan80: err, there's Edgy as well
[09:22] <javaJake> !backports | graham_100
[09:22] <ubotu> graham_100: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[09:22] <Cpudan80> err sorry Edgy
[09:22] <hexdream> graham_100: If you are using a low bandwidth connection you may need to find somebody who can give you the extras on a disk.
[09:23] <bigbro> Erudition: Yes - you can do either. WHich would you prefer to do and why?
[09:23] <Music_Shuffle2> Cpudan80, Edgy yes.
[09:23] <Nido_Media> Music_Shuffle2: Thanks.
[09:23] <jherm> Anyone know how to install Ubuntu to a 4 TB disk?
[09:23] <graham_100> hexdream my isp is rubbish i struggle to get 256kbps on broadband
[09:23] <LjL> Cpudan80: the timeline is Breezy -> Dapper -> Edgy -> Feisty.  Feisty is not yet released, and there's no reason why you should use Breezy; on the other hand, there may be valid reasons to use Dapper over Edgy
[09:23] <lemonsCC> bigbro: i am trying to use nmap to find the ip's of all the computers on my network.  I put in "nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24" but i seems to miss my powerbook everytime
[09:23] <Music_Shuffle2> Best f luck.
[09:23] <graham_100> i am changing that too hope that causes no problems there
[09:23] <Nido_Media> This is how I want to use ubuntu. To get out of the terminal. Great!
[09:23] <Music_Shuffle2> jherm, the same way you install it to any other disk?
[09:24] <jherm> Music_Shuffle2, no BIOS cannot address greater than 2 TB
[09:24] <Arwen> graham_100, I'm on dialup - I just use patience
[09:24] <nn> From another machine on the network (dsl not ubuntu) how do i connect to the X login on my ubuntu box (which does allow remote logins by my configuration)
[09:24] <ghoul83> jherm, a 4 TB disk? nice hardware
[09:24] <jherm> Music_Shuffle2, something about GPT needed
[09:24] <Music_Shuffle2> jherm, install it to just one of the disks and then mount, couldn't you? >.>
[09:24] <Erudition> bigbro: my router acts as a dns server which forwards requests through to the ones set by my ISP, and these change quite often. But it can't handle ipva6 dns queries so I can't connect to MSN through GAIM, for example. in Firefox I'v manually disabled ipv6
[09:24] <hexdream> graham_100: :-) im using GPRS charged at extortion prices per MB. Essentially dial-up speed.  Our local telekoms monopoly is evil.
[09:24] <Arwen> nn, you need a client to login over network.... if its not built in, you'll have to find one and compile it
[09:24] <jherm> Music_Shuffle2, no GRUB will not install
[09:25] <redduck676> nn: fix the DISPLAY? use vnc?
[09:25] <ghoul83> nn, through ssh you have to set the pass X too option
[09:25] <redduck676> ssh X forwarding?
[09:25] <jherm> Music_Shuffle2, and grub will not boot
[09:25] <Music_Shuffle2> =[
[09:25] <Music_Shuffle2> There go MY plans for a 4 TB setup later. Heheheh.
[09:25] <graham_100> hexdream i am paying 26.99 per month for supposadly 8mb i get nowhere near that is why i am changing!
[09:25] <Arwen> any beryl users here?
[09:25] <jherm> Music_Shuffle2, i tried finding docs on GPT and Ubuntu, but it is allfor MacBooks
[09:25] <nn> Arwen: hmm, what kind of "client"?
=== GuBA_ is now known as gbarrero
[09:25] <bigbro> lemonsCC: Does your macbook respond to ICMP traffic?
[09:25] <Arwen> nn, a login client....
[09:25] <nn> Arwen: yea, but such as? :)
[09:26] <nn> redduck676: i'd really rather not use VNC for this, since it's two *nix boxen
[09:26] <bigbro> Erudition: Get an IPv6 tunnel from sixxs.net - job done?
[09:26] <Arwen> nn, no idea - both gnome and kde have one built-in, but....
[09:26] <leny> jherm: have you tried installing it within 2TB then growing the partition with parted. You may need a pc98 disk label... guessing
[09:26] <ghoul83> what driver do i need to read an ext3 disk from windows?
[09:26] <Erudition> hmm, I'l look into that
[09:26] <LjL> Ubotu, tell ghoul83 about ext3 | ghoul83, see the private message from Ubotu
[09:26] <nn> ghoul83: there's a few ext2 drivers but they are scary
[09:26] <redduck676> any tips on how to get a tap to behave like a click on G4?
[09:26] <hexdream> graham_100: shopping around is usually a good idea. I have a feeling that ISP's are having trouble with supplying enough broadband. I think its because ppl are abusing P2P.
[09:27] <Arwen> nn, not very scary
[09:27] <Arwen> ghoul83, try e2ifs... or whatever it was called
[09:27] <Arwen> ghoul83, just google ext3 windows
[09:27] <Garito> hi all
[09:27] <Reilithion> tulip driver.  Is it on the Live CD?
[09:27] <ghoul83> LjL, your my man :)
[09:27] <nn> Arwen: ext2ntfs 0.5 is a great driver, if you can get it setup
[09:27] <graham_100> hexdream i have decided to switch to toucan they offer me a better deal and being a low downloader i go on the priority stream during peak times :)
[09:28] <jherm> leny, thats a good idea
[09:28] <Arwen> nn, does it support ext3 journals?
[09:28] <Lattyware> help
[09:28] <LjL> ghoul83: note that as arwen pointed out, though, there are other solutions, including a stand-alone file browser that doesn't need you to install an IFS driver. google "ext2 windows" as well - for *reading* (not writing) ext3 is effectively the same as ext2
[09:28] <Garito> someone how knows how to activate 3d acceleration for a intel 82855?
[09:28] <nn> Arwen: No, it just ignores the journal
[09:28] <Arwen> nn, and I'm still trying to find a proper xfs driver
[09:28] <nn> Arwen: which is harmless, really
[09:28] <Arwen> nn, if it writes and ignores the journal?
[09:29] <leny> jherm: try ext2 first thenconvert after resizing last Ilooked parted doesn't resize ext3
[09:29] <graham_100> hexdream i went through the auto install of flash player and it said:   automatic installation failed due to network problems or upstream changes  : is this to do with my internet connection??
[09:29] <alex_> hi I have LEXAR flash 2Gig media, I got it mounted well into /media/LEXAR, I have a tutorial which I am trying to use to install a debiann system on it, the tutorial start with shred /dev/sdd, but my Lexar is mounted in /media ? any idea ?
[09:29] <Arwen> graham_100, you're using an old install script
[09:29] <hexdream> graham_100: what application gave you that error?
[09:29] <Arwen> graham_100, make sure the version number says 9.x.x.x.x
[09:29] <Garito> someone how wants to help me ?
[09:29] <nn> Arwen: harmless, the journal is only for fs ops that arent fully completed
[09:29] <lemonsCC> bigbro: how would i know?
[09:29] <jherm> leny, problem is that this is RAID5
[09:29] <LjL> alex_: ... shred? that's stupid, it'll ruing your card, what kind of tutorial is that?
[09:29] <jherm> leny, cant redothe array
[09:29] <Lynoure> LjL, Arwen: BTW, http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ says very little on bittorrent, the guy might have been genuenely ignorant of the effect even after reading the faq.
[09:29] <Arwen> nn, so if you crash while writing?
[09:29] <Garito> joder
[09:30] <Arwen> Lynoure, it says somewhere on there that P2P = BAN
[09:30] <nn> Arwen: then you're gonna have to fsck, same as before the journal came around
[09:30] <Arwen> last time I checked
[09:30] <nn> Arwen: it works exactly how ext2 worked
[09:30] <Arwen> nn, but will it be marked as dirty?
[09:30] <alex_> LjL,www.debian-administration.org/articles/179
[09:30] <graham_100> hexdream that was the mac flash player
[09:30] <Erudition> bigbro: I'd rather just disable ipv6, it doesn't really make much difference to me whether I have it or not
[09:30] <lemonsCC> bigbro: how would i know if my macbook supports icmp?  (sorry for the repeat)
[09:30] <LjL> Lynoure: maybe... still i can't care less, he's been abusive enough
[09:30] <nn> Arwen: that's debatable, personally any time i allowed a non kernel driver to write to my ext{2,3} fs, i'd force a fsck
[09:31] <nn> Arwen: the drivers simply arent very mature yet
[09:31] <Lynoure> LjL: I agree.
[09:31] <Arwen> nn, and the drivers for xfs and reiser are non-existant....
[09:31] <nn> Arwen: i gotta run, but i'll be back in a few hours if you care to continue this discussion
[09:31] <nn> Arwen: yeup
[09:31] <hexdream> graham_100: you running a MAC? not used one before so cant really give much help. Arwen did suggest that the scripts you have may be only. Have you done an update to your repositories?
[09:31] <alex_> LjL: shred is only to erase the content of the USB key, I don
[09:31] <graham_100> i tried a manual install beforee of mac 9 but it told me to delete a file *wich i did* and nothing seems to have taken effect!!
[09:31] <nn> Arwen: ext2/ext3's safest bet, but.. ymmv
[09:31] <bigbro> lemonsCC: DO you have it disabled at the firewall? Get it's IP address and try pinging it from another host?
[09:31] <leny> jherm: sorry don't know RAID thought it just looked like one disk although there were many.  Any milage in using LVM to add additional partitions?
[09:31] <alex_> LjL: t see why it could ruin my USB key
[09:31] <Arwen> graham_100, make sure you have backported updates enabled
[09:32] <Garito> hello
[09:32] <hexdream> graham_100: Sorry, finger slip. Meant to say your scripts may be outdated. ;-)
[09:32] <graham_100> hexdream i am not using a mac it's an AMD athlon XP 1600+ machine
[09:32] <jherm> leny, dunno
[09:32] <bigbro> lemonsCC: Some firewall configurations block ICMP traffic for no discernably good reason - under the misguided assumption that crackers are too stupid to find your computer using the myriad of other methods available to them.
[09:32] <alex_> LjL: ?
[09:32] <LjL> alex_: indeed, it probably won't, because there's the "-n 1" option set... see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Flash_file_systems and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear-levelling for the reason why writing to flash multiple times will ruin them (and shred normally *does* write quite a few times)
[09:32] <Erudition> bigbro: I'd rather just disable ipv6, it doesn't really make much difference to me whether I have it or not
[09:32] <graham_100> hmnm i haven't come across scripts yet so how do i update them??
[09:32] <lemonsCC> bigbro: you a genius disable the firewall and it showed up
[09:32] <bigbro> Erudition: rmmod ipv6 ?
[09:33] <LjL> alex_: i'd have used something like "dd" to achieve the same effect, but then as long as you take care to pass those option (especially -n 1), it should be good
[09:33] <Erudition> ok
[09:33] <_tcc> Why is vi retarded in Edgy?
[09:33] <bigbro> _tcc: Use vim.
[09:33] <_tcc> What the hell?
[09:33] <_tcc> It's not symlinked?
[09:33] <afief> What would be a good program to draw flow charts?
[09:33] <lemonsCC> bigbro: i assume this would fall under the "enable stealth mode" category?
[09:33] <nunod> afief, dia
[09:33] <bigbro> _tcc: Even if it is, it's often configured to react differently depending on how it's called.
[09:33] <hexdream> graham_100: oh, right. sorry. Try the repository update anyway. Click System / Administration / Synaptic package manager.
[09:34] <LjL> !dia | afief
[09:34] <bigbro> lemonsCC: Nope - that's something completely different.
[09:34] <ubotu> dia: Diagram editor. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.95.0-4ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 179 kB, installed size 528 kB
[09:34] <LjL> !kivio | afief

[09:34] <alex_> LjL: the problem is that is tells me that /media/LEXAR is a directory and even with -f it won't shred it, even with the second step of the tutorial with parted, it refuses to do it
[09:34] <francisco> Garito, my xorg.conf didnt help?
[09:34] <alex_> LjL: should I umount it before maybe ?
[09:34] <Garito> nope francisco
[09:35] <graham_100> hexdream do i just search for macromedia flash player in there?
[09:35] <Garito> i think i only need to install a 82855 correct driver
[09:35] <A-L-P-H-A> can someone tell me why when I do sudo apt-get remove totem-mozilla, apt-get wants to remove ubuntu-desktop??  All I want is VLC.
[09:35] <LjL> alex_: well, /media/LEXAR is where you *mounted* it, but the *device* will be some file in /dev, like (but not necessarily) the mentioned /dev/sdd
[09:35] <LjL> alex_: you certainly can't run shred over a directory, which is what /media/LEXAR is
[09:35] <graham_100> hexdream or would  it be adobe?
[09:35] <Arwen> A-L-P-H-A, ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package
[09:36] <Arwen> A-L-P-H-A, it depends on everything in ubuntu, but it doesn't do anything itself
[09:36] <Arwen> therefore, you can delete it if you want
[09:36] <alex_> LjL: yes that is what I thought but can I find the corresponding /dev file ?
[09:36] <stephan21_> can someone tell me if there is a way to upgrade from dapper to edgy while still kipping my settings
[09:36] <alex_> LjL: I have tried a ls -l /dev but no success
[09:36] <A-L-P-H-A> Arwen, thanks.  I wasn't sure why it was asking, but that explains it.
[09:36] <graham_100> stephan21_
[09:36] <LjL> alex_: type "mount" and, assuming the card is mounted correctly, you'll see what the device is.
[09:37] <stephan21_> ?
[09:37] <graham_100> stephan21_ i upgraded from dapper to edgy no problems
[09:37] <Arwen> heh, vista corporate's already been cracked
[09:37] <alex_> LjL: off course thanks
[09:37] <graham_100> i ran a backup disk of but i didn't need it
[09:37] <hexdream> graham_100: No. Click the reload package information first. Let the system update (may take a while). Once this is done, if you have the extra repositories installed you should be able to install the flashplayer either through the repository, or probably directly from firefox itself.
[09:37] <stephan21_> graham_100, how.... never did an upgrade in linux :/
[09:37] <Mwa> Hi
[09:37] <Arwen> graham_100, I upgraded and it killed my fstab, broke hibernate, and screwed my drivers...
[09:37] <LjL> however alex_, if you're not familiar with this kind of stuff, i think doing that soft of work with shred and the like runs you into a risk of destroying the wrong filesystem. be very careful. only work as root when you absolutely need to
[09:37] <Mwa> I'm having trouble installing ubuntu
[09:38] <graham_100> stephan21_  give me a moment i will see if i still have it ! i did it through the terminal took about 2 hours
[09:38] <LjL> alex_: by the way, see http://www.google.com/search?q=encrypted+site%3Ahelp.ubuntu.com&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 , we have a couple of howtos for encryption as well
[09:38] <stephan21_> ok
[09:38] <graham_100> arwen i guess it's luck of the draw really
[09:38] <Arwen> graham_100, I always recommend a fresh install
[09:39] <Arwen> :-\
[09:39] <alex_> LjL: yeah well its just USB key is not it ? and having a debian OS on it makes it interesting
[09:39] <graham_100> my mouse pointer just dissapearewd lol
[09:39] <leny> jher: Sorry to witter onbut you are using a 2.6 kerne are't you?
[09:39] <LjL> alex_: *that* is an usb key, but if you get the /dev/sdsomething (or whatever) wrong during a shred, dd, mkfs, etc command, you're likely to wipe or corrupt your hard drive, not the USB key
[09:39] <Mwa> Is there any way to disable the install of grub?
[09:39] <honix> hello! I don't see window's borders with Beryl, I thing is Emerlad but I don't know what to do.
[09:40] <alex_> LjL: ah yes sure
[09:40] <agent> why does pypanel in ubuntu require python2.5 when the real requirements are python2.2+?
[09:40] <graham_100> is there a ctrl + alt + del type command on edgy??
[09:40] <hexdream> I am getting an error connecting to seahorse (gpg)  when sending a mail (connection refused). Can anybody help?
[09:40] <leny> jherm: Oops - Sorry to witter on but you are using a 2.6 kernel aren't you?
[09:40] <jherm> yes
[09:40] <bigbro> graham_100: Yes - Ctrl+Alt+Del
[09:40] <jherm> leny, i have EFI flag on
[09:41] <Arwen> is there a specially designed filesystem for flash drives?
[09:41] <graham_100> bigbro doesn't do anything  lol is this normal?
[09:41] <jherm> Arwen, no
[09:41] <dothazard> #ubuntu-fr
[09:41] <Arwen> bigbro, that doesn't do anything... except in console mode
[09:41] <bigbro> graham_100: It's probably disabled. What are you actually trying to do?
[09:41] <stephan21_> can someone tell me if there is a way to upgrade from dapper to edgy while still kipping my settings
[09:41] <graham_100> stephan21_ i will be with you when i get my mouse back lol
[09:41] <bigbro> Arwen: That largely depends on how it's configured.
[09:41] <stephan21_> oh lol thanks
[09:41] <Arwen> bigbro, ctrl+alt+del in console forces a freboot, ctrl+alt+backspace on X causes X to restart
[09:42] <senjin> go in too www.rollforlife.se and vote in the poll pleas:D
[09:42] <agent> nm... silly xlib package dep is causing that...
[09:42] <francisco> garito, the one in edgy should give you glx
[09:42] <Arwen> I don't think there's a hotkey for the task list though
[09:42] <francisco> Garito, the driver in edgy I mean
[09:42] <Arwen> Garito, don't install breezy....
[09:42] <Garito> why?
[09:42] <bigbro> Arwen: No - really - it depends on how it's configured. I generally disable it, but it's often configured to call init 0 (reboot)
[09:42] <graham_100> i think my optical mouse is dead i put on a rollerball  one it's fine now
[09:42] <nolimitsoya> Garito, couse its old and riddled with problems
[09:42] <Arwen> bigbro, I know - talking defaults
[09:42] <Garito> the?
[09:42] <francisco> I also had glx in dapper, Garito
[09:42] <Garito> then?
[09:43] <Arwen> Garito, there's dapper and edgy now
[09:43] <hcjc92> 'win 3
[09:43] <hcjc92> my keyboard FAILS
[09:43] <Arwen> francisco, what's glx?
[09:43] <Garito> sure but don't want to upgrade
[09:43] <francisco> er dri in glx
[09:43] <leny> jherm: Have you tried ELILO? See http://sourceforge.net/projects/elilo
[09:43] <Garito> at least I want to activate 3d acceleration
[09:44] <francisco> what ubuntu are you using now, Garito
[09:44] <jherm> leny, grub2 works
[09:44] <Garito> garito@Portatil:~$ glxinfo | grep dir
[09:44] <Garito> direct rendering: No
[09:44] <Garito> OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
[09:44] <Jhuri> oi mates, ive got this problem when I install a 2.4 kernel the initrd in /boot is empty 0.o how do I fix that, how to create them manually?
[09:44] <Garito> dapper
[09:44] <einPaule> !su
[09:44] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:44] <Arwen> are there any beryl users here?
[09:44] <leny> jherm: I'll shut up now... :-(
[09:44] <LjL> !beryl
[09:44] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[09:44] <Arwen> Garito, graphics card?

[09:45] <_tcc> Where are the scripts that tell ubuntu to elicit a dhcp request?
[09:45] <_tcc> I want to turn that off....
[09:45] <Arwen> Garito, integrated... hrmm...
[09:45] <Arwen> Garito, why don't you buy a real grpahics card?
[09:45] <Garito> jajajajajaja
[09:45] <bigbro> _tcc: Configure your network interfaces to NOT use DHCP?
[09:45] <Garito> because then I buy a mac
[09:46] <_tcc> bigbro, uh yeah...?
[09:46] <einPaule> what was the page with all the !-commands like !su etc. with all the explanations
[09:46] <Garito> I have a travelmate 4002lmi
[09:46] <_tcc> bigbro, and the file is where?
[09:46] <noelferreira> lupine_85: are you there? Can you help me with rt61 and kernel 2.6.15-27-386 in dapper?
[09:46] <francisco> arwen dri works fine on 855, I can use beryl just as well
[09:46] <LjL> Ubotu, tell einPaule about bot | einPaule, see the private message from Ubotu
[09:46] <Arwen> francisco, that's not the issue...
[09:46] <graham_100> stephan21_ i think your best bet is to go to the ubuntu site and download the latest 6.10 version maybe put it on a cd and go that way i will try to remember how i did it you can try that method if you likeQ!
[09:46] <einPaule> thx LjL
[09:46] <bigbro> _tcc: Depends on the interface. There are graphical tools to do it. Is there a reason you want to modify the scripts directly?
[09:46] <_tcc> Because I am in a chrooted terminal?
[09:46] <Garito> then?
[09:46] <bigbro> _tcc: If so, check out /etc/network/
[09:46] <_tcc> I just need to disable that...
[09:47] <_tcc> I don't see anything there.
[09:47] <francisco> do tell us Arwen what the issue is
[09:47] <Arwen> francisco, he has an unsupported graphics card...
[09:47] <francisco> its not unsupported
[09:47] <Garito> the isue is beryl works but to sloooooow
[09:47] <bigbro> _tcc: Generally networking would be set up outside the chroot environment - I'm assuming you're on a Debian / Ubuntu system.
[09:47] <Garito> only because direct rendering is off
[09:47] <_tcc> bigbro, i am now
[09:47] <graham_100> hexdream i have found the flash player in synaptic i have gone for the flash player at the top
[09:47] <alex_> what is a USB thumbdrive as opposed to a USB flash media ? (a french asking)
[09:48] <francisco> beryl is slow for him becuause something is not configured correctly that is all
[09:48] <Garito> sure
[09:48] <_tcc> bigbro, i don't want it just randomly requesting addresses without the users constent
[09:48] <_tcc> that's stupid
[09:48] <Garito> but I don't what
[09:48] <Garito> thanks francisco
[09:48] <blue-frog> alex_: same thing
[09:48] <bigbro> _tcc: Networking would be a root level thing - users should not be involved. I don't see the issue.
[09:48] <Arwen> francisco, he said direct-rendering = 0
[09:48] <lostinc> Is there a way to permanently name USB devices like my external HD?
[09:48] <hexdream> graham_100: Thats great. That is the way I did it and I had no problems.
[09:48] <francisco> maybe you have the software rendering drivers installed...
[09:48] <alex_> blue-frog: thats what i THOUGHT
[09:48] <alex_> thanks
[09:48] <bigbro> _tcc: Either it has DHCP enabled interfaces - which must request an IP if one is required - or it does not.
[09:48] <Mwa> I'm having trouble installing ubuntu on a Macbook
[09:49] <Garito> how can I see this?
[09:49] <alex_> blue-frog: sorry I hit the caps key
[09:49] <francisco> arwen I have the same chipset and I get direct rendering
[09:49] <_tcc> bigbro, the issue is you are putting data onto the networking without them knowing
[09:49] <LjL> !username
[09:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about username - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:49] <_tcc> what if you don't want to interact with that dhcp server?
[09:49] <Mwa> Mainly with GRUB
[09:49] <graham_100> stephan21_   i think this is the command to upgrade from any version to 6.10  :>>>>    gksu "update-manager -c"
[09:49] <_tcc> So...
[09:49] <_tcc> I'm asking how you turn that off...
[09:49] <graham_100> correct me if i am wrong anybody
[09:49] <bigbro> _tcc: I'm really not sure what you want to achieve.
[09:49] <francisco> garito, open synaptic and search for glx
[09:49] <graham_100> :)
[09:49] <ghoul83> can a PCI Gigabit NIC be slower then a PCI-E equivalent?
[09:49] <Garito> ok
[09:49] <_tcc> bigbro, NOT REQUESTING AN ADDRESS
[09:49] <_tcc> On boot!
[09:49] <graulich> I want to run a perl script but a file it use()s isn't in @INC. what do I do?
[09:50] <LjL> !caps | _tcc
[09:50] <ubotu> _tcc: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[09:50] <_tcc> Ok.
[09:50] <bigbro> _tcc: Then don't configure your interfaces to request DHCP addresses. Job done.
[09:50] <francisco> Garito,  also can you paste your xorg.conf
[09:50] <Garito> sure
[09:50] <stephan21_> graham_100, i got it on cd...do i do that in the live cd /install?
[09:50] <Arwen> ghoul83, yes
[09:50] <Garito> where can i paste it?
[09:50] <LjL> !paste
[09:50] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[09:51] <francisco> Garito, use this site: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[09:51] <_tcc> You basically just told me what I said in the beginning of my question.
[09:51] <ghoul83> Arwen would the PCI-E get the 125MB/S?
[09:51] <Garito> yes
[09:51] <bigbro> _tcc: All the Debian / Ubuntu networking configuration is available under /etc/network/
[09:51] <_tcc> That doesn't tell me how it is done.
[09:51] <graham_100> stephan21_ i would imagine so, you see i used the terminal command but i think the cd will be the live cd version!! you can just give it a try and see what it does
[09:51] <Garito> thanks
[09:51] <Jhuri> help me out ppl, initrd-s for the 2.4 kernels how do i make em?
[09:51] <Arwen> ghoul83, only if your card supported it, which is probably a no
[09:51] <Garito> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36115/
[09:51] <graham_100> did you get the command i put there for you stephan21_
[09:51] <ghoul83> just help me out systemadministrator *sing*
[09:51] <p33k4y> can i use debian etch's mirrors as a apt-get repository in ubuntu?
[09:52] <stephan21_> graham_100, yea
[09:52] <graham_100> hexdream my flash player is still not working?!!?! don't know what to try next
[09:52] <stephan21_> graham_100, thanks alot
[09:52] <hexdream> graham_100: I'm off  to count sheep. Hope you come right :-)
[09:52] <sacater_> how do i get flash for mozzila
[09:52] <sacater_> firefox
[09:52] <ghoul83> Arwen if my card supported it? if the vendor said hey it's up to 125MB/s or what?
[09:52] <hexdream> graham_100: Oh, hmm, have you upgraded all your packages and rebooted?
[09:52] <graham_100> sacater_ i am having same problem! lol
[09:52] <Arwen> graham_100, manual install...............
[09:52] <jake> hello, is there anyway to make ubuntu tell you the bios version for your mobo?
[09:53] <Arwen> ghoul83, yea
[09:53] <Ashura> i need to put some commands like iwpriv before my ra0 interface goes up...what can i do? Where can i find the syntax for /etc/network/interfaces to execute a custom script before putting up ra0 ?
[09:53] <graham_100> arwen i can't seem to grasp the maual install
[09:53] <sacater_> how do i install flash player
[09:53] <El_Che> jake: what about booting and writing the number down?
[09:53] <alex_> sacater_: what is your machine
[09:53] <Arwen> graham_100, go to adobe.com, download the flashplayer, copy it to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[09:53] <Arwen> graham_100, done
[09:53] <sacater_> alex_: i built it myself, so it has no official name
[09:54] <graham_100> arwen i am going to the site now!
[09:54] <hexdream> graham_100: You can upgrade using the automatic update feature. I dont use it anymore but it's the ornage icon next to the clock/volume icons.
[09:54] <jake> could do that, I was hoping the os could do it
[09:54] <nemeza> hello everyone..
[09:54] <Arwen> graham_100, ah.... its at their beta download site... one sec
[09:54] <alex_> sacater_: as long as its not a ppc, try the synaptic app and search for flash you should be fine
[09:54] <stephan21_> graham_100, im going to try the image.....do i do gksu "update-manager -c image?
[09:54] <nemeza> may you help me in grub problem?
[09:54] <fab5freddy> i am curious how unbuntu works with the Athlon 64 X2
[09:54] <francisco> Garito, so after you search for glx in synaptic, is libgl1-mesa-dri installed?
[09:54] <leny> jhuri: I've always used make-kpkg from kernel-package in the repository
[09:54] <Arwen> graham_100, http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/

[10:00] <mxktmdude> hi everyone, i have ubuntu edgy installed here on my laptop. I have followed instructions on installing ndiswrapper 1.8 + common, modprobed all working, ndiswrapper showing driver installed, but my wifi light keeps flashing and doesnt actually allow me to use it... im lost

[10:00] <Mwa> Also, is it possible to change the resolution that the live CD plays at?
[10:00] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, no, they are not :)
[10:00] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, and to be honest, its easier to download and copy the file
[10:00] <tjb891> is there a hamachi like funtunality in ubuntu?
[10:00] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, yes they are - check the file size
[10:00] <graham_100> lmao who do i listen too :)
[10:00] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, 9mb is a pretty large link ;)
[10:00] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, me, of course :)
[10:01] <graham_100> lol :)
[10:01] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, flashplugin-nonfree?
[10:01] <Arwen> graham_100, he's thinking of the wrong one
[10:01] <Garito> francisco can i make a private to you?
[10:01] <UbuntuCE> hi. how i can check if my torrent-downloaded ubuntu .iso is ok? (md5)
[10:01] <graham_100> arwen ok
[10:01] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, yes, and player. there are two
[10:01] <cartesian1984> nolimitsoya: he's right. They're just scripts to download the debs.
[10:01] <graham_100> my brain hurts!
[10:01] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, im no ;)
[10:01] <cartesian1984> Or.
[10:01] <cartesian1984> Not the debs.
[10:01] <nolimitsoya> *not
[10:01] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, flashplugin-nonfree - 12K
[10:01] <Arwen> graham_100, anyway, have you extracted it?
[10:01] <Rasta> 6.10 its edgy?
[10:01] <graham_100> arwen yes
[10:02] <Arwen> graham_100, copy the .so file to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[10:02] <graham_100> rasta yes
[10:02] <Arwen> you might need root privileges for that
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, flashplayer-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb is 2.4mb.
[10:02] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, um, no it isn't
[10:02] <graham_100> hang fire i am ging to just have a smoke brb
[10:02] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386 is 2.5mb
[10:02] <francisco> Garito, also can you paste your latest xorg.0.log from /var/log
[10:02] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, check in synaptic and without seveas' repos
[10:03] <sacater_> Arwen: i did that, what website should i use to test whether i have flash
[10:03] <alvarom> please help, i been installed the package of postgres-server.8,
[10:03] <Garito> ok
[10:03] <Arwen> sacater_, I forgot... its somewhere on adobe's page
[10:03] <francisco> I'm not registered on freenode, but you can try
[10:03] <Rasta> nice
[10:03] <Arwen> sacater_, you could also just go to youtube
[10:03] <Garito> ok
[10:03] <cartesian1984> nolimitsoya: Maybe on your system, but on mine it's 102k. It does not contain the plugin. Although, if you have alternate repos, that could be it.
[10:03] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, that might be, but i didnt get it from the repos. either way, why on earth would you tell him touse tgz when he can get it from the repos?
[10:03] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, its not working for him
[10:04] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, and also, download, untar, copy is easier
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> Arwen, then the right way isstill to get a working deb
[10:04] <Arwen> nolimitsoya, .....
[10:04] <Mwa> So
[10:04] <graham_100> arwen have we all decided what i am to do ?? lol

[10:04] <Mwa> Uhm.
[10:04] <bud_resin> anyone have a working labtec webcam pro?
[10:04] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, flip a cion
[10:04] <graham_100> oh and does 6.10 support raid?
[10:04] <Arwen> graham_100, yes, copy the .so file to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[10:04] <leny> Jhuri, I'm not sure what you mean by repo .  However you initrd.img-etc is in /boot and if you copy it and mount it thrugh a loop device you can then change it, put it back and reissue grub-install (devname)
[10:05] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, yes, both hw and lvm
[10:05] <graham_100> the .so file is in ???
[10:05] <Arwen> graham_100, if it supports raid depends on your raid card/software
[10:05] <Mwa> Is everyone buisy? ):
[10:05] <Arwen> graham_100, should be in the .tar.gz that you downloaded
[10:05] <graham_100> arwen i see it
[10:05] <francisco> this guy has the flash for ubuntu too: http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/blog/
[10:05] <Garito> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36120/
[10:05] <Otacon22> work compiz without xgl server, but with nvidiaglx server?
[10:06] <spx2> whatwhat ssh client should i use in ubuntu ?
[10:06] <Arwen> graham_100, good, you can't just copy and paste because of the whole root thingy, so open a terminal and type cp ~/Desktop/*.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[10:06] <mxktmdude> hi everyone, i have ubuntu edgy installed here on my laptop. I have followed instructions on installing ndiswrapper 1.8 + common, modprobed all working, ndiswrapper showing driver installed, but my wifi light keeps flashing and doesnt actually allow me to use it... im lost
[10:06] <Arwen> Otacon22, if you have nvidiaglx, just use AIGLX + nvidia beta drivers
[10:07] <graham_100> cp: cannot stat `/home/kelly/Desktop/*.so': No such file or directory
[10:07] <Arwen> graham_100, oops.... stick the name of the folder that "extract" created before the *.so part
[10:07] <Jhuri> leny: repo - repository (prepackaged kernel that is), right but i dont know what to put in initrd-2.4.27-k6, since its empty - I thought there was a script for that, u know which one?
[10:08] <graham_100> cp: cannot stat `/home/kelly/Desktop/*.so': No such file or directory?
[10:08] <graham_100> *oops
[10:08] <graham_100> the whole file directory right?
[10:08] <francisco> Garito, 2297. (II) I810(0): [DRI]  installation complete
[10:08] <francisco> 2298. (II) I810(0): direct rendering: Enab
[10:08] <Arwen> graham_100, um, just sudo nautilus and copy and paste if the terminal thingy is too confusing
[10:08] <leny> %C1  \Z880 .
[10:08] <francisco> hmm
[10:08] <Mwa> Does anyone know how to disable the installation of GRUB on the Ubuntu install? Because it's causing problems, and I have a boot loader allready
[10:08] <Flannel> Arwen, graham_100, gksudo, not sudo, for nautilus.  and be super careful.
[10:08] <francisco> can you run glxinfo and check if dri is enabled?
[10:08] <Arwen> Flannel, doesn't really matter, he has a terminal open
[10:09] <Flannel> Arwen: yes, it does really matter.
[10:09] <Arwen> Flannel, and... why?
[10:09] <Garito> like this:
[10:09] <Garito> garito@Portatil:/var/log$ glxinfo | grep dri
[10:09] <Garito> garito@Portatil:/var/log$
[10:09] <Garito> ?
[10:09] <francisco> sure
[10:09] <Garito> no response
[10:09] <Flannel> Arwen: the major difference between sudo and gksudo is *not* the way in which they ask for your password, it's in how they set up the environment for that program.
[10:09] <leny> Jhuri: Will be back after looking at the make-kpkg script
[10:10] <Arwen> Flannel, works either way
[10:10] <Jhuri> leny: k
[10:10] <francisco> you can just run glxfinfo
[10:10] <graham_100> arwen i am going to type this.....kelly@kelly-desktop:~$ cp ~/Desktop/flash-player-plugin-9.0.21.78*.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins.....is this right??
[10:10] <Flannel> Arwen: which is why you use gksudo for graphical programs, not because you want a nice textbox, but because the program itself is graphical.
[10:10] <Garito> ok
[10:10] <Arwen> graham_100, no.... add a "/" before the *.so
[10:10] <Flannel> Arwen: No.  It can screw up some permissions some places.  Please don't break other peoples machines.
[10:10] <graham_100> kelly@kelly-desktop:~$ cp ~/Desktop/flash-player-plugin-9.0.21.78/*.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins???
[10:10] <Arwen> Flannel, ............
[10:10] <Garito> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36122/
[10:10] <Cpudan80> Is Ubuntu's package manager good?
[10:10] <Arwen> graham_100, yes
[10:10] <zylche> aww
[10:11] <Cpudan80> Better than Suse anyway
[10:11] <graham_100> okiesx
[10:11] <graham_100> cp: cannot create regular file `/usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so': Permission denied
[10:11] <Arwen> graham_100, ah yea.... tack a "sudo" before the command
[10:11] <Arwen> heh, sorry for the inconvenience
[10:11] <nolimitsoya> *cough*
[10:11] <nolimitsoya> ;)
[10:11] <kash> do i need /etc/inittab
[10:11] <kash> i'm in edgy
[10:11] <tjb891> if i download the package vncserver will it start vnc as a service or will it have to be enable?
[10:12] <addicted> Does ubuntu support Finger Print Sensors?
[10:12] <ProN00b> tjb891, check System - Preferences - Remote Desktop
[10:13] <tjb891> ok

[10:14] <noelferreira> lupine_85: are you there? Can you help me with rt61 and kernel 2.6.15-27-386 in dapper?
[10:14] <Emo_Samurai> I'm chatting from Windows right now, and my Ubuntu won't acknowledge that it's got an ethernet cable plugged into it.
[10:14] <graham_100> i started firefox i see no "about:plugins"
[10:14] <Arwen> graham_100, that's the name of a page
[10:14] <Flannel> graham_100: you type it into the address box
[10:14] <Arwen> put it in the address box
[10:15] <Emo_Samurai> can somebody help me?
[10:15] <tonyyarusso> addicted: Sometimes.
[10:15] <Emo_Samurai> I can't network.
[10:15] <graham_100> oh lol i see now
[10:15] <Emo_Samurai> And it won't let me install my driver, even though it's supposed to be supported.
[10:15] <tonyyarusso> addicted: Best bet is to check the Ubuntu (and other) wikis.  Aslo, if it's a ThinkPad, there's the ThinkWiki.
[10:15] <Emo_Samurai> It says there's no auto-install application for it.
[10:15] <Emo_Samurai> Can somebody help?
[10:15] <Emo_Samurai> !install

[10:16] <graham_100> well shockwave flash
[10:16] <alex_> once you have parted a /dev, how do you get to view the result ?
[10:16] <Arwen> graham_100, congrats... double check for extra files in that flashplayer folder on your desktop and then go to youtube
[10:16] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso: Can you help me install my wireless card? I'm loggin on from Windows right now.
[10:16] <Arwen> Garito, you have an ATi driver loaded? weird..
[10:16] <Garito> then perhaps i have an ati?
[10:16] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: I doubt I'll be much help since I don't have experience with that, but what card?
[10:16] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso: D-Link.
[10:16] <alex_> what comd should I use to see how a /dev/ is partitionned ?
[10:17] <ProN00b> Emo_Samurai, what chipset ?

[10:17] <francisco> garito try: lspci
[10:17] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso: Where're the wiki pages?
[10:17] <Garito> ok
[10:17] <Arwen> Garito, you can unload it with modprobe... but make sure before you try that
[10:17] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport

[10:19] <Mwa> So, does anyone know how to stop grub installing?
[10:19] <graham_100> they are games on miniclip and shockwave but it comes up with a grey screen and says plugin needed and a green jigsaw peice but i only have the option to manual install
[10:20] <Arwen> graham_100, double check the reqs, does it require shockwave player?
[10:20] <Arwen> flash != shockwave
[10:20] <francisco> Garito, noting unusual there in lsmod either...
[10:20] <spx2> whatwhat ssh client should i use in ubuntu ?
[10:20] <Garito> mmm

[10:24] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[10:24] <graham_100> arwen ok np if you are here i will see you then!
[10:24] <mseney> Flannel, k thanks
[10:24] <graham_100> :)
[10:25] <Arwen> Darst, don't know about that, sorry
[10:25] <ivx> hey i am trying to install ubuntu and i am getting the following error: MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to I0-APIC
[10:25] <Arwen> DarkD_at_work, sorry about the misname
[10:25] <ivx> anyone know how to fix this
[10:25] <Darst> arwen no probs - thanks anyway

[10:25] <noelferreira> but i use rt61 Ashura what you mean?
[10:25] <stapel> Why is update-manager saying my system is up-to-date, but then there are 4 updates under distribution-upgrade greyed out?
[10:25] <Arwen> stapel, dependency hell
[10:25] <jherm> LjL, dont use backports --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-c268ba69c6b38af1dc31ea09701c7d296cf971c3
[10:26] <stapel> looks like it...
[10:26] <Arwen> stapel, run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and see what that says
[10:26] <stapel> ok
[10:26] <BadMike> Could anyone help me I'm not able to install something
[10:26] <Darst> general question then to the channel - have got sound working thru normal output (ie 2 ch headphones), got a TOSLink out to the amp, but not getting sound thru that - where to start looking at setting up digital out ?
[10:26] <lostinc> Is there a good set of instructions to set up a printer via the network without the use of a LPT port??
[10:26] <Ashura> noelferreira, you mean how do i managed to understand the commands on iwpriv?
[10:26] <LjL> jherm: why's backports bad?
[10:26] <eimajenthat> hey, how do I make a password protected zip file in Ubuntu?
[10:27] <jherm> LjL, unsupported
[10:27] <Flannel> jherm: no.  Use backports.  package management good.
[10:27] <stapel> The following packages have been kept back:
[10:27] <stapel>   libggi2 mplayer podbrowser tomboy
[10:27] <LjL> jherm: erm, and a third-party package (or .bin, or whatever) would be supported? =)
[10:27] <jherm> Flannel, but dont add the entire backports
[10:27] <noelferreira> Ashura: can you help me? my system freezes with that kernel
[10:27] <jherm> Flannel, just grab what you need
[10:28] <Ashura> noelferreira, try to boot it with the resue kernel and look for any crash dump on the messages
[10:28] <Flannel> jherm: are you in the habit of installing all the packages from every repository you have? ;)
[10:28] <Arwen> stapel, go to synaptic, mark them for upgrade individually and see what it says
[10:28] <LjL> Flannel: well, he has a point, -backports might update *other* packages that you have installed and that you don't want updated
[10:28] <jherm> Flannel, no just dont do dist-upgrade with backports installed
=== Greenie is now known as _greenie
[10:28] <LjL> Flannel, jherm: but it's easy enough to add it, install whatever you need, and remove it
[10:29] <noelferreira> something related to old drivers Ashura.
[10:29] <jherm> LjL, you dont even need to do that
=== jerp is now known as JohnPariah
[10:29] <Ashura> noelferreira, boot with rescue and manually delete them from /lib/modules/kernel_ver/
[10:29] <jherm> LjL, from the command line you can say "grab flash from backports" without even touvhing your apt sources.list
[10:30] <LjL> jherm: how?
[10:30] <xst> After an upgrade, the fonts en emacs became very ugly and non-antialiased. How can I fix that?
[10:30] <Ashura> noelferreira, then reboot and see if it was the real problem
[10:30] <jherm> LjL, :-)
[10:30] <LjL> jherm: i wouldn't recommend wget+dpkg, if that's what you mean
[10:30] <jherm> LjL, no
[10:30] <leny> Jhuri: The list of whats in my initrd is on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36128/ .  The initrd is a gzipped cpio archive of those files. Rgds
[10:31] <noelferreira> and then Ashura?
[10:31] <Ashura> noelferreira, then reinstall the correct drivers (i use the one from multiverse)
[10:31] <Ashura> noelferreira, i have a D-Link DWL-G510
[10:32] <Jhuri> leny: gee thanks, is it a 2.4-k6 suitable one?
[10:32] <noelferreira> ok i'll trie Ashura
[10:32] <noelferreira> thanks
[10:32] <Ashura> you are wellcom
[10:32] <Ashura> i'll be here
[10:32] <william> someone know how to completely reinstall X11?
[10:33] <Spaghetti_Knife> How do I get my computer to recognize that it has a frakking ethernet cable plugged into it?
[10:33] <Spaghetti_Knife> Please don't point me to a site; they never have all the information I need.
[10:34] <wyld> how do i close one channel with / quit, and not my entire session?
[10:34] <wyld> in xchat
[10:34] <Ashura> use /part
[10:34] <Spaghetti_Knife> Can somebody help me?
[10:34] <leny> Jhuri: Its a 2.6 but all but the module names for the drivers should be v close.  You can look at your original one by installing one of the linux-2.4.x kernel packages?
[10:34] <Spaghetti_Knife> Help?
[10:34] <Arwen> william, so apt-get remove --purge xorg?
[10:34] <Arwen> william, you might as well reinstall
[10:34] <noelferreira> Ashura: i dind't find rt61 in /lib/modules/my kernel
[10:35] <Ashura> it's deep inside
[10:35] <noelferreira> where ?
[10:35] <noelferreira> aliases?
[10:35] <Ashura> wait a sec
[10:35] <wyld> ashura: thanks
[10:35] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Maybe a little.  Does it recognize your ethernet card at all?
[10:35] <william> how do i go about that while keeping my /home as it is and apps installed though? thats really what i'd be happy to do
[10:35] <noelferreira> ok
[10:35] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso: How do I get it to do that?
[10:35] <william> basically the mouse has locked up (ps/2) and completly reinstalling X may fix it
[10:36] <Ashura> noelferreira, kernel/driver/net/wireless/   dlete all rt2xxx
[10:36] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso: Tony?
[10:36] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Tony!!!
[10:37] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Check 'lspci' to see if it's listed.
[10:37] <tonyyarusso> !patience | Spaghetti_Knife
[10:37] <ubotu> Spaghetti_Knife: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[10:37] <Jhuri> leny: the 2.4 kernels install from the repositories without a initrd
[10:37] <william> is there a way to force apt to reinstall files that it already thinks are uptodate?
[10:37] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso: lspci?
[10:37] <Jhuri> leny: u think a 2.6 initrd will work for a 2.4 kernel?
[10:38] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:How do I make it recognize it if it doesn't?
[10:38] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: It's a command that lists a lot of hardware info.  Run it, and post the output to the !pastebin
[10:38] <alex_> if I use debootstrap, it will use my apt source list  right ?
[10:38] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: That's the sticky part.  Drivers.  I'm hoping this ends up being a simple fix, b/c if not I doubt I'll be able to help, and it will be a wiki-reading situation.
[10:38] <leny> Jhuri: As I understand it the method is the same for all 2.x kernels. See 'man initrd'
[10:38] <noelferreira> and now Ashura?
[10:39] <stapel> arwen: thanks...it worked
[10:39] <alex_> so if from a ubuntu machine I do a debootstrap sid, it won't find it
[10:39] <M3L7down> hey guys I got a question
[10:39] <leny> Jhuri: Your binaries should be your own though
=== ryu2 is now known as ryu
[10:39] <Ashura> now boot and see if the kernel itself (without ralink drivers loaded) load correctly
[10:39] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:It recognizes the ethernet controller.
[10:39] <wyld> how do i change desktops in 3ddesktop?
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Okay, that's good
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Now try 'ifconfig -a'
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> See if it's listed there.

[10:42] <klm-> is there a way to reset all my videocodecs? somethings starts bugging when I run a certain videofile
[10:42] <borg> thank you LjL that thing he was doing was causing my client to annoy me with sounds
[10:42] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:okay, did that. Lots of drek I don't understand.
[10:42] <Arwen> klm-, remove all your gstreamer-plugin-* packages
[10:42] <LjL> actually it wasn't me who banned him borg
[10:42] <Arwen> klm-, then reinstall
[10:42] <Mwa> Uhm, can I have some help now? <_<;
[10:42] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Just put it on the pastebin and I'll try to decipher for you.
[10:42] <borg> LjL: oh, i didnt see it then

[10:43] <borg> thank you gnomefreak
[10:43] <klm-> Arwen, ok, will that be a permanent or temporary solution?
[10:43] <Crescendo> What tool can be used to edit files on an FTP server, and automatically upload them to the server when saved?
[10:43] <Darst> will put the question out there... i have got sound working in 2ch headphones out of the std audio out... if i plug in the digital cable (into the TOSLink out) and connect to the amp, nothing - no sound at all... question is should i be looking at my .asoundrc file or is there a better place to start looking (4 day linux newbie)... pity me... please
[10:43] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: See the link from ubotu
[10:43] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:The whole problem is that my Ubuntu boot won't recognize that I have a frakking ethernet cable plugged into it.
[10:43] <Arwen> klm-, permanent... assuming you don't break it again somehow
[10:43] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Oh, nvm
[10:43] <klm-> Arwen, ok thanks then
[10:43] <finalbeta> Crescendo, You can try using nautilus to connect to the FTP.
[10:43] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay...
[10:43] <Mwa> See, I don't have a working computer until I get this fixed. ):
[10:43] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Okay, just tell me the far left column, eth-whatevers and such
[10:43] <graham_100> hello
[10:44] <M3L7down> for some reason, I can't force Ubuntu to read xorg.conf. Which basically means I can't get my resolution any higher than 1024x768. Can you guys tell me another way to do this?
[10:44] <whyameye_> is there a bash irc room? I'm wondering how to print out the ascii value of a string in bash.
[10:44] <Arwen> whyameye_, #bash or ##linux
[10:44] <jrib> Crescendo: vim
[10:44] <Crescendo> finalbeta, it seems opening a file from an FTP connection on nautilus doesn't go very well, using Gedit.  Empty document.
[10:44] <M3L7down> I have changed the subsections to add another value like so:
[10:44] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay, it says, in descending order, ath0, eth0, lo, sit0, wifi0.
[10:44] <M3L7down> 	SubSection "Display"
[10:44] <M3L7down> 		Depth		24
[10:44] <M3L7down> 		Modes		"1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
[10:44] <M3L7down> but for....
[10:44] <M3L7down> wait a second
[10:44] <finalbeta> Crescendo, sry, didn't know that.
[10:45] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: eth0 is most likely what you want
[10:45] <stapel> is it possible to upgrade to feisty yet?
[10:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay, I have no idea what to do with that.
[10:45] <nalioth> stapel: join #ubuntu+1
[10:45] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: See if you can bring it up, with 'sudo ifconfig eth0 up'
[10:45] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:But thanks a lot for your help so far.
[10:45] <stapel> nalioth: thanks
[10:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> I can't.
[10:46] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: How so?
[10:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:I typed it in, nothing happened.
[10:46] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:It moved onto the next line without anything being printed.
[10:47] <Crescendo> jrib, I'd like to use a graphic interface, though
[10:47] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: On Linux, "nothing happened" usually means it worked.  (Opposite of Windows, which assumes it will fail and gets excited as says "YAY" when it succeeds)
[10:47] <jrib> Crescendo: gvim
[10:47] <ironfroggy_LT> what would cause trying to put a print job on hold or cancelling it freeze my cups server?
[10:47] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay, what do I do?
[10:47] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Try ifconfig without the -a switch now and see if it's listed as up.
[10:48] <Crescendo> jrib, sudo apt-get install vim-gnome
[10:48] <Crescendo> ?
[10:48] <jrib> Crescendo: yep
[10:48] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:what do I type? I have no idea what you're saying.
[10:48] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso::(
[10:49] <Mwa> Does anyone know how to disable GRUB when running the installer?
[10:49] <Mwa> Please. ):
[10:49] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: 'ifconfig', as a command on the terminal.  Look for eth0 just like before, and especially see if it has an "inet addr" (IP).
[10:49] <Crescendo> jrib, nope, still does nothing
[10:50] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Yep, tried my Firefox, it works.
[10:50] <jrib> Crescendo: what do you mean "does nothing"?  What are you trying to do and how?
[10:50] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Now to get my wireless to work.
[10:50] <Stengah> what do i need to get to be able to do "make" and "qmake" commands?
[10:50] <Crescendo> Right click a file in nautilus, on an FTP server, and open with
[10:50] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Aweseome.  That's something.
[10:51] <jrib> Crescendo: hmm don't know how nautilus handles it.  Try 'gvim ftp://foobar'
[10:51] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: You can do the same process if everything's good.
[10:51] <Crescendo> Gah, now GNOME isn't responding.
[10:51] <Crescendo> :/
[10:51] <Mwa> That reminds me
[10:51] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Either wifi0 or ath0, should be supported I think (Atheros?)
[10:51] <i7ch> what's the main feisty channel?
[10:51] <jrib> i7ch: #ubuntu+=1
[10:51] <tonyyarusso> i7ch: #ubuntu+1
[10:51] <Mwa> Which of the two options in the wireless thing is for WEP keys?
[10:51] <jrib> i7ch: what tonyyarusso said
[10:51] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay, what do I do?
[10:51] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Define "wireless thing"?
[10:52] <Mwa> Networking
[10:52] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Use the ifconfig line with "up" in it, replace eth0 with wifi0 or ath0 (not sure if it matters)

[10:52] <aiduciukas> Hi! how I can downgrade version? like gnome or other software?
[10:52] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Does it say something like "Security key"?
[10:52] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay, did that.
[10:53] <pantalaimon_> how can we manually delete shortcuts on the menu? i removed the package but it didnt remove the shortcut
[10:53] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Now how do I install the drivers for my wifi?
[10:53] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: You probably already have them, if you were able to bring it up without errors.
[10:53] <Mwa> Password type: and Network Password:
[10:53] <Mwa> It offers "Plain (ASCII)" and "Hexadecimal"
[10:54] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Ah, WEP is Hex
[10:54] <Mwa> Ok, thanks
[10:54] <tonyyarusso> (generally)
[10:54] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:After installing xchat on my ubuntu computer, I'll see if the wifi is working.
[10:54] <Mwa> Also, do you know how to stop GRUB installing when installing ubuntu?

[10:55] <Stengah> hello. i have just installed ubuntu and i want to make my win partitions writable, how
[10:55] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Okay.  You can take the ethernet connection down by replacing "up" with "down" in the line to bring up eth0, and make sure your wireless card has an IP address.
[10:55] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Thanks for your help.
[10:55] <Mwa> I tried setting the installation path to /dev/null
[10:55] <rambo3> what tool should i use to see what my browser is sending like tcp scan
[10:55] <Mwa> But this didn't work.
[10:55] <phaedrus44> why does penguinracer run so slow!
[10:55] <nunod> rambo3, ethereal
[10:56] <tonyyarusso> phaedrus44: Graphics card drivers most likely
[10:56] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Okay, I'm back in.
[10:56] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: Do you know?
[10:56] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Ethernet connection or wireless.
[10:56] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Wild guess.
[10:56] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:Ethernet.
[10:56] <borg> can ethereal tell me if my wifi network is being used by wifi theives?
[10:56] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:What do I do to see if my wireless works?
[10:56] <sakara> hallo
[10:57] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:When I was downloading xchat, I pulled out the cable. It wouldn't continue until I plugged it back in.
[10:57] <Stengah> what do i need to get to be able to do "make" and "qmake" commands?
[10:57] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso:So I don't think my wifi works yet.
[10:57] <i7ch> Stengah, build-basic or something like this
[10:57] <sakara> i think i ve done summat to my dad computer
[10:57] <KenSentMe> !build-essential | Stengah
[10:57] <ubotu> Stengah: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[10:57] <adaptr> borg: no, you cannot
[10:57] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: Bring down the eth0 connection.  Then, check if there's an inet addr for the wireless card.
[10:57] <willskills> borg, logging into your router will tell you
[10:58] <sakara> i need help
[10:58] <i7ch> oh yeah, build-essential ;)
[10:58] <mnoir> Stengah: do you have build_essentials installed?
[10:58] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: "Wild guess"? I asked how to stop GRUB installing with ubuntu. x_X
[10:58] <Stengah> ty KenSentMe
[10:58] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Wait...I thought you were referring to something else.
=== compengi_ is now known as compengi
[10:58] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: Oh. :P
[10:58] <sakara> i think ive deleted windows
[10:59] <borg> let me rephrase can ethereal help me tell if someone is using my wifi netork? like say packets from an internal ip that was never assigned to my computers 192.168
[10:59] <faddatp> Hey, is anyone aware of a distro other than Fedora that works with a Intel X3000 GMA out of the box?
[10:59] <adaptr> borg: let me repeat: not easily.. define what you mean by "network"
[11:00] <leny> tonyyarusso: wrt Mwa's qn does alternate install let you put grub on the installed partition therefore avaoiding the problem?
[11:00] <rambo3> nunod, whats the command to start ethereal , cant find it
[11:00] <nunod> rambo3, maybe you should check if you have it installed first :)
[11:00] <rambo3> nunod, well i installed it
[11:00] <Mwa> I'm installing on a Macbook, which have completely messed up HD names
[11:00] <tonyyarusso> leny: I think the alternate allows you to skip grub entirely, not sure what it has for options of which drive to put it on
[11:00] <Crescendo> The "Opening <servername>" window NEEDS to stop popping up on TOP of the "Default Password" window.
[11:01] <Crescendo> It's really pissing my off.
[11:01] <Crescendo> I'm in the middle of typing a password, and the "opening server" pops up.
[11:01] <Crescendo> Of course, the only option is cancel.
[11:01] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: where's the alternate install?
[11:01] <cegy> what should i set in samba to be able to connect to some shared objects on windows?
[11:01] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Same download page as the rest
[11:01] <Crescendo> So, when I press enter for the password, it cancels.
[11:01] <Crescendo> THAT'S some retarded crap.
[11:02] <baconbacon> cegy: shared objects?
[11:02] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: I need to download another CD?
[11:02] <baconbacon> shares?
[11:02] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: If you want to do the alternate one
[11:02] <cegy> baconbacon: like directories
[11:02] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: I'm not quite sure what you're trying to do
[11:02] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: I'm trying to normally install Ubuntu, but without GRUB
[11:02] <adaptr> cegy: define your workgroup, servername, and the directories you want to share
[11:02] <adaptr> cegy: a minmal samba config is quite short
[11:03] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: which there doesn't apear to be an option to do
[11:03] <Stengah> what's the name of the file you edit the partitions and boot proprieties with?
[11:03] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: Ah, sounds right then
[11:03] <tonyyarusso> Stengah: /etc/fstab
[11:03] <Stengah> ty
[11:03] <baconbacon> cegy: No setting for connecting to shares. In nautilus, type smb://server/share, or use shortcuts -> connect to server...
[11:04] <adaptr> cegy: sorry, I read your question backwards... :) just add a //server/share to fstab, or use the network server option
[11:04] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: So I do need to dl another CD?
[11:04] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:Okay, it's me, spaghetti_knife under a different name.
[11:04] <tonyyarusso> Mwa: I think so
[11:04] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Working now?
[11:04] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:My ethernet is no longer working.
[11:04] <luxuser> ls
[11:04] <luxuser> ciao
[11:04] <Mwa> tonyyarusso: meh. k
[11:04] <luxuser> we
[11:04] <luxuser> oki
[11:04] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Right, because you brought down the interface.
[11:04] <Mwa> This is gonna be hard to do
[11:04] <Zambezi> Can anyone check this firewallog and tell me if there's any concern? Cause I am now: http://pastebin.ca/273389
[11:05] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:Huh?
[11:05] <leny> Mwa: Why do you not want GRUB?
[11:05] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:You have to realize that I'm a total n00b.
[11:05] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: You did the ifconfig eth0 down thing, right?
[11:06] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:Yes. Then I did the ifconfig eth0 up thing like 50 times.
[11:06] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: So it's status currently is showing as up?
[11:06] <wheels3572> Can someone help me with a few issues im having wtih Xubuntu please
[11:06] <adaptr> Zambezi: what is this interface connected to ?
[11:06] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:It shows up when I type "ifconfig."
[11:06] <Mwa> Ah
[11:06] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:So... yeah?
[11:06] <Mwa> I understand
[11:06] <Mwa> Thakn you
[11:06] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:It still won't internet.
[11:06] <wheels3572> 1st:  I cant minimize my icons wtihout them disappearing on me
[11:07] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Does it have an inet addr associated with it?  (*brb)
[11:07] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:Yes.
[11:07] <unimatrixzxero> Hello
[11:07] <nothlit> whats the ip
[11:07] <Zambezi> adaptr, I have to check.
=== jori is now known as Crashzor
[11:08] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, are you trying to connect directly to the net or just you network
[11:08] <Jhuri> leny: u were saying?
[11:08] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:I'm trying to use the internet.
[11:08] <unimatrixzxero> I'm having trouble with Ubuntu 6.0.6 on a Pentium 4 530HT, I can't seem to compile anything is there some extra setup you have to do to get g++ or gcc compiler to work???
[11:08] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:What do I do?
[11:08] <adaptr> Zambezi: how do you mean ? either it's a switch, or an Internet connection, or a cross-cable to another PC.. there aren't any more sensible options, really
[11:08] <cegy> adaptr: when i open file browser and type: smb://ipadress then i become an error message
[11:08] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit: I'm trying to use the Internet.
[11:08] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, through a router or what? do you have an adsl or cable modem
[11:08] <Zambezi> adaptr, I have two cards. One for internet and the second for LAN. I think LAN is eth1.
[11:09] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit: I'm using a cable modem.
[11:09] <adaptr> cegy: what file browser ? just go to Places... Network Server and browse for your share
[11:09] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: If you have both the ethernet and wireless up at the same time that could be the problem.
[11:09] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit: It worked when I used eth0 up before on the console, but now when I type it in, it doesn't link me to the net.] \
[11:09] <Zambezi> adaptr, It from the firewallog in IPCop which has two interfaces.
[11:09] <adaptr> Zambezi: type "ifconfig" to see what IP eth1 has - that will tell you
[11:09] <d3> *sigh* installing these ATi drivers is such a pain.
[11:10] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, so no hardware changed then
[11:10] <wheels3572> HOW DO I FIX DISAPPEARING ICONS When I minimize a program?
[11:10] <stephan21> can somene tell me how to install nvidia drivers for edgy
[11:10] <adaptr> Zambezi: aha.. then forget about it, who wants to read firewall logs ?
[11:10] <stephan21> !nvidia
[11:10] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:10] <cegy> adaptr: that i did, but it doesnt work
[11:10] <kitche> !nvidia|stephan21
[11:10] <ubotu> stephan21: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:10] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:It's not doing anything.
[11:10] <leny> JHuri: What exactly were you wanting to achieve with what you were putting on your initrd?
[11:10] <adaptr> Zambezi: why would you bother with reading logs when yuo have ipcop running ?
[11:10] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, usually cable modem problems are the cable between the computer and modem being the incorrect type of ethernet cable
[11:10] <tonyyarusso> nothlit: Nope, this was in the last 5 minutes.  Emo is trying to get both wired and wireless working; I suspect both cards are supported, but he's a little lost on the status of them.
[11:10] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:I took down wifi0 and put up eth0, and it still won't use the internet.
[11:10] <adaptr> cegy: define "didn't work" - what happened ?
[11:10] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:And it worked before.
[11:11] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: What's its IP?
[11:11] <faddat> stephan21:  do you have a great similar trick set up for Intel G965 X3000's?
[11:11] <cegy> adaptr: i cant see there any shares
[11:11] <adaptr> cegy: what kind of shares do you HAVE, then ?
[11:11] <Emo_Samurai> tonyyarusso:its inet addr is 192.168.0.7
[11:11] <faddat> We've been trying to get the graphics working properly on this motherboard *forever*.  Fedora has been the only distro we've enjoyed success with
[11:11] <kitche> stephan21: install the nvidia-glx package then shutdown X with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop then do sudo nvidia-glx-config enable then do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start and you should now be using hte nvidia drivers
[11:11] <Stengah>  /media/sda1     ntfs    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1 does not mount as writable. i changed the defaults into "rw" same thing
[11:11] <NineTeen67Comet> Can an NFS user please look at this pastebin and see if they can tell why one directory would be read/write to all, and the other read only? .. I am perplexed . (shared is locked read only, yet shared-backup is r/w all) .. help?
[11:11] <NineTeen67Comet> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36138/
[11:11] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, thats an internal address, it means you're within a network
[11:11] <Zambezi> adaptr, I just read it for fun cause there's some ,morons which send about 2000 packages to the "last bridge". It's the last ip-number in the range. I can't explain what it is.
[11:12] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Do you have a router between you and the modem?
[11:12] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Yes, I have a router between me and the modem.
[11:12] <adaptr> kitche: or he could just run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" and restart the X server... why all the trouble ?
[11:12] <rrenaud> anyone play starcraft under ubuntu?  It is performing somewhere between poorly and terrible for me
[11:12] <KenSentMe> I try to play the video on this page, but get an error message 'Can't parse that. No files'. Anyone else have problems or a solution for the video on this page? http://www.omroep.nl/themakanaal/player/hollanddoc.html
[11:12] <jrib> Stengah: you can't write to ntfs, you need to use !fuse, which I know nothing about
[11:12] <Jhuri> leny: a boot capable k6 optimized kernel
[11:12] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Is the router and modem both up and running okay?  (Check the blinking lights)
[11:12] <Czarek> hi. how defragment ext2 under windows?
[11:12] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, are you sure the router has internet access configured and working properly?
[11:12] <cegy> adaptr: im not sharing. i want to connect to windows shares
[11:12] <Stengah> ty jrib
[11:12] <adaptr> Zambezi: if I ever were to start reading what gets sent to my ADSL connection I would not have time to do anything else
[11:12] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, log into the router and check if it has WLAN ip
[11:13] <jrib> !fuse | Stengah
[11:13] <ubotu> Stengah: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[11:13] <nothlit> err
[11:13] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarussoYes, they're working quite well. The computer I'm using is routing through it.
[11:13] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, i mean WAN ip
[11:13] <adaptr> cegy: that is my quesiton: what shares should you have available, then? do you KNOW you have shares somewhere ?
[11:13] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Okay, what does that mean? "WAN ip"?
[11:13] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, nm you said its working
[11:13] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, it stands for world area network btw, for the internet
[11:14] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: So what the frak do I do?
[11:14] <Zambezi> adaptr, The whole firewallog is on about 2000 pages. I read the summary.
[11:14] <cegy> adaptr: yes, im connectet throw hamachi and i know 100% there are shares
[11:14] <adaptr> cegy: it's quite simple: if the Network Servers browser does not show you any windows machines that have shares then either A) you don't have any, or B) they do not allow you to browse them
[11:14] <adaptr> cegy: "connectet throw hamachi" - huh ?
[11:14] <adaptr> that last does not parse, sorry
[11:14] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Can you ping google?  'ping www.google.com'
[11:15] <cegy> adaptr: connected via hamachi
[11:15] <nothlit> adaptr, hamachi is a virtual private networking utility thats relatively easy to use
[11:15] <adaptr> cegy: and hamachi is.. ?
[11:15] <cegy> adaptr: i dont speak english well :-)
[11:15] <Emo_Samurai> I just restarted the computer.
[11:15] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: I just restarted my computer.
[11:15] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: I'll tell you in a sec.
[11:15] <Czarek> how defragment ext3]  under windows?
[11:15] <scrocco> hi all - any tip about burning dvd discs , so they are readable by apple systems? i'm using k3b with DVD-R supports, but they always look empty when i insert them in 2 ibooks
[11:15] <adaptr> cegy: ah... and you are absolutely, positively certain that you can access the required ports throgh hamachi ?
[11:16] <kitche> adaptr: hamachi lets you play games over a network though your computer xbox ps3 and such
[11:16] <cegy> adaptr: http://www.hamachi.cc/
[11:16] <nothlit> scrocco, do they look empty under linux?
[11:16] <scrocco> nothlit:  no they are ok on my linux system
[11:16] <nothlit> scrocco, have you tried finalising the discs?
[11:17] <scrocco> nothlit:  i'm going look that. thx
[11:17] <nothlit> scrocco, check what filesystem you're burning them with
[11:17] <scrocco> i add UDF support
[11:17] <leny> Jhuri: Then you are probably better off connecting to one of the Debian archives (current/stable == Sarge) and downloadiong their kernel package you fancy. They are at www.debian.org .  If you download from their packages list you can use 'sudo dpkg -i <package>' to install it.
[11:17] <Czarek> how defragment ext3 under windows?
[11:17] <adaptr> cegy: and what are you connected to via this hamachi ? does your routing table show that it works ?
[11:17] <cegy> adaptr: on my sisters comp with windows i can download the shared files...
[11:18] <kitche> cegy: ah that one :) was thinking of the x-link type of system but maybe that is the one i m thinking of sicne I use x-link myself
[11:18] <nothlit> Czarek, why can't you defrag it under linux?
[11:18] <Jhuri> leny: yeah, I should have thought of that, thanx mate
[11:18] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Okay, it works, but I had to restart my computer.
[11:18] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: How do I stop my terminal pinging it?
[11:19] <Czarek> nohlit - i need to stay on windows for a longer time, and meanwhile i can defrag the shared partition
[11:19] <adaptr> cegy: it's nigh on impossible to troubleshoot these kind of issues remotely... you'll have to dive into networking to get anywhere on this
[11:19] <cegy> adaptr: the connection works, hamachi says me, im connected and showed me all other users...
[11:19] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Ctrl-C
[11:19] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Thanks.
[11:19] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, next time you ping something use -c #
[11:19] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Now how do I get my wifi to work?
[11:19] <nothlit> lool
[11:19] <adaptr> cegy: can you identify the remote machine in hamachi ? if so, try to conenct to it directly
[11:20] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: See if you can take down the ethernet, bring up the wifi, and have an IP address for the wifi, if so, try ping.
[11:20] <cegy> adaptr: yes, o know the ip
[11:20] <Czarek> is there way do defrag ext3 under windows?
[11:21] <jamesbrose>  Whats that Edgy Tweaks page
[11:21] <nothlit> Czarek, i'm not sure something like that exists, or if you want to use it... only way i would think is to use linux within windows to do it, there are options like colinux, cygwin and virtual machines, but i would still recommend doing inside linux
[11:21] <jamesbrose> ?
[11:21] <adaptr> cegy: then ping it, perhaps, or try to access it with smbclient
[11:21] <nothlit> Czarek, if you would want to use it*
[11:21] <adaptr> Czarek: why would yo want to do that ?
[11:21] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: It says "Unknown Host"
[11:21] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: What does?
[11:21] <nothlit> adaptr, he uses windows mostly so he figures in his free time he could defrag it
[11:22] <Crankymonky> Does anyone else have trouble playing flash audio, like in purevolume?
[11:22] <alex_> how do I set how to mount any usb dev ? I have a box with Etch and I have /etc/usbmount, on ubuntu, it is not, any idea ?
[11:22] <nothlit> tonyyarusso, his wifi
[11:22] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: Does it have an IP?
[11:22] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: My terminal.
[11:22] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: It can't frakking ping google.
[11:22] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Not over the wireless.
[11:22] <cegy> adaptr: ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted ... and i used sudo
[11:22] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: And now I took down wifi0 and took eth0 up, and it's not working again.
[11:22] <adaptr> cegy: then that's something that hamachi probably blocks
[11:22] <Czarek> nothlit: tommorow i will use shared partition under ubuntu
[11:22] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: It has to have an IP address first.  Use dhclient to get one.
[11:23] <Czarek> nothlit that`s why
[11:23] <adaptr> Czarek: shared partition ? that's new
[11:23] <kitche> Emo_Samurai: this might be a wild gues sbut did you turn off ipv6? your wireless might be choking on using that just a thought
[11:23] <nothlit> !wireless | Emo_Samurai
[11:23] <ubotu> Emo_Samurai: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:23] <alex_> anyone ?
[11:23] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Okay, you have to realize I have no idea what you're talking about.
[11:23] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: More specifically?
[11:23] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: It says nothing about ip addresses, just inet addr.
[11:23] <alex_> how do I set how to mount any usb dev ? I have a box with Etch and I have /etc/usbmount, on ubuntu, it is not, any idea ?
[11:23] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: It's not pinging.
[11:24] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: inet == IP
[11:24] <adaptr> alex_: we heard you the first time
[11:24] <tonyyarusso> (v4)
[11:24] <nothlit> alex_, if you're still running under gnome it will be automounted in /media
[11:24] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Okay, so what the frak do I do to get my ethernet working again?
[11:24] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: I'd be more inclined to help you without the "frakking"
[11:24] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: We don't know, because we don't know what's happening.  You need to tell us.
[11:25] <alex_> nothlit: yes, but I would like to change the way it mount them I woud like to remove the option noexec and nodev
[11:25] <nothlit> alex_, umount them and remount them normally
[11:25] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: I typed in "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" and "sudo ifconfig wifi0 down"
[11:25] <nothlit> !info pmount | alex_
[11:25] <ubotu> pmount: mount removable devices as normal user. In component main, is optional. Version 0.9.13-1build1 (edgy), package size 39 kB, installed size 588 kB
[11:25] <leny> alex_: AFAIK usb disks appear in the /dev/sd? series. If you haven't got an SATA then 'sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt' should do.
[11:25] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: Then I typed in "ping www.google.com."
[11:25] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: It doesn't ping.
[11:25] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: We said to check the IP first.
[11:25] <Awal> can somebody tell me what the best way to install Steam is?
[11:26] <willskills> awal
[11:26] <alex_> leny: yes my usb media is /dev/sbd
[11:26] <Awal> yes
[11:26] <willskills> just copy your steam directory from your windows install
[11:26] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit and tonyyarusso: There's an ip. It's 192.168.0.7
[11:26] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: you seriously need to calm down a little
[11:26] <willskills> and run it through wine
[11:26] <willskills> I was playing CS ten minutes ago
[11:26] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: okay, you have an IP - on which interface ?
[11:26] <alex_> leny: but still this does not help me, I really need to change the way it mount them
[11:26] <Awal> ic
[11:26] <willskills> am playing WoW now
[11:26] <Awal> but I just nuked my hard drive so no windows right now
[11:27] <Awal> I can get to a different computer though
[11:27] <nothlit> Awal, the information tool steam or the game downloader steam
[11:27] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr: Okay, what do you mean by that? It's showing on my console.
[11:27] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: is this IP connected to the internet ? type "route -n" to see
[11:27] <leny> alex_: What do you want it to mount like?
[11:27] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: an interface is a network port
[11:27] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: What's showing, where on your console, as output of what?
[11:27] <nothlit> adaptr, on his ethernet
[11:27] <Awal> steam games like counter strike
[11:27] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr: It's showing 0.0.0.0 for gateway.
[11:27] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: what does "route -n" show you ?
[11:27] <nothlit> adaptr, he brought down his ethernet card to try wireless and when he brought eth0 back up his internet still no longer functioned
[11:28] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr:I just typed in "route -n"
[11:28] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: What are the destinations?
[11:28] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: great - now you need to show us what the result was
[11:28] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, that means your computer doesn't know your router is how it should get to the internet
[11:28] <alex_> leny, I am following a tutorial to install a debian sid on a usb media and I am using debootstrap for this, I have some chroot problem at the installation time, in the tutorial it says to remove the mount option noexe and nodev if this happens
[11:28] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr:It shows me the destination, 192.168.0.0, the gateway 0l0l0l0, and Genmask 255.255.255.0

[11:28] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: No others?
[11:28] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr:No others.
[11:28] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: I'd get a new IP, that should also set your gateway
[11:29] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: run "sudo dhclient"
[11:29] <nothlit> Awal, for help with wine or cedega, go to #wine and #cedega
[11:29] <leny> alex_: Generally such options appear in /etc/fstab

[11:29] <kitche> Emo_Samurai: ping this ip 64.233.167.99 it's google's
[11:29] <Awal> nothlit: thanks i will try that, I did try wine but it didnt work well
[11:29] <Awal> nothlit: I mean not at all
[11:29] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr:Okay, it's working, at least for the eth0.
[11:29] <nothlit> Awal, you can try cedega cvs, look online for guides
[11:30] <Awal> ok
[11:30] <leny> alex_: Which you can edit with sudo <editor-name> /etc/fstab
[11:30] <adaptr> Emo_Samurai: what's working ?
[11:30] <tonyyarusso> Emo_Samurai: When you try your wireless the next time, do the same thing.
[11:30] <Jowi> d1gital, hold down shift key to enable snap to border.
[11:30] <alex_> leny: I have looked into it but it does not specify it for usbmount
[11:30] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr: My ethernet's working.
[11:30] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:30] <Emo_Samurai> nothlit tonyyarusso adaptr: So when I take down eth0 and put up wifi0, I type "sudo dhclient?"

[11:31] <scrocco> nothlit: this the way I usually burn DVDs : I add Rock Ridge , Joliet and UDF and make a ISO9660 file, then i burn it on the disc
[11:31] <nothlit> Emo_Samurai, you have to get your wireless card drivers working and enter things like the SSID encryption method and password
[11:31] <d1gital> jowi:  that's all that is? i thought it was a whole different thing. thanks
[11:31] <wceoscar> HEy, I just gave my unalocated drive a fat32 partition wich wndows recognises without a prob... but on ubuntu i cant see the drive?????????????????

[11:33] <wyld> I'm thinking about buying a laptop and putting linux on it. Could anyone give me a recommendation on which brands/chipsets have good linux drivers?
[11:33] <leny> alex_: does usbmount allow you to do a 'sudo umount /dev/sbd; mount -o noexe,nodev /dev/sbd /mnt' ?
[11:33] <kitche> wyld: mostly lenovo laptops work great in linux
[11:34] <leny> alex_: oops do 'sudo bash' then do the bit from umount onwards

[11:34] <wyld> *lenovo
[11:34] <cypher1> wyld, i think there is a laptop testing team.. you can check the link to whether there are any problems with specific laptops

[11:35] <adaptr> Tjoels: make it executable and run it: #./binfile
[11:35] <mnoir> xerophyte: ask in #vim ?
[11:35] <nothlit> leny, you're telling him to mount something directly to /mnt? sans subdirectory?
[11:35] <adaptr> Tjoels: or just open it with a shell if it's a shell script installer: ./sh binfile

[11:38] <Jowi> yoiuwer, (streamtuner uses xmms to actually play the inet radio station but it is good in the way that it lists the stations by category for you: 80's, 90's, rock, classic etc etc)
[11:38] <ivx> hey how can i install ununtu on a sata device
[11:38] <BigCanOfTuna> tonyyarusso: how do I tell what runlevel I am in?
[11:38] <kitche> blekos: do you mean a ntfs drive?
[11:38] <adaptr> BigCanOfTuna: runlevel ?
[11:38] <Tjoels> adaptr: ok.. so if i want to uninstall the program again, is there an easy way to do that,?
[11:38] <leny> nolith: sorry I always use /mnt as temporary a mount. If I want a permenant mount it goes in /media is this wrong?
[11:38] <name>        runlevel - display previous and current runlevel
[11:38] <Jowi> BigCanOfTuna, type "runlevel" in a terminal
[11:38] <tonyyarusso> BigCanOfTuna: Yep, runlevel.  (Default is 2)
[11:39] <Rubin_> what is apt-index-watch? its always using like 50% of my cpu :(
[11:39] <leny> nothlit: sorry I always use /mnt as temporary a mount. If I want a permenant mount it goes in /media is this wrong?
[11:39] <BigCanOfTuna> thanks!!
[11:39] <alex_> there is nothing in /etc/fstab that say how to mount any hotplug device such as my usb media, can I create an entry there  or is there another place for this case ?
[11:39] <cypher1> yoiuwer,  rhytmbox
[11:39] <adaptr> Tjoels: that depends on what the installer *does*.. most 3rd-party installers install in /opt, under their own subdirectory, which should make it trivial to remove
[11:39] <lyy> what sould i type to install gcc and all other dev tools?
[11:39] <kitche> lyy: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:39] <lyy> thanks
[11:40] <kitche> leny: well your suppose to mount things in /mnt/<subdir> not in /mnt itself
[11:40] <Jowi> alex_, i have this in fstab for mine: "/dev/sdb1       /media/usb-disk vfat    defaults,rw,umask=000   0   0"
[11:40] <adaptr> lyy: you might want to rephrase "all other build tools" - there are several thousand of those
[11:40] <Tjoels> adaptr: so then i just need to remove the directory /opt/program/ to uninstall?
[11:40] <adaptr> Tjoels: if it was a well-behaved program, yes
[11:40] <alex_> Jowi, what version of ubuntu ?
[11:40] <nothlit> leny, no, like i said before you told him a command to mount the drive to /mnt rather than a subdirectory inside it
[11:40] <Jowi> alex_, your /dev/ will probably be a different one though
[11:40] <Jowi> alex_, I use dapper but this will work with any type of linux installation.
[11:40] <nothlit> leny, when you give people commands you have to be more careful than instructions
[11:40] <blekos> yes ntfs drive
[11:40] <Tjoels> adaptr: ok, thank you.
[11:41] <kitche> blekos: ok you want to use ntfs-3g then
[11:41] <yoiuwer> Jowi, hm ok ill try this one... i tried totem but there are bugs there i think, the transmition gets mixed up
[11:41] <leny> kitche & nothlit : sorry is this LSB directories that I've not read or something?
[11:41] <lyy> adaptr: gcc
[11:41] <kitche> leny: no it's actually been that way for a long time
[11:41] <Jowi> alex_, my line assumes that it is a fat formatted drive and that you want read/write abilities on it for all users.
[11:41] <lyy> and cc
[11:41] <slinky_> If I have DevHelp installed is there any reason to have Monodoc installed also?
[11:42] <adaptr> lyy: I understood that - and cc is a part of gcc
[11:42] <kent> slinky_: not unless you are developing with mono.
[11:42] <nothlit> leny, lol also, its generally permanent mounts can be in /mnt and temporary in media... though permanent can be in /media too
[11:43] <adaptr> slinky_: if it is a separate package then the chances are you do want them both, yes
[11:43] <alex_> Jowi: if I want to mount it by default but want to change an option can I do a defaults,exe for ex ?
[11:43] <leny> kitche:  Thx kitche I was trying to avoid making similar mistakes by reading the right docs . One trained HP-UX guy I knew mounted things as /local1 /local2 etc. I'm trying to learn from my mistakes.
[11:43] <slinky_> kent: what does Mono offer for development, I am not familiar with it
[11:43] <adaptr> alex_: you want it to be able to execute files ?
[11:43] <adaptr> slinky_: it's dot.net for Linux
[11:43] <NickK> Are there ubuntu packages for the development releases of MESA?

[11:44] <slinky_> ok thank you very much, a necessity for me :)
[11:44] <leny> nothlit: thx
[11:44] <Jowi> alex_, I think the auto-mount at boot option is called "auto" but check (man fstab)
[11:44] <zipzo> hi how can i get a cd iso burner? I dled and installed k3b through packet manager, but like many other programs i never get a start icon in my menu and when i go to the installed folder theres no executable file there
[11:44] <adaptr> zipzo: it sounds like you have more fundamental problems then
[11:45] <adaptr> zipzo: which package manager did you use ?
[11:45] <nothlit> Jowi, auto is for filesystems...all things in fstab get mounted at boot
[11:45] <zipzo> synaptic
[11:45] <python> hi
[11:45] <bun_tun_dun> hi. somebody here have made an authentication against samba PDC?
[11:45] <tshirtman> Bonsoir a tous
[11:45] <python> I'm downloaded ubuntu 6.10 from the site
[11:45] <adaptr> nothlit: of course not - only those that are set to auto get mounted at boot
[11:45] <python> downloading*
[11:45] <slinky_> After several crashes using kubuntu and KDE, I committed myself to Dapper Drake for the length of life it allows
[11:45] <nothlit> bun_tun_dun, have you checked the samba section of the server guide
[11:45] <tshirtman> enfin j'ai de nouveau le net chez moi ^^
[11:45] <python> Is it the live CD?
[11:45] <M3L7down> can you guys help me force my resolution larger?
[11:46] <Jowi> nothlit, thanks for clearing it up. i never auto mount my usb devices so it is of no real interest for me :)
[11:46] <M3L7down> well, not really force, my monitor can handle it
[11:46] <alex_> Jowi, but if I have an entry in my fstab, will it overwrite the auto mount currently in process ? should I restart any ps after editing this file ?
[11:46] <tshirtman> oups escuse me I thought I was on #ubuntu-fr
[11:46] <kitche> python: if you have the desktop-install cd it is
[11:46] <adaptr> M3L7down: what do you mean, "force"
[11:46] <M3L7down> I mean
[11:46] <python> cool kitche
[11:46] <python> I'm looking to dual boot linux
[11:46] <zipzo> adaptr: synaptic
[11:46] <M3L7down> I can't get it to detect my changes to the
[11:46] <M3L7down> sec
[11:46] <python> ubuntu is the best distro imo
[11:47] <M3L7down> I will find the file name again
[11:47] <python> apt-get rules
[11:47] <python> xD
[11:47] <Jowi> alex_, you can have multiple lines. but only one line per device. "mount -a" will remount the devices in the fstab
[11:47] <adaptr> zipzo: then you do have serious problems if you have nothing after installation.. I'd check that first
[11:47] <python> kitche , once I dl it, I can just run it live yes?
[11:47] <meshyf> Hey everybody, anyone know where I can find some Card reader drivers?
[11:47] <slinky_> I have a new computer arriving ina few days A duo core E6600, do I need the 64 bit version of ubuntu?
[11:47] <nothlit> adaptr, then defaults includes auto?
[11:47] <kitche> python: if you burn it to cd you can
[11:47] <python> yup, I have a dvd right here
[11:47] <zipzo> its been that way off and on, sometimes i get a program from package manager and it never show in the list

[11:47] <M3L7down> adaptr: I added lines to xorg.conf

[11:48] <nothlit> adaptr, sry haven't read man fstab in years
[11:48] <bun_tun_dun> on kubuntu, it works
[11:48] <M3L7down> I follow a forum post here
[11:48] <adaptr> M3L7down: if you want X to support whatever your monitor supports, then you have to add its capabilities to xorg.conf
[11:48] <M3L7down> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=315369
[11:48] <zipzo> in fact, i have noticed on every install of Ubuntu ive done that some programs you get from package manager never have an icon in the startup menus
[11:48] <nothlit> bun_tun_dun, have you checked the gdm xdmcp settings?
[11:48] <M3L7down> adaptr: I belive I did
[11:48] <python> forgive me kitche , but isn't 700megs small for ubuntu
[11:49] <bun_tun_dun> hum, i don't think so
[11:49] <M3L7down> but it can't be easy like this guy said right
[11:49] <M3L7down> lol
[11:49] <bun_tun_dun> let me see
[11:49] <python> last time I dl'ed ubuntu it was 2.1 Gb or something
[11:49] <nothlit> python, its compressed, and you must have d.led the dvd
[11:49] <zipzo> Is that normal? i mean i have alot of stuff on here now i cant remeber all its names
[11:49] <kitche> python: nope that's cd image the dvd image has more packages on it
[11:49] <adaptr> M3L7down: google for "monitorworld" and the make and model of yoru monitor, that will tell you its frequencies
[11:49] <blue-frog> how do i reconfigure my keyboard in console, pls?
[11:49] <python> :o
[11:49] <M3L7down> okay
[11:49] <nothlit> kitche, i thought dvd just = live+alternate
[11:49] <M3L7down> but I am absolutely sure my monitor can do this
[11:49] <python> i have Suse aswell, but its 5 cd's too much
[11:49] <M3L7down> windows works on this resolution
[11:49] <M3L7down> very well infact
[11:49] <adaptr> M3L7down: that's fine, but you have to *know* the specs. period.
[11:50] <slinky_> adaptr: hello, which version of ubuntu show i use with my new Intel Duo Core E6600? PC or 64 bit?
[11:50] <adaptr> M3L7down: get back when you have them
[11:50] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy amd64?
[11:50] <kitche> nothlit: if it was then that would be a lot of space wasted on the dvd since those would only take up 1.4 gigs of space
[11:50] <nothlit> python, you only need the first disc disc for basic stuff, the others should just be packages, but i don't use suse so i could be wrong
[11:50] <adaptr> slinky_: I have no idea whether 64 bit is as stable as 32 bit yet
[11:50] <adaptr> slinky_: otehrs can tell you much more
[11:50] <leny> blue-frog: loadkeys if you want to do it temporarily
[11:51] <python> desktop cd = live cd right?
[11:51] <kitche> python: didn't you say you have a dvd?
[11:51] <blue-frog> leny: permanently, have fr in terminal I want us
[11:51] <kitche> python yes
[11:51] <adaptr> M3L7down: actually, it is relatively easy - if you know what to change
[11:51] <nothlit> slinky_, 64 bit is fine but things like flash and binary blobs you'll have to run in 32 bit mode, which can complicate things
[11:52] <nothlit> python, the alternate cd is also a livecd, you know
[11:52] <funkyHat> Where would I report a bug about ipw2200 firmware needing updating?
[11:52] <slinky_> nothlit: will it run fine using PC version?
[11:52] <nothlit> !launchpad | funkyHat
[11:52] <ubotu> funkyHat: launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's Bounty and Bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/
[11:52] <Jowi> M3L7down, you can use "gtf 1280 1024 60 -x" or something similar depending of what you want, and paste the output for that command in the Monitor section in xorg.conf. you might need to add: Option "DDC" "false"       as well. but not 100% sure it's needed
[11:52] <nothlit> slinky_, basically you can use 64bit if you like but it'll be more hassle
[11:52] <kitche> nothlit: the alternate cd doesn't have a live system on it at least from what I have seen
[11:52] <python> nothlit , whats the difference?
[11:52] <M3L7down> adaptr: what do I need to change?
[11:52] <Belter_> is their problems with Linux and WIFI networking?

[11:53] <M3L7down> but there are only 3 choices
[11:53] <adaptr> M3L7down: what is the make and model of your monitor ? i'l lget them for you
[11:53] <M3L7down> of this producer
[11:53] <M3L7down> and they are all the same hrz
[11:53] <M3L7down> refresh rate I mean

[11:56] <nothlit> slinky_, like bare metal restore? mondo, regular backup, sbackup
[11:56] <ubuntu> can apt or dpkg check the integrity of the installed files ??
[11:56] <d1gital> yeah my average d/l speed on utorrent is like 85, nothing compared to 800
[11:57] <nothlit> !mondo | slinky
[11:57] <ubotu> mondo: powerful disaster recovery suite. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.08-2-2 (edgy), package size 391 kB, installed size 1128 kB
[11:57] <kitche> Tuxguy: yes since the filesystem is inside the iso
[11:57] <adaptr> M3L7down: from the sudo part onward, yes - but please get used to running a console terminal
[11:57] <Jowi> d1gital, are you behind a router?
[11:57] <M3L7down> I know
[11:57] <python> d1gital , whats ye home connectio?
[11:57] <M3L7down> I understand
[11:57] <Tuxguy> kitche, Ever had any luck, or heard of installing ubuntu on the imac G3?
[11:57] <d1gital> jowi: yes
[11:57] <slinky_> thank you nothlit
[11:57] <qkslvrwolf> So, my gnomebaker stopped recognizing mp3s to burn audio cd's....any ideas where to start?
[11:57] <PPAAUULL> Ok I want to play some 3d games on Ubuntu like ET and such but the problem is that everytime I start something that need the 3D it gives me this error "drmCommandWrite: -22" and on the next line "drmRadeonCmdBuffer: -22 (exiting)". Is there anyway of fixing it?
[11:57] <Jowi> d1gital, are the ports open for bittorrent in it?
[11:57] <adaptr> M3L7down: if you have xorg.conf open, find the "Monitor" section
[11:57] <nothlit> slinky_, sbackup is a great little tool if you're just worried about data
[11:58] <python> go to irc.p2p-network.net then join #utorrent
[11:58] <Pelo> Tuxguy,  someone mention they have done it, don'T ask me who I don'T recall but they seamed to be safisfied
[11:58] <nothlit> slinky_, most people prefer partimage but i am of the firm opinion that mondo is better
[11:58] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, installing Cedega might help... but if not, you just have to install Windows (I'm assuming its a Windows game?)
[11:58] <M3L7down> kk
[11:58] <Tuxguy> Pelo, My machine is 233mhz, 32mb ram, 4GB hd, can I do an installation?
[11:58] <python> Pelo , how come ur not on #utorrent pn p2p-net?
[11:58] <Arwen> all my media players break when using beryl - what should I do?

[11:58] <d1gital> jowi: yeah, i think so, i used to get like 10kbps before opening them, so i'm pretty sure i did it correctly, could be wrong tho
[11:58] <adaptr> nothlit: is mondo in the repos ?
[11:58] <Pelo> Tuxguy,  you might want to look into xubuntu
[11:59] <slinky_> ok thank you very much, i'll do some reading, you guys are great, thanks
[11:59] <PPAAUULL> Arwen, It is not a windows game it is a linux version.
[11:59] <M3L7down> I have found the monitor section
[11:59] <Arwen> d1gital, opening is overrated, I had 2MB up and 1.4MB down with closed ports
[11:59] <Pelo> python,   I use to be , I got in a a row with dwk
[11:59] <adaptr> M3L7down: when you have the Monitor section in front of you, fill in the values you got from monitorworld :
[11:59] <Spaghetti_Knife> tonyyarusso: Okay, I've downloaded madwifi, how do I compile it?
[11:59] <Tuxguy> Pelo, What's that? Just a smaller resource ubuntuu?
[11:59] <Arwen> PPAAUULL, what graphics card and what driver?
[11:59] <M3L7down> alright
[11:59] <qkslvrwolf> ubotu: I do use free formats when I rip cd's now, but I have a large collection.  Second, its been working, and now its stopped.  So this is not just a "how do I use mp3s on my ubuntu box" question
[11:59] <python> Pelo , yu heard what happened to Ludde?
[11:59] <M3L7down> if I disappear you know what happened
[11:59] <tonyyarusso> Spaghetti_Knife: I wouldn't know.  See !compile for starters.
[11:59] <Jowi> d1gital, i would double check. 6881-6889 tcp are the ports to use. redirect them to your computers ip address.
[11:59] <leny> blue-frog: You need to update /etc/console-setup/boottime.kmap.gz with the appropriate file. brb
[11:59] <python> Bram bought utorrent
[11:59] <python> bastard
[11:59] <slinky_> is there a url for mondo?
[11:59] <adaptr> M3L7down: HorizSync  30-69
[11:59] <qkslvrwolf> I have the codecs installed, and I'm listening to them right now
[11:59] <Pelo> Tuxguy,  yeah,  used xfce instead of gnome
[12:00] <python> and DWK and Directrix is furious
[12:00] <qkslvrwolf> its only gnome baker that isn't picking it up
[12:00] <Tuxguy> xfce is nice and lightweight
[12:00] <adaptr> M3L7down: VertRefresh  50-90
[12:00] <Pelo> python,  do you mean the deal with bram ? or something else ?
[12:00] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy amd64?
[12:00] <python> yes Pelo
[12:00] <mcscruff> lo all, im trying to mount a samba share but i keep getting this error 12037: session setup failed: ERRDOS - ERRnoaccess (Access denied.)
[12:00] <beerockxs> does anyone here have an ati x1900GT and know how to make normal console mode work after having started X once?
[12:00] <alex_> Jowi: ok, knowing that I disabled the gnome auto mount facility, how do I see to which /dev my flash media is attributed when hotplug ?
[12:00] <adaptr> M3L7down: don't be silly - none of this will influence X in hte slightest
[12:00] <alex_> Jowi: mount ?
