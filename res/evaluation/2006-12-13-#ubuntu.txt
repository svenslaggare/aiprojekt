[12:02] <devin_> I want to add my /home to a seprate drive! How should I partition the 2nd drive, and what should i add to fstab?
[12:02] <aluno_> hello
[12:02] <crisp> heh
[12:03] <CarCase928> weswh: how do i identify the card?
[12:03] <xipietotec> Is there some way to find out the most recently installed programs in ubuntu? I recently installed something that filters out questionable IP's (for filesharing) and I think it's blocking sourceforge servers, due to probably my misconfiguration...but I don't remember the name of the program
[12:04] <ailean> did i hear somewhere that ubuntu can handle rpms?
[12:04] <art_> leave #ubuntu
[12:04] <weswh-> CarCase928: lspci tells me precisely what my card is. otherwise, take it out and look for a model or part number or something. if you are lucky there is a clearly identified sticker on it...otherwise, look up the computer model etc. if the card came with it
[12:04] <Twinxor> ailean: yeah, use the package 'alien'
[12:04] <xipietotec> ailean: Yes...but it can break things, you're thinking about alien

[12:06] <hydrox> Hey, I'm having a bit of a problem,
[12:06] <weswh-> ailean: virus protection in that sense isn't really a big thing in linux.
[12:06] <mindtrick_> are universal repositories slow now? i can't download over 14kb/s
[12:06] <lupine_85> I think avast or avg have linux clients
[12:06] <lupine_85> not really needed though
[12:06] <ailean> anti-virus is needed
[12:06] <hydrox> When I maximize windows in gnome it maximizes over the panels
[12:07] <mnoir> weswh-: but it certainly should be
[12:07] <feugan3333> weswh-: If you have linux-sources installed read /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.15/Documentation/filesystems/hfs.txt
[12:07] <weswh-> ailean: maybe i'm just in the dark, but i don't even know of a so-called "anti virus" app for linux. avg for linux? ok..fair enough. guess i'll look into it for myself.
[12:07] <mobile> hello, plz help me i want to compile the madwifi on my home made kernel... it doesnt work...

[12:07] <jb0nd38372> Could someone help me with a permission problem when time permits?  Least I think its a permission problem
[12:07] <lupine_85> there's also amavis but that's for email

[12:09] <CarCase928> the card is built into the moterboard
[12:10] <feugan3333> weswh-: err sorry linux-source. It's rather big (kernel sources). Is there some way I could send your the hfs.txt file
[12:10] <cafuego_> CarCase928: 'nvidia-glx' and 'linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)'
[12:10] <FunnyMan3595> ailean: AVG does have a linux version, but compared to Windows, linux is 99% virus free.  Windows has major security problems that make an antivirus an absolute necessity, but under Linux, you don't really need one, as long as you're careful.
[12:10] <feugan3333> CarCase928: Thats fine. Follow the instructions on the link I gave you.

[12:14] <weswh-> CarCase928: backup your xorg.config file before you run that nvidia config -enable or whatever it is.
[12:14] <CarCase928> weswh: ok
[12:14] <FunnyMan3595> mnoir: Not really.  As long as you don't go around installing things from fishy sources, you should be alright.  Linux doesn't really have the problem of viruses that install themselves without you knowing.  And when something like that does show up, it gets fixed before it can become a problem.  Just remember to keep your software up-to-date, so that you don't fall afoul of an old security hole.
[12:14] <weswh-> CarCase928: i didn't have great luck with that util but ymmv
[12:14] <d1gital> jbond: try running it using sudo  and see if it says the same thing
[12:15] <zac1> how do you make a makefile from makefile.in and makefile.am

[12:15] <devin_> I want to add my /home to a seprate drive! How should I partition the 2nd drive, and what should i add to fstab?
[12:15] <FunnyMan3595> mnoir: And if you're installing fishy software, you should be using a dummy account anyway.  One that's not on the wheel and doesn't hold any important data.
[12:16] <mnoir> FunnyMan3595: NO.   Besides the threat from newly developed virii, there is the matter of passing on things to others.  Not acceptable
[12:16] <blatios_> 'lo all
[12:16] <jb0nd38372> d1gital:  No sudo lets it run without incident... I tried chown to make it work.. but either I did it wrong or something
[12:16] <feugan3333> devin_: Do you have another OS that need to access the drive. Cause that complicates matters
[12:16] <FunnyMan3595> mnoir: If it's newly-developed, the antivirus won't help!
[12:16] <LjL> uhm... when a run of fsck (-f -v options) gives a "file system was modified" in caps, it means it has corrected errors, right?
[12:17] <lupine_85> mnoir: right now, there isn't a /single/ virus in the wild for linux. that might change in the future, but right now rootkits and exploits are the more realistic threat
[12:17] <czer323> Look'n for some direction with this error.  Using only CLI.  ifup eth0 returns "ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0".  I've read online about checking the /etc/network/interfaces file, but i'm not sure what i'm looking for.
[12:17] <blatios_> glxinfo gives me lots of "Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0""
[12:17] <devin_> feugan3333 no, I just have a blank drive i would like to you for /home
[12:17] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Sounds more like you're trying to fsck a running system.
[12:17] <h0ndaracer2> hello this is my first time on ubuntu channel
[12:17] <blatios_> czer323, You need to add eth0 to the file
[12:17] <mnoir> FunnyMan3595: in some cases you are correct, but still, the need for ubiquitous filtering trumps that lessened risk that linux presents
[12:17] <feugan3333> There are viruses for linux. Google it

[12:18] <h0ndaracer2> ok ive recently installed ubuntu uninstalled stuff i didnt want and installed stuff i liked now whats sometin i can learn or do
[12:18] <feugan3333> devin_: Ok. I suggest ext3 filesystem. The default. Are you doing a new install or just adding the drive to an existing system
[12:18] <czer323> blatios_, I've added "iface eth0 inet dhcp" and that didn't quite do the trick.
[12:18] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Ah, got it.
[12:19] <d1gital> jbond:   you probably mistyped something when chowning  if you are the only user of the system, then just give full rwx access to both of those folders
[12:19] <d1gital> !chown

[12:19] <FunnyMan3595> LjL Sorry about the junk in the middle there, not sure where that came from.
[12:19] <LjL> mince: what about sudo apt-get install tcl8.0 ?
[12:19] <czer323> blatios_, sure thing, I'll just be searching around google.
[12:20] <devin_> feugan3333 just adding drive to existing system
[12:20] <blatios_> czer323, using dhcp?
[12:20] <weswh-> feugan3333: how can i get info on exactly which kernel, and which version of kde my system is running? (default edgy install)
[12:20] <ailean> ubotu, tell beibei about wine
[12:20] <czer323> blatios_, yeah, I'd like to use dhcp.  keeps things simple.
[12:20] <blatios_> czer323, auto eth0
[12:20] <jb0nd38372> d1gital:  So the command would be for me !chown /usr/bin/kiba-dock ?  or am I missing something, the file that starts it is /usr/bin/kiba-dock
[12:20] <h0ndaracer2> how do i delete those files in the documents it says i cant delete tehm
[12:20] <blatios_> czer323, iface eth0 inet dhcp
[12:20] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: well, what i got was slightly different. actually, what i'm doing is making sure the defrag program is not corrupting things. you can see the log of the whole thing at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36729/

[12:21] <ubotu> beibei: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[12:21] <feugan3333> weswh-: 'uname -r' will give you the kernel version
[12:21] <Moosejaw> hi guys...
[12:21] <h0ndaracer2> the examples i should say
[12:21] <blatios_> czer323, Substitute eth0 with whatever interface you're trying to add

[12:22] <blatios_> Does anyone know why glxinfo tells me GLX extension is missing even though I'm loading it in xorg.conf
[12:22] <mnoir> jb0nd38372: one command you should learn is man as in man <somecommand>   - this gives you access to basic doc

[12:23] <blatios_> babis85, ssh
[12:23] <d1gital> jbond:  give kiba another try without sudo and tell me if it says the same thing

[12:23] <blatios_> czer323, Any luck?
[12:23] <aristoteles> i just installed it, but how do i start it?
[12:23] <Moosejaw> blatios_: what libraries should i dload?
[12:23] <mnoir> babis85: there is a primitive cluent called 'talk'
[12:23] <blatios_> Moosejaw, The thing is, that should already be installed
[12:23] <babis85> blatios_: does ssh provide communication in messages?

[12:27] <babis85> mnoir: right, i don't know, i guess i have to start it through init.d directory?
[12:27] <blatios_> Moosejaw, You'll have to chmod it first
[12:28] <mnoir> I would start with ps auxwww|grep talkd
[12:28] <d1gital> jbond:  so its working now?
[12:28] <blatios_> Moosejaw, chmod a+x binfile    <-  gives all users the abiolity to run the binfile

[12:30] <kane77> hi
[12:30] <czer323> blatios_, Yep.  This was working, and occasionally works on it's own for some reason.  I haven't quite pinpointed the issue.  eth0 is the only card that I have.  and it's the only one that shows in ifconfig.
[12:30] <aristoteles> is there anyone here how has openoffice2.1 installed?
[12:30] <czer323> blatios_, it's cool.  i'll figure it out eventually.  thanks for the help though.
[12:30] <blatios_> Moosejaw, I have to go, I think it's a problem with the path, hope that helps

[12:31] <devin_> feugan3333 what should i name the partition/ and exactly how? with an kubuntu disk or fdisk?
[12:31] <zac1> !windows

[12:31] <jb0nd38372> <lupine_85> I tried the command that you pasted and got "chown: `jb0nd28272': invalid user" even though thats my login name
[12:31] <LjL> zac1: you really find that funny, don't you?
[12:32] <babis85> mnoir: talkd is running at both systems
[12:32] <zac1> i dont know
[12:32] <ReWT_AxS> Any ideas?
[12:32] <ReWT_AxS> im getting error:   Internal Error Failed to Initialize HAL!
[12:32] <lupine_85> jb0nd38372: sorry, 3 not 2 :)
[12:32] <feugan3333> devin_: Did you create an ext3 partition successfully?
[12:32] <LjL> zac1: then what about stopping? not banned enough times yet?
[12:32] <mnoir> I am getting connection refused too - I dunno what is filtering it...
[12:32] <zac1> no
[12:32] <jb0nd38372> Doh.. I even missed it... trying that
[12:32] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Welcome back.  Missed your reconnect.
[12:32] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: i was out smoking while it rebooted anyway ;-)
[12:33] <Music_Shuffle> Lol
[12:33] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Is the filesystem ext2 or ext3?
[12:33] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: ext3
[12:33] <zim> hi all
[12:33] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: and before you ask... i'm testing an experimental version of defrag that was patched to run with ext3
[12:33] <devin_> feugan3333 wasn't sure what to use to create it n00b<
[12:33] <zim> got a Q for someone who is goo with sound
[12:33] <linuxpoet> Why is sendmail rewriting my domains when it sends email even though I have explictly told it to not masquerade? This is dapper LTS
[12:34] <zim> goo = good sorry
[12:34] <weswh-> feugan3333: ok, reading over that HFS stuff - does that tell me anywhere to go? like i said, i don't care if the drive never works for mac again, I am going to format it once I get the data off of it.
[12:34] <tim167> how can I make an installable dvd of my entire ubuntu intallation ?
[12:34] <shwag> how do I show all the files installed for a package ?
[12:34] <jb0nd38372> Dlgital, Lupine, it worked... thanks so much, I really appreicate it
[12:34] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Okay, then my guess is that e2defrag isn't quite getting the journalling right, since the data itself checks out in the md5.
[12:34] <jb0nd38372> I want to try and learn cl rather than gui ways of doing things... I hope one day I can learn C and even do a lil development
[12:34] <shwag> LjL: dont use e2defrag
[12:34] <zim> I have a sony vaio  tr1mp and need to get sound working any one out there HELP
[12:35] <LjL> shwag: ?
[12:35] <feugan3333> devin_: Did you run the command I gave you, the mkfs.ext3 ?
[12:35] <shwag> LjL: no need
[12:35] <webben> d1gital, that /is/ the rep I'm using
[12:35] <FunnyMan3595> jbond: Personally, I'd avoid C like the plague, especially if it'd be your first language.
[12:35] <shwag> LjL: linux manages its own defragmentation
[12:35] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: well, yes, if you look, the only difference is in the ls diff, which shows a date change for / ... perhaps defrag did that for some reason, and didn't reflect it in the journal?
[12:35] <LjL> shwag: if it really did, nobody would have written defrag
[12:36] <kane77> I'm trying to create a partition on my usb flash disk.. what are the START/END parameters??
[12:36] <feugan3333> weswh-: Man, why are you trying to chmod when you just want to copy the files?
[12:36] <tim167> zim: what program do you need to have sound ?
[12:36] <devin_> feugan3333 brb
[12:36] <zim> all
[12:36] <zim> I have no sound
[12:36] <d1gital> webben: ...  ohh yeah ya know what you're right cuz i needed an update today and it couldn't retrieve it...   nope guess its borked right now
[12:36] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Keep in mind that the journalling info is separate from the data itself, so it won't show up in standard examination.
[12:36] <jb0nd38372> Funnyman:  What would you reccomend starting out with, I used basic back in the days of msdos.. but never took progamming serious... then got lazy with windows.. now ubuntu / linux has sparked my interest
[12:36] <LjL> shwag: and anyway, under artificial conditions (i.e. a partition i created and wrote files like mad to), i found a quite important performance improvement
[12:36] <tim167> zim: some programs make sound through jack
[12:36] <agent> a data dvd i received is being mounted with wrong permissions... doing mount -o with correct options does not seem to do anything - all other media mount correctly... whats wrong?
[12:37] <shwag> LjL: well, okay, suit yourself.
[12:37] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: well, if you look at the fsck run that's complaining, it does mention the journal (while the others don't)
[12:37] <shwag> jb0nd38372: ruby
[12:37] <tim167> zim: did you try alsamixer ?
[12:37] <shwag> jb0nd38372: python is good.  php is easy, but sucks in the long run.  ruby is awesome.
[12:37] <sindrum> any ideas which directory is the system sounds stored in?
[12:37] <webben> d1gital, ah okay, thanks :)
[12:37] <zim> tim167 no you are missing the point my sound car needs drivers/conf/somthing to work
=== moonlite1 is now known as moonlite
[12:38] <zim> no sound
[12:38] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: And shwag is somewhat correct, ext3 is fragmentation-resistant.  You don't really need to defrag under normal conditions, but as you pointed out, there are exceptions.
[12:38] <feugan3333> weswh-: Do you get errors when you copy the files as root?
[12:38] <tim167> zim: what soundcard? internal? usb ?
[12:38] <LjL> shwag: i certainly will, especially when, as i said, all i'm doing is *testing* an experimental patch that an ubuntu developer kindly devoted his time to. see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35993/ for the artificial-partition logs
[12:38] <NamelessJon> Ruby is awesome. I never used python much though
[12:38] <zim> internal laptop
[12:38] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Right.  Basically, it's bringing the journal back up-to-date with the actual filesystem contents.
[12:38] <shwag> LjL: linux manages fragmentation as long as there is 15% free space.
[12:38] <_SKiTZO> hi! I have struggled a while to get wifi working. I have a HP dv2004 laptop, and it seems that I will need to use ndiswrapper. I followed several forum threads on the subject, but I cant seem to get it to work
[12:38] <zim> sony vaio tr1mp
[12:38] <_SKiTZO> anyone care to help me?
[12:39] <jb0nd38372> Thanks  I'll go check out ruby :)
[12:39] <tim167> zim: hm not sure, maybe lspci shows you what type of soundcard your vayo has
[12:39] <kane77> 'doh... can anybody help?
[12:40] <Music_Shuffle> with?
[12:40] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: What you really need to do is find a way to examine the journal before and after, so that you can figure out what the defrag is messing up.
[12:40] <zim> AC'97 Audio Controller
[12:40] <x06vh> How, if possible, do I create a DOS bootable floppy in Ubuntu?
[12:41] <agent> _SKiTZO: your best bet is to find out your exact network card chipset make and type.. this is not the information you get in your manual or box (that just says who boxed your card and put their company stamp on it)... once you find out the chipset, THEN search the forum, google, etc. for that specific chipset/card
[12:41] <sindrum> any ideas which directory is the system sounds stored in?
[12:41] <tim167> zim: hm strance I have " AC'97 Modem Controller"
[12:41] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: no idea how to do that honestly... also, perhaps i won't be able to reproduce this again, at least until i give my fs a bit of fragmentation again ;)
[12:41] <kane77> Music_Shuffle, partitioning my usb drive
[12:41] <_SKiTZO> agent: good call
[12:41] <tim167> zim, no you're right, my soundcard is also AC'97
[12:41] <MrProper_> can anyone tell me how i apt-get install a specific version of a package (ie an older one then is currently available
[12:41] <_SKiTZO> agent: how would I do that? rip the lid off?
[12:41] <zim>  Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03)
[12:41] <weswh-> feugan3333: it just says "omiting folder", and stops.
[12:41] <LjL> MrProper_: sudo apt-get install packagename=version
[12:42] <agent> _SKiTZO: to do this, connect your network card to the computer and type: lspci THEN type lspci -vv for more info THEN type sudo lshw
[12:42] <green_earz> zim: to find out what the driver name is for sound card check out > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
[12:42] <weswh-> or in kdesu konqueror (drag and drop copy), it says "files do not exist"
[12:42] <feugan3333> weswh-: Show me the command you used?
[12:42] <arrenlex> MrProper_: A single package? apt-get install package/version.
[12:42] <zim> green_earz will do ty
[12:42] <MrProper_> LjL, cool, any way to list what package versions are available?
[12:42] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: In that case, I'd just write back to the maintainer and give them your log.  *e should at least know a way to debug it.
[12:42] <green_earz> np
[12:42] <zim> ty tim167 to
[12:42] <LjL> MrProper_: apt-cache policy packagename
[12:42] <agent> _SKiTZO: ripping the lid off usually will not help you as a company will just stamp their logo to make it look like they actually create the card and chipset
[12:42] <weswh-> feugan3333: (as root) cp /media/firewire/Users/wes/Music/windows /home/wes/music/windows
[12:43] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: sure, i'll certainly do that. i'll just wait until he's back on irc though i guess ;)
[12:43] <cld2> what do I need to install to get gcc to work for 6.10?
[12:43] <d1gital> i was here earlier and someone gave me a link to a site about making your own ubuntu livecds, does anyone have that link?] 
[12:43] <LjL> Ubotu, tell cld2 about build-essential | cld2, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:43] <cld2> LjL: thanks.
[12:43] <weswh-> cp: omitting directory `/media/firewire/Users/wes/Music/windows'
[12:43] <yoshig3> Anyone ever run Steam through wine on ubuntu?
[12:43] <feugan3333> weswh-: Thats a normal warning, you need to use the -R flag to copy directories "cp -vR /media/firewire/Users/wes/Music/windows /home/wes/music/windows"
[12:44] <agent> _SKiTZO: a lot of the time two brands, one no name and one well known will be actually selling the exact same card but one will be MUCH cheapter than the other
[12:44] <babis85> mnoir: i tried to add to /etc/hosts a line that associates the hostname with the local ip adress, but it did nothing
[12:44] <mike> I would like to change my apt sources to local mirrors,What is an easy way please
[12:44] <agent> weswh-: you need to pass -f option to cp so that it copies directories (if you want to do that)
[12:44] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Let me take a look and see if I can find a site for you...
[12:44] <feugan3333> agent: not -f, -R
[12:44] <_SKiTZO> agent: i identified my card pretty well with lspci -vv | grep -i -A 30 broadcom
[12:45] <agent> feugan3333: okay.... so its -r, whatever... i usually just type -rf and its fine
[12:45] <_SKiTZO> it says BCM4310 rev01
[12:45] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Are you just looking for how to burn one of the original livecds, or do you actually want to change what goes into it?
[12:45] <weswh-> feugan3333: seems to be working!
[12:45] <_SKiTZO> subsystem: hp unknown device 1361
[12:45] <klotho> hello... does anyone know how to get the wireless card to work in an IBM T-series? It loads the driver but the card always shows as "disabled"
[12:45] <feugan3333> weswh-: Man, all this for nothing :-)
[12:46] <d1gital> funnyman:  i want to change it
[12:46] <weswh-> feugan3333: tell me about it! haha. what do you want for christmas ;)
[12:46] <klotho> also, how do I get the file browser's search function to search all subdirectories?
[12:46] <zim> green_earz the sound driver shoul be snd-intel8x0,i810_audio
[12:46] <feugan3333> weswh-: Cofee
[12:46] <mnoir> babis85: try this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1398433#post1398433 - I am trying it now
[12:46] <DekKeD> any idea how to edit an IMG file?
[12:46] <agent> _SKiTZO: there you go, not go do a search on ubuntuforums for BCM4310, then try the wiki, then google, then ask here.... you usually want to ask here last as the chances are low someone here reading has and knows they have that exact card
[12:46] <mnoir> babis85: are you 6.06 or 6.10
[12:46] <mnoir> ?
[12:47] <_SKiTZO> agent: but i allready did that
[12:47] <weswh-> yeah? my gf works at starbucks, our pantry runneth over. e-mail me an address and i'll work it out
[12:47] <babis85> 6.06
[12:47] <mnoir> that one is for 6.06
[12:47] <babis85> cool
[12:47] <mnoir> good - might work :)
[12:47] <_SKiTZO> i allready followed several forum posts on BCM4310
[12:47] <agent> klotho: thinkpads should work without any help - make sure you enable your network card in network manager (if you use gnome)
[12:47] <feugan3333> weswh-: Going to sleep, good luck
[12:47] <agent> _SKiTZO: okay, then ask away :)
[12:48] <weswh-> feugan3333: thanks much. it was still educational, so not in vain :)
[12:48] <feugan3333> weswh-: True, true.
[12:48] <BlueLaguna> how can I get info about a specific disk?
[12:48] <SJr|Work> Anyone know of a good really intrusive proxy that I can use to log a session heavily
[12:48] <klotho> agent: I thought that would be the case, but when I enable the card it still shows as disabled in lshw
[12:49] <BlueLaguna> I have multiple drives under /dev/sda*, but I'm trying to identify which one's which
[12:49] <arrenlex> BlueLaguna: what kind of "info"? Like what partitions it has? sudo fdisk -l. Like, where it is mounted? "mount". Like, its free space? "df"
[12:49] <BlueLaguna> arrenlex: see my last statement
[12:49] <olrrai_> hi guys
[12:49] <agent> klotho: i did not know lshw shows that enabled/disabled status... maybe you mean ifconfig or iwconfig?
[12:49] <olrrai_> do u know what package I need to run xf86config ?
[12:49] <DekKeD> any idea how to edit an IMG file?
[12:49] <arrenlex> BlueLaguna: What information will help you identify which one's which? Partition type? Mount points? Size?
[12:49] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Here's an official page on Dapper.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e06
[12:50] <kittyhawk> hello
[12:50] <babis85> mnoir: how is it going?
[12:50] <agent> _SKiTZO: i just searched google/linux and had good sucess with information
[12:50] <kittyhawk> I just did a dist-upgrade and now X doesn't work
[12:50] <agent> _SKiTZO: www.google.com/linux
[12:50] <BlueLaguna> arrenlex: actually, fdisk -l seems to do the trick
[12:50] <arrenlex> kittyhawk: sudo apt-get install x-window-system-core
[12:50] <mnoir> almost there :)
[12:50] <klotho> agent: lshw says -  *-network:0 DISABLED
[12:50] <agent> _SKiTZO: search for BCM4310
[12:50] <kittyhawk> arrenlex: thanks, I'll try that
[12:50] <d1gital> funnyman:  thanks.  too bad i'm using edgy... darn
[12:51] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Yeah, looks like the equivalent page for edgy hasn't been written yet.
[12:51] <agent> klotho: neat... never noticed that before - what about ifconfig and iwconfig?
[12:51] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Still, a lot of the info there may still apply.
[12:51] <olrrai_> do u know what package I need to run xf86config ?
[12:51] <cafuego_> you don't run xf86config
[12:51] <olrrai_> (sorry my disturb)
[12:51] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Maybe you could write the edgy guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e10.  :)
[12:51] <cafuego_> you run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[12:52] <olrrai_> oh, thanks
[12:52] <mnoir> babis85: it is working on 1 single sys
[12:52] <d1gital> funnyman:  yeah, from what it looks like, i am guessing what they mean by dapper-specific is that they use 6.06 where edgy would be 6.10
[12:52] <klotho> agent: iwconfig says: wlan0     no wireless extensions
[12:52] <mnoir> you need to install xinetd per that link
[12:52] <lasse> hi.  My Marvell Yukon Ethernet connection isnt recognized by Ubuntu 6.10. I've been googling this a bit, but i cant seem to find any answers there. Could someone please help me?
[12:52] <d1gital> if i am successful, i will write one for edgy
[12:52] <mnoir> I do not hv snd sys done yet
[12:52] <mnoir> snd=2nd
[12:52] <BlueLaguna> hmm, do /dev/sda and /dev/sda1 refer to the same drive?
[12:53] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: Right, so things may have moved around a bit.  Still, it's a starting point.
[12:53] <arrenlex> BlueLaguna: /dev/sda is the first hard drive. /dev/sda1 is the first partition on that drive.
[12:53] <green_earz> zim: i am a debian user so should be very simular setup to config sound. see if the command sudo alsaconf    dose any thing
[12:53] <klotho> agent:  ifconfig doesn't show it at all
[12:53] <d1gital> funnyman:  wait, so can i just build a dapper cd or does taht mean i have to actually be using dapper to make it?
[12:54] <arrenlex> green_earz: That command doesn't exist in the ubuntu packages.
[12:54] <green_earz> OK thanks
[12:54] <blue-phuz> hello all can some one tell me how to fix a screen corruption problem on my laptops gf4 mx 420 using ubuntu 6.10 and the latest nvidia glx
[12:54] <klotho>  btw, where's the standard place to put a mysql java connector jar?
[12:54] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: You should be able to build the dapper CD from edgy, but that's not really what you want to do, is it?
[12:54] <agent> klotho: ifconfig does not show your network card? do note that your network card can be named eth0, wlan0, or even wifi0 (replace 0 with any number)
[12:54] <agent> klotho: in /dev/null ;)
[12:54] <ubun> when i install a kde based app like amarok, does it install everything needed to run KDE on my system?
[12:55] <dope_> how do i set gvim as my default text editor instead of gedit
[12:55] <klotho> agent: it's wlan0, which is how it shows up in lshw
[12:55] <agent> klotho: just joking, dont mv it into /dev/null
[12:55] <arrenlex> ubun: No.
[12:55] <ubun> dope_ i right clicked on a .txt file and choose 'open with' and changed it to 'gvim' might be other ways
[12:55] <d1gital> funnyman:  i will try to builld the edgy one first, but as i am mainly just doing this as a learning experience, i may end up making one for dapper
[12:55] <klotho> agent: thanks, I know not to put it there!
[12:55] <arrenlex> ubun: only everything needed to run that particular application.
[12:55] <FunnyMan3595> d1gital: The point is that you'll have to change some steps accordingly, including the obvious one of getting the edgy livecd iso to start with.
[12:55] <mnoir> babis85: getting promising errors now
[12:55] <dope_> ubun: i just want to double click and have it open
[12:56] <agent> klotho: you are trying to connect to a router, correct? and your router has dhcp working, correct?
[12:56] <ubun> dope_ what i said will work, you just have to do it for all the types of files you want, .c, etc
[12:56] <d1gital> funnyman:  yeah... that's the hard part since i installed dapper from the disc then upgraded... so it looks like im downloading it  :-(
[12:56] <dope_> i know it does
[12:56] <klotho> agent: I'm first of all just trying to get the card to show up in ifconfig, but eventually I want to be able to go to a cafe and connect to a router there
[12:56] <anandanb1> hi

[12:56] <bruenig> !hi anandanb1
[12:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hi anandanb1 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:57] <bruenig> !hi | anandanb1
[12:57] <ubotu> anandanb1: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[12:57] <agent> how do i change the permissions of a media files inside of a mount point? currently i get 500 with some goofy data dvd but all other media work as expected
[12:57] <BlueLaguna> arrenlex: hmm, fdisk -l doesn't give any output for /dev/sda2
[12:57] <ubun> dope_ you'd think it'd be in 'system->Preferences->prefered applications
[12:57] <BlueLaguna> Does that only mean the disk doesn't have any partitions?
[12:57] <anandanb1> i have a problem with the updates in ubuntu
[12:57] <arrenlex> BlueLaguna: Then that drive only has one partition. Does this not sound right?
[12:57] <Agiofws> how does someone as use mount a partition in uubntu ?
[12:57] <olrrai_> how can I know my video card Identifier?
[12:58] <agent> klotho: okay, so you have no dhcp access right now, correct?
[12:58] <babis85> mnoir: from edgy says 'your party is refusing messages', while from dapper 'connection refused' and i have applied the things of the post you gave me to dapper
[12:58] <BlueLaguna> arrenlex: how can I find out the amount of space that hd contains then?
[12:58] <bruenig> dope_, very simple, right click on a file, select properties, change the open with. All files with that filetype you just changed will now obey the open with that you set.
[12:58] <BlueLaguna> it's not mounted
[12:58] <Helpmeee> I just installed ubuntu, and I can boot it but after ubuntu has completed the loading my screen goes blue
[12:58] <babis85> mnoir: and my dapper output of mesg is y
[12:58] <klotho> agent: I do. I'm connected right now on an actual wire on my OTHER ethernet card
[12:58] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: You can't usually mount in user mode, you have to be able to enter root mode.
[12:58] <klotho> via dhcp
[12:58] <green_earz> olrrai_: lscpi -v  will give you pci info
[12:58] <arrenlex> BlueLaguna: fdisk -l should show that at the top. Or you could use "df".
[12:59] <mnoir> babis85: i am at exactly same point!
[12:59] <d1gital> any suggestions as to a good download manager?
[12:59] <mnoir> this is more work than i wanted right now :)
[12:59] <dope_> awesome, thx
[12:59] <mnoir> but it cannot be that hard to fix....
[12:59] <BlueLaguna> arrenlex: /dev/sda2 isn't mounted.  fdisk -l /dev/sda2 gives no output
[12:59] <olrrai_> thanks green_earz
[12:59] <dope_> you guys always have an answer for all my questions
[12:59] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: Unless that's been granted by root.  The classic example of that is mounting a cdrom or other removable media.
[12:59] <green_earz> np
[12:59] <agent> klotho: sorry, i meant wireless dhcp.... and are you connected to the network using  a network card on the same machine/
[12:59] <babis85> mnoir: ok, nevermind
[12:59] <babis85> mnoir: thanks for your help
[12:59] <h0ndaracer2> hello everyone
[12:59] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,   ths is what has happened  mount: special device /dev/disk/by-uuid/00ECF459ECF44A84 does not exist
[01:00] <arrenlex> BlueLaguna: If you run "sudo fdisk -l" just like that, it will list all information about all partitions on all hard drives in your system, whatever their state.
[01:00] <klotho> agent: yes, I'm connected on wired ethernet on the same machine via dhcp, using the eth0 interface
[01:00] <blue-phuz> can some one help me fix a screen corruption problem on my laptops gf4 mx 420 using ubuntu 6.10 and the latest nvidia glx
[01:00] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Try: ls /dev/disk/by-uuid
[01:00] <mnoir> i will keep on trying :)
[01:00] <BlueLaguna> ah, thanks
[01:01] <green_earz> olrrai_: and if you want to know the driver name for the card > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
[01:01] <olrrai_> excelent!
[01:01] <tim167> is there a way to make an installable image on DVD from my entire ubuntu installation ?
[01:01] <blue-phuz> Help plz
[01:02] <blue-phuz> my evil gfx card is twiggin
[01:02] <agent> klotho: well heres the thing: you network card will not show up enabled unless you connect to some network if you try to use dhcp (because if dhcp fails netowrk card bails out) - point being, your netowrk card will be enabled if it has a checkmark in network manager and is connected to a network... without a check it will be diabled... this of course makes sense and it is supposed to be like that
[01:02] <lasse> how do i get ubuntu to check for hardware and install the drivers for my very common Marvell Yukon ethernet card?
[01:02] <babis85> tim167: try AptOnCd
[01:02] <slipttees> i have problem, with the LVM Groups...
[01:02] <vector_sum> I have a problem too, with NetworkManager
[01:02] <slipttees> no halt my system!
[01:02] <agent> klotho: what you should try doing is connect with your network card via static ip - i never tried this without a wireless ap or router around
[01:03] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,  07548e20-a2d3-4ec6-806f-0e4c0e78a0eb  ab82ab50-e6ba-4580-92b4-0ed4b4890b5d  457F-37F1  whats that
[01:03] <arrenlex> lasse: It should do that automatically.
[01:03] <slipttees> I'm am using ubuntu 6.06.1 all upgades!
[01:03] <klotho> agent: how do I get it to search for available access points? I don't think it's actually working because it doesn't show up in ifconfig, but if it was, how would I search for the access points?
[01:03] <slipttees> updates*
[01:03] <jvai> hey ppl
[01:03] <drkm> when my WIFI drops.. how do I get it to reconnect?
=== DreamThief is now known as DreamThief|off
[01:04] <ubun> dang, gnome really goes a lot faster when i use the 'simple (thin appearance, high performance) theme
[01:04] <agent> klotho: my wired netowrk card is also not listed in ifconfig because its not connected (i don't have it checked in network manager) but it has worked fine for years
[01:04] <blue-phuz> help my evil gfx card is twiggin
[01:04] <FunnyMan3595> w Agifws: Looks like the UUID you think the drive has isn't the one that linux knows about.  Or that it never created the link for it.
[01:04] <snowshoefox> hi... how do can I setup fireFox to play mp3 files?
[01:04] <zim> hi all i still cant get my sound to work but im abit better informed my sound card is a 2801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC97 Audio Controller97 Audio Controller and the driver should be snd-intel8x0,i810_audio how do i get this working as it is NOT :(
[01:04] <snowshoefox> <or any audio file for that matter?>
[01:04] <h0ndaracer2> where can i get adobe photoshop cs 2 for ubuntu
[01:04] <tim167> babis85: thanks ill have a look
[01:04] <klotho> agent: okay, so how do I get it started and search for access points?
[01:04] <babis85> drkm: maybe by running sudo ifup <interface> --force
[01:04] <lasse> arrenlex: ok, but I have a common motherboard, ASUS A8N-SLI, with a common 2 common on board network cards, one marvell yukon and one realtek thingy, and none of them are recognized
[01:04] <drkm> babis85: anything easier like going to network settings in gnome?
[01:05] <lasse> arrenlex sudo ifconfig gives me this eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
[01:05] <agent> klotho: use iwlist
[01:05] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: Basically, that gave you a list of the disk UUIDs that linux knew about.
[01:05] <babis85> tim167: np, you can completely customise your installation
[01:05] <agent> klotho: iwlist wlan0 scan
[01:05] <Agiofws> i have ubuntu and wnat to mount this partition please help me " hdb5                    Logical   W95 FAT32                       104855,87 "
[01:05] <arrenlex> lasse: How curious. I, too, have an asustek motherbord, a marvell yukon integrated NIC and a realtek ethernet card, and everything is recognised fine.
[01:05] <lasse> arrenlex, and ifconfig -a only shows lo0 wlan0 ra0
[01:05] <klotho> agent: no scan results
[01:05] <slipttees> ???????????????

[01:05] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: Do you have a directory created as a mount point yet?
[01:05] <yoshig3> guys!
[01:05] <lasse> arrenlex, ive had the very same motherboard on another computer and it worked great (with hoary, that is)
[01:05] <yoshig3> I need working nvidia drivers T.T
[01:06] <arrenlex> specialdave: On Gnome? Probably gaim.
[01:06] <d1gital> specialdave: Gaim
[01:06] <specialdave> cool ty
[01:06] <zim> specialdave GAME is good
[01:06] <ubun> gnome that comes with dapper is gtk2.0 right?
[01:06] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,  let me see
[01:06] <agent> klotho: i think it needs to be listed with iwconfig for it to scan.... hrm
[01:06] <zim> specialdave GAIM is good Sorry
[01:06] <lasse> arrenlex, what can i do to fix this? my wifi connection is really unstable because of some thick walls, so i really need this to work
[01:07] <snowshoefox> NM, i, i will be installing mozilla-mplayer
[01:07] <zim> specialdave it should be install by default
[01:07] <klotho> agent: yeah, that's the problem. It seems to be disabled
[01:07] <slipttees> that fuck is happening with the LVM in ubuntu ..... never halt my ubuntu correctly
[01:07] <slipttees> ??????????
[01:07] <PriceChild> !language
[01:07] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:07] <agent> klotho: correct
[01:07] <jorgp> anyone familiar with hdparm?
[01:08] <klotho> agent: which was my problem the first time... so... ?
[01:08] <sedrake> Anyone knows what this error means? "Aritmetiskt fel (core dumped)"
[01:08] <yoshig3> Is there anything I can do in ubuntu to fix graphical perfomance issues?
[01:08] <jorgp> why would I get only 50M/s, I have dma on, IO 32bit
[01:08] <yoshig3> I have some new drivers....
[01:08] <agent> klotho: so it shows up in ifconfig but not not in iwconfig, right? (i don't remember now)
[01:08] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: The mount command is: sudo mount -t fat32 /media/hdb5 /path/to/mount/directory
[01:08] <oslo>  does someone here has already success to use gmailfs ??
[01:08] <klotho> agent: no, it doesn't show up in ifconfig
[01:08] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: But you need to create a blank directory to mount it to first.
[01:08] <klotho> only in lwsh
[01:08] <blue-phuz> can some one help me fix a screen corruption problem on my laptops gf4 mx 420 using ubuntu 6.10 and the latest nvidia glx
[01:09] <agent> klotho: okay... what card are you using and what module is being loaded?
[01:09] <babis85> dkrm: i don't anything easier than this, it is only a command, just type it replacing <interface> by eth1 (i think so)
[01:09] <ubun> how do i change the theme of ubuntu from gnome-look (the look if icons/apps)
[01:09] <slipttees> 
[01:09] <slipttees> right order nobody answers!
[01:09] <slipttees> :(
[01:09] <slipttees> i have much problems with the LVM later update my system
[01:09] <zim> This is a Q to anyone good with soundcmy sound card is a 2801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC97 Audio Controller97 Audio Controller and the driver should be snd-intel8x0,i810_audio how do i get this working as it is NOT :(
[01:09] <slipttees> no halt!!! somebody hemp me, please ?
[01:10] <klotho> agent: the card is Prism 2.5 Wavelan chipset, and the driver being loaded is driver=p80211_prism2_pci driverversion=0.2.5
[01:10] <agent> slipttees: with your foul language and attitude is it a surprise no one is helping?
[01:10] <slipttees> sorry
[01:10] <babis85> mnoir: xinet.d service doesn't exist in edgy
[01:10] <slipttees> but...	
[01:10] <slipttees> nobody helps me: (
[01:10] <agent> klotho: okay, i do not have any experience with this card... have you tried searching ubuntuforums?
[01:11] <babis85> mnoir: maybe this is the reason ...
[01:11] <agent> __mikem: scroll up (not too far)
[01:11] <klotho> agent: it's just the standard card that came with most of the T-series IBM laptops
[01:11] <tim167> zim:I'm not that experienced with that, but... what does lsmod say ? does it list your soundcard ?
[01:11] <d1gital> when you chroot, and then install a package, the package gets installed in the folder you have chrooted into, not the normal folders, correct?
[01:11] <_SKiTZO> who are these people? that makes me have to extract firmware from a windows driver to have my wifi work on a linux box... *sigh*
[01:11] <zim> yes
[01:12] <agent> klotho: try thinkwiki.org they usually have all the answers when it comes to thinkpads
[01:12] <BlueLaguna> how do I list all the groups on the system?
[01:12] <_SKiTZO> agent: thanks alot it seems to work
[01:12] <zim> tim167 yes
[01:12] <slipttees> agent: sorry..am using google tranlation!
[01:12] <dope_> how do i rename a the ftp shortcut name
[01:12] <sindrum> what should i use to convert .oog file to .wav?
[01:12] <BlueLaguna> or see a list of all the groups on the system rather
[01:12] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,   yes there is a dir /media/hdb5 now how do i mount ?
[01:12] <agent> _SKiTZO: great!
[01:12] <tim167> zim: i remember getting midi to work by simply doing modprobe snd-seq, maybe modprobe snd-dev or something (again, not sure tho)
[01:13] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: You misunderstood.
[01:13] <__mikem> agent, found it
[01:13] <klotho> agent: nah, they just say it worked with previous versions of ubuntu
[01:13] <klotho> nothing on 6.10
[01:13] <Agiofws> in fstab  ?
[01:13] <Agiofws>  i have ubuntu and wnat to mount this partition please help me " hdb5                    Logical   W95 FAT32                       104855,87 "  and the line in fstab is UUID=00ECF459ECF44A84 /media/hdb5     vfat     defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
[01:13] <slipttees> agent: where I find logs of lvm?
[01:13] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: You need a blank directory somewhere to mount to.  Just create a directory wherever you want it to be.
[01:13] <Agiofws> there is dir
[01:14] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: The mount command is: sudo mount -t fat32 /media/hdb5 /path/to/mount/directory
[01:14] <Agiofws>   /media/hdb5
[01:14] <green_earz> zim: to install the driver for the card you can use the app modconf : sudo apt-get install modconf  : then sudo modconf and track down the driver for the sound card : but first is the driver all ready install : lsmod | grep snd    and can you see it ?
[01:14] <Agiofws> empty
[01:14] <Agiofws> huh ?
[01:14] <agent> klotho: in truth, it is very odd that your wireless card is not working - its not normal for a thinkpad to have problems with linux.... have you tried rmmod <your module> modprobe <your module> AFTER you disable your wired ethernet connection in network manager?  you may have problems with having two netowrk cards on at the same time
[01:14] <Agiofws>   /media/hdb5 is the device ?
[01:14] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Right, if I'm reading that right...
[01:14] <agent> slipttees: /var/log probably like every other system wide log file
[01:15] <mnoir> babis85: I got it but not yet in X
[01:15] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Which isn't guaranteed.
[01:15] <agent> klotho: i have used many thinkpads including t and x series w/o problems
[01:15] <slipttees> but	
[01:15] <Agiofws> UUID=00ECF459ECF44A84 /media/hdb5     vfat     defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
[01:15] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: It'd be the other way around in that case, with the device as /dev/hdb5.
[01:15] <Agiofws> isnt that the dir
[01:15] <Agiofws> so whats the command ?
[01:15] <klotho> agent: there seems to be a problem in 6.10
[01:16] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Try: sudo mount -t fat32 /dev/hdb5 /media/hdb5
[01:16] <zim>  green_earz http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36736/
[01:16] <klotho> agent: I read about some other computers using this same chipset and it was loading two drivers, so I followed those instructions but they still didn't help
[01:16] <slipttees> but which? it has several!
[01:16] <slipttees> dmesg?
[01:17] <agent> klotho: you know.... if you have a space non 6.10 live cd (could be a different distribution) i would load it up to see if the card works... if it shows up check what module is loaded... may be 6.10 is loading the wrong module or 6.10 has a bad module
[01:17] <pablo_> hi, is it fine a piii with 700 mhz for ubuntu?
[01:17] <lupine_85> pablo_: sure
[01:17] <somerville32> pablo_: You might look at Xubuntu.
[01:17] <klotho> agent: I used the alternate disk... reinstalling would be kind of a pain
[01:17] <anandanbu> Hi
[01:17] <somerville32> !xubuntu | pablo_
[01:17] <ubotu> pablo_: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[01:17] <agent> klotho: i menat "if you have a non..."
[01:17] <agent> klotho: no, do not reinstall just use a live cd of some kind
[01:18] <babis85> mnoir: great, but how. saying 'not yet in X' you mean that you are logged at a simple shell without loading X server?
[01:18] <h0ndaracer2> ok how do i install a program from the command line in ubuntu for example im installing firefox
[01:18] <klotho> agent: which version do you think I should try?
[01:18] <jollyroger1210> I have an old COmpaq presario 5150 which will run ubuntu, except for the ram.  It only has 96 megs, is that enough?
[01:18] <pablo_> mm so you dont recommend kde or gnome on a 700 mhz piii?
[01:18] <Moosejaw> has anyone successfully installed the poker app PPSsetup.bin on edgy???  I keep getting an error, and it seems common but I havent found a fix.
[01:18] <mnoir> actually - i have it now in 2 win in x but not yet tween 2 machines by dns name
[01:18] <mike> Enough for text mode jollyroger lol.
[01:18] <h0ndaracer2> how do i install
[01:18] <mnoir> almost there....
[01:18] <jollyroger1210> mike: thanks a ton
[01:19] <Micksa> okay, ubuntu developer people
[01:19] <Micksa> we really need a new format for /var/lib/dpkg/info
[01:19] <Micksa> just FYI
[01:19] <agent> tough choice.... but maybe newest knoppix live cd? or dapper?
[01:19] <green_earz> zim: its there snd_intel8x0    so are you a member of the auido group ? use the command :  groups   to see
[01:19] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: Personally, I'd go grab the official version of firefox.  It's one of the things that annoys me about the debian family.
[01:19] <h0ndaracer2> what you mean the officaill i was just upgrading to the 2.0 version
[01:20] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: But if you want the ubuntu standard, that's: sudo apt-get install firefox
[01:20] <Rebecca> hi peoples. i have an amd64 system. i have read the ubuntu faq. it's currently running deb amd 64 but i want to switch to ubuntu... is it really worth installing the amd64 version of ubuntu.. the chroot stuff game me a headache with deb
[01:20] <zim> ok
[01:20] <zim> yup
[01:20] <zim> am a member
[01:20] <agent> FunnyMan3595: nothing wrong about debian ideology... at least they try to be true to freedom software by having a somewhat strict policy
[01:20] <mnoir> babis85: grrrr - connection refused tween machines on same subnet - i dunno what is wrong
[01:20] <h0ndaracer2> like i saved it on my desktop and extracted firefox 2.o what do i do next to install it
[01:21] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: Basically, the debian group (which ubuntu is a child of) and the mozilla foundation (who make firefox) don't get along, so if you want the *real* version, you have to get it from the firefox people directly.
[01:21] <arrenlex> Rebecca: a) why would you want to switch from debian? b) It's a huge headache with no benefits. Stick with 32.
[01:21] <h0ndaracer2> i got it directly
[01:21] <L0cKd0wN> hey guys
[01:21] <arrenlex> !hi
[01:21] <L0cKd0wN> i've been trying to VNC all day
[01:21] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[01:21] <h0ndaracer2> andi extracted the files now what do i do
[01:21] <agent> __mikem: because seveas packaged and fixes the kernel you run on (plus tons of other stuff), thats why ;)
[01:21] <FunnyMan3595> agent: Yeah, I get the philosophy, but I think what the mozilla people have been doing makes perfect sense, so...  *shrugs*
[01:22] <sedrake> what do i write to get error messages in english instead of local language?
[01:22] <L0cKd0wN> here's what im dealing with with VNC: http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a179/ArcTuRuX/screen.jpg
[01:22] <klotho> agent, okay, thanks for trying to help
[01:22] <R4Nd0M> in winblows i can hold alt and key an ascii value and when I release alt it will insert that char.  Is there a way to do this in linux?
[01:22] <arrenlex> agent: Yes, but typically the ops lurk.
[01:22] <Rebecca> arrenlex: because i first installed this deb setup when it was still unofficial and very experimental.. so it has plenty of quirks... i need to reinstall and ubuntu looks nice
[01:22] <babis85> mnoir: if we try to find out the correspondent package to xinett.d in edgy?
[01:22] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: Okay, what form did you get it in?  Source tarball?
[01:22] <green_earz> zim: so driver installed your install auido group so it may be that the sound is muted in alsamixer : use the command alsamixer and see if it a channel that muted
[01:22] <Micksa> argh
[01:22] <h0ndaracer2> lol im a noobie to this stuff so you lost me their funnyman
[01:22] <mnoir> it is same - I installed on 1 6.10 machine and 1 6.10
[01:23] <mnoir> and 1 6.06 :)
[01:23] <agent> R4Nd0M: yes, in fact, you can even switch your keyboard layout whenever you want to different languages.... system -> preferences -> keybaord layout for your options
[01:23] <Rebecca> arrenlex: is there really much performance gain? i think i will just go 32bit
[01:23] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: What's the filename that you got?  Particularly the extension (if any)
[01:23] <arrenlex> Rebecca: There is no perceptible difference, I believe.
[01:23] <h0ndaracer2> tar.gz
[01:23] <Rebecca> arrenlex: then ill save myself some headaches and go 32. thanks :)
[01:24] <R4Nd0M> thanks
[01:24] <h0ndaracer2> is that it funnyman
[01:24] <FunnyMan3595> !tar | h0ndaracer2
[01:24] <ubotu> h0ndaracer2: Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[01:24] <L0cKd0wN> anyone wanna help me with VNC?
[01:24] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: Yeah, that's a tarball.
[01:24] <L0cKd0wN> stuck here:
[01:24] <L0cKd0wN> http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a179/ArcTuRuX/screen.jpg
[01:24] <h0ndaracer2> now whtat do i do
[01:25] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: Personally, I usually open them via command line, but you can use the link ubotu just pointed out.
[01:25] <Agiofws>  sudo mount -t fat32 /media/hdb5 /path/to/mount/directory
[01:25] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: From a command line...
[01:25] <Agiofws>  sudo mount -t vfat /media/hdb5 /path/to/mount/directory
[01:25] <h0ndaracer2> ok thanks
[01:25] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,  it worked
[01:25] <babis85> mnoir: it doesn't exist such a package
[01:25] <agent> h0ndaracer2: its a tarball that is compressed (tar does not compress - it just files, gz = the compression on top of tar)
[01:25] <R4Nd0M> agent: i use ascii chars that are not typically mapped to a key. (i.e. ASCII 146)

[01:26] <olrrai_> where is /etc/X11/XF86Config, or what is its replacement?
[01:26] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,  now  when i try to copy files  to it   it says permison dinied can you help me on this one ?
[01:26] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: tar -xvf filename
[01:26] <LjL> R4Nd0M: not an ASCII char... ASCII is 7 bits ;)
[01:26] <yoshig3> Hey guys, what does "Sync to VBlank" do?
[01:26] <arrenlex> olrrai_: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:26] <agent> R4Nd0M: you can set a special key (forgot the name) in the keybaord layout options
[01:26] <yoshig3> should I disable it for better performance?
[01:26] <olrrai_> ok
[01:26] <zim> green_earz nothing muted
[01:26] <green_earz> zim: turn your volume down and see if the command cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp    puts out a sound or any errors on the terminal
[01:26] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: On the second one, the filename will have changed (dropped the .gz extension)
[01:26] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: Ack, messed up...
[01:26] <R4Nd0M> I'll try that - thought ASCII was 0-255 decimal and 0 being null
[01:27] <yoshig3> HEY GUYS! What does "Sync to VBlank" do!?
[01:27] <zim> green_earz cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp
[01:27] <FunnyMan3595> h0ndaracer2: The first command should be *gunzip*.  bzip2 is for .tar.bz2 files.
[01:27] <green_earz> yes

[01:27] <yoshig3> What's "Sync to VBlank" mean?
[01:27] <zim> copy did not work
[01:28] <arrenlex> h0ndaracer2: Are you trying to extract a gzipped tarball? "tar xzf <file.tar.gz>"
[01:28] <LjL> FunnyMan3595: at any rate, even 'tar' alone will find out if and how the archive is compressed, and extract it first
[01:28] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Sorry, two conversations...
[01:28] <yoshig3> What's "Sync to VBlank" mean?
[01:28] <yoshig3> What's "Sync to VBlank" mean?
[01:28] <Agiofws> sorry FunnyLookinHat
[01:28] <Agiofws> sorry FunnyMan3595
[01:28] <LjL> arrenlex: or "tar xf" for either gzipped or bzipped
[01:28] <h0ndaracer2> idk im lost with all the conversations going on at once
[01:28] <LjL> yoshig3: don't spam
[01:28] <yoshig3> LjL: No one will answer me lol
[01:28] <yoshig3> LjL: What's "Sync to VBlank" mean?
[01:28] <L0cKd0wN> has anyone ever seen that?
[01:28] <__mikem> Hey LjL
[01:28] <L0cKd0wN> or ideas on how to fix?
[01:28] <yoshig3> LjL: I know you'll answer me :D
[01:28] <L0cKd0wN> or anything at all? lol
[01:28] <FunnyMan3595> LjL: Some systems I work on don't have (de)compression built into tar, so I do it in two stages by habit.
[01:29] <FunnyMan3595> Agifws: Okay...
[01:29] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: You'll need an extra tag in the mount line.
[01:29] <LjL> yoshig3: it means that the screen is redrawn during the vertical blank time, which is the time during which a cathodic ray tube's ray is switched off in order to reposition it to top-left
[01:29] <zim> green_earz bash: /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
[01:29] <Agiofws> which is ?

[01:29] <h0ndaracer2> im just gona leave
[01:29] <LjL> yoshig3: and you're muted for 10 minutes
[01:29] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Start off by doing umount on the directory you just mounted to.
[01:30] <babis85> mnoir: it works prefectly if i connect from edgy to dapper through ssh and then run 'talk username'
[01:30] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: And then use the same mount command as before, but make it start out: mount -w -f ...
[01:30] <__mikem> LjL, I said Hi

[01:31] <L0cKd0wN> i just get a small window with the logo
[01:31] <LjL> oh hi __mikem. didn't notice that, too many highlights nearby :P
[01:31] <L0cKd0wN> (again relating to VNC problems)
[01:31] <green_earz> zim: see if this one dose any thing     lspci -nv && amixer -c0
[01:31] <__mikem> oh its alright, I see you have your hands full anyway
[01:31] <R> hey, I just started using ubuntu and I have a quick question.
[01:32] <R> Im using the live disc
[01:32] <R> but I cant seem to get on the internet.
[01:32] <LjL> __mikem: not really
[01:32] <magic_ninja> what's the latest version of cedega
[01:32] <Agiofws> sudo mount -f -w -t vfat /dev/hdb5 /media/hdb5 FunnyMan3595
[01:32] <Agiofws> ?
[01:32] <m1key> I installed regular ubuntu on my 64bit machine and now I want to upgrade to x64 version of everything is there an easy way to do this?
[01:32] <babis85> mnoir: i guess that we have to make some configurations like that in dapper (from the post you gave me), but in which file???
[01:32] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: Try it.
[01:32] <Jbirk> Hello
[01:32] <FunnyMan3595> Agiofws: You'll probably need to sudo umount /media/hdb5 first, though.
[01:32] <Jbirk> I have a question about iTALC with Ubuntu
[01:32] <Agiofws> what about  changing the line in fstab ?
[01:33] <Agiofws> i did that
[01:33] <babis85> mnoir: the reverse direction (ssh to edgy from dapper and then talk) doesn't work
[01:33] <zim> green_earz http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36737/
[01:33] <m1key> easy way to upgrade to x64 from i386
[01:33] <m1key> !channel
[01:33] <FunnyMan3595> Can't really help with fstab, it's not a subject I know.  :(

[01:35] <anandanbu> i have a problem with ubuntu and the internet connetion.whenever i open more than one tab in the firefox the connection goes off.when i plog it displays 'connection terminated' and 'modem hangup'
[01:35] <Agiofws> FunnyMan3595,  still not letting me

[01:37] <L0cKd0wN> well it was hard to describe heh
[01:37] <FunnyMan3595> Okay, Agiofws has gone past my level of experience.  Anyone around who might be able to figure out why mount -w didn't give *m a writeable system (fat32)?
[01:37] <spx2> anyone know how to get gaim to put status the music i'm playing with xmms ?

[01:38] <zim>  green_earz did you get this ???  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36737/
[01:38] <arrenlex> Agiofws: Can you write to it as root?
[01:38] <green_earz> zim: the out put looks ok may be that the sound app is not config to alsa. fire up xmms and have a look at if its using alsa as its sound demom
[01:38] <Agiofws> don't know
[01:38] <arrenlex> Agiofws: Well try. o_O
[01:38] <Agiofws> i'm trying this
[01:38] <Agiofws> now

[01:39] <L0cKd0wN> i've been waiting 4 hours, so sorry if I keep asking
[01:39] <Agiofws> with the umask option
[01:39] <L0cKd0wN> just frustrated at this point
[01:39] <L0cKd0wN> this is where i'd pay for technical support if ubuntu had a local phone number lol
[01:39] <zim> installing xmms
=== james is now known as njan
[01:39] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wn: Is it doing that at the machine as well, or only over VNC?
[01:40] <Agiofws> L0cKd0wN,  wnna pay me
[01:40] <L0cKd0wN> FunnyMan3595: only over VNC, I can ssh and manipulate the box
[01:40] <jvai> lol
[01:40] <green_earz> zim: yes sudo apt-get install xmms
[01:40] <L0cKd0wN> lol no i don't wanna pay
[01:40] <L0cKd0wN> there's close to 900 people in this room
[01:41] <L0cKd0wN> and nobody knows what im talking about lol...
[01:41] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Just to double-check, if you sit at the machine, you can log in just fine, with the usual graphical interface?
[01:41] <L0cKd0wN> i must communicate horribly
[01:41] <L0cKd0wN> FunnyMan3595: yea if I hook up a monitor to the box, works fine
[01:41] <spx2> anyone know how to get gaim to put status the music i'm playing with xmms ?
[01:42] <L0cKd0wN> I followed the instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC
[01:42] <L0cKd0wN> exactly
[01:42] <L0cKd0wN> word for word
[01:42] <zim> output plugin ALSA 1.2.10
[01:43] <green_earz> zim: open xmms on a sound file and see if it will make a sound we hope
[01:43] <tom_kelleher> is there a way to mount an .iso file so that I don't have to burn it to a CD?
[01:43] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Which part of it?  Connect to your desktop or start sessions?
[01:44] <L0cKd0wN> FunnyMan3595: well from my understanding, it looks like I can't start a session, cuz vncserver is running or I wouldn't see anything at all, correct?
[01:44] <zim> green_earz :( nope
[01:44] <calm> quick question: where are ppd files located?
[01:45] <zim> bars jump ups and down no sound
[01:45] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: If you just do "connect to your desktop", that creates a VNC server on :0 that should match your in-chair view.
[01:45] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Anything that uses hardware accelleration will show up black, for the obvious reason.
[01:46] <L0cKd0wN> I followed "Enabling other computers to Connect to XDM/GDM and start sessions."
[01:46] <L0cKd0wN> cuz, im on windows Xp
[01:46] <zim> why is nothing with a sony simple
[01:46] <L0cKd0wN> windows xp -> ubuntu box (via VNC)
[01:47] <zim> I love sony for style build Q etc but hardware and linux sucks
[01:47] <green_earz> zim: haa it playing if you can see movement on xmms interface. chech your jack plugs for the sound out put lead
[01:47] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: The first method should still work under windows, I've used it myself.
[01:47] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Try that and see if you can get to your desktop.  It looks to me like the vnc server is having trouble starting gnome.
[01:48] <L0cKd0wN> I only see "using Gnome / Ubuntu" and "using KDE / Kubuntu" instructions, nothing for windows
[01:48] <zim> nope i get sound in windoze and and the sony startup jingle but not in 6.10
[01:48] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: But the first method piggybacks off of an existing gnome session, so it bypasses that.
[01:48] <nofxx2> hi.. my mouse was working on the live cd and it dosent work anymore after install, any help?
[01:48] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Right, you want the gnome instructions.
[01:48] <nofxx2> xubuntu
[01:48] <tom_kelleher> is anybody familiar with WINE and Games in Ubuntu?
[01:48] <L0cKd0wN> System > Preferences > Remote Desktop
[01:49] <L0cKd0wN> i don't have those
[01:49] <L0cKd0wN> i'd have to hook a monitor up
[01:49] <L0cKd0wN> login
[01:49] <L0cKd0wN> and do that
[01:49] <zim> green_earz nope i get sound in windoze and and the sony startup jingle but not in 6.10
[01:49] <rastilin> tom_kelleher; what about them?
[01:49] <tom_kelleher> rastilin; I'm trying to play StarCraft with WINE in Edgy
[01:49] <green_earz> tom_kelleher: sudo -s  then mount -o loop cd-miage.iso /mnt    then cd to /mnt   and ls
[01:50] <rastilin> So, what's the problem?
[01:50] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Yeah.  Obviously not something you want to be doing in the end, but it would help verify what is working in the VNC connection.
[01:50] <tom_kelleher> rastilin; well, if I install it with WINE will it 'just work'
[01:50] <L0cKd0wN> see what im saying FunnyMan3595, if we're looking at the same set of instructions, I can't enable those options because I don't have initial access to the box, only ssh atm
[01:50] <rastilin> Pretty much
[01:50] <tom_kelleher> rastilin; I'll give it a try then
[01:51] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Right.  Okay, let me massage Google for a bit here, see if I can find anything.
[01:51] <green_earz> zim: sorry but i am at a lost here. the driver install your in the sound group and its the mixer not muted. it be small small thing
[01:51] <babis85> mnoir: i dit
[01:51] <babis85> mnoir: i did it
[01:52] <zim> i hate small things
[01:52] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Oh, have you tried looking at the log?
[01:52] <zim> you cant kick them
[01:52] <zim> ty for your time
[01:52] <L0cKd0wN> FunnyMan3595, new to ubuntu, where is the log file located?
[01:52] <babis85> mnoir: but there is still a small problem, i can use talk from dapper to edgy and not in reverse
[01:52] <green_earz> tom_kelleher: once you mounted the .iso as sudo -s you can exit back the the normal user mode
[01:52] <daniminas> it is possible to change where firefox save all user configurataion?
[01:53] <tom_kelleher> green_earz; will I be able to play StarCraft from an ISO without a CD ?
[01:53] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Take a look at your terminal output in the screencap.
[01:53] <rastilin> You can do the mount with only one command.
[01:53] <babis85> mnoir: i installed xinetd and then i applied the instructions mentioned in the topic from ubu forums
[01:53] <L0cKd0wN> FunnyMan3595: nothing stands out particularly

[01:54] <zero-1> what can I do ?
[01:54] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Amazing the useful information programs print out sometimes.  :)
[01:55] <WonderClown> I have a question about upgrading dapper->edgy *without* using the graphical update-manager app.
[01:55] <WonderClown> I can't use update-manager because these boxes do not have any X libraries installed, so I can't install update-manager, because it's a gtk app.
[01:55] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Take a look at the bottom of that file.  It may have some big ugly error messages, or it may just... stop.
[01:55] <WonderClown> So I need to use apt-get, or aptitude, or some other text-mode tool.
[01:55] <WonderClown> But the official upgrade instructions have dire warnings about using apt-get, so what am I to do?
[01:56] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: If it just stops, chances are that the last line will tell you what got stuck while trying to load.

[02:00] <h-edge> Using dual-head and xinerama in edgy on laptop, is there a way to disable secondary on the fly when not in use?
[02:00] <L0cKd0wN> i've seen 'vncserver' 'Xrealvnc' etc.
[02:00] <h-edge> because when my external isn't being used application like to open over on a screen I cant see...
[02:00] <h-edge> and I cant get them onto the screen I can see.
[02:01] <h-edge> just being able to switch which screen they're on would be good enough
[02:01] <eviltwin> much better >_<
[02:01] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: vncserver should be fine.
[02:02] <h-edge> on that note, having to use IRC in gaim... because xchat is stuck on my other screen

[02:08] <carutsu> hello
[02:08] <apokryphos> hi
[02:08] <carutsu> Have you ever heard that a sound card get disconfigured?
[02:08] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: There might be something important in one of the /var/log files, maybe X0rg.0.log
[02:08] <carutsu> my sound card was ok til yesterday
[02:09] <carutsu> now not even totem makes any sound
[02:09] <L0cKd0wN> FunnyMan3595: ok i'll look there as well
[02:09] <carutsu> i just installed Beryl, any conections?
[02:09] <FunnyMan3595> L0cKd0wN: Sorry, that's Xorg.0.log.  Your username's getting me into a zero frenzy.
[02:10] <h-edge> maybe I didn't explain this very well, lol : I use ubuntu with dual head on my laptop, when I have the external disconnected programs still appear on the secondary, but I obviously can't access them. E.g right now I'm using Gaim because Xchat is appearing on the external and I can't get to it. How would I either move the switch which screen a programs on? or, disable the external when not plugged in?
[02:10] <arrenlex> FunnyMan3595: That's the l33t xorg log =P
[02:10] <n2diy_> Does the MinimalCD install give you X?
[02:10] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[02:10] <FunnyMan3595> arrenlex: No, I keep all of those in /dev/null.
[02:10] <sc4ttrbrain> l0l
[02:11] <Flannel> n2diy_: minimal CD installs a normal install (same as alternate CD), just with downloading straight from repositories, instead of off the CD
[02:11] <grodius> Hey if i attached a camera to my comp, how do i access the pictures on it ?
[02:11] <LjL> Flannel: minimal cd would be mini.iso?
[02:11] <FunnyMan3595> arrenlex: Though if you're a believer, you might put them in /v4|-/106/
[02:11] <Flannel> LjL: correct
[02:12] <n2diy_> Flannel, fine buisness, does it include X?
[02:12] <LjL> Flannel: besides, i'm curious how it can be that small... the debian businesscard cd is about 30 megs
[02:12] <carutsu> I'm having troubles with my resolution too
[02:12] <Flannel> n2diy_: yes.  It installs a normal Ubuntu desktop.  Well, it has options for that, or a GUI-less install, (and maybe OEM, I'm not sure).
[02:13] <humblerodent> hi, there's got to be a fairly simple way of converting a PNG image into a 1-second-long MPEG2 movie with no sound, but I can't seem to figure out how....can anyone help?  TIA
[02:13] <carutsu> i need 1280 but its currently 1024, my xorg.conf shows that it is 1280 however it isnt
[02:13] <Orangekid13> total noob question... trying to install an NVIDIA driver and it says it "must be run as root"
[02:13] <n2diy_> Flannel, Roger that.
[02:13] <eriksay1> sudo
[02:13] <Orangekid13> what do i do
[02:13] <deep> Orangekid13: sudo
[02:13] <eriksay1> orangekid: sudo it
[02:13] <humblerodent> Orangekid13: put sudo in front of the command
[02:13] <humblerodent> lol
[02:13] <deep> hahah :D
[02:13] <Flannel> LjL: it has no packages.  Just the installer, packages all come from the interblag.
[02:13] <eriksay1> everyone jump on orangekid
[02:13] <humblerodent> lol
[02:13] <deep> Yeah :D
[02:13] <carutsu> even i knew that
[02:13] <Orangekid13> ok thanks
[02:14] <humblerodent> np
[02:14] <Orangekid13> well this is my first day
[02:14] <humblerodent> well, welcome :)
[02:14] <deep> Orangekid13, Welcome :D
[02:14] <humblerodent> you gotta endure the n00b jokes until you get good
[02:14] <humblerodent> it's worth it
[02:14] <Orangekid13> well first day off the live cd
[02:14] <carutsu> before i installed linux i readed a lot on windows, lol
[02:14] <lasse> its an honest question, dont laugh
[02:14] <LjL> humblerodent: i see "kipi-plugins" and "dvd-slideshow" that are probably able to do that
[02:14] <h-edge> first day, and installing Nvidia drivers... eek :)
[02:14] <humblerodent> LjL: I'll check those out, thanks.
[02:14] <FunnyMan3595> !sudo | Orangekid13
[02:14] <ubotu> Orangekid13: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[02:14] <humblerodent> h-edge: heh, yeah....
[02:14] <LjL> Flannel: but afaik that goes for the debian bc cd as well, except for packages that are considered necessary to make the cd itself run
[02:15] <eriksay1> anyone have experience setting up samba, specifically to share drives with windows, across a wireless network?
=== trurl_ is now known as trurl
[02:15] <LjL> humblerodent: the keyword i looked for was "slideshow" - thought it made sense. just make one with only one image...
[02:15] <carutsu> unless is a graphical which must use gksudo
[02:15] <humblerodent> LjL: eww....kipi-plugins is KDE?  lol
[02:15] <LjL> humblerodent: well yes
[02:15] <humblerodent> yeah, that's an idea I suppose.
[02:15] <lasse> eriksay1, ive had lots of trouble with it :D
[02:15] <eriksay1> lasse: thanks
[02:15] <LjL> humblerodent: but then it says "MpegEncoder:        Create an MPEG slideshow from your images"
[02:15] <carutsu> any ideas about my problem?
[02:15] <humblerodent> true
[02:16] <Timeline> Hey everyone
[02:16] <arrenlex> !hi
[02:16] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[02:16] <Orangekid13> "You appear to be running an X server; please exit X before installing."
[02:16] <lasse> eriksay1, but i have resolved my problems though
[02:16] <Orangekid13> crappers
[02:16] <h-edge> anyone got any ideas about what I asked a minute ago :)
[02:16] <Orangekid13> i hate errors
[02:16] <humblerodent> Orangekid13: you gotta shutdown the X server
[02:16] <Orangekid13> what is it
[02:16] <lasse> eriksay1, whats your issue?
[02:16] <lasse> Orangekid13, sudo killall gdm
[02:16] <arrenlex> Orangekid13: /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:16] <humblerodent> I would do a "sudo killall gdm" but that's a little unconvential....someone might have a better idea
[02:16] <arrenlex> xD
[02:16] <humblerodent> unconventional*
[02:17] <humblerodent> let's all jump on him again
[02:17] <humblerodent> lol
[02:17] <FunnyMan3595> Orangekid13: Beware, that kills your GUI.
[02:17] <Orangekid13> mmm tasty
[02:17] <arrenlex> Everyone! Orangekid13 is giving piggybacks!
[02:17] <humblerodent> be on the CTRL+ALT+F1 console to do that
[02:17] <GaiaX11> which is the program to convert mp3 into wmv in ubuntu?
[02:17] <lasse> Orangekid13, save open stuff
[02:17] <eriksay1> lasse: laptop, accessing the network wirelessly, cannot see the samba share
[02:17] <FunnyMan3595> Orangekid13: If you're not used to working at a command prompt, you'd better make sure you know how to do stuff there before you try that.
[02:17] <arrenlex> GaiaX11: How exactly do you convert a sound file into a video file?
[02:17] <Timeline> What's a good open-source WMA to MP3 converter for Windows and ubuntu?
[02:17] <lasse> eriksay1, your ubuntu laptop is samba client or server?
[02:17] <h-edge> ... you do realise telling him to kill X is going to confuse the hell out of him.
[02:17] <h-edge> lol
[02:18] <GaiaX11> arrenlex: sorry wma
[02:18] <Orangekid13> i'm gonna put this off, i have a math review packet for my final tomorrow and i have to study for my cpts 223 final tonight too
[02:18] <Orangekid13> ttfn
[02:18] <Orangekid13> thanks though
[02:18] <cablesm102> Timeline: VLC will convert anything it can open to anything else.
[02:18] <humblerodent> not a problem
[02:18] <cablesm102> but that may not be the best choice
[02:18] <LjL> Timeline: note that converting lossless->lossless like that is generally not a good idea. you'll lose quality
[02:18] <cablesm102> you mean lossy-lossy
[02:18] <lasse> cablesm102, no hes right
[02:19] <LjL> cablesm102: hm yeah, that i do
[02:19] <eriksay1> lasse: it's the pc that's ubuntu, that's the samba server
[02:19] <LjL> lasse: no i'm not
[02:19] <arrenlex> LjL: xD How does lossless->lossless lose quality?
[02:19] <eriksay1> lasse: the laptop is windows xp
[02:19] <LjL> arrenlex: it doesn't
[02:19] <eriksay1> (wife's computer)
[02:19] <cablesm102> Lossy-Lossy does. Not lossless-lossless
[02:19] <cablesm102> WMA, MP3 are lossy
[02:19] <lasse> LjL, it does... every convertion looses data
[02:19] <FunnyMan3595> arrenlex: Yeah, no kidding.  I'd best be careful the next time I try to zip up something that was in a tarball!
[02:19] <LjL> lasse: no
[02:19] <cablesm102> Not lossless-lossless though
[02:19] <cdavis_> when using ettercap arp poisoing it breaks my traffic flow to the gateway, any ideas?  this is a fresh install
[02:19] <arrenlex> lasse: Lossless by definition means no data is lost.
[02:19] <lasse> * not data, quality
[02:19] <arrenlex> Thus, lossLESS.
[02:19] <LjL> lasse: no
[02:20] <cablesm102> lasse, lossless encoding does not lose quality
[02:20] <lasse> pff, and  CDs sounds better than LPs?
[02:20] <carutsu> if no data is lost no quality is lost
[02:20] <carutsu> can anyone help me!?
[02:20] <eriksay1> lasse: i rightclick on the folder (in ubuntu) and set share properties > go to general windows setting, point it to the Domain / Workgroup that I setup on the laptop
[02:20] <LjL> lasse: what does that have to do with anything?
[02:20] <cablesm102> carutsu, with what?
[02:20] <cablesm102> i don't see anything above that you've written
[02:21] <carutsu> I'm on a laptop and my screen has a resolution of 1280, however it only displays 1024
[02:21] <Timeline> Well reason I'm asking, is a friend has an Ipod but can't play her WMA music she ripped from CDs. So I need to find a converter
[02:21] <lasse> LjL, i was thinking everyting, but im gonna back down, becuase im realising im on thin ice here
[02:21] <carutsu> i tried editing xorg.conf, with no results
[02:21] <h-edge> gleh, how do I disable secondary monitor on the fly?
[02:21] <carutsu> it even says that it suport 1280
[02:21] <lasse> eriksay1, hmm. the first thing you can try is the check if the workgroups match on both machines
[02:21] <h-edge> or stop programs loading onto that space.
[02:21] <LjL> lasse: you really are. if you're using a lossless format, it means everything that the soundcard managed to capture is there, bit by bit. if you convert that to another lossless format, you'll just be changing the... format. the data (i.e. sound) bits will remain the same.
[02:22] <cablesm102> carutsu, after you edited xorg, did you check the Resolution setting thing?
[02:22] <LjL> lasse: but MP3 and WMA (and Vorbis, etc) obviosuly are *lossy* format, my slip of the tongue notwithstanding, so converting between those *will* lose quality
[02:22] <carutsu> of course, i'm not that noob
[02:22] <arrenlex> lasse: What you are saying is if you take a .zip archive and change it into a .tar.gz archive, you lose data. This is incorrect. You just changed formats. They are both lossless compression schemes
[02:22] <arrenlex> (you would hope_
[02:22] <arrenlex> )
[02:23] <cablesm102> carutsu, are you sure you edited xorg correctly?
[02:23] <FunnyMan3595> arrenlex: That analogy sounds familiar...
[02:23] <sc4ttrbrain> carutsu: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ?
[02:23] <MacMatt> Hello!?
[02:23] <LjL> arrenlex: try the opposite... i'm not sure ZIP supports unix permissions :P
[02:23] <FunnyMan3595> !hi
[02:23] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[02:23] <carutsu> i havent't tried that
[02:23] <lasse> LjL, and here i was going around thinking I shouldnt do that because every convertion to on format to another no matter the type, will lose at least loose some small amount of quality,
[02:23] <cablesm102> sc4ttrbrain, that won't do much
[02:23] <arrenlex> FunnyMan3595: Sorry, did I steal someone else's analogy? xD I went downstairs for most of the argument.
[02:23] <cablesm102> carutsu, it's already been run when the system was installed
[02:23] <carutsu> oh
[02:23] <cablesm102> carutsu, that should only be necessary when you change monitors
[02:23] <FunnyMan3595> arrenlex: I'd directed it at you a bit ago, actually.  :)
[02:24] <carutsu> well i edited and added just a line
[02:24] <carutsu> let me see what was it
[02:24] <MacMatt> Looking to try Linux for the first time, ... is there a recommended way for setting it up on a iMac G5 ???
[02:24] <LjL> lasse: but that's untrue.
[02:24] <carutsu> something about line
[02:24] <GaiaX11> which is the program to convert mp3 into wav in ubuntu?
[02:24] <Timeline> LjL: So converting WMA to MP3 isn't a good idea? I should just tell her to re-rip everything to MP3?
[02:24] <FunnyMan3595> arrenlex: Made it particularly amusing to see you pick the same one.
[02:24] <LjL> lasse: lossy formats will, lossless formats just won't
[02:24] <lasse> LjL, then i learned something today
[02:24] <arrenlex> FunnyMan3595: OMG! You DID XD That is so weird. I did NOT see that.
[02:24] <LjL> Timeline: if possible, absolutely yes (well, actually, you might want to tell her to re-rip to Ogg Vorbis instead)
[02:24] <FunnyMan3595> Timeline: If that's an option, it'd certainly give the best quality.
[02:24] <lasse> LJL, btw, im going to check that up
[02:24] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Timeline about restricted | Timeline, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:24] <arrenlex> Maybe my subconscious did.
[02:24] <Red-Sox> hey guys
[02:24] <mike> I have a noob question
[02:24] <h-edge> anyone? disabling secondary monitor on the fly?... I suppose I could edit xorg.conf and restart X but thats ALOT of effort everytime I want to walk around with my laptop.
[02:25] <Red-Sox> 'Wonderin how to upload songs from my iPod
[02:25] <mike> can any of you point me to a page that shows the keyboard controls for beryl
[02:25] <lasse> h-edge, turn the power off?
[02:25] <Agiofws> how can you  send a movie to s-video to tv and still surf  the web on your monitor ? is that possible ?
[02:25] <Timeline> Will Ipods play ogg?
[02:25] <Red-Sox> Yeah
[02:25] <Red-Sox> Timeline: ^
[02:25] <rapid> Agiofws, yeah
[02:25] <cablesm102> carutsu, in Section "Screen" you will have to copy the most likely-looking profile, add it below the rest, but edit the resolution
[02:25] <sc4ttrbrain> mike: wiki.beryl-project.org ?
[02:25] <Agiofws> rapid,  how ?
[02:26] <h-edge> lasse: what exactly do you mean?
[02:26] <arrenlex> Timeline: No.
[02:26] <mike> They actually have no info on it.
[02:26] <carutsu> i just added this
[02:26] <humblerodent> LjL: dvd-slideshow seems like crap =P
[02:26] <carutsu> 	ModeLine "1280x800_60.00" 83.5 1280 1344 1480 1680 800 801 804 828
[02:26] <arrenlex> Timeline: just dump your wma to a .wav and then lame it to mp3.
[02:26] <mike> All I want to do is zoom out of my cube.
[02:26] <cablesm102> carutsu, then save open files and restart X (ctrl-alt-backspace)
[02:26] <rapid> Agiofws, you just have two screens setup
[02:26] <GaiaX11> which is the program to convert mp3 into wav in ubuntu?
[02:26] <humblerodent> I'll try the other one though
[02:26] <sc4ttrbrain> mike: they have ! i just read it when installing beryl
[02:26] <arrenlex> GaiaX11: Do you mean, wav to mp3?
[02:26] <lasse> h-edge, i was kidding, if you want to disable your secondary monitor on the fly, just turn it off, cut the power and so on
[02:26] <mx-> is programming in c on ubuntu easy?
[02:26] <mx-> I want to write some code
[02:26] <mx-> :D
[02:27] <arrenlex> mx-: c is c.
=== antoninus is now known as anto9us
[02:27] <carutsu> the only mode avalible is 1280x800
[02:27] <levander> Why is everyone installing beryl now?  Isn't beryl supposed to be a lot more seemlessly integrated into feisty than it is with edgy?
[02:27] <Agiofws> rapid xinerama ?
[02:27] <sysdoc> mike,  the keyboard settings are in the beryl settings manager
[02:27] <hueblur> is anyone available to help a newb?
[02:27] <cablesm102> carutsu, try looking under Section "Screen"
[02:27] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: Programming in other languages is probably easier, but c is no harder on ubuntu than anywhere else.
[02:27] <cablesm102> hueblur, ask your question first
[02:27] <h-edge> lasse: heh, yeah... but that doesn't stop my laptop sticking programs over there :)
[02:27] <h-edge> because it has no idea its not there.
[02:27] <mike> thanks
[02:27] <kitche> mx-: you just have to install the gcc compiler
[02:27] <mx-> why you say that Funny
[02:27] <Timeline> arrenlex: How do I convert it to WAV then?
[02:27] <sc4ttrbrain> levander: beryl is good in edgy too ;)
[02:27] <carutsu> i though it should be added under monitor
[02:27] <rapid> Agiofws, that should be simple.
[02:27] <lasse> h-edge, what kind of video card?
[02:27] <lewyjh> !update
[02:27] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[02:27] <mx-> why would other languages b easier than c? wasn't ubuntu written in c?
[02:28] <GaiaX11> arrenlex: No. I want do turn mp3 into wav for playing in a normal radio cd player.
[02:28] <mx-> and have direct access to xlib
[02:28] <arrenlex> Timeline: How do you dump a stream to wav? It depends on what you use... mencoder can do it with the -ao pcm switch. I assume VLC can do it with whatever other switch.
[02:28] <levander> sc4ttrbrain: are a lot of people having trouble installing beryl in edgy?  It seems like it.
[02:28] <arrenlex> GaiaX11: lame can do that with the --decode switch
[02:28] <h-edge> intel i915.
[02:28] <cablesm102> carutsu, I added a resolution under Section "screen"
[02:28] <Agiofws> rapid,  the 2nd screen is a tv via s-video from graphic card ok ?
[02:28] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: C is not a particularly programmer-friendly language.  It's precise, fast, and interfaces with hardware pretty easily.
[02:28] <Agiofws> and how simple ?
[02:28] <h-edge> lasse: intel i915...
[02:28] <carutsu> ok, let me see
[02:28] <sc4ttrbrain> levander: for me its as simple as adding repo and apt-get
[02:28] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: But none of that is what a beginning programmer is really interested in.
[02:28] <rapid> Agiofws, Are they both up and running?
[02:28] <lasse> h-edge, i know nothing about intel. sorry
[02:28] <carutsu> should i add that: (	ModeLine "1280x800_60.00" 83.5 1280 1344 1480 1680 800 801 804 828)
[02:28] <levander> sc4ttrbrain: and, it came right up?
[02:28] <GaiaX11> arrenlex: Lame is a command line or a program?
[02:29] <arrenlex> GaiaX11: Yes.
[02:29] <h-edge> lasse: Ok, thanks anyway :)
[02:29] <sc4ttrbrain> levander: i use it everyday,even now ;D
[02:29] <LjL> GaiaX11: a command line program.
[02:29] <arrenlex> GaiaX11: That is, a command line program.
[02:29] <mike> Now all I need to know is how to zoom out of my 3d desktop
[02:29] <Timeline> arrenlex: My friend will probably need something that can run in windows
[02:29] <levander> sc4ttrbrain: but, what improvements are they making in feisty that that's supposed to be the big release for it?
[02:29] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: I'd go for perl or python as a starting language, myself.
[02:29] <arrenlex> Timeline: lame can run on windows. In the command line.
[02:29] <LjL> GaiaX11: if you want a GUI program, then why get one that converts to WAV? just get ones that can directly burn audio CDs from MP3s
[02:29] <agent> is there a terminal calculator that is included in ubuntu by default?
[02:29] <n2diy_> mike, try ctrl+ -
[02:29] <mx-> perl is the hardest language I know
[02:29] <Timeline> Ok thanks arrenlex
[02:29] <arrenlex> agent: expr 1 + 1
[02:29] <mx-> and I know quite a few
[02:29] <mx-> :P
[02:30] <levander> agent: i think it's called gcalc
[02:30] <engla> agent: there is bc I think?
[02:30] <sc4ttrbrain> levander: sorry,dunno about feisty development, but sure it will be stabil enough when feisty come
[02:30] <hueblur> ### I have a machine that doesn't have a CD on it, its one of those ultraportable dealios.  So, I went to my roomy's machine, installed ubuntu from the livecd to the USB HD, and - plugged that HD into my laptop.  It boots.  I rsync'd the system files to hda1, updated grub and fstab with the right UUID's but its not booting.  It hangs on the splash, "waiting for root filesystem"  clearly, I have done something wrong.  I don't even CARE
[02:30] <hueblur> about using the same system installed to the USB.  Is it possible to install to HDA while booted to the USB system?  just - start fresh?
[02:30] <mike> nothing
[02:30] <arrenlex> agent:  echo "1 + 1" | bc for a better one
[02:30] <GaiaX11> arrenlex: LjL . Which ones? K3b for example?
[02:30] <agent> levander: gcalc is a gnome calculator (and its not called gcal but some other name)
[02:30] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: Eh, it has its hard spots.  Passing a file pointer to a function is a headache, but most of the things I do tend to be string processing.
[02:30] <agent> arrenlex and engla thank you for the bc suggestion
[02:30] <humblerodent> LjL: in case you're wondering, I'm making a DVD with dvdauthor, and I want it to be able to go to the menu when "Next" is pressed on the last chapter.  But that doesn't work, so I need like a one-second "Please wait" type of screen to go in between the video and the menu call.
[02:30] <LjL> GaiaX11: yeah, i know that K3b and arson do it. but i'm sure there are Gnome programs that do it as well... gnomebaker perhaps
[02:30] <engla> agent: but it's kind of hard to work with and you have to run "bc -l" to even get float division (else you get integer division)
[02:31] <levander> hueblur: you can put an iso image on the USB HD, and mount it using the "loop" device
[02:31] <phlite> hi, apt-get is timing out for me, any ideas guys?
[02:31] <levander> hueblur: actually, i'm not sure how that would work...
[02:31] <agent> arrenlex: expr may actually work ;P
[02:31] <GaiaX11> LjL: I will see. Thx.
[02:31] <levander> hueblur: you can mount it, but i'm not sure where you would mount it...
[02:31] <jvai> hey every1, is glabels the best app for making business cards?
[02:31] <agent> engla: yeah, thank you
[02:31] <phlite> i try to do: sudo apt-get install xmms, times out, also sudo apt-get upgrade times out :( mirror prob?
[02:31] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: Ah, if you've got experience, just go with what you know.  That'll be the easiest regardless.
[02:31] <arrenlex> agent: Remember to escape your multiplication so bash doesn't glob it.
[02:31] <hueblur> I'm in ubuntu - surely, there has to be a way to install it to the HD.
[02:31] <cablesm102> phlite, I'd just try again later.
[02:32] <phlite> hasn't worked in 2 days
[02:32] <hueblur> maybe some hd install script somewheres.
[02:32] <agent> arrenlex: good tip, thank you!
[02:32] <age6racer> hey all... quick one... How do I 'sudo cp' a whole directory and it's subdirectories?
=== cdavis_ is now known as cdavis
[02:32] <levander> hueblur: look in /etc/fstab and grub's menu.lst, i beet menu.lst is pointing at the wrong root partition
[02:32] <arrenlex> age6racer: cp -r <dir> <dir2>
[02:32] <phlite> age6racer: cp -R src dest
[02:32] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: Though I have been contemplating picking up python.  From what I hear, it actually resembles MOO a fair bit, and that's where I started programming.
[02:32] <mnoir> age6racer: man cp
[02:32] <hueblur> levender - I took great pain to find the right UUID.
[02:32] <age6racer> arrenlex: thanks
[02:32] <green_earz> phlite: apt-get update  then apt-get install xmms
[02:33] <phlite> green_earz: apt-get update times out
[02:33] <FunnyMan3595> mx-: And if you've never heard of the MOO programming language...  I'm not surprised in the least.
[02:33] <shwag> what should I change in /etc/sshd so that my server doesnt log me out ?
[02:33] <cdavis> when i turn on arp poisoning I can no longer send traffic from gateway to victim machine.  I enabled ip_forward, do I have to do somethign else?
[02:33] <levander> hueblur: shouldn't have been great pain, should have just been "vol_id <device name>", is that what you did?
[02:33] <arrenlex> FunnyMan3595: I used to have a cow that programmed in that.
[02:33] <hueblur> yes
[02:33] <n2diy_> Hueblur, I've encounterd permission problems using USB drives, you might want to tar your stuff before storing it on the USB drive, and then untar it on the target box.
[02:33] <arrenlex> FunnyMan3595: She wrote her own milking subsystem from scratch.
[02:33] <phlite> weird
[02:33] <phlite> now it works
[02:33] <hueblur> I used rsync to move the system files.
[02:34] <age6racer> and how do I delete? sorry I know this is basic stuff  :)
[02:34] <phlite> apt-get update worked now, guess there server was unavail for a bit , thx
[02:34] <humblerodent> LjL: this is insane....I get stupid errors from both programs

[02:35] <humblerodent> LjL: I know it.  I've tried persistently to use qdvdauthor.
[02:35] <hueblur> how can I prep hda to do a netinstall from within a USB booted system?
[02:35] <humblerodent> but I had to put up with one too many crashes, and I'm done with it.
[02:35] <hueblur> i don't even CARE about migrating the USB installed system
[02:35] <hueblur> I just want ubuntu on my harddrive.
[02:36] <humblerodent> oh....
[02:36] <humblerodent> I get it now....the manual page said "duration" not "duration in seconds" and the examples provided said "10s" and "1s"
[02:36] <humblerodent> so I used 1s
[02:36] <humblerodent> but it turns out 1 actually makes it work

[02:42] <jrib> !ubuntu-desktop | trurl
[02:42] <ubotu> trurl: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[02:42] <phlite> for when you close the lid?

[02:47] <calm> arrenlex: the only thing is: the "page orientation" option for printing from evince seems a bit broken. if i try page orientation: "landscape" and layout: "4 pages to 1", my printer (an HP deskjet 6540) just starts loading a page, and then freezes
[02:47] <trurl> darn ;)

[02:47] <jvai> smh
[02:48] <dope_> does anyone use connection-manager and have WPA working?  I'm having some issues.  Might won't connect at all.  my wireless card is called rausb0 instead of wlan0 is that a prob?

[02:50] <humblerodent> anyway, that one worked, so thank you very much, I appreciate it =)
[02:50] <Catshrimp> I can't get glxinfo | grep -i opengl to show that I have the correct driver installed
[02:50] <sorroww> is there a frontend for wine?
[02:50] <sorroww> or a gui
[02:50] <arrenlex> sorroww: A gui for doing what?
[02:50] <Catshrimp> I've run both "sudo aptitude install xorg-driver-fglrx" and "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[02:50] <LjL> humblerodent: wasn't needed in that case anyway, since mpeg2enc was already install by mjpegtools which was installed by all those slideshow programs you tried and probably dvdauthor ;)
[02:51] <kitche> sorroww: no since wine is only used to start the .exe program
[02:51] <Catshrimp> But glxinfo still shows that the mesa driver is being used
[02:51] <trurl> Okay, all i get is 'Totem could not play 'fd://0'' when i try to view a .mov via plugin, whats wrong?
[02:51] <bruenig> sorroww, there is no need for one, just wine "/path/to/executable" and go. Wine is merely an compatability layer. It doesn't really actively do anything worthy of a frontend
[02:51] <arrenlex> Catshrimp: What card?
[02:51] <humblerodent> I'm sure I already had mjpegtools anyway.  I do a lot of media stuff.
[02:51] <Catshrimp> x1400 radeon mobility
[02:51] <sorroww> alright
[02:51] <humblerodent> which adds even more insult to the fact that I didn't know how to do this.

[02:51] <LjL> sorroww, what is it that you need to do?
[02:51] <sorroww> something that runs the occisaional exe
[02:52] <sorroww> a gui would jsut have bene cool
[02:52] <humblerodent> ah....I should have known there is jpeg2yuv, lol xD
[02:52] <LjL> sorroww, here i can just click on the exe i think... but then i'm on KDE

[02:52] <shwag> so phpmyadmin setup generate  /var/lib/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php  do I move this to /etc/phpmyadmin/ ?
[02:52] <LjL> sorroww: perhaps installing the "binfmt-support" package (and making sure your exe files are +x...) would help. not really sure though
[02:53] <jvai> gn ppl... ty
[02:53] <arrenlex> LjL: No. That's not what it's for. You have to define an association.
[02:53] <LjL> arrenlex: doesn't it come with some defaults?
[02:53] <arrenlex> LjL: The reason they open for you is because you have konqueror set to open exe in wine, same as you have it set to open htm in firefox or whatever.
[02:53] <arrenlex> LjL: It might on KDE; it's very good about things like that. In Gnome? No idea.
[02:53] <LjL> arrenlex: ok, wouldn't something very much like that be doable on Gnome still?
[02:54] <arrenlex> LjL: Definitely. Nautilus options.

[02:54] <sorroww> lol im so used to command lines though

[02:58] <LjL> Ubotu, tell masse|applying about grub | masse|applying, see the private message from Ubotu
[02:58] <humblerodent> Microshaft installs a bootloader which bypasses any other OSes and goes straight to windows.
[02:58] <Catshrimp> arrenlex: I'll let ya know soon as I get it pastebinned
[02:58] <ubotu> masse|applying: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:58] <sorroww> how do i format a partition with fdisk
[02:58] <pablasso> man fdisk
[02:58] <pablasso> o wait
[02:58] <LjL> sorroww: fdisk edits the partition table, it doesn't format
[02:58] <trurl> Anyone? No idea? help! ;)
[02:58] <pablasso> no formatting with fdisk
[02:58] <LjL> sorroww: you need mkfs to format
[02:58] <sorroww> oh ok
[02:58] <masse|applying> so i need to put grub on a flopppy then
[02:58] <Gigaamd> use qt paritition!!
[02:58] <arrenlex> masse|applying: You want the first link =P
[02:58] <masse|applying> or reinstall ubuntu..not like i did much to change it anyway
[02:59] <masse|applying> you guys rock
[02:59] <humblerodent> LjL: would you have any idea why my mpg would look fine, but then the resulting DVD data would look all scrambled up on the screen?
[02:59] <LjL> masse|applying, i'm not sure about the specifics, but i think you can do it with just the Ubuntu CD and no need for a floppy. i guess that page has more information though
[02:59] <Gigaamd> anyone live in the tampabay area that could train a newbie??
[03:00] <arrenlex> humblerodent: Do you have ntsc\pal settings correct?
[03:00] <LjL> humblerodent: scrambled like what? perhaps you have the wrong interlacing set in that command? (i used progressive, i.e. no interlacing)
[03:00] <humblerodent> yeah, I would think you'd be able to boot the CD up and re-install GRUB.
[03:00] <jlgutier01> hello
[03:00] <arrenlex> !hi
[03:00] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:00] <jlgutier01> tks
[03:00] <humblerodent> arrenlex: yeah, it's NTSC; I used mplex -f 8 to make the final mpeg that I used
[03:00] <zappa420> hi ya.  got a wierd problem.  I'm trying  to do phone support for a friend I converted to Ubuntu Edgy.  Everythings been fine so far.  Her networking is down and ifconfig isn't showing an IP.  So I'm trying to haver her sudo ifdown/ifup eth1 or ./etc/init.d/networking restart but the commands arent being found when she uses sudo.  the commands are there if she doesnt use sudo but then ofcourse they don;t work.  any ideas?
[03:00] <sorroww> how do i get mkfs?
[03:00] <jlgutier01> sorry_
[03:01] <LjL> sorroww: it's a standard command. you have it. type "man mkfs"
[03:01] <sorroww> oh
[03:01] <humblerodent> LjL: it's scrambled almost like it used rows for columns and vice versa, ya know?  lol.  Like the pixels are all goofy looking.
[03:01] <phlite> fuck, ubuntu doesn't come with smbfs support? whats easiest way to get around not rebuilding the kernel with support?  how do they plan on mounting samba shares?
[03:01] <humblerodent> LjL: and I wouldn't really know how to change the interlacing....
[03:01] <LjL> humblerodent: hmm, i dunno

[03:01] <Gigaamd> !helpme
[03:01] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:01] <LjL> phlite: cifs perhaps, since smbfs is obsoleted since an age
[03:02] <pablasso> green_earz: thanks ill give it a try
[03:02] <carutsu> I'm back guys, jeje, well I've downladed the right driver for my card from intel's page, can anyone tell me how to install it?
[03:02] <green_earz> np
[03:02] <phlite> LjL: hmm trying to mount a samba share tho
[03:02] <carutsu> it says is Linux's driver even is on a zipped tar
[03:02] <ryanakca> what package provides X includes? I'm searching threw the output of apt-cache search x includes... can't find anything usefull... :(
[03:03] <arrenlex> ryanakca: xlibs-dev
[03:03] <ryanakca> arrenlex: ah, thanks :D
[03:03] <trurl> I'm getting "Totem could not play 'fd://0'" as an error when i try to watch a .mov within firefox. What can i do?
[03:03] <LjL> phlite: "mount -t cifs". if that fails, install the "smbfs" package
[03:03] <mame_runner> Hey guys (or gals) does anyone here remember in the Barnes and nobles bookstores there used to be two columns one on either side as you walked into the music section? Well since your the best comp geeks I know of can anyone tell me what the electronics are for?
[03:03] <ZenMasterJG> hey all, i'm having a bit of a problem w/ swap. Swapon has recently decided to start failing with the error "swapon: /dev/disk/by-uuid/<16 bytes of gibberish>: invalid argument."
[03:03] <ryanakca> arrenlex: heh, no wonder I didn't find it... apt-cache didn't output it
[03:03] <Gigaamd> I need to know how to install firefox using mozilla not the apt or terminal.  I did search and cannot get an honest way of doing it.  I am using kubuntu 6.10.  I like kubuntu.
[03:03] <Catshrimp> arrenlex: http://pastebin.ca/277289 && http://pastebin.ca/277295
[03:04] <ZenMasterJG> which i don't get, becuase the UUID matches that in /etc/fstab, which matches the pointer in /dev/disk/by-uuid to the swap partition
[03:04] <carutsu> I need to know how to install a driver, anyone?
[03:04] <Catshrimp> arrenlex: also, you can safely ignore the errors regarding the tablet pc stuff.  I just haven't removed that information from the config file yet since I've been worrying about getting the opengl thing fixed.
[03:04] <humblerodent> LjL: I lied.  it doesn't look like the pixels are scrambled around....some turned magenta
[03:04] <arrenlex> Catshrimp: I know, don't worry.
[03:05] <humblerodent> and the writing is green, which is the inverse of magenta....don't know if that's relevant
[03:05] <sc4ttrbrain> Gigaamd: u just download firefox from site ,untar it, ./firefox
[03:05] <Gigaamd> how do i untar it sc4tterbrain?
[03:06] <Gigaamd> where do i put the folder???
[03:06] <Gigaamd> after i untar it??
[03:06] <engla> Gigaamd: right-click on it
[03:06] <Gigaamd> ok then what after i untar it?
[03:07] <zappa420> anyone know why I can't get commands to work when using sudo.  ex: sudo ifdown  = command not found  but just ifdown is recognized
[03:07] <Quagmire> Giggity
[03:07] <kamui> wait
[03:07] <LjL> humblerodent: make a new image with magenta pixels
[03:07] <engla> Gigaamd: you could put it anywhere if it's just the static firefox build
[03:07] <humblerodent> LjL: lol....I'll have to figure out exactly which ones got inverted lol
[03:07] <Gigaamd> anywhere huh?? ok
[03:08] <engla> zappa420: aliases and user PATH changes are not picked up by the root user
[03:08] <carutsu> I need to know how to install a driver, anyone?
[03:08] <LjL> zappa420: shouldn't happen... you mean "ifdown" is recognized while you're a normal user (not root)?
[03:08] <Gigaamd> engla:  then how do i install firefox after it is untar?
[03:08] <Catshrimp> zappa420: you should just run "sudo ifdown ethx" sub ethx for whatever
[03:08] <LjL> engla: but ifdown is a standard command that should definitely be in root's path
[03:08] <Catshrimp> zappa420: no = sign
[03:08] <humblerodent> LjL: and it does actually look a bit scrambled, almost like an Alpha version of a "motion blur" plugin.
[03:08] <arrenlex> Catshrimp: Where did you get these fglrx drivers?
[03:08] <engla> LjL: Yeah, I didn't know it was a standard command. But still, a PATH that is wrong could be a lead
[03:09] <javaJake> My battery says 0%, but I know it isn't. What's up?
[03:09] <Catshrimp> arrenlex: from the repository (universal I think)
[03:09] <LjL> engla: i guess so
[03:09] <mike> javajake, I have the same issue.
[03:09] <sc4ttrbrain> Gigaamd: oops sry,been out,ff dont need to be installed if u just want to use it as static build
[03:09] <cablesm102> carutsu, what sort of driver?
[03:09] <engla> Gigaamd: I don't know what you have. If it's the source package, it's complicated and you use the terminal. If it is a static build you can put it anywhere you like
[03:09] <javaJake> mike: no kidding
[03:09] <Quagmire> Giggity
[03:09] <carutsu> a video driver
[03:09] <zappa420> LjL:  yeah its recognized as a normal user but not when using sudo
[03:09] <mike> I think ubuntu has trouble recognizing a battery's power level
[03:09] <Catshrimp> arrenlex: yep, universe repository
[03:09] <mike> I don't think there's a cure
[03:09] <Gigaamd> what is a static build??
[03:09] <cablesm102> carutsu, which one?
[03:09] <javaJake> mike: heh, too bad. Maybe there's a good app that does...?
[03:10] <LjL> zappa420: try "sudo -i", then "ifdown", then "exit", is it recognized there?
[03:10] <Gigaamd> No i download the file for linux.
[03:10] <sc4ttrbrain> Gigaamd: when u download from mozilla site,likely u ll get static build
[03:10] <carutsu> er Intel mobile 915gm
[03:10] <mike> Lemme see
[03:10] <arrenlex> Catshrimp: I don't know. Everything looks fine to me. The error message is in your xorg log, starting at 693, but I don't understand what exactly is broken. = / Maybe google it? Sorry.
[03:10] <humblerodent> Gigaamd: you have to have pretty specific requirements to run a static build, but at the same time it's all compiled and ready to run.
[03:10] <carutsu> i downloaded from intel
[03:10] <Catshrimp> arrenlex: no problem, thanks for guiding me at least :D
[03:10] <Gigaamd> oh ok.  thank guys.  <TRYING TO BREAK THE MS ADDICTION>
[03:10] <javaJake> Gosh, this is REALLY aggrivating
[03:11] <humblerodent> at least, I'm pretty sure that's close enough to what it is, lol.
[03:11] <LjL> humblerodent: hmm, "man mpeg2enc", it lists options to encode to DVD-specific mpeg flavors, perhaps that might do the trick
[03:11] <cablesm102> carutsu, I don't know how to install it, but it might be a better idea to look in the repositories first before downloading straight from the source.
[03:11] <humblerodent> I just use debs for most things.
[03:11] <humblerodent> LjL: hm....okay.
[03:11] <carutsu> let me see
[03:11] <zappa420> LjL:  lemmie call my friend and see if it does.  thx  I'll let you know   this is such a wierd error
[03:11] <sith_man> I'm having problems with GRUB...error 21. I have Windows XP on my primary drive, storage space and Ubuntu on my secondary drive. i just installed ubuntu....and now i cant get onto windows. im on the live cd right now. v6.06 dapper drake.
[03:11] <Quagmire> Giggity
[03:11] <mike> Damn, I found nothing.
[03:11] <sc4ttrbrain> carutsu: isnt there a readme or sumthin ?
[03:11] <cablesm102> carutsu, you probably have to activate the Multiverse repository
[03:11] <arrenlex> sith_man: Grub does not start at all?
[03:11] <carutsu> let me see, ok, wait a little
[03:11] <sith_man> it says loading. then error 21
[03:12] <sith_man> loads bios, then starts loading grub, then it says error 21
[03:12] <mx-> do people make money off ubuntu?
[03:12] <arrenlex> sith_man: You're in liveCD? Can I give you instructions such as "mount your ubuntu partition to some folder and chroot into it" or do you need to be more specific?
[03:12] <mike> Not much.
[03:12] <cablesm102> carutsu, i found something else. I remember you had a resolution problem, there's a package here called 915resolution for modifying the resolution on intel 915 devices
[03:12] <syntaxx> what is the shortcut keys to go to the next virtual desktop in KDE?
[03:12] <carutsu> great idea, i found something promising
[03:13] <carutsu> yea!
[03:13] <mike> mx-, probably by just selling cds
[03:13] <carutsu> taht's what i found
[03:13] <carutsu> letme see
[03:13] <sith_man> arrenlex: how would i mount the ubuntu partition
[03:13] <Quagmire> Giggity
[03:13] <bruenig> syntaxx, I would imaging #kubuntu could give a quick answer
[03:13] <bruenig> s/imaging/imagine
[03:13] <carutsu> anf its only 133kb, what else could i have asked for!?
[03:13] <sith_man> arrenlex: im on liveCD now. thats the only way i can do anything.
[03:13] <syntaxx> bruenig: no ones answering
[03:13] <arrenlex> sith_man: Do you know what the device name of that partition is?
[03:14] <MasterLexx> does ubuntu support more hardware than suse or others?
[03:14] <lupine_85> ctrl+alt+left/right ?
[03:14] <cablesm102> carutsu, read the description, because it has some important informaiton
[03:14] <rapid> MasterLexx, probably out of the box.
[03:14] <LjL> zappa420: if it doesn't work, do "sudo -i" again, and "echo $PATH". i guess there'll be something missing from there. in that case, "grep SUPATH /etc/login.defs"... check if the ifdown path (/sbin) is listed
[03:14] <carutsu> ok
[03:14] <sith_man> arrenlex: hdb2
[03:14] <mx-> mike i don't understand how so many people spend so much time on something and don't make a dime
[03:15] <mx-> don't they have jobs?
[03:15] <zv> rapid: yeah it supports a whole lot out of the box
[03:15] <MasterLexx> rapid, why are different packages provided for xubuntu than for kubuntu?
[03:15] <mx-> and why don't they charge at all
[03:15] <mx-> minus for cd's
[03:15] <carutsu> would you mind opening a new window
[03:15] <mike> You know.
[03:15] <arrenlex> sith_man: "sudo mkdir /target && sudo mount /dev/hdb2 /target && sudo chroot /target"
[03:15] <carutsu> its too fast
[03:15] <MasterLexx> i meant for online download of programms
[03:15] <mike> I think that's the spirit of linux and open source.
[03:15] <arrenlex> sith_man: that's all one big command between the quotes.
[03:15] <mike> It's like a charity really.
[03:15] <sith_man> arrenlex:  ok
[03:15] <sc4ttrbrain> mx-: u can make web hosting server ,then here comes money
[03:15] <Pelo> mx-,  they do it as a hobby or because they need something for themselves and then they share it
[03:16] <rapid> MasterLexx, kubuntu uses kde, xubuntu uses a different manager, different packages obviously
[03:16] <mx-> so wait wait
[03:16] <mx-> guys hold on
[03:16] <Jeffm515> failed to start X server ...
[03:16] <mx-> people actually use linux as their primary OS?
[03:16] <sith_man> arrenlex: it now says root@ubuntu:/# rectangle thing
[03:16] <arrenlex> mx-: I do.
[03:16] <mx-> :0
[03:16] <Pelo> mx-,  sure
[03:16] <sc4ttrbrain> mx-: yup, i do
[03:16] <Jeffm515> yup
[03:16] <MasterLexx> okay, i am a newbie, but shouldnt software for xfce also run on kde?
[03:16] <rapid> yes.
[03:16] <engla> mx-: you are kidding? it was invented for that purpose
[03:16] <Gigaamd> can anyone tell me the difference between gnome and kde???  Just give it to me leyman terms.
[03:16] <sith_man> arrenlex: nvm, thats the blinking cursor. lol
[03:16] <arrenlex> mx-: Haven't seen Windows for more than ten minutes at a time for two years now.
[03:17] <mx-> That's just hard to believe
[03:17] <engla> mx-: and it's been used by companies, isps, servers, banks etc since 90's
[03:17] <Pelo> mx-,  Im one app away from ditching xp alltgether,  I only boot it occasionnaly now
[03:17] <MasterLexx> so why can i get amule on xubuntu for download, but not on kubuntu?
[03:17] <mx-> how do you game?
[03:17] <rapid> Gigaamd, 2 differnt guis. both are cool
[03:17] <arrenlex> mx-: I don't. =P
[03:17] <mx-> :(
[03:17] <mx-> i'm sorry arrenlex
[03:17] <mx-> I really am
[03:17] <sc4ttrbrain> mx-: im not gamer
[03:17] <Pelo> mx-,  not every computer use it a gamer
[03:17] <Psykovsky> is there any way to delete some characters from a string in shell script?
[03:17] <Jeffm515> failed to start X server ... help...:)
[03:17] <arrenlex> mx-: I didn't have 3d acceleration on Linux for two years and I only noticed it because I couldn't run the screensaver I wanted.
[03:17] <Gigaamd> rapid.  Which is better and easier to use???  kde??
[03:17] <Pelo> not every computer user is a gamer
[03:17] <rapid> Jeffm515, lol
[03:17] <mx-> second most things done on pc's is gaming according to stats
[03:17] <mx-> browsing being #1
[03:17] <jrib> Psykovsky: yes
[03:17] <arrenlex> sith_man: Good. Please pastebin the output of "fdisk -l"
[03:17] <Jeffm515> no.. I'm serious...
[03:18] <rapid> Jeffm515, so am I.
[03:18] <Jeffm515> lol
[03:18] <Phuzion> mx-:  Who provided these statistics?
[03:18] <Jeffm515> nice...
[03:18] <sith_man> arrenlex: and that means?
[03:18] <mx-> microsoft
[03:18] <Psykovsky> jrib: Any hint please?
[03:18] <mx-> thats why vista is a gamers os
[03:18] <jrib> Psykovsky: try sed, but there are more ways
[03:18] <engla> mx-: move to #ubuntu-offtopic for chat-like topics
[03:18] <Pelo> mx-,  if you want games for linux  you might like this  http://techgage.com/article/top_10_free_linux_games
[03:18] <Jeffm515> 82845G/GL
[03:18] <rapid> Gigaamd, I like KDE.. you can try both I think at www.nomachine.com
[03:18] <arrenlex> sith_man: That means run the command "fdisk -l" and then copy and paste this output to the pastebin website, and paste the link it gives you to this channel.
[03:18] <arrenlex> !pastebin | sith_man
[03:18] <ubotu> sith_man: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:18] <Jeffm515> I dunno how to set it up...
[03:18] <mx-> do you run older hardware?
[03:18] <Psykovsky> jrib thanks, I'll try that...
[03:18] <Gigaamd> thanks rapid
[03:18] <MasterLexx> mx, i heard of cedega, this let's you play some win games in linux
[03:18] <sc4ttrbrain> mx-: google nexuiz ;D
[03:19] <arrenlex> mx-: Me? No, my computer's pretty good.
[03:19] <mx-> heh
[03:19] <mx-> no hardware trouble?
[03:19] <Jeffm515> any ideas on which server to run in X Server?
[03:19] <javaJake> Anyone know of a fix that gets the battery meter working?
[03:19] <mx-> if gaming is supported on linux like windows might switch over
[03:19] <mx-> linux is a nice community
[03:19] <LjL> !offtopic | mx-
[03:19] <ubotu> mx-: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:20] <Jeffm515> we play wel with others..
[03:20] <dope_> does anyone use connection-manager and have WPA working?  I'm having some issues.  Might won't connect at all.  my wireless card is called rausb0 instead of wlan0 is that a prob?
[03:20] <Jeffm515> well*
[03:20] <mx-> my questions were related
[03:20] <MasterLexx> mx, eg. the transgaming database shows nwn and nfs mw as playable under linux with cedega
[03:20] <mx-> to hardware
[03:20] <sith_man> arrenlex: what is the fdisk -|   ? and what output should i see?
[03:20] <arrenlex> sithman: it's an l. an ell.
[03:20] <sith_man> ok
[03:21] <sith_man> arrenlex: cannot open /proc/partitions
[03:21] <mx-> Ok well "the mans" trying to supress our completely related discussion, so i'll leave it at that
[03:21] <cratel> how hard would it be to set up two independent screens driven by two different video cards?
[03:21] <mx-> thanks for the answers
[03:21] <arrenlex> sith_man: Ah. "mount /proc" first then.
[03:22] <linuxgoober> im considering running linux for about a week without a GUI to teach me the Linux commands better, can someone tell me how practical this is
[03:22] <LjL> linuxgoober: depends on what you need to do with your computer
[03:22] <arrenlex> linuxgoober: Not practical. Better just look through a bash tutorial for things you need.
[03:22] <rapid> linuxgoober, 1 week only?
[03:22] <cratel> yeah like maybe no video editing, for example...
[03:22] <linuxgoober> basically programmign, email, basic web browsing, etc
[03:22] <bruenig> linuxboy, ctrl + alt + f1, will take you to a console if you just want to deal with that
[03:22] <Gigaamd> ok i downloaded firefox and untar it.  Now how to bring up the browser or what do i do???  please help
[03:22] <linuxgoober> but I'll always be pushing ctrl alt f7
[03:22] <rapid> Gigaamd, run a make install
[03:22] <LjL> linuxgoober: should work. for web browsing there's links2, and mail clients abound i think
[03:22] <arrenlex> Gigaamd: Why not use firefox from the repositories?
[03:23] <sith_man> arrenlex: after i mounted /proc and used the fdisk -l command, nothing happens
[03:23] <pablasso> theres any way to send a message while invisible on a msn account?
[03:23] <pablasso> err on gaim
[03:23] <linuxgoober> so do you think it would be a good idea?
[03:23] <mx-> I like gaim, am using it right now
[03:23] <mx-> ;)
[03:23] <rapid> linuxgoober, you can use a console and X at the same time
[03:23] <sc4ttrbrain> Gigaamd: tar xvzf package.name then cd firefox then ./firefox
[03:23] <bruenig> Gigaamd, after you have untarred, it all you need to do is run the firefox script inside of the directory
[03:23] <LjL> linuxgoober: that's not what i said... i don't know, i'm not sure, i'm on a graphical interface but i find myself using the CLI half of the time
[03:23] <green_earz> linuxgoober: i would say use a terminal for your desktop for your learning of the command line
[03:23] <arrenlex> sith_man: What about "sudo fdisk -l"? A wild guess.
[03:23] <Gigaamd> where is the script??
[03:24] <linuxgoober> i want to only use a terminal so i won't be tempted to switch back
[03:24] <rapid> Gigaamd, cd into your firefox directory.. it should be in there
[03:24] <bruenig> Gigaamd, in the untarred directory, the directory called firefox I believe
[03:24] <green_earz> linuxgoober: from a desktop
[03:24] <cratel> linuxgoober: just use your computer and if it leds you to the command line, great. But I don't get the point of learning the command line just to learn it and I say just open a terminal window when you need...
[03:24] <linuxgoober> yeah
[03:24] <sith_man> arrenlex: unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname()
[03:24] <LjL> linuxgoober, perhaps i could suggest this instead: when you don't immediately know of a way to do something from your GUI, instead of looking up how it's done in the GUI, open a shell and look up how it's done in a shell.
[03:24] <linuxgoober> ok
[03:24] <Gigaamd> how do i make install?
[03:25] <sc4ttrbrain> Gigaamd: should be a README !
[03:25] <cratel> linuxgoober: I agree with LjL
[03:25] <rapid> lol
[03:25] <Gigaamd> ok
[03:25] <LjL> Ubotu, tell Gigaamd about firefox | Gigaamd, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:25] <arrenlex> sith_man: That's very odd. Could you please pastebin the commands you've run so far?
[03:25] <sith_man> yes
[03:25] <linuxgoober> ok, sounds good... i know how to do basic things, but would like to learn to do things better because its usually mor eefficient
[03:25] <bruenig> Gigaamd, there is no install, you simple run the firefox script in the directory.
[03:26] <bruenig> Gigaamd, although I would be interested to know why you aren't using the firefox in the repository
[03:26] <sc4ttrbrain> Gigaamd: ./firefox inside the directory
[03:26] <linuxgoober> or create a link to kmenu with kmenuedit
[03:27] <sith_man> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36747/    <is that what ur lookin for?
[03:27] <LjL> linuxgoober: you could also try and use common CLI programs that many people use even though they're in a GUI... like, dunno, irssi for an IRC client. or vi/emacs for text editing. or mutt (or whatever the free equivalent is) for mail. but honestly, i don't do that (well, aside from using nano as a text editor most of the time)
[03:27] <humblerodent> hm....I added an extra "-f 8" to the mpeg2enc process as well as the mplex process
[03:27] <humblerodent> and I think that did it =D
[03:27] <humblerodent> I'm going to burn it to a real DVD and try it out
[03:27] <linuxgoober> ok thx LjL
[03:27] <arrenlex> sith_man: Yes. That's very odd...
[03:28] <arrenlex> sith_man: What happens if you run "cat /proc/partitions"?
[03:28] <Gigaamd> bruenig, i just want to do something different without using repository.  I want to learn different dynamics of linux.  I am trying to break the MS addiction.
[03:28] <cratel> 2 monitors and 2 video cards: a big deal or pretty easy to set up?
[03:28] <cryptid> How do i install compiz themes??? on my ubuntu dapper???
=== jbaskew is now known as Doodluv
[03:28] <bruenig> Gigaamd, well precompiled firefox is not really much. Now compiling a program from source....
[03:28] <LjL> Ubotu, tell cryptid about compiz | cryptid, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:29] <sith_man> arrenlex: root@ubuntu:/# cat/proc/partitions
[03:29] <sith_man> bash: cat/proc/partitions: No such file or directory
[03:29] <Gigaamd> how do i do that bruenig???
[03:29] <arrenlex> Gigaamd: Untarring a tarball and running a script isn't really very hard, or common. Compile something from source.
[03:29] <sith_man> whoops
[03:29] <bruenig> !compile
[03:29] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[03:29] <arrenlex> sith_man: space between cat and /proc
[03:29] <cratel> if you love to compile from the source, just use Gentoo
[03:29] <sith_man> arrenlex: pastebin the output?
[03:29] <Gigaamd> thanks bruenig.  how do i do that using gui?
[03:29] <arrenlex> sith_man: Yes.
[03:30] <bruenig> Gigaamd, you don't
[03:30] <Gigaamd> just
[03:30] <Gigaamd> just !compile?
[03:30] <sith_man> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36748/
[03:30] <bruenig> Gigaamd, no sorry, I was trying to trigger that factoid
[03:30] <nativity^> hi
[03:30] <cablesm102> no, !compile was a command to ubotu (a bot) to tell you what to do.
[03:30] <bruenig> !compile | Gigaamd
[03:30] <ubotu> Gigaamd: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[03:30] <Gigaamd> oh ok
[03:30] <arrenlex> sith_man: What's on your primary hard drive? Windows?
[03:31] <cablesm102> Gigaamd, the repositories are the best way to go. And you pretty much can't compile without using the command line.
[03:31] <sith_man> arrenlex: yes, windows XP sp2
[03:31] <nativity^> is it possible to stop firefox from automatically loading and running videos when I visit certain webpages?
[03:31] <arrenlex> sith_man: Okay. Run "update-grub"
[03:31] <Gigaamd> ok cables.  Well how do i update my software when i use the repositories???
[03:31] <arrenlex> sith_man: You don't have to pastebin the output unless there's an error. Just tell me when it's done.
[03:31] <Gigaamd> just firefox or openoffice???
[03:31] <cablesm102> it updates automatically
[03:31] <arrenlex> Gigaamd: apt-get update
[03:31] <bruenig> nativity^, you can use one of those extensions that allows you to remove objects from pages, assuming you visit those pages often
[03:31] <arrenlex> Gigaamd: And then apt-get upgrade
[03:31] <cablesm102> Gigaamd, the repos will distribute all updates.
[03:32] <nativity^> bruenig: what?
[03:32] <sith_man> arrenlex: how to update grub? in the terminal? and in what dir?
[03:32] <bruenig> nativity^, something like Nuke Anything Enhanced
[03:32] <arrenlex> sith_man: Run that command in the terminal, anywhere.
[03:32] <nativity^> bruenig: its ok! I found soltuon! turn off javascript for the site
[03:32] <cablesm102> Gigaamd, if it doesn't have an update you want, at least look for a .deb file with the version you want.
[03:32] <bruenig> nativity^, install that extension
[03:32] <sith_man> arrenlex: its done
[03:32] <Gigaamd> oh ok.  thanks cables.  how will i know if there is an update??  how do i find a .deb file???
[03:33] <der0b> umm, ok. I need a way to may import a self signed certificate.  I run an ftp server that requires SSL and I either get annoying errors about the cert or some programs (seveas GFTP for instanace) bail completely.  any ideas how I can do this?
[03:33] <cablesm102> Gigaamd, when a package is updated, the OS will prompt you.
[03:33] <arrenlex> sith_man: Okay, now run "grub-install /dev/hda"
[03:33] <cablesm102> Gigaamd, you will see a bubble in the top right of your screen prompting you to install the update. Sorta like Windows Update, but works for every program on your computer
[03:33] <sith_man> arrenlex: /dev/hda: Not found or not a block
[03:33] <arrenlex> sith_man: Actually, run "cat /boot/grub/menu.lst" and pastebin it, please.
[03:34] <cryptid> LjL: I Have understood how to install and succeded in it but i found compix themes on gnome-look and dont know how o install them  please help me out
[03:34] <Gigaamd> oh ok.
[03:34] <cablesm102> Gigaamd, most sites distributing linux programs will offer a .deb version, which is pre-compiled for Debian or Ubuntu
[03:34] <cablesm102> But the repos are the most reliable way
[03:34] <LjL> cryptid: i haven't the slightest idea, ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:34] <Gigaamd> ok thanks cables
[03:35] <bruenig> Gigaamd, 99 times out of 100 the program will be in the repos or the site you are getting it from will have a deb which is just a double click installation. But knowing how to compile is nice
[03:35] <sith_man> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36749/
[03:35] <Gigaamd> yes i want to learn how to compile
[03:35] <aleka> -I have finally decided to try AIGLX and beryl and been reading a lot of Howtos and Wikis.. I have an Intel graqphics card and the out put I get from "lspci | grep VGA" is Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G] /GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01) Most forums refer to intel drivers as i810 or i915, What kind do I have>
[03:35] <cablesm102> !compile | Gigaamd
[03:35] <ubotu> Gigaamd: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[03:36] <Jeffm515> anyone an xorg genius?
[03:36] <kitche> aleka: check your xorg.conf in /etc/X11
[03:36] <cablesm102> Jeffm515, depends. What's your problem?
[03:36] <Jeffm515> I need the cmd to re-run xorg conf
[03:36] <rapid> Jeffm515, don't need a genius for that, xorgconfig
[03:36] <Jeffm515> lol
[03:36] <arrenlex> Jeffm515: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:36] <Jeffm515> smarter then me. :-P
[03:36] <Jeffm515> thank
[03:36] <ActivE> Is there a media play that will stream over a samba network?
[03:37] <cablesm102> ActivE, there's no such thing as a "samba network"
[03:37] <cablesm102> samba is a protocol. As long as two computers can communicate via IP, you can stream something over it
[03:37] <LjL> ActivE: VLC can stream over a network
[03:37] <Jeffm515> any ideas for which driver to use for an intel 82845G/GL
[03:37] <arrenlex> sith_man: Something's not quite right about your system and I don't like it. Can you open a new bash session (don't close the old one) and run "sudo fdisk -l" there?
[03:37] <ActivE> i know this
[03:37] <ActivE> but it was a lazy way of writing the question
[03:37] <cablesm102> Samba only matters for filesharing, printing
[03:37] <green_earz> aleka: try "lspci -v | grep VGA"  will give you some more info
[03:37] <kitche> Jeffm515: probably i810
[03:37] <aleka> kitche: what section should I look under?
[03:37] <LjL> ActivE: well, what you meant was an IP network
[03:37] <der0b> aleka: you could also perform an "lsmod" and look for i810 or i915
[03:38] <LjL> ActivE: at least i suppose. anyway, look at VLC
[03:38] <sith_man> arrenlex: yes, it shows output. pastebin?
[03:38] <Jeffm515> kitche: use framebuffer?
[03:38] <arrenlex> sith_man: Please.
[03:38] <kitche> aleka: the device section
[03:38] <cratel> I can't get the external monitor working on my MacBookPro running dapper. Aticonfig --initial=dual-head isn't working.
[03:38] <ActivE> I mean stream a video from a windows network
[03:38] <aleka> der0b: lsmod|grep 915
[03:38] <aleka> tsdev                   9152  0
[03:38] <aleka> i915                   21632  2
[03:38] <aleka> drm                    74644  3 i915
[03:38] <cablesm102> ActivE, it's not a windows network
[03:38] <cablesm102> it's an IP network
[03:38] <sith_man> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36750/
[03:38] <cablesm102> samba is just a file-sharing protocol
[03:39] <nativity^> bruenig: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/722/
[03:39] <sc4ttrbrain> !pastebin | aleka
[03:39] <ubotu> aleka: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:39] <ActivE> Ok from a computer running a windows Xp operating system.
[03:39] <der0b> aleka: so you should be able to run it, can't vouch for the performance, but you should be OK
[03:39] <cablesm102> ActivE, VLC.
[03:39] <cablesm102> like everyone else has said.
[03:39] <ActivE> Ive tried that.
[03:39] <Rupie> y do u need 2 compile somethings in ubuntu? ive never had to compile stuff on windows but people are talking about compliling. y is it necessary sometimes?
[03:39] <Phuzion> how do I look at memory usage in terminal?
[03:39] <ActivE> It doesnt seem to recognise a path like smb://server/file
[03:39] <cablesm102> Rupie, I have no idea why he wanted to compile stuff
[03:39] <rapid> Phuzion, top
[03:39] <Phuzion> rapid, thanks
[03:39] <bruenig> nativity^, yeah that is one of the most popular extensions. I have no real need to use it. And since my webpage viewings vary so widely it is not like I can just configure for all the websites I visit.
[03:40] <kitche> Rupie: in ubuntu you don't have to compile anything
[03:40] <cablesm102> ActivE, do you want streaming or are you just opening a samba file?
[03:40] <rapid> Rupie: every program I have installed has been compiled almost :)
[03:40] <green_earz> Phuzion: free -m
[03:40] <ActivE> steaming of an avi file for example
[03:40] <cablesm102> ActivE, do you mean opening a shared file?
[03:40] <rapid> Rupie, though you shouldn't have to do this, unless you can't find the binaries for what you want.
[03:40] <aleka> xorg.conf has the same info listed as the lspci output
[03:40] <arrenlex> sith_man: Your liveCD detects your partitions fine... why doesn't your system? = /
[03:40] <nativity^> bruenig: you can still visit the websites
[03:40] <sith_man> arrenlex: beats me
[03:40] <nativity^> bruenig: what are scripts exactly that can run of websites that this addon helps stop?
[03:40] <bruenig> nativity^, right but stuff is disabled
[03:40] <aleka> der0b: so I should assume I have the i920?
[03:40] <loki505> im tryin to get my wifi mx workin for my psp and i cant seem to get it working
[03:41] <loki505> im using edgy
[03:41] <rapid> loki505, lol
[03:41] <ActivE> When im in windows i can browse the windows shares of other pcs on my network and play a movie as if it was on my computer. On linux i am forced to copy the file to my pc to play it.
[03:41] <loki505> and im a noob
[03:41] <loki505> big noob
[03:41] <sith_man> arrenlex: is there a way for me to be able to get back to windows? at all?
[03:41] <rapid> loki505, psp = play station portable?
[03:41] <bruenig> nativity^, nothing that really matters to linux generally. So I don't worry myself with it. They are targeted the windows users not me.
[03:41] <loki505> yea
[03:41] <cablesm102> ActivE, that's because the media player doesn't support Gnome's network sharing system
[03:41] <loki505> i checked the forums
[03:41] <cablesm102> you will have to mount the Samba share as a drive
[03:41] <loki505> but its too confusing
[03:42] <rapid> loki505, i still don't know what edgy is
[03:42] <cablesm102> ActivE, I'll send you a link to some instructions. The samba share will show up as a drive, like /media/sambashare
[03:42] <loki505> i was wonderin if there is a easier way to get wifi working with my wifi macx
[03:42] <arrenlex> sith_man: Yes... but if I were you I would try reinstalling ubuntu first, because something about the installation got botched.
[03:42] <loki505> edgy is updated ubuntu
[03:42] <ActivE> thankyou <cablesm102>
[03:42] <loki505> 6.10
[03:42] <nativity^> bruenig: ok
[03:42] <rapid> loki505, running on your psp, have fuin.
[03:42] <arrenlex> sith_man: You could follow the instructions in the second link of !grub to make a grub floppy or something which you can use to boot, I guess.
[03:42] <arrenlex> !grub
[03:42] <dope_> my wireless is rausb0 instead of wlan0 and wpa won't work
[03:42] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[03:42] <nativity^> bruenig: but i installed it and video.google.com still loads videos automatically!  Any solution?
[03:42] <loki505> no on my computer
[03:43] <dope_> my wireless is rausb0 instead of wlan0 and wpa won't work
[03:43] <loki505> i cant get my wifi max working on my computer with is running ubuntu
[03:43] <rapid> loki505, Oh, you want to be able to access the net from your psp
[03:43] <cablesm102> ActivE, for future reference, you're not referring to streaming. It's just that programs have to support Gnome's networking system. Your media player doesn't and I don't know what does. So you will just make the samba share appear as a regular folder to the media player through these instructions.
[03:43] <loki505> yea
[03:43] <bruenig> nativity^, for google video, you could use flashblock, but that is a bit extreme
[03:43] <sith_man> arrenlex: ok, i will try the floppy. will it at least let me get to windows? cuz its really important that i get back to windows.
[03:43] <cablesm102> loki505, I'd think that that was a network problem, nothing to do with Ubuntu.
[03:43] <rapid> loki505, you will have to setup your card as a access point or obtain a router
[03:43] <arrenlex> sith_man: Oh, I guess I should explain the error. xD It means that your computer can't find the grub files on the hard drive, so it can't load.
[03:43] <nativity^> bruenig: ok
[03:44] <cablesm102> ActivE, here you go:
[03:44] <zappa420> LjL: my friend had to split before I got back to her.  so I'll try the things you suggested tomorrow.  Thanks for the help.  ALso thanks Catshrimp and engla and anyone whot thought bout my problem.
[03:44] <cablesm102> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently?highlight=%28shares%29%7C%28Windows%29
[03:44] <ActivE> I see, what would be a more appropriate term to streaming?
[03:44] <cablesm102> ActivE, "opening a media file" would work.
[03:44] <loki505> how do i do that i got comcast  an rca box that they gave me and wifi max thats all i got
[03:44] <friedtofu> question: how do i share files between two computers that run linux? (file share... :/) (they're on the same network, or at least i think they are... connected via the same router)
[03:44] <rapid> Active: you can just mount the drive and play the file?
[03:44] <loki505> imma big NOOB
[03:44] <sith_man> arrenlex: also, i was reading in the forums, could my prob be that ubuntu is on the secondary drive?
[03:44] <cablesm102> rapid, that's what the instructions will help him do.
[03:44] <rapid> friedtofu, samba maybe.
[03:44] <aleka> One question I had posted on the forums and I don't think I had explained myself as precisely as I should have. I broke my PS2 connection extension for my keyboard and plugged the USB wire right into a USB port, now my BIOS can not read my keyboard on reboot and I can not choose between OS es in grub, rather than just watch it go to the default one
[03:45] <rapid> cablesm102, too easy :)
[03:45] <arrenlex> sith_man: It's possible that it caused complications, but it's definitely possible to do and I don't see anything in what you pasted that indicates you ran afoul of such a configuration. It should work.
[03:45] <cablesm102> rapid, I don't think I get the joke, but :) anyway :)
[03:45] <friedtofu> rapid, after i install samba, it should be easy? (ok, i'll try now..)
[03:45] <goomie> What program would i use to connect to devices through the com port?
[03:45] <MightyVince> I have a problem with ubuntu, is there someone who can help me out?
[03:45] <rapid> goomie, minicom
[03:45] <cablesm102> wait, friedtofu, is this between 2 linux systems?
[03:45] <arrenlex> !ask | MightyVince
[03:45] <ubotu> MightyVince: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:45] <friedtofu> cablesm102: yeah
[03:46] <deep> MightyVince, alot of people here will try to. :)
[03:46] <cablesm102> friedtofu, you don't need samba for that. Samba's for sharing with Windows boxes
[03:46] <friedtofu> (they're connectedo n the same router)
[03:46] <friedtofu> ah
[03:46] <justin_> Is anyone good with "Cedega" ?
[03:46] <friedtofu> so how do i share between two linux boxes?
[03:46] <rapid> ftp/ssh
[03:46] <rapid> shrug
[03:46] <Music_Shuffle1> !nfs | friedtofu
[03:46] <ubotu> friedtofu: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[03:46] <ActivE> well whatever the case may be, its not the same process involved in playing a video from a hard disc as it is playing it from the hard disc on another pc over an ethernet network. However i guess the way unix handles files in streams makes it a very similar process?
[03:46] <cablesm102> friedtofu, right click on the folder and click share folder
[03:46] <MightyVince> okay so emm... Ubuntu is slow since ehh.. a few days ago
[03:46] <sith_man> arrenlex: ok, thank you very much for your help. i really appreciate it. if i get it workin, i will be sure to come back and tell you. even if i dont get it workin, i'll be back to complain some more. lol. i've g2g now. got school :\
[03:46] <ahaller> friedtofu, another simple way is gshare.
[03:46] <dope_> 5
[03:47] <cablesm102> ActivE, it's the exact same process
[03:47] <humblerodent> you also COULD do SMB if you wanted to....right?
[03:47] <loki505> i have no idea if its a network problem or not  can somebody please help me i wanna get net on my psp
[03:47] <arrenlex> sith_man: I have to go, unfortunately. Sorry... but good luck.
[03:47] <cablesm102> humblerodent, sure. But there wolud be no point.
[03:47] <rapid> loki505, I told you what you have to do
[03:47] <MightyVince> I managed to understand that the network was the problem since when I unplug the network cable all is okay

[03:47] <arrenlex> Hey, can xen be used like qemu\vmware?
[03:47] <green_earz> friedtofu: or look up nfs   network file share
[03:47] <MightyVince> but I tried to uninstall or desactivate whatever that is related to networking that could've created a problem
[03:47] <ActivE> Well its not the same process underneath but i guess what you mean is that process is transparent to the media player.
[03:48] <tlouden> Hello, I'm looking for some help with using a parallel port.  I keep getting the error:

[03:49] <rapid> loki505, you need a access point! or your card to run as a access point
[03:49] <arrenlex> richiefrich: In particular to run Windows in an emulated environment.
[03:49] <richiefrich> arrenlex  it is built directly into the kernel ..  not a guess,  it's what i read
[03:49] <graham_100> can anybody tell me how to use airsnort???

[03:53] <loki505> bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
[03:53] <cablesm102> !offtopic | youser
[03:53] <ubotu> youser: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:53] <zappa420> aleka: thats wierd.  you might have to get a PS2 keyboard to change the BIOS so it has USB support turned on.  or you might be able to find a program that will let u change the bios from within linux.
[03:53] <loki505> thats what i got
[03:53] <loki505> loki505@loki505-desktop:~$ file <name of fiel>

[03:53] <youser> lol
[03:53] <graham_100> richiefrich never mind lol :0
[03:53] <richiefrich> loki505 the name of the file itself
[03:54] <loki505> what file
[03:54] <richiefrich> loki505 like this  ->  file  foo
[03:54] <gravyfoo> I'm using KDE with Edgy and would like to disable the screensaver (or powersaving) -- seems to go to sleep and not wake up, or when it does, its extremely sluggish and only a x reboot helps.
[03:54] <richiefrich> file  start
[03:54] <MightyVince> like? I have Ubuntu Edgy x86 installed, SATA HDD, Athlon 64 4000+, Dual Channel 1GB RAM
[03:54] <richiefrich> loki505 whatever file you dont know what it is
[03:54] <MightyVince> but I don't think its hardware related cuz my friend had the same problem the same evening
[03:54] <aleka> alrgihty.. thanks for the info zappa420
[03:54] <sc4ttrbrain> MightyVince: like is there is any error?

[03:55] <richiefrich> graham_100 just repeat me your  question please the  driver for a wifi card?
[03:55] <richiefrich> graham_100 and it isk modelk number?  name is ?
[03:55] <MightyVince> I know its network-related and that its not my network card since my friend doesn't have the same one and have the same problem
=== bun-bun_ is now known as bun-bun
[03:56] <MightyVince> and it just happened like that when I rebooted
[03:56] <graham_100> richiefrich i have a program called "airsnort" a wireless sniffer app! i need some instructions as to how to use it as i cannot find any
[03:56] <richiefrich> graham_100    like kismet
[03:57] <richiefrich> http://airsnort.shmoo.com/  <-- homr  page
[03:57] <richiefrich> graham_100 ^^
[03:57] <graham_100> richiefrich kind of yeah (i have kismet *wireshark*
[03:57] <MightyVince> well it happened after my computer crashed but since my friend's computer didn't crashed when it happened I guess its not the source of the problem
[03:58] <MightyVince> so I know what is not the source of the problem now I need to know what is XD
[03:58] <richiefrich> graham_100   kismet is different them wireshark.. i think you know that :)   .. bur thats there home page --> http://airsnort.shmoo.com/
[03:58] <graham_100> richiefrich thanx :)
[03:58] <cablesm102> MightyVince, do you have a backup from before?
[03:58] <dope> can anyone help me get wpa workin?  wep works right now
[03:59] <cablesm102> MightyVince, is your CPU usage high?
[03:59] <richiefrich> graham_100 np i dont see any instructions just a FAQ --> http://airsnort.shmoo.com/faq.html
[03:59] <MightyVince> err no
[03:59] <MightyVince> mmm is there a way to check?
[03:59] <phisquare> bum
[03:59] <MightyVince> like to check which app takes how much of the CPU?
[03:59] <cablesm102> MightyVince, right click on a panel, and add system monitor. Then click it.
[03:59] <cablesm102> yep
[03:59] <dope> nobody knows wpa?
[03:59] <MightyVince> k I'll check that wait a min
[04:00] <humblerodent> LjL: now my DVD is even more problematic than before....
[04:00] <cablesm102> MightyVince, actually
[04:00] <humblerodent> I'm thinking of just leaving it with the minor flaw
[04:00] <whyameye> how do you change bootup parameters when booting from LILO?
[04:00] <humblerodent> =P
[04:00] <cablesm102> just go to system>administration>system monitor
[04:00] <richiefrich> dope wpa_supplicant  is the app you need
[04:00] <cablesm102> MightyVince, then just sort by CPU usage and you'll see if anythings hogging stuff.
[04:00] <dope> i got it
[04:00] <dope> richiefrich, and i got wpa_gui
[04:00] <richiefrich> whyameye you cant iirc
[04:00] <MightyVince> CPU : 0% Usage
[04:00] <richiefrich> dope then i have a guide for you
[04:01] <cablesm102> MightyVince, how 'bout memory?
[04:01] <dope> well my wireless is called rausb0 instead of wlan0
[04:01] <carutsu> i installed beryl and didnt configure tge xgl, is there anything wrong about that/
[04:01] <carutsu> ?
[04:01] <richiefrich> dope you have the same linksys I do ?
[04:01] <richiefrich> dope the usb one?
[04:01] <LjL> Ubotu, tell carutsu about xgl | carutsu, see the private message from Ubotu
[04:01] <dope> ralink i think?
[04:01] <cablesm102> MightyVince, I also have another idea. Add another panel item, the CPU scaling monitor
[04:01] <carutsu> thx
[04:01] <dope> i use the rt73 driver
[04:01] <dope> i think they're similar if not the same thing
[04:01] <whyameye> richiefrich: so if I changed something in my xorg.conf file and Gnome crashes now then how am I supposed to fix?
[04:02] <richiefrich> dope  WUSB54GC  ??
[04:02] <cablesm102> whyamey, hopefully you made a backup
[04:02] <dope> whatever came with a averatec 2730
[04:02] <dope> how can i check?
[04:02] <MightyVince> CPU scaling monitor is unsuported
[04:02] <richiefrich> whyameye in console
[04:02] <MightyVince> but it says 100%....
[04:02] <cablesm102> whyameye, then you can do a sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:02] <richiefrich> dope  lsusb OR lspci
[04:02] <cablesm102> MightyVince, I have no idea
[04:02] <cablesm102> sorry
[04:03] <MightyVince> and memory is at bout 20% abd there's some peaks at 100% some time
[04:03] <richiefrich> dope then tell me the link for the linksys
[04:03] <MightyVince> okay well ty anyways =/
[04:03] <richiefrich> dope  is a  gentoo doc but all the same just a few config fileshttp://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=4&chap=4
[04:03] <richiefrich> dope  is a  gentoo doc but all the same just a few config files   http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=4&chap=4
[04:04] <dope> ok leme see here
[04:04] <whyameye> richiefrich: how can I get to the console? the machine crashes hard.  No keys work after the crash at all.
[04:05] <richiefrich> whyameye what do you mean jyuo cant get to console ?
[04:05] <richiefrich> whyameye X fails then it drops you to console
[04:05] <whyameye> richiefrich: when Gnome tries to load the machine becomes completely unresponsive. COMPLETELY. It does NOT drop me to the console.
[04:05] <whyameye> it's dead.
[04:05] <richiefrich> whyameye s o gdm is failing?
[04:05] <richiefrich> whyameye you boot right into X?
[04:06] <whyameye> richiefrich: trying to get dual head to work. I tried two different drivers one for each head. I guess it was a stupid thing to try
[04:06] <richiefrich> whyameye not at all i love my tripes :)
[04:06] <richiefrich> triples*
[04:07] <whyameye> richiefrich: don't most installs boot right into x?
[04:07] <whyameye> runlevel2 = gdm
[04:07] <whyameye> anyway, it's solvable. Just boot from a LiveCD. But it's annoying.
[04:07] <richiefrich> whyameye boot into a liveCD mount your HDD and  edit xorg.conf
[04:07] <Heojaua> Hey guys, i kinda have a weird problem on Ubuntu Edgy 6.10... when i plug my RJ45 cable into my network card and i boot ubuntu is slow as hell...but if i dont plug the cable in it goes well anyone got an idea ? =o..help would be veryy appriciated
[04:07] <richiefrich> whyameye and next time  use Xnest..  it loads X inside your currently running X
[04:07] <carutsu> does anyone know how to configure sound cards?
[04:07] <richiefrich> whyameye that way you can test
[04:07] <carutsu> somehow it got messed up
[04:08] <carutsu> it worked fine
[04:08] <dope> i don't really understand this tut
[04:08] <dope> richiefrich, i don't have a /etc/conf.d/net file
[04:08] <richiefrich> carutsu reinstall the driver.. i dont think you have to configure it either ubuntu recognize=s it or it doesnt
[04:09] <whyameye> richiefrich: okay that is a good tip. Thank you.
[04:09] <evilghost> I'm working on doing ToS/QoS traffic shaping with tc qdisc/htb and need someone to attempt to saturate my bandwidth on residential DSL against Apache2, anyone with a downstream greater than 300kbps want to help me out?  I'd be very appreciate.
[04:09] <richiefrich> dope  of  but you do have a network file  someplace
[04:09] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: It's trying to configure the networking during boot time, and for some reason is having trouble doing so.  Does your connection take a long time to acquire an address for usually?
[04:10] <richiefrich> whyameye the cmd to runj it then is like so -->  startx -- /usr/bin/Xnest :#   <-- where the # is  a real number like  :2  :4
[04:10] <dope> i might
[04:10] <Heojaua> no its goes well
[04:10] <dope> but i don't know
[04:10] <carutsu> it recognized it
[04:10] <richiefrich> dope you have configs just look around in /etc :)
[04:10] <Heojaua> it was doing well then suddenly when i rebooted it was uber slow
[04:10] <carutsu> how do i reinstall it?
[04:10] <richiefrich> carutsu apt-get
[04:11] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: What was doing well?
[04:11] <Heojaua> its not only slow on bootup but its slow into the OS when i start an application
[04:11] <richiefrich> carutsu or they to reconfig it
[04:11] <Heojaua> my Ubuntu/connection
[04:11] <carutsu> ok, but how? or where?
[04:11] <richiefrich> whyameye you get that cmd ?
[04:11] <GK> hello all - I am looking for ubuntu full version ( Source and extras ) - where can I find them
[04:12] <Heojaua> ex: when i start Amarok it takes 5 mins to start....
[04:12] <bruenig> GK, you want to iso?
[04:12] <richiefrich> GK ubuntu homepage
[04:12] <bruenig> the*
[04:12] <GK> what I have is only single CD desktop verion
[04:12] <GK> yes
[04:12] <Megaqwerty> is it possible to run my windows partition in a VM?
[04:12] <GK> I am looking for iso images
[04:12] <bruenig> GK, yeah the single cd desktop version is the whole thing essentially
[04:12] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: So it's not just your boot time, it's all performance that's affected?
[04:12] <carutsu> apt-get only? can't be synaptic?
[04:12] <Heojaua> yeah totally
[04:12] <bruenig> GK, you can get a dvd iso, or if perhaps other isos like the alternative iso or server iso
[04:12] <GK> hmmm .. I need to install a development system
[04:13] <richiefrich> carutsu yes what ever you like to use
[04:13] <evilghost> Megaqwerty:  No, you'll need to convert it first using something like p2v (Vmware) or Ghost, etc.
[04:13] <Crescendo> What is the recommended java install for Ubuntu? How do I change it from whatever it is that I have
[04:13] <GK> I do not need dvd iso .. b'se I don't have DVD writer
[04:13] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: Have you checked your processes to see what's bogging it down?
[04:13] <richiefrich> Crescendo sun java
[04:13] <bruenig> !info sun-java5-bin
[04:13] <GK> what is alternative iso
[04:13] <Megaqwerty> evilghost: what do you mean convert it? Would I lose all of the files already on there? I'm confused.
[04:13] <ubotu> sun-java5-bin: Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.5.0-08-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 21811 kB, installed size 65084 kB
[04:13] <tonyyarusso> !alternate | GK
[04:13] <ubotu> GK: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[04:13] <bruenig> GK, it is the textual installer instead of graphical
[04:13] <Crescendo> Alright, and how do I set it as the default Java?
[04:13] <ianp> hey all
[04:13] <Crowley1027> hola everyone.
[04:13] <Heojaua> my CPU is not doing anything i mean its at 0% usage
[04:13] <ianp> Crescendo: "default java" in what sense?
[04:13] <bruenig> !hi | Crowley1027
[04:14] <ubotu> Crowley1027: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:14] <Heojaua> Ram is at 20% average
[04:14] <Crowley1027> :)
[04:14] <GK> bruenig - ok
[04:14] <Crescendo> In the sense that all java applications on the machine run using that runtime?
[04:14] <GK> the point is I have been using redhat flavour till now ..
[04:14] <evilghost> Megaqwery:  No, you wouldn't lose anything but there are some caveats to it, such as having to define your "Computer" as a "Standard Computer" and a "Standard IDE Controller" in Windows Device Manager prior to taking an image of it.
[04:14] <GK> it comes with 3 cd's
[04:14] <GK> where I get every thing to setup my development system
[04:14] <bruenig> GK, well if you need more stuff, you can always use the repos to get it, what sort of stuff do you want?
[04:14] <borat> Hey, guys, im using XGL, and all of a sudden it seems like my priorities on my right click have been changed, because when i right click, it is shaded over by another box instead of being the prominant box.
[04:14] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: That's very very odd
[04:14] <ianp> I have a question. I finally got Beryl going on Edgy. but if I use it, my Java app shows as grey.. if i switch back to normal metacity, everything is ok. any known issues with Java (or any) apps having drawing issues in Beryl?
[04:14] <Crowley1027> is the full ubuntu install just one CD?
[04:15] <bruenig> borat, #ubuntu-xgl
[04:15] <GK> including compilers and all extra softwares
[04:15] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: Checked forums for anyone else having the same thing happen?
[04:15] <bruenig> ianp, #ubuntu-xgl
[04:15] <Heojaua> found nothing
[04:15] <ianp> bruenig: ok
[04:15] <Heojaua> i googled it for 3 days now
[04:15] <bruenig> Crowley1027, yes
[04:15] <richiefrich> cirkit ^_^
[04:15] <cirkit> does anyone know why emerge does not work in ubuntu?
[04:15] <Heojaua> found nothing
[04:15] <cirkit> i installed it after someone told me ubuntu is like gentoo
[04:15] <evilghost> cirkit:  Because it's not Gentoo?
[04:15] <bruenig> GK, sudo apt-get install build-essentiall will install all the compilers and make and all that good stuff
[04:15] <jrib> ubotu: tell cirkit about synaptic
[04:15] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: Tried the mailing list?
[04:15] <jrib> ubotu: tell cirkit about apt-get
[04:16] <GK> oh .. ok
[04:16] <Heojaua> !
[04:16] <Crowley1027> is the full ubuntu install just one CD?
[04:16] <Crescendo> How do I set my default java?
[04:16] <jrib> !multijava | Crescendo
[04:16] <GK> thanks bruenig
[04:16] <ubotu> Crescendo: To set which java version/implementation is to be used as default, use sudo update-java-alternatives
[04:16] <Heojaua> ill check it out brb
[04:16] <bruenig> Crowley1027, yes
[04:16] <tonyyarusso> Crowley1027: Depends what you mean by that
[04:16] <Crowley1027> very nice.
[04:16] <Megaqwerty> evilghost: ^^
[04:16] <GK> can I get some document where I can make my own linux flavour based on ubuntu
[04:16] <Crowley1027> um, as compared to a SuSe 10.2 5-CD install
[04:16] <GK> I mean my own distro
[04:17] <HappyHolliday> Hello...I am new to Ubuntu... Can anybody help me with a screen resolution problem... I can't change in from 640x480

[04:17] <cirkit> can I use apt-get to install emerge?
[04:17] <bruenig> cirkit, there is no emerge. Use apt-get to install your stuff
[04:17] <kitche> cirkit: no emerge should not be installed on ubuntu it's bad
[04:17] <cirkit> oh
[04:17] <evilghost> cirkit:  Why do you want to use emerge?  No, emerge is for Gentoo for portage/etc....
[04:17] <Heojaua> yeah i activated it but...lol does have something with my problem ?
[04:17] <tonyyarusso> Crowley1027: Then yes.  You can do the installation process from one CD.  (The total amount of software available in the repos is like 30 GB)
[04:17] <cirkit> ok is ubuntu secure?
[04:17] <evilghost> HappyHolliday: What kind of video card to you have?
[04:17] <evilghost> cirkit:  Dude, are you trolling?
[04:18] <cirkit> what?
[04:18] <cirkit> im coming from windows
[04:18] <cirkit> don't know to much linux
[04:18] <chrisjw> hi, i don't know if anyone can help me, I've just installed python 2.4.4 because apparently there are security bugs
[04:18] <HappyHolliday> geforce
[04:18] <bruenig> cirkit, you talk of gentoo a lot
[04:18] <tonyyarusso> cirkit: Compared to windows, absolutely.
[04:18] <evilghost> cirkit:  I'm confused on what makes Gentoo more secure than Ubuntu/etc, and the questions about emerge.
[04:18] <Crowley1027> its like...the basic stuff needed to run ubuntu is on one CD, and the net installs whatever else is needed?
[04:18] <chrisjw> when I run gedit, I now get the error:
[04:18] <Megaqwerty> evilghost: will you please answer my question? ^^^^

[04:18] <whyameye> richiefrich: okay I just saw the cmd. So I type /usr/bin/Xnest inside a console inside a Gnome session?
[04:18] <ubotu> chrisjw: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:18] <evilghost> Megaqwerty: Sorry, I missed it, what was your question again?  I thought I answered the last one.
[04:18] <jrib> chrisjw: use the python in the repositories
[04:18] <richiefrich> whyameye yes just like i did you need the :#
[04:19] <chrisjw> I couldn't find 2.4.4
[04:19] <cirkit> hi richiefrich
[04:19] <richiefrich> whyameye make that a real number :3 :1
[04:19] <cirkit> richiefrich, do you use ubuntu?
[04:19] <tonyyarusso> cirkit: 'sudo' is one nice thing security wise, along with intelligent defaults, in addition to the built-in !firewall.  Beyond that, you can lock it down even more if you wish.
[04:19] <Megaqwerty> evilghost: "what do you mean convert it? Would I lose all of the files already on there? I'm confused."
[04:19] <richiefrich> cirkit no sir i like to help
[04:19] <cirkit> tonyyarusso, oh ok thank you...I will research about it.
[04:19] <evilghost> Megaqwerty: Oh, I answered you..., let me repost.
[04:19] <cirkit> richiefrich, you like to help how?
[04:19] <evilghost> Megaqwerty:  No, you'll need to convert it first using something like p2v (Vmware) or Ghost, etc.
[04:19] <Crowley1027> hahahaha.....megaqwerty
[04:19] <Crowley1027> nice name
[04:19] <richiefrich> cirkit answer question that i know :P
[04:19] <tonyyarusso> Crowley1027: Yep.  Although many many things are included right off the bat (internet, email, word processor, etc)
[04:19] <jrib> chrisjw: 2.4.4 isn't in the repositories
[04:19] <Megaqwerty> oh, whoops, it was lost up above
[04:20] <obgynot> I'm trying to set up sound on ubuntu 6.10 on a old laptop, fujitsu lifebook... any ideas?
[04:20] <Heojaua> Tonyyarusso - I activated mail but does it have something to do with the problem ? =o
[04:20] <richiefrich> cirkit i just cant point you  to an ubunutu config file
[04:20] <Megaqwerty> Crowley1027: what is your implication?
[04:20] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: dunno
[04:20] <Crowley1027> its a creative but simple name.
[04:20] <cirkit> richiefrich, dude...how much do you charge for assistance?
[04:20] <Heojaua> Tonyy - how i do to deactivate it ?

[04:20] <bruenig> wow
[04:20] <GK> sorry

[04:21] <GK> some issue ... here
[04:21] <whyameye> richiefrich: ok. Well I'm finally back to where I started i.e. it will load up and the 2nd screen is blank. So I'll try now...
[04:21] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: Checking e-mail you mean?
[04:21] <GK> sorry for repeate
[04:21] <richiefrich> whyameye ok :)
[04:21] <jrib> chrisjw: what is the security issue exactly?
[04:21] <Crowley1027> GK, you don't want to make your own distro if you don't know how to do that.
[04:21] <TiG4> *** If I have one hard drive with multiple partitions, what do I add to fstab in order to mount the other partitions? ***
[04:21] <chrisjw> a unicode parsing bug
[04:21] <Crowley1027> you want to go through allllllllllllll that trouble?
[04:21] <GK> hey it is all about learning
[04:21] <Heojaua> tonyy well to uninstall this or something..to clear it up....linux was going fine before i do some stuff in it -_-
[04:21] <boltozaurus> !firewall
[04:21] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:21] <Crowley1027> its all about learning a lot.
[04:22] <chrisjw> It recommends that 2.4.3 should be updated to 2.4.4
[04:22] <jrib> chrisjw: what is "it"?
[04:22] <lupine_85> GK: just mirror the repository and make any changes that you want. et voila, your own distro
[04:22] <Crowley1027> !security
[04:22] <bruenig> TiG4, you have to add the drives to the fstab, generally just follow the formatting of the other drives in fstab
[04:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about security - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[04:22] <Megaqwerty> Could you point me towards a tutorial?
[04:22] <richiefrich> GK thats the best i can sdo base it off that
[04:22] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: I'm sorry, I really don't understand what you're asking now.

[04:23] <cirkit> richiefrich, are you a leet hacker?
[04:23] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: You mean you have a mail server running or what?
[04:23] <bruenig> TiG4, do sudo fdisk -l, then figure it out, should be pretty easy, look at the sizes and how big you rememer making them
[04:23] <richiefrich> cirkit o.O no
[04:23] <cirkit> richiefrich, ok thanks for talking to me today...im gonna go get stoned
[04:23] <Crowley1027> is richiefrich a 1337 h4x0r???!?!?!?!?!?11111//?!!?!11/?!1
[04:24] <GK> ok thanks - will do some research
[04:24] <Heojaua> tony - no i installed the mail feature of Ubuntu ...ya know ?

[04:24] <Megaqwerty> evilghost: ?? ^^^^
[04:24] <richiefrich> Crowley1027 dotn believe all the hype :)
[04:24] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: Internal system mail with 'mailx'?
[04:24] <TiG4> bruenig, gread thanks
[04:24] <Crowley1027> its overrated.
[04:24] <Crowley1027> define: hack

[04:25] <Music_Shuffle1> tonyyarusso, who?
[04:25] <tonyyarusso> Music_Shuffle1: Heojaua
[04:26] <Heojaua> tony- ughh i still dont understand why my ubuntu goes uberslow when i plug my rj45 cable into my network card...lol i think its something that eats all the juice or trying to aplicate somethin
[04:26] <tonyyarusso> Music_Shuffle1: Changed something, and now everything is really slow - not sure exactly what
[04:26] <Crowley1027> ughh
[04:26] <Music_Shuffle1> tonyyarusso, he installed Evolution.
[04:26] <cirkit> evilghost, any reason why you did a /whois on me?
[04:26] <tonyyarusso> Music_Shuffle1: Evo's default though, wait
[04:26] <Music_Shuffle1> I'm pretty sure that's what he means...mail client...Gnome...makes sense.
[04:26] <chrisjw> does anyone know how I can fix this problem I have got myself into, I did make install on the 2.4.4, now i'm getting errors running things like gedit
[04:26] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: Do you run Gnome or KDE?
[04:26] <Music_Shuffle1> Might not be under the Alter or something.
[04:27] <GK> lupine - can you give some more info on the mechanism you said
[04:27] <evilghost> cirkit:  Any reason you're trolling?
[04:27] <Heojaua> tony- i think i use gnome im a newb with linux lol
[04:27] <jrib> chrisjw: uninstall 2.4.4
[04:27] <tonyyarusso> Music_Shuffle1: Alt disk installs same packages.
[04:27] <GK> I mean "create a repository and make changes" ..
[04:27] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: WEll, is it brown?
[04:27] <chrisjw> ok
[04:27] <cirkit> evilghost, im not trolling....
[04:27] <evilghost> cirkit:  Set your channel +i if you don't want exposure over /whois
[04:27] <cirkit> evilghost, /whois is rude
[04:27] <cirkit> evilghost, its not my channel
[04:27] <Heojaua> tony- how do i know ? lol..=l
[04:27] <chrisjw> jrib, but then won't it have problems finding 2.4.3?
[04:27] <cirkit> evilghost, Im new to ubuntu world and don't know what im doing
[04:27] <evilghost> cirkit:  Not going to turn this into a flame-war but amazing how your typing skills have evolved.
[04:28] <jrib> chrisjw: I'm reading about the advisory.  It was issued in october before edgy release, so I would expect a fix to be implemented.  But this is speculation, i am looking for a way to verify this
[04:28] <cirkit> evilghost, thanks
[04:28] <Dial_tone> how do i hide join/part messages in xchat-gnome? I tried changing conf mode
[04:28] <tonyyarusso> cirkit: (I /whois people all the time - most don't get notified; it helps us keep track of who's here and where they might be from, in case a LoCo channel might be useful to them, etc.)
[04:28] <Music_Shuffle1> tonyyarusso, if he doesn't know if its brown or not, personally, I would be >.> real quick.
[04:28] <chrisjw> ok, well that's not my major concern right now because when running things like gedit, it's returning many errors
[04:28] <czer323> Dial_tone, Do yourself a favor.  Get rid of xchat-gnome and get regular xchat instead.
[04:28] <chrisjw> so I don't want to know what's going to happen if I restart unless I fix it
[04:29] <Music_Shuffle1> Yes...xchat > xchat-gnome.
[04:29] <delaney> Problem:  dual booting edgy + xp and im getting this when i boot up  http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/8norsn71.html  anyone able to tell me how to fix such a problem?
[04:29] <TiG4> *** how do I reload my fstab so that disks will mount
[04:29] <Dial_tone> that is good advice
[04:29] <jrib> chrisjw: are you able to uninstall it?
[04:29] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: You can try looking through your logs (in /var/log/) to see what you might have changed, but beyond that I have no idea.
[04:29] <chrisjw> well I don't really know how, I'm a noob to this
[04:29] <chrisjw> but once I uninstall it, how does 2.4.3 work again?
[04:29] <chrisjw> with all that stuff it's meant to have
[04:29] <chrisjw> lol
[04:30] <kitche> TiG4: sudo mount -a try that
[04:30] <obgynot> looking for 'sndconfig' for ubuntu 6.10... apt-get didn't help
[04:30] <TiG4> kitche, thanks
[04:30] <jrib> chrisjw: where did you install it to?  python on edgy seems to be 2.4.4. rc by the way
[04:30] <Heojaua> tony - lol wait up it takes for ever to open...
[04:30] <chrisjw> I put it in home, untarred, configured, did make, then make install
[04:30] <chrisjw> I thought it would just update
[04:31] <jrib> chrisjw: join me in #ubuntu-classroom please
[04:31] <richiefrich> evilghost not to stick up for cirkit but if you do qa  /chanserv info #lsf1 it will tell you the owner
[04:31] <Heojaua> tony - ! open !
=== capunk is now known as LaD
[04:32] <aleka> a stupid Q>>> What is the "super" Key <which key is it?> as it is mentioned in the beryl wiki?
=== LaD is now known as LaDIes
[04:32] <Heojaua> tony - ok now what you need to know ?
[04:32] <rajiv_nair> windows key
[04:32] <aleka> ohh
[04:32] <rajiv_nair> :)
[04:33] <tonyyarusso> Heojaua: It's what _you_ need to know.  Spend some time looking through those to figure out what on earth you changed since when it was working, try undoing it, and come back later with more data to work from, since thing's are way too vague to say much right now.
[04:33] <aleka> thanks rajiv :)
[04:33] <evilghost> richiefrich:  NP, just really seemed a blatant troll especially the evolution of typing (correct case, etc).
[04:34] <Heojaua> tony - okay thanks tho =O
[04:34] <evilghost> richiefrich:  Not sure anyone is going to come in asking about emerge, how to install it on ubuntu, is ubuntu secure, etc.
[04:34] <rajiv_nair> aleka: np:)
[04:34] <Heojaua> merci beaucoup ^-^
[04:34] <richiefrich> evilghost i was just commenting on the owning of the channel
[04:35] <evilghost> richiefrich:  I'm in XChat so I'm more used to BitchX but it appears he's +v?
[04:36] <as> hallo there
[04:36] <richiefrich> evilghost ahh that idk  but chanserv info tells me he aint the owner
[04:36] <aleka> rajiv_nair: have you used beryl? and would you have the patience to answer another silly Q?
[04:36] <rajiv_nair> aleka: go on
[04:36] <evilghost> richiefrich:  NP, not sure chan-owner would have much to do with if hes' trolling for "kicks" in a Gentoo channel.
[04:36] <rajiv_nair> aleka: im currentyl usin beryl :D
[04:36] <rajiv_nair> currently*
[04:37] <loki505> i have a question regarding my recent upgrade of ubuntu 6.10edgy and during the upgrade it hepy tellin me to keep or delete obsolete files but i kept them i dont know why cause i dontsee no need too really but is there anyway i can delete those files
[04:37] <aleka> How can I give my application menus cool effects? Like clikcing on applications or places or system.. just drops down a menu now.. how can that be altered?>
[04:37] <evilghost> richiefrich:  You're less pessimistic than I and I doubt we'll really know the full scenario.
[04:37] <rajiv_nair> hold on
[04:37] <aleka> I just installed it... and I guess I am looking ofr some shortcuts than finding out the hard way :)
[04:37] <cirkit> evilghost, what do you hope to accomplish with your repetitive comments about the scenario?
[04:37] <jpiccolo> he 2.6.20 Linux kernel will include a driver aimed at allowing user-space processes to exploit virtualization capabilities in modern 64-bit x86 Intel and AMD processors. -sweet
[04:37] <richiefrich> evilghost i really just dont care
[04:38] <delaney> no love on my file inconsistencies huh.
[04:38] <rajiv_nair> aleka: beryl settings manager-> animationa-> create effect..check the box labeled "drop down menu"
[04:38] <loki505> in other words i there anyway i can find out if ihave obsolete files if so how do u delete them and or how do u do it
[04:39] <aleka> thanks again rajiv
[04:39] <rajiv_nair> :)

[04:42] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: works well, but the main diff is that codecs for win media etc are not available
[04:43] <toodles> i need to run some programs to program a satellite
[04:43] <aleka> Is there a difference between a PS2 extension for mouse and a PS2 extension for a keyboard in pins and their layout? Would one work for the other?
[04:43] <HappyHolliday> Thanks everyone... I will try your suggestions
[04:43] <rapid> toodles, try wine, if not theres also vmware

[04:44] <MrFatJack> I had xgl and compiz set up and running fine on 6.06. When I upgraded to 6.10 it no longer works. Also when I log in I get a desktop with no window manager. I have to go to terminal and type metacity& to control windows on my screen. Any thoughts on how to fix this?
[04:44] <rajiv_nair> u reinstalled XGL??
[04:44] <shinobi2> thoreauputic: i don't care too much about media, dvd, sound, it's going to be a remote server.
[04:44] <MrFatJack> yes

=== khisanth_ is now known as Khisanth
[04:46] <aleka> am afraid I might have damaged the PS2 port on my computer... which means i will never have an active keyboard during bootup and am forced to only boot into 1 OS all the time
[04:46] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: I would say for most server purposes it shouild be fine ( mine is a 12" iBook though, and i don't use it as aserver) At the moment Sun java is still not avilable as far as i know, for PPC - but if it's a mactel I guess it would be)

[04:48] <rapid> aleka: not that I can see.
[04:48] <shinobi2> sun java is available for linux, so i don't think there will be a prob. on mac with ubuntu
[04:48] <aleka> thnx rapid
[04:48] <aleka> rapid: what did I do to make what happen?? break my PS2 extension?
[04:48] <minerale> Has anyone tried to manually compile truecrypt? I keep getting errors about a certain DM_MSG_PREFIX  -- google shows others have had the problem
[04:49] <rapid> aleka: crash xcash
[04:49] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: erm, the problem is that sun java is not availabe for PPC
[04:49] <rapid> xchat
[04:49] <rapid> :)
[04:49] <Cran1988> is not available ?
[04:49] <Cran1988> impossible
[04:49] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: linux PPC that is
[04:49] <shinobi2> ahh..
[04:49] <Jobe> Is there such thing as a program Wine can run?
[04:50] <thoreauputic> Cran1988: might change soon since java is now open source
[04:50] <aleka> rapid.. I was just clicking on the xchat window to make it active so I could type.. and it just crashed...
[04:50] <shinobi2> thoreauputic:  i thought it's transparent if i install sun on ubuntu
[04:50] <aleka> this is not the first time I've had xchat crash
[04:50] <blaa> hi nolimitsoya
[04:50] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: I repeat - you can't install Sunn Java on PPC Ubuntu at the moment
[04:50] <thoreauputic> or PPC linux in general
[04:51] <obgynot> how do I run a modprobe command at boot?
[04:51] <Jobe> Everything I try to install on Wine fails one way or another. Everything :/  Grim Fandango, Gabriel Knight, this Fish Aquarium Screensaver program, Pharoah, Septerra Core...
[04:51] <thoreauputic> obgynot: put the modulke in /etc/modules
[04:51] <obgynot> I want to do this: modprobe sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x330
[04:51] <thoreauputic> *module
[04:51] <obgynot> thanks
[04:52] <Jobe> my girlfriend even installed this desktop dancer and it flickers too much on the desktop.
[04:52] <jrib> Jobe: check out wine's appdb
[04:52] <Jobe> jrib: where's that at
[04:52] <thoreauputic> obgynot: if it's more specific than just loading it, i don't know
[04:52] <jrib> Jobe: on wine's web site
[04:52] <Jobe> jrib:  oh
[04:53] <obgynot> thoreauputic: man modules says it allows params, so I think I just put everything after the modprobe in there
[04:53] <Jobe> it looks like it supports a lot :(  I dont see why it isnt wokring for me.
[04:54] <hardaway> when will openoffice 2.1 be in feisty
[04:54] <Jobe> is there some sort of way you have to set it up?
[04:54] <thoreauputic> obgynot: ah OK - I never needed it but the man is the bible on the subject I guess ;-)
[04:54] <shinobi2> how can i take away priviledge for a normal user? disable sudo, and other adminstrative tasks, so user can't install apps with apt-get and synaptic?
[04:54] <thoreauputic> obgynot: normally /etc/modules is just a list of modules - no commands
[04:54] <kitche> shinobi2: make sure users aren't in the admin group
[04:54] <jrib> shinobi2: don't put him in the admin group
[04:55] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: only users in the admin group can use sudo
[04:55] <shinobi2> jrib: how to check?
[04:55] <shinobi2> i don't want them to see 'cat /boot/grub stuff either"
[04:55] <jrib> shinobi2: system > administration > uses and groups  will let you choose whether or not the user has adminstrative privileges
[04:56] <shinobi2> jrib: ok, 'id' shows that too
[04:57] <thoreauputic> !msg
[04:57] <ubotu> Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[04:57] <jrib> shinobi2: yep, 'groups' would also work, or you can look at /etc/group
[04:58] <shinobi2> i'll probably need to do all the administrative tasks over ssh once, ubuntu-mac server is setup
[04:59] <thoreauputic> shinobi2: to add a user to a group,  sudo adduser $USER $GROUPNAME ( e.g adduser foo admin ) to remove,  deluser foo admin
[05:00] <Midtronic> I feel like this is a rather dumb question, but is there a liveCD/liveDVD version of Eft?  And if there is, where do I find it?
[05:00] <Midtronic> the latest liveCD I could find was 4.10
[05:00] <TheGilmanator> The installation CD also functions as a live CD.
[05:00] <AngryElf> when trying to import a theme i keep getting "theme format invalid" -- what am i doing wrong?
[05:00] <thoreauputic> Midtronic: yes, the desktop CD
[05:01] <Midtronic> TheGilmanator: how?  The options on the framebuffer screen that loads are only for install
[05:01] <TiG4> I have a game controller that when plugged in is not detected. Is there a way to determine wheter or not Ubuntu sees it?
[05:01] <TheGilmanator> Midtronic: Use that one. I'm not sure how much stuff is installed, but you can play with it there.
[05:01] <thoreauputic> AngryElf: maybe the theme isn't valid :) Usually Gnome themes can be drag-dropped to the theme dialog
[05:01] <obgynot> how about a command-line tool to play an ogg file?
[05:01] <TheGilmanator> midtronic: Be sure you're using the Desktop CD and not the server CD, though.
[05:02] <obgynot> ... that is in the edgy universe?
[05:02] <Midtronic> TheGilmanator: I know what I'm doing with Linux.  This is for a friend who has a PC whose HDD died
[05:02] <thoreauputic> obgynot: ogg123 from vorbis-tools
[05:02] <AngryElf> thoreauputic, yea -- i downloaded it from gnome-look.org and dragged and dropped, still nothin
[05:02] <browrp> hey
[05:02] <Midtronic> thoreauputic: thanks a bunch
[05:02] <thoreauputic> AngryElf: well, either it needs an engine you don't have, or it isn't a valid theme tarball
[05:02] <obgynot> thoreauputic: that's it, thanks
[05:02] <Jbirk> Anyone ever overclock?
[05:03] <TheGilmanator> Midtronic: The desktop CD will at least give you a terminal window and get you on a network.
[05:03] <graham_100> how do i set my wireless card to work with airsnort??
[05:03] <AngryElf> thoreauputic, it says it's gtk2 -- is that ubuntu default?
[05:03] <Midtronic> TheGilmanator: right.  As long as it has gaim I think she'll be happy.  Does 6.10 come with ntfs support?
[05:03] <graham_100> i can use the scan function but i can't seem to get it to work for airsnort
[05:03] <thoreauputic> AngryElf: should be - does it require a gtk2 engine? If so check if that's installed
[05:03] <browrp> is Java SE 6 going to be included in the ubuntu repositories
[05:03] <TheGilmanator> midtronic: Not sure. I'm not dual-booting so I haven't bothered to find out.
[05:03] <AngryElf> it's installed according to synaptic
[05:03] <kitche> Midtronic: read support bu default for read/write you need ntfs-3g
=== shinjin is now known as shin-jin
[05:04] <Midtronic> read is fine.  Thanks
[05:04] <TheGilmanator> Here's a fun one. Beryl 0.1.3 is making all of my menus and dropdown lists appear BEHIND my windows, leaving them completely inaccessable. Anyone seen this?

[05:08] <thoreauputic> AngryElf: :D
[05:09] <shin-jin> Tried installing Ubuntu 6.06 PPC on a Mac iBook G4 onto an external firewire drive -- the installer recognized the disk as a scsi disk but couldn't proceed with the installation. Any ideas?
[05:09] <jb0nd38372> <yuv656>  I know theres windows based solutions like partition manager that can convert.. but since I did a clean format on my 74gig and installed ubuntu, I really have no way of doing that... and I dont trust wine to handle something like that :)
[05:09] <bruenig> aleka, settings, preferences, textbox, check the enable timestamps
[05:09] <brainsik> Psykovsky: nice. i like the sound of slavic languages. hmm.. okay, i'll check this out.
[05:09] <kitche> jb0nd38372: well you can't convert ntfs to ext3 really
[05:09] <aleka> bruenig: thanks
[05:09] <yuv656> jb0nd38372: there is an installable ext2 filesystem for windows but i guess that wont help
[05:10] <Psykovsky> brainsik: Lithuanian is baltic, slavic is Russian, Polish and such...
[05:10] <noobie0057>  I have a question, I'm logged in as user1 running a bittorrent client  If I "switch users" and log in  as user2 will my downloads continue?
[05:10] <brainsik> Psykovsky: oops,
[05:10] <washbear> how do i run an install script (USB driver) that expects /etc/rc.d/rc.local'  and then exist with the error msg: : No such file or directory?
[05:10] <brainsik> Psykovsky: sorry for being ignorant :-(
[05:10] <washbear> oops: how do i run an install script (USB driver) that expects /etc/rc.d/rc.local'  and then exits with the error msg: : No such file or directory?
[05:10] <jb0nd38372> I really didn't know guess the best thing to do is just find an external, back everything up, format, and reload, i've heard that ntfs support is , r can be buggy, when reading and writing to that type of partition
[05:11] <Psykovsky> brainsik: you should see my boss at work, that is ignorant.... you're not even close to it ;)
[05:11] <thoreauputic> washbear: sounds like a Red Hat thing
[05:11] <washbear> ys, it is a FC tested driver
[05:11] <yuv656> jb0nd38372: yes i think that's your safest bet, i wouldn't trust a buggy solution with my data either
[05:11] <TheGilmanator> Has anyone seen beryl cause menus to appear behind focused windows?
[05:11] <thoreauputic> washbear: why do you need it? There may be an Ubuntu equivalent
[05:12] <jb0nd38372> <yuv656> yeah.. well my data isn't "mission critical" just some mp3's and avi'
[05:12] <jb0nd38372> avi's
[05:12] <graham_100> other than airsnort are there any other programs work the same that my card will work on???
[05:12] <jb0nd38372> but none the less i'd rather not have it corrupted
[05:12] <XiXaQ> Need help with installing VMWare Server on Ubuntu Edgy. Any experience hanging around? :)
[05:13] <Zakir> XiXaq: I've done it a couple of times... what are you running into?
[05:13] <jb0nd38372> <XiXaQ> I installed vmware server using a great howto, for edgy... I'll see if I can round it up for you
[05:13] <weswh-> i have an Athlon 2500+, should i install ardour-gtk, or ardour-gtk-i686?
[05:13] <XiXaQ> Zakir, failed dependency:  /bin/sh is needed by VMware-server-1.0.1-29996.i386
[05:14] <XiXaQ> Zakir, jb0nd38372, I've been trying to install the rpm version.
[05:14] <DragonRomer`> hello
[05:14] <washbear> thoraeuputic - i need it for a driver which is only in testing yet for 2.6.19 - if there is an Ubuntu solution I'd be happy, but there seems be very little - apart from the vendor's own buggy driver (which thinks it is in a Fedora system), which has been cleaned up for 2.6.19 (or whenever))
[05:14] <brainsik> Psykovsky: btw, using those grep's for user/pass is definitely questionable, for the exit command it's not a big deal, but for user and password it'll accept "user" as well as "user    " (if i get this to work).
[05:15] <thoreauputic> washbear: is it an rpm? If so the alien utility might help
[05:15] <DragonRomer`> im trying to boot from the live cd thing, well i downloaded it and burnt it to a disc, but every time i try it just takes me to a command line thing, and i cant work out how to get past it?
[05:15] <jb0nd38372>  XiXaQ: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183209 this one is for the one downloaded directly from vmware... i'm not seasoned enough yet to help other than finding good links hhehe
[05:15] <jb0nd38372> I'm trying to learn though
[05:15] <Psykovsky> brainsik this is only to dull the eyes, the firewall will be set so only one IP could connect to this open port...
[05:15] <ianp> anyone run vmware on edgy?
[05:15] <ianp> vmware workstation
[05:15] <brainsik> Psykovsky: ah ;-)
[05:15] <ianp> i sure hope it works, i already installed :)
[05:15] <XiXaQ> jb0nd38372, thank you, it helps alot :)
[05:15] <Zakir> XiXaQ: the RPM worked great on RHEL for me... however, from my limited experience, rpm's don't install on debian or ubuntu.. you'll probably have to install it via a .deb... by converting it through alien.
[05:15] <will> Hey all
[05:16] <bruenig> !hi | will
[05:16] <ubotu> will: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[05:16] <will> How can I change my refresh rate?
[05:16] <existence> How can i refresh my grubs MBR?  I reinstalled windows and it got wiped :/.
[05:16] <Zakir> if you download the tar, there's an install script that you can run that will let you install it on ubuntu w/o any issues.
[05:16] <ianp> yeah, alien file, then dpkg -i result
[05:16] <xipietotec> IS anyone familiar with Moblock? (Peerguardian) ?
[05:16] <will> Outside of the 'screen resolution' settings.. which infact have no settings at all.. just 3 options that I cant use.
[05:16] <ianp> can't you put rpm on ubuntu ?
[05:16] <ianp> or only redhat?
[05:16] <washbear> thoraeuputic - no, there is no binary
[05:16] <xipietotec> ianp: It's not adviseable
[05:16] <supervisor> how install  driver  wireless  in distro ubuntu
[05:16] <washbear> ianp - you can with alien
[05:16] <ianp> xipietotec: well, good point :)
[05:16] <DragonRomer`> is anyone available to help me with a nooby question with ubuntu?
[05:16] <ianp> xipietotec: rpm is never advisable
[05:17] <washbear> !alien
[05:17] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[05:17] <will> !question
[05:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about question - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[05:17] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:17] <yoshig3> Can I talk now?
[05:17] <DragonRomer`> ok
[05:17] <will> yea thats it.

[05:17] <malt> if it has meta tag
[05:17] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: ask your question to find out
[05:17] <supervisor> thanks  i rewiev
[05:17] <will> Anyone know how to change refresh rate?
[05:17] <xipietotec> Is anyone familiar with MoBlock?
[05:17] <brainsik> Psykovsky: uhmm, what's not working? it looks like it's working to me
[05:17] <Zakir> the script for for vmware works very well -- I'd stick to that and not touch the rpm... it's probably not worth it since it was designed for RHEL (at least the vmware server.)
[05:18] <Psykovsky> brainsik: the login and pass works when you run it from console. run it via netcat and connect from other machine
[05:18] <brainsik> Psykovsky: i am
[05:18] <shin-jin> Tried installing Ubuntu 6.06 PPC on a Mac iBook G4 onto an external firewire drive -- the installer labeled the disk as a scsi disk, but couldn't proceed with the installation. Any ideas?
[05:18] <Psykovsky> hmm
[05:19] <DragonRomer`> i should probley mention this is the first time ive tried linux
[05:19] <thoreauputic> existence: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[05:19] <brainsik> Psykovsky: i'll double check i didn't change anything, i'm re-copying it
[05:20] <Psykovsky> brainsik maybe this is because I'm connecting from windows machine? I mean windows adds additional newline symbol to the end of the  string...
[05:20] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[05:20] <brainsik> Psykovsky: brb
[05:20] <saivert> Ubuntu 10.6 is nice. XDMC anyone?
=== driv[sleep]  is now known as drivera90
[05:21] <will> wait so I have to go through 190 steps
[05:21] <will> to change my refresh rate?1
[05:21] <DragonRomer`> im trying to boot from the live cd thing, well i downloaded it and burnt it to a disc, but every time i try it just takes me to a command line thing, and i cant work out how to get past it, can anyone help?
[05:21] <will> Someone tell me there is a 1 line command.
[05:21] <thoreauputic> will:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:21] <brainsik> Psykovsky: the \W* in the grep should suck all those up, regardless of whether it's windows or whatever. that's the point.
[05:22] <Psykovsky> then I'm lost... strange...
[05:22] <will> theCore,  u sure?
[05:22] <brainsik> Psykovsky: hmm
[05:22] <theCore> ?
[05:22] <will> thoreauputic,  are u sure?
[05:22] <will> thats just the blue screen isn't it?
[05:23] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: what does it say on the "command line thing", did you see the ubuntu cd's menu?
[05:23] <will> where you select which resolution to pick?
[05:23] <will> If I install XP will I be able to see the ubuntu folders and what not?
[05:23] <thoreauputic> will: *sigh* of course - just accept defaults, do the advanced part and enter your V and H rates from your monitor manual
[05:23] <DragonRomer`> no i didnt see any cds menue, and it just says on the thing "current optons" and says somet hings like /MLX, but if i try typign those it saqying invalid command, also no other commands that i tried from /help helped yuv656
[05:24] <will> thoreauputic, :Its for a tv. i just want the refresh rate to be 60hz
[05:24] <Psykovsky> brainsik when I run it direcly, I mean ./ then it goes OK... netcat is ruining it
[05:24] <thoreauputic> will: if you install XP install it first or you will have to jump through extra hoops
[05:24] <shin-jin> Tried installing Ubuntu 6.06 PPC on a Mac iBook G4 onto an external firewire drive -- the installer labeled the disk as a scsi disk, but couldn't proceed with the installation. Running live of the CD works fine and can open the  firewire drive. Any ideas?
[05:24] <thoreauputic> will: for a TV ?? Sorry, don't follow you
[05:24] <will> oh god.
[05:24] <will> not oh god to you
[05:24] <Zakir> will: probably not... windows cannot read ext2 or ext3 natively without a third party app.
[05:25] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: are you sure you booted correctly from the cd?
[05:25] <will> I just want to set ubuntu to a certain resolution. its amazingly difficult. I'm just not l33t enough clearly.
[05:25] <thoreauputic> will: if you install XP second, you will have to rescue your MBR
[05:25] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[05:25] <VMT2007> thoreauputic: it's not that hard.
[05:25] <tp_> i  unable to connect proftpd?
[05:25] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 well i think so,
[05:25] <will> thoreauputic, : oh well.. then I'm just going to backup the stuff.. I had fun with ubuntu
[05:25] <thoreauputic> VMT2007: I know
[05:25] <will> but its a bit too over my head still.
[05:26] <VMT2007> will: why are you making a downgrade?
[05:26] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 i burnt the whole cd to a bootable cd, then set my bios to boot from it
[05:26] <VMT2007> if you have an extra hard drive
[05:26] <thoreauputic> will: have you even tried  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
[05:26] <VMT2007> install XP on that
[05:26] <will> VMT2007, : because I have to go through 2395030593509830498309248 steps to do anything.
[05:26] <VMT2007> ... not really
[05:26] <will> This is for a machine just to run dvd's on my tv.
[05:26] <Psykovsky> brainsik: if you're connecting from unix like system, it should use correct line feeds, the router of our phone system uses unix connection format... so it should go OK, I hope...
[05:26] <will> well not dvd's but movie files
[05:27] <will> They played fine in XP. now all the files chug.. I figured it was a drivers thing.. but no
[05:27] <brainsik> Psykovsky: here, let me give you the debug code i was using to show you what is being sent
[05:27] <VMT2007> wait
[05:27] <will> I played them on this machine, in vlc.
[05:27] <will> in xp though
[05:27] <VMT2007> what video adapter?
[05:27] <will> an nvidia 6800gt
[05:27] <VMT2007> did you install the nvidia drivers
[05:27] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: ok, but i'm sorry i'm not fimiliar with your problem, if you boot you should see a menu with the ubuntu logo with options to start ubuntu etc
[05:27] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 also, it calls the command thing DR-DOS or something like that
[05:27] <will> Yes yes yes.
[05:27] <thoreauputic> !nvidia
[05:27] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:27] <tp_> how to install proftpd in the ubuntu?
[05:27] <VMT2007> did you configure them in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:27] <will> Yea, I can quote you that thing word for word.
[05:27] <will> VMT yes.
[05:28] <will> I've been in this chan for about 3 weeks now
[05:28] <Psykovsky> brainsik ok...
[05:28] <will> different name
[05:28] <will> but configuring this
[05:28] <VMT2007> will
[05:28] <will> Right now there is no advantage. Every time I come home. I have to try to configure ubuntu
[05:28] <VMT2007> if anyone told you linux is easy, they were wrong
[05:28] <VMT2007> but, once it's done, it's so worth it
[05:28] <will> VMT2007, : i didn't think it was easy. I work with fedora core @ work
[05:29] <brainsik> Psykovsky: basically, but the input through `od -a`: echo $user | od -a
[05:29] <VMT2007> hmm, have you tried another media player?
[05:29] <will> But I mean, come on. I just want to change a refresh rate. without having to reinstall my glx drivers because something broke.
[05:29] <will> Or changed.
[05:29] <VMT2007> I play videos just fine on my GeForce 5200
[05:29] <will> VMT2007, I get the nvidia splash screen
[05:29] <yoshig3> Alright guys I need some serious help.
[05:29] <will> it just seems laggy still
[05:29] <VMT2007> hmm
[05:29] <will> as if the drivers didn't do anything
[05:29] <shin-jin> VMT2007: Hmm, the Ubuntu books I browse at Barnes & Noble all say how wonderfully easy it is compared with those _other_ distros ... "Linux For The Rest Of Us"
[05:29] <VMT2007> what video driver are you using
[05:30] <yoshig3> I'm getting extremely crappy graphics performance
[05:30] <will> VMT2007, : I get pageflipping.
[05:30] <VMT2007> lol shin-jin
[05:30] <VMT2007> those books are written by people familiar with linux
[05:30] <will> With or without Vsync on /off
[05:30] <brainsik> Psykovsky: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36770/
[05:30] <will> VMT2007, : What do you mean by which 'graphics video driver?
[05:30] <VMT2007> will: Xv, Xshm, OpenGL, ?
[05:30] <brainsik> Psykovsky: as you can see, i am sending '\r\n' even though it's linux -> linux
[05:30] <yoshig3> Can someone help me wiht a graphics problem please?
[05:30] <will> VMT2007, : Where is that an option?
[05:30] <VMT2007> VLC, right?
[05:30] <brainsik> Psykovsky: i don't know for sure, but it makes me think it's part of the way telnet works
[05:30] <will> VMT2007, : id say OGL because all the screensavers work.
[05:31] <will> VMT2007, : oh, ive tried all of them
[05:31] <will> VMT2007, : OGL is slow as dirt
[05:31] <yoshig3> Can someone help me wiht a graphics problem please?
[05:31] <shin-jin> And speaking of which, Tried installing Ubuntu 6.06 PPC on a Mac iBook G4 onto an external firewire drive. Ran live from the CD; the installer labeled the external disk as a scsi disk, but couldn't proceed with the installation. Any ideas?
[05:31] <thoreauputic> !ask
[05:31] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:31] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 i just googled about the DRdos hting and it says its something wrong with my bios or something?
[05:31] <VMT2007> OGL works fine for me, dude
[05:31] <brainsik> Psykovsky: are you in Lithuania right now?
[05:31] <will> OGL is supposed to be fast too right? as far as playback
[05:31] <VMT2007> did you install the nvidia drivers from synaptic?
[05:32] <will> Yes
[05:32] <VMT2007> or from nvidia?
[05:32] <VMT2007> hmm
[05:32] <will> I tried both
[05:32] <yoshig3> I'm getting extremely crappy graphics performance on a GeForce4 MX 4000 PCI with the beta drivers, and I've tried all of the drivers except for 9X31.
[05:32] <VMT2007> same here, I don't have problems
[05:32] <VMT2007> do they play fine on your normal display
[05:32] <will> No
[05:32] <will> they are lagged.
[05:32] <yoshig3> Anyone have any ideas?
[05:32] <shin-jin> Short version: Want to install Ubuntu PPC 6.06 on an external FireWire drive off mu iBook G4. Runs fine from the live CD but won't install...
[05:32] <VMT2007> alright
[05:32] <VMT2007> go to the VLC settings
[05:32] <will> k/.
[05:32] <VMT2007> video, output modules
[05:32] <VMT2007> check advanced options at the bottom
[05:32] <will> k
[05:32] <Psykovsky> brainsik: yes I am
[05:32] <will> k.
[05:33] <VMT2007> tell me what's selected as your video output module
[05:33] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: i'm not sure
[05:33] <will> Default is now.
[05:33] <Psykovsky> brainsik: I'll copy what I get to private...
[05:33] <will> I had OGL selected.
[05:33] <VMT2007> select OpengL
[05:33] <Zakir> yoshig3, do the nvidia drivers through synaptic work tfor you or do none of the nvidia drivers work?
[05:33] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: have you actually stated your problem?
[05:33] <VMT2007> hmm
[05:33] <will> eh ok
[05:33] <yoshig3> thoreauputic: yes I have.
[05:33] <Psykovsky> brainsik: did you get it?
[05:33] <VMT2007> what are the videos encoded in?
[05:33] <brainsik> Psykovsky: sorta, that didn't come up too well :-(
[05:33] <VMT2007> I know VLC comes packed with codecs, but I'm just wondering
[05:33] <will> divx xvid.
[05:33] <yoshig3> Zakir: I installed the 9x29 drivers.,
[05:33] <Zakir> and those worked?
[05:34] <will> whatever dvd codecs there are.
[05:34] <will> the h.34 thing
[05:34] <brainsik> Psykovsky: better to use the paste bin, unfortunately, i know it's a pain
[05:34] <yoshig3> Zakir: They work, but everything is very laggy, as if I didnt' have a video card, but beryl works.
[05:34] <VMT2007> you said you've already tried all the output modules
[05:34] <VMT2007> and they ALL lagged?
[05:34] <yuv656> !pastebin
[05:34] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:34] <Zakir> yoshig3, if you run glxgears, does it run?
[05:34] <AngryElf> how can i prevent themes from changing the look of websites?
[05:34] <will> vt yes sir
[05:35] <will> VMT2007,  YES
[05:35] <VMT2007> wow
[05:35] <will> sorr caps
[05:35] <yoshig3> Zakir: Yeah it runs, but I only get about 1K fps without beryl running, and about 500 with beryl running.
[05:35] <VMT2007> it's alright
[05:35] <VMT2007> hmm.
[05:35] <VMT2007> well you clearly don't have outdated drivers
[05:35] <VMT2007> otherwise synaptic would be crying about it
[05:36] <will> yea so I dunno
[05:36] <will> Like when I select ogl
[05:36] <will> and play the file
[05:36] <VMT2007> it must be your x11 settings
[05:36] <will> it literally chokes.
[05:36] <will> and chugs
[05:36] <VMT2007> hmm
[05:36] <VMT2007> what are you playing them off of
[05:36] <VMT2007> your HD?
[05:36] <will> yes
[05:36] <VMT2007> did that video card perform fine with windows?
[05:37] <will> oh y ea
[05:37] <will> yea 100%
[05:37] <kelvie> How do I display the last few packages I installed?
[05:37] <kelvie> something broke my firefox :(
[05:37] <VMT2007> and do the "pretty" OGL screensavers work right?
[05:37] <Zakir> yoshig, what are the stats on that card?
[05:37] <will> VMT2007, : yea they are fast
[05:37] <VMT2007> well
[05:37] <will> like the tunnel one
[05:37] <xiambax> anyone ever have problems trying to connect to an airport in ubuntu?
[05:37] <will> the lil ant
[05:37] <VMT2007> what video players have you tried so far
[05:37] <garytran> how do i install rpm files on this os
[05:37] <yoshig3> Zakir: 128MB DDR, and I think it's around 4.7 Million polygons per sec
[05:37] <will> Vlc, mplayer.
[05:37] <Psykovsky> brainsik: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36771/
[05:38] <VMT2007> garytran: try looking for the same packages on synaptic first
[05:38] <will> VLC works fine for everything though
[05:38] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[05:38] <yoshig3> Zakir: Or something along those lines, I don't have the box anymore
[05:38] <Psykovsky> brainsik: first two is already set variables, and next goes what I've entered
[05:38] <Zakir> yoshig, doesn't sound like insufficient hardware though. :-)
[05:38] <will> VMT2007, : I appreciate the help man. But you just went through exactly what I've been going through since I installed ubuntu
[05:38] <brainsik> Psykovsky: wow, that's wack
[05:38] <Psykovsky> brainsik: bunch of unknown symbols
[05:38] <ThePub> kelvie: idk if you can find the "last few" packages you installed really.
[05:38] <VMT2007> hmm
=== garytran is now known as catsy
[05:38] <yoshig3> Zakir: That's what I'm saying
[05:38] <VMT2007> you say you're familiar with linux
[05:38] <yoshig3> Zakir: Everything ran great in windows
[05:38] <will> VMT2007, : Familiar? no. I work with it on a daily basis though.
[05:38] <Psykovsky> brainsik as for password I see that it goes OK, only user seems to be buggy
[05:38] <kelvie> ThePub: :/ is there a list of the ones I've installed, sorted by date?
[05:38] <catsy> how do i install RPM files on this os
[05:39] <jrib> !rpm | catsy
[05:39] <ubotu> catsy: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[05:39] <yoshig3> Zakir: I do wanna try one thing- installing the newest newest drivers, the 9x31 drivers. Know where I can get them?
[05:39] <will> VMT2007, : I just know there is no reason that after installing video drivers. that this shouldn't be working
[05:39] <brainsik> Psykovsky: hmm, i'm wondering if you are sending some sort of encoding info
[05:39] <will> im off to install xp
[05:39] <ThePub> kelvie: was checking the dpkg man page.  might be an apt tool or something though.  "dpkg -l" will give you a package though.
[05:39] <will> bbl
[05:39] <Zakir> yoshig: http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
[05:39] <yoshig3> later will
[05:39] <DragonRomer`> guys, im trying to boot from the ubuntu live disk but it keeps taking me into DRDOS
[05:39] <ThePub> kelvie: what did you install?
[05:39] <yoshig3> I might follow your lead later
[05:39] <VMT2007> well, he's given up :P
[05:39] <kelvie> ThePub: The thing is I don't remember
[05:40] <VMT2007> catsy: what package are you trying to install
[05:40] <ThePub> kelvie: you don't remember what package you chose to install?
[05:40] <kelvie> ThePub: I just configured SKIM.. it's the last thing I was doing before firefox started segfaulting
[05:40] <yoshig3> VMT2007: Ubuntu has extreme graphical problems =\
[05:40] <kelvie> Either way, something makes my firefox segfault :/
[05:40] <ThePub> kelvie: skim or scim?
[05:40] <yoshig3> VMT2007: Other than that it's great
[05:40] <VMT2007> yoshig3: what's wrong
[05:40] <kelvie> ThePub: skim
[05:40] <brainsik> Psykovsky: oh, hmm..
[05:40] <brainsik> Psykovsky: i have this weird memory that windows sends extra information when you telnet
[05:40] <kelvie> ThePub: I closed it..and firefox still seg's, so I have no clue
[05:40] <yoshig3> VMT2007: Extremely slow graphical performance, but I'm going to try the latest drivers first. I have the 9x29 drivers, I'm going to try the 9x31 drivers.
[05:41] <tonyyarusso> Can XSane scan directly to PDF, or do I need to do something stupid like import to OOo first?
[05:41] <kelvie> I don't think this firefox is compiled with -DDEBUG so I can't gdb it :/
[05:41] <Psykovsky> brainsik well I connect via PuttyTel, it's Putty made for telnet :)
[05:41] <DragonRomer`> guys im trying to boot fromt eh Ubuntu live cd, but it keeps taking me to a DRDOS menue, can anyone help?
[05:41] <yoshig3> VMT2007: When I try to scroll on any program or webpage, it's extremely laggy, unless I use the mousewheel. Even then, it's laggy.
[05:41] <ThePub> kelvie: well if skim was the last thing you installed, if you run "apt-cache depends skim" it'll give you a list of the depndencies (packages) that were installed with it.
[05:41] <kelvie> ThePub: Naw, skim comes with kubuntu-desktop
[05:41] <kelvie> and I installed that AGES ago
[05:42] <kelvie> I don't think it's skim
[05:42] <brainsik> Psykovsky: what i would try is to clear the input buffer before querying the user for the loing
[05:42] <jrib> kelvie: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingFirefox  you need firefox-dbg for symbols
[05:42] <kelvie> Hrm ldd /opt/firefox/firefox-bin shows some broken linking :/
[05:42] <brainsik> Psykovsky: s/loing/login/
[05:42] <yoshig3> Zakir: What drivers should I use? The i32?
[05:42] <VMT2007> yoshig3: wow, that's bad
[05:42] <VMT2007> hmm.
[05:42] <xiambax> Does anyone connect to an AIRPORT from their ubuntu desktop?
[05:42] <VMT2007> xiambax: apple airport?
[05:42] <kelvie> but taht shouldn't cause segfaults :O
[05:43] <xiambax> VMT2007, yes
[05:43] <kitche> DragonRomer`: hmm what does the menu show?
[05:43] <ThePub> kelvie: I think he's saying that with that it would allow you to debug it, like you indicated you could be able to do :)
[05:43] <kelvie> ThePub: Yeah.. I was just thinking out loud  :x
[05:44] <DragonRomer`> kitche it shows some commands like /mlx but they dont do anything, and shows my drive as A:\ even though i have no drive a
[05:44] <ThePub> kelvie
[05:44] <kitche> DragonRomer`: ok where did you get this cd from and what cd is it dekstop or alternate?
[05:44] <ThePub> kelvie: take a look at /var/log/dpkg.log
[05:44] <Psykovsky> brainsik: erm... I tested it with windows native telnet program.... and it works... seems this problem is Putty one...
[05:44] <DragonRomer`> kitche i downloaded it fromt he ubuntu website
[05:45] <DragonRomer`> kitche and then burntt it to disk
[05:45] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: Ubuntu CDs don't have DRDOS on them :D
[05:45] <ThePub> kelvie: that's a log of the actions taken by dpkg, and would include installation of packages arranged by date.
[05:45] <kelvie> ThePub: yeah
[05:45] <kelvie> it says mdadm :x
[05:45] <brainsik> Psykovsky: interesting, i'm trying to find out what extra info putty sends first
[05:45] <gotit> how do i setup my console screen size , its perfect in desktop mode
[05:45] <DragonRomer`> kitche well... somethings making drdos come up,a nd i cant get into ubuntu because of it
[05:45] <Psykovsky> I think it's somthing with the encoding...
[05:46] <kelvie> I don't even use RAID...
[05:46] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: BIOS set to boot from CD ?
[05:46] <brainsik> Psykovsky: that sounds definitely possible
[05:46] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic yes
[05:46] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: md5sum of CD is OK ?
[05:46] <Psykovsky> brainsik putty lets you choose encoding, I connected with default one, but seems that it has something bad in it...
[05:46] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic i havnt checked that, but it shows my drive as A:\ even thoguht my hdd is c and cd is D
[05:46] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic in drdos that is
[05:47] <ThePub> kelvie: "apt-cache rdepends mdadm" maybe? :)
[05:47] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: none of that is remotely related to linux or ubuntu
[05:47] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic how do i get rid of it then?
[05:47] <kelvie> ThePub: hrm.. mindi and lvm -- doubtful ..
[05:47] <sorroww> is there  away to lower the brightness on my laptop screen?
[05:47] <cablesm102> I have a problem. GNOME doesn't detect my laptop's lid, but KDE does. Any ideas?
[05:47] <kitche> DragonRomer`: reburn the cd
[05:48] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: no idea ;) have you previously installed DR-DOS ?
[05:48] <DragonRomer`> kitche ive tried that
[05:48] <ThePub> kelvie: *shrug*  dunno what you installed or why there's an issue, but you have the tools to track it down now if all you want to find is the package :)
[05:48] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic err, i never isntalled it int he first place
[05:48] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: are you sure you have the right CD ?
[05:48] <kelvie> ThePub: something broke my firefox.. and I'm trying to find out what it is :/
[05:48] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic i think so, i downloaded it from the ubuntu website
[05:48] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: this isn't magic you know ;-)
[05:48] <gotit> ctrl+alt+f1 to f6 are these all different console or just another clone
[05:48] <kelvie> ThePub: I thought it was a package I installed, but this seems less likely now
[05:48] <brainsik> Psykovsky: this might be it: PuTTY can use two different strategies for negotiation: In active mode, PuTTY starts to send negotiations as soon as the connection is opened.
[05:48] <ThePub> kelvie: what about a simple reinstall?
[05:49] <kelvie> ThePub: of firefox?
[05:49] <ThePub> sure, why not? :)
[05:49] <kelvie> it tries to remove ubuntu-desktop when I remove it, is that safe? :o
[05:49] <kitche> DragonRomer`: what is did you download?
[05:49] <quux> Hmm... is there no 'apropos' package for ubuntu?
[05:49] <DragonRomer`> kitche pardon?
[05:50] <thoreauputic> quux: it isn't a package, it's a command e.g. apropos synaptic  etc
[05:50] <ThePub> kelvie: ubuntu-desktop is a placeholder package.  if you do a "apt-get autoremove" after removing it your whole desktop *will* go.  although, reinstalling it will also reinstall all the dependencies, recursively.
[05:50] <quux> yeah. And I've just discovered it's part of the 'man' package (I'm dealing with an *extremely* minimal dapper here)
[05:50] <thoreauputic> quux: part  of the man-db package
[05:50] <kelvie> ThePub: ah
[05:50] <kitche> DragonRomer`: what .iso did you download from the ubuntu website
[05:50] <quux> thaks thoreauputic
[05:50] <DragonRomer`> kitche i downloaded it from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#currentrelease
[05:51] <cratel> what is the name of the package which includes the microsoft fonts for oo?
[05:51] <DragonRomer`> kitche and it wasnt an iso
[05:51] <kelvie> ThePub: thanks :p haven't really read up on apt; new to ubuntu
[05:51] <yoshig3> Which nvidia drivers should I use? i32?
[05:51] <yoshig3> for a 32bit processor
[05:51] <yuv656> http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/redhat-fedora-linux-help/45822-booting-cd-dr-dos.html DragonRomer` that's your problem right?
[05:51] <jkimball4> is there any possible way to have totem-xine and totem-gstreamer installed simultaneously
[05:51] <jrib> cratel: msttcorefonts ?
[05:51] <kitche> DragonRomer`: then what did you download? if it was an iso
[05:51] <thoreauputic> jkimball4: no
[05:51] <yoshig3> From this page, what drivers should I use? http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
[05:52] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 yes thats my problem
[05:52] <DragonRomer`> kitche it was a zip
[05:52] <ThePub> kelvie:
[05:52] <nowimproved> does anyone know this font http://www.lynucs.org/index.php?screen_type=1&screen_id=24463640144a4cc1dc1e6b&m=screen
[05:52] <SilentDis> hilow :)
[05:52] <lupine_85> yoshig3: you don't really want to install them using the .run files
[05:52] <ThePub> kelvie: don't be afraid to play with it.  apt is a fairly solid system.  :)
[05:52] <thoreauputic> jkimball4: different backends for totem - you choose ( the xine backend usually works better IMO )
[05:52] <kelvie> sigh -- I shouldn't be messing with all this during exams
[05:52] <lupine_85> it's a pain to get them uninstalled if you need too
[05:52] <kitche> DragonRomer`: then you downloaded the wrong thing
[05:52] <lupine_85> what version are you after?
[05:52] <cratel> jrib: yes I think that's it. Thanks.
[05:52] <Psykovsky> brainsik one more problem... how can I add permissions to user to use mysql in console?
[05:52] <yoshig3> lupine_85: how to install them then?
[05:53] <lupine_85> what version and architecture are you after?
[05:53] <Psykovsky> when I run my code from console it goes ok, via netcat it started to swear...
[05:53] <yoshig3> lupine_85: The newest, and 32bit.
[05:53] <sorroww> so how do i lower my brightness?
[05:53] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: you didn't download the wrong thing, i've seen this problem before
[05:53] <SilentDis> nowimproved:  no idea what font that is, sorry
[05:53] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 ah, is their a way to fix it?
[05:53] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: with a windows xp cd
[05:53] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: i'm looking for a solution now
[05:53] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 ok
[05:54] <SilentDis> sorroww:  i am trying... very very hard... to refrain comment on that one...
[05:54] <lupine_85> the newest is 9742... see http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ for instructions
[05:54] <kelvie> cd
[05:54] <thoreauputic> yuv656: how on earth can you get DR-DOS with an official Ubuntu CD ?
[05:54] <AngryElf> what's a good Visual Studio replacement?
[05:54] <brainsik> Psykovsky: i don't know a lot about MySQL, here are a couple of notes about granting privileges: http://wiki.brainsik.to/MySQL_Notes
[05:54] <lupine_85> AngryElf: I use KDevelop :)
[05:54] <lupine_85> other people use Eclipse
[05:54] <kitche> yuv656: DragonRomer` said he downloaded a zip file but all the install images are in .iso format on the mirrors
[05:54] <sorroww> well its not like i have any dials.. and the buttons arent working. so i was wondering if there was another way
[05:54] <uMISTA> i need to use ./configure but with gcc 3.3. ive tryed to make it run under it but it keeps going back to 4.x is there a way to get rid of 4 adn use 3.4 from now on
[05:54] <brainsik> Psykovsky: those usually help me do the right thing :-)
[05:54] <ThePub> hmm, am I missing something with epiphany..  is there not a way to force everything to open in new tabs?
[05:55] <karthik> guys ... help me.. i am admin for my linux...but how to be a root owner also... becoz i cannot edit the files under root...
[05:55] <DragonRomer`> kitche oh no! it was a iso but i didnt realise and unextracted it >.<
[05:55] <lupine_85> uMISTA: CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.3 ./configure ?
[05:55] <lupine_85> if not... just symlink gcc to gcc-3.3 for a short period of time :)
[05:55] <karthik> guys ... help me.. i am admin for my linux...but how to be a root owner also... becoz i cannot edit the files under root...
[05:55] <thoreauputic> !root|karthik
[05:55] <ubotu> karthik: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:55] <kitche> DragonRomer`: well that's your problem then probably you were suppose to burn the iso as an image
[05:55] <AngryElf> lupine_85, edgy packages only :(
[05:55] <ThePub> karthik: sudo :)
[05:55] <lupine_85> AngryElf: yeah
[05:55] <yoshig3> lupine_85: Not so greatest?!
[05:55] <jkimball4> thanks thoreauputic
[05:55] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: you didn't burn it correctly
[05:56] <lupine_85> indeed
[05:56] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 kitche yes, my bad, sorry guys
[05:56] <gotit> does ubuntu support oracle sql server
[05:56] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: check out this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=268876
[05:56] <uMISTA> how do o symlink gcc to gcc-3.3?
[05:56] <lupine_85> after you've had your first Xid (if you do - lots of people don't), you'll understant
[05:56] <lupine_85> understand*
[05:56] <kelvie> ThePub: yay I fixed it... no more konqueror for me :o
[05:56] <AngryElf> lupine_85, alternatives?
[05:56] <kelvie> ThePub: the firefox in /opt was broken, but the one in /usr/lib was fine
[05:56] <kelvie> so I symlinked it
[05:56] <kelvie> to /usr/bin/firefox
[05:56] <gotit> does ubuntu support oracle sql server
[05:56] <lupine_85> uMISTA: sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc~; ln  -s /usr/bin/gcc-3.3 /usr/bin/gcc
[05:56] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 kitche ma n cant believe i wasted your time over a stupid mistake i made
[05:56] <karthik> yeah...i know that but i dont want to use command-line....i want permission to get added to my user
[05:57] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 kitche im so sorry :(
[05:57] <ThePub> kelvie: O.o  not happy installing the firefox in the apt repository?
[05:57] <kitche> gotit: not officially if that's what you meant
[05:57] <kelvie> ThePub: I wanted 2.0 :o
[05:57] <lupine_85> AngryElf: there aren't any repos like this for dapper AFAIK :/
[05:57] <ThePub> kelvie: 2.0 is part of edgy
[05:57] <lupine_85> oops... add another sudo to that ln
[05:57] <kelvie> ThePub: I realize this now :x
[05:57] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: no problem, burn that cd correctly to check out linux, don't give up, it's worth it :)
[05:57] <kitche> kelvie: it's also in dapper-backports
[05:57] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[05:57] <ThePub> karthik: so when you browse to the location choose "edit as administrator"
[05:57] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 ok :)
[05:57] <kelvie> heh :p
[05:57] <gotit> hm, can it be installed and tested on it
[05:57] <kelvie> kitche: what is backports? :o
[05:58] <cratel> what package is the font "courier new" in?
[05:58] <kelvie> I do use edgy now btw
[05:58] <karthik> ThePub...tell me clearly...i m newbie
[05:58] <kitche> kelvie: it's updated packages for dapper they just made them work with dapper from edgy
[05:58] <kelvie> kitche: ah
[05:58] <cablesm102> karthik, put sudo before the command you wish to run as root
[05:58] <vanberge> would anybody be able to tell me - does easyubuntu work on 6.10 ?  :-)  thanks in advance
[05:58] <cablesm102> karthik, it will then ask for your password, and run the command as root
[05:58] <kitche> !easyubuntu|vanberge
[05:58] <ubotu> vanberge: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[05:59] <ThePub> karthik: idk how clearer I can be...  O/o  use konq/nautilus to go to the location that holds your file, right-click and click "edit as administrator"...
[05:59] <cablesm102> karthik, you can start GUI programs like this: "sudo firefox" for example.
[05:59] <thoreauputic> vanberge: preferably, don't use easy ubuntu - use the wiki on restricted formats
[05:59] <karthik> oh..ok
[05:59] <cablesm102> ThePub, that isn't there by default
[05:59] <vanberge> thoreauputic, tyvm...
[05:59] <gotit> how do i tell ubuntu to search for plug and play devices from terminal
[05:59] <thoreauputic> !restricted | vanberge

[05:59] <uMISTA> when i enter sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc~; ln  -s /usr/bin/gcc-3.3 /usr/bin/gcc i get a permission denied
[05:59] <belfegor> hello
[05:59] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[05:59] <ThePub> cablesm102: oh, it isn't?  oops.. how'd I add it then?  I hate misinformation O.o
[05:59] <belfegor> how can i instal bet365 poker on ubuntu?
[06:00] <kitche> uMISTA: you forgot the second sudo
[06:00] <cablesm102> ThePub, I installed a script in Nautilus to get that.
[06:00] <belfegor> can i instal it?
[06:01] <karthik> ThePub.....i cannot  find "edit as administartor"
[06:01] <lardarse> question: is there any way of determining the exit status of a program that has just run ?
[06:01] <cablesm102> karthik, he was incorrect about that command
[06:01] <kitche>  /quit
[06:01] <kitche> bah stupid space
[06:01] <lardarse> heh
[06:02] <karthik> i want permissions to get added to my user.....i dont wanna use sudo.......
[06:02] <uMISTA> so wheres the second sudo go?
[06:02] <cablesm102> karthik, open a command prompt, and put in "gksudo gedit FILENAME" (except obviously replacing FILENAME with the path of the file you want to edit)
[06:02] <ThePub> cablesm102: well, no.. clearly not since I have it and have a fairly stock installation :)
[06:02] <cablesm102> ThePub, I can't find it, and neither can karthik
[06:02] <karthik> ok
[06:02] <n30n> karthik: sudo -s?
[06:02] <ThePub> I know what has it.  KDE :)
[06:02] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[06:03] <cablesm102> karthik, you can't add permissions to your account. It will ask you for a password whenever you want to do anything as an administrator. To have it otherwise would be a huge security risk.
[06:03] <karthik> ok
[06:03] <cablesm102> karthik, that was one of the biggest flaws in windows.
[06:03] <belfegor> so can u tell me please?what sould i do with bet365?is working on ubuntu?
[06:03] <karthik> i accept that
[06:04] <cablesm102> karthik, you can install a script to add "edit as root" to your right-click menu
[06:04] <cablesm102> not sure how i did it though
[06:04] <ThePub> karthik: KDE has the command, and since you're here you're using Gnome (like me actually).  My applogies, too much flipping around GUIs recently.  Get confused :)
[06:04] <cablesm102> I'll try to dig up the instructions
[06:04] <MrFoobar> does anyone know when a .deb package for Java 1.6 is going to be released?
[06:04] <n30n> cablesm102: In my opinion windows itself was the flaw
[06:05] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 i burnt it correctley but it still goes to DRDOS
[06:05] <lupine_85> uMISTA: before ln
[06:05] <catsy> how do u compile your own kernel
[06:05] <karthik> but how to write a script for that n add to ur menu......i m a new-bie
[06:05] <cablesm102> DragonRomer, are you trying to boot from a CD?
[06:05] <DragonRomer`> cablesm102 yes
[06:05] <cablesm102> karthik, I'm finding it
[06:05] <lupine_85> but after ;
[06:05] <cablesm102> DragonRomer, check your BIOS settings to see the boot order.
[06:06] <DragonRomer`> cablesm102 the boot order is correct, the cdrom is the only thing booting
[06:06] <lupine_85> uMISTA: to get back to the original... sudo rm /usr/bin/gcc; sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc~ /usr/bin/gcc
[06:06] <cablesm102> oohhhh. So nothing else is working, JUST the CD?
[06:06] <VMT2007> !kernel
[06:06] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[06:06] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: how did you burn it this time?
[06:06] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 i burnt the iso into a bootable disc in nero express
[06:06] <ThePub> cablesm102: you can easily create such a command using nautilus actions btw.
[06:07] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: you need to burn as an image ( a literal image)
[06:07] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: did you burn the iso file to the cd, or did you burn it as an image?
[06:07] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic oh.... grr im using so many cds lol
[06:07] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: in nero, there should be an option Burn image to disc
[06:07] <cablesm102> karthik, you need to first go to the folder ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
[06:07] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: the DRDoS thing is perhaps nero's way of making the cd bootable ( guessing)
[06:07] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 yeh i just burnt it onto a bootable disc, ill go try as an image now
[06:07] <karthik> wait..
[06:07] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: you don't need that - just a pure image
[06:07] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: you don't have to go to bootable disc, if you burn the image it will be bootable
[06:08] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic ok, thanks
[06:08] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: the boot code is in the CD image
[06:08] <DragonRomer`> yuv656thanks :)
[06:08] <thoreauputic> built in :)
[06:08] <uMISTA> so i tryed to make a the symlink but i get symlink but i get this error! mv: cannot stat `/usr/bin/gcc': No such file or directory

[06:08] <cablesm102> DragonRomer, are you sure you burned it as an image and not as a file?
[06:08] <missing> hello people!!
[06:09] <karthik> how can i go to that folder
[06:09] <karthik> its not found
[06:09] <thoreauputic> cablesm102: he didn't - he tried to make it a bootable CD ( not the right choice)
[06:09] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[06:09] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic problem, when i try to burn it using nero it tells me its the wrong type of disc now, it wants a cd not a dvd?
[06:09] <ThePub> isn't the cd already bootable?  just burn the raw iso to the disk and be done with it, isn't it?
[06:09] <missing> cablesm102: burn your image with imgburn
[06:09] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: hang on a minute - I 'll try to find a link for an ISO burner for you
[06:09] <cablesm102> missing, I'm not having the problem.
[06:10] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic ok thanks

[06:10] <missing> good
[06:10] <yuv656> minerale_: truecrypt-4.2a-build.tar.gz ?

[06:10] <cablesm102> karthik, I've got a script you can use to edit something as administrator easily
[06:11] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: I don't use windows, but that should do it

[06:11] <karthik> yes i m there cable
[06:11] <Cyber_Stalker> what programming language would u guys suggest i learn
[06:11] <missing> vanberge: its really easy
[06:11] <karthik> tell me the steps
[06:12] <missing> vanberge: let me walk you along
[06:12] <Cyber_Stalker> i know some java but im bored of it :/

[06:12] <yuv656> minerale_: ok hang on
[06:12] <cablesm102> karthik, go to the private chat
[06:12] <Cyber_Stalker> i could use it to create an irc bot ?
[06:12] <missing> its no problem
[06:12] <vanberge> missing, pretty familiar.  used off/on for a few years now
[06:12] <Cyber_Stalker> :P
[06:12] <missing> kewl
[06:12] <rapid> Cyber_Stalker, perl, bash, php, c
[06:12] <rapid> lol
[06:12] <MrFoobar> I would suggest python if you're not too hardcore into programming, C/C++ otherwise
[06:12] <missing> so u wanna write to the drive right?
[06:12] <ThePub> Cyber_Stalker: C is the basis of any low-level programming.  it's pretty much the model of most "c like" languages.  C/C++ are the core of most programming projects.
[06:13] <vanberge> missing, not necessarily... want to copy all my files off of there.  read acces is fine
[06:13] <Cyber_Stalker> ok ThePub but does it have a good range of functions?
[06:13] <missing> if u wanna write there is a ntfs-3g driver u can install
[06:13] <ThePub> Cyber_Stalker: If you want to learn a fun language, check out Groovy.  All the power of Python, Perl and Ruby wrapped onto the JVM :)
[06:13] <Cyber_Stalker> easy to use, portable
[06:13] <missing> do u have sata or atapi drives
[06:13] <kuto> how do i recover my grub install if i reinstall windows in my boot partition?
[06:13] <vanberge> atapi
[06:14] <kuto> anyone pls
[06:14] <vanberge> kuto, you want grub to go away?
[06:14] <missing> kuto: look up wingrub
[06:14] <ThePub> kuto: boot using the live cd and re-run grub from the installed linux partition and choose to install it
[06:14] <missing> kuto: its really easy u can boot linux from microsofts boot loader
[06:14] <missing> okay well atapi
[06:15] <vanberge> 10.4
[06:15] <kuto> vanberge: no i have windows and ubuntu installed in a single HDD and there is something wrong with my windows install right now. how doi reinstall grub
[06:15] <missing> 1st u need to find out what partition it is
[06:15] <missing> the way u do that is with fdisk
[06:15] <ThePub> kuto: you would also probably need to add a boot entry to /boot/grub/menu.lst for your windows partition.
[06:15] <yuv656> minerale_: uploading..
[06:15] <vanberge> fdisk -l ? missing
[06:15] <kuto> ThePub: do i need to mount my linux partition chroot to it and run grub?
[06:16] <vanberge> missing, got it... /dev/hdb1
[06:16] <ThePub> kuto: man grub, useful :)
[06:16] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic hmm that still dosnt want to use my dvd
[06:16] <missing> can  we go private im sorry
[06:16] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic this is rediculous, how can i not burn an image to a dvd?
[06:16] <arrenlex> kuto: If I understand your problem correctly, you need to mount your system, chroot into it, mount /proc, and then grub-install.
[06:16] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: are you burning a DVD? Apparently doing that on windows is problematic?
[06:17] <missing> can we go private?
[06:17] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: ie. as an iso
[06:17] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: don't you have a cd that you can burn it to?
[06:17] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: on linux it's trivial...
[06:17] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 no i dont
[06:17] <missing> okay now go edit your /etc/fstab under root
[06:17] <DragonRomer`> yuv656 i dont have a floppy drive either
[06:17] <vanberge> missing,  yeah sure
[06:17] <missing> okay
[06:18] <missing> its better for me i have kids going crazy here
[06:18] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: you would be better to use a CD ISO to install - then you can burn the full DVD if you wish from linux
[06:18] <vanberge> lol... no prob
[06:18] <yuv656> minerale_/minerale: http://www.chweb.net/downloads/truecrypt-4.2a-build.tar.gz
[06:18] <VMT2007> hi guyz how do i compil gentoo.
[06:18] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic i dont have a cd
[06:18] <VMT2007> and bored.
[06:18] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: it seems that windows burning apps are crippled in this respect... ( I don't know)
[06:18] <minerale> thank you very much, yuv656
[06:19] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: you mean you don't have a blank  Cd to burn to?
[06:19] <friedtofu> ok -.- question: i have shared folders, every time i try to DELETE the shared folders from the "System > Administration > Shared Folders" they refresh... why? -.- ....
[06:19] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic no i dont
[06:19] <amal029> I wanted to know why ubuntu live CD requires 256MB of ram to boot
[06:19] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: is your download a CD image or a DVD image?
[06:19] <friedtofu> amal029: i believe its the graphics, and they also store some files onto the RAM
[06:20] <friedtofu> *temporarily use RAM as diskspace
[06:20] <amal029> it becomes too much since I could not load Ubuntu on a whole lot of my computers
[06:20] <minerale> amal029: it has to use half of that memory as a `fake` hard drive
[06:20] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic err its an iso
[06:20] <mindflow> Hi. Anybody here who can help a linux noob fix a broken dependency?
[06:20] <n30n> friedtofu: Are they located on the system you used to delete them? Or a remote one
[06:21] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: if it's a CD ~700MB then go get yourself some cheap CD R blanks
[06:21] <amal029> I switched to simply MEPIS it has the same graphics as ubuntu but only needs 64MB of ram
[06:21] <arrenlex> mindflow: Could you be more specific? Are you getting an error message? What program? What package? Are you installing from source?
[06:21] <friedtofu> n30n: yeah, i'm on the system i used to delete it: it keeps refreshing after i delete it
[06:21] <friedtofu> *as in, delete, exit, go back to window, and its back there again!
[06:21] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic how much do they cost?
[06:21] <friedtofu> amal029: i think they have ubuntu less graphic intense on their main site?...
[06:22] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: you can get a stack of them for about $10 even in a post office ( i see you are in Oz)
[06:22] <ubox> hey all
[06:22] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic aside frome being slightley scared that you knew im from aus, thanks
[06:22] <n30n> friedtofu: How are you going about trying to delete them.
[06:22] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: Forestville?
[06:22] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: it's in your /whois ")
[06:22] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`:  /whois DragonRomer`

[06:23] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic ah lol
[06:23] <n30n> friedtofu: You should do it from the terminal so it will give you error output
[06:23] <vanberge> missing i think i pm'ed u... not sure.  :-P
[06:23] <thoreauputic> :D
[06:23] <ValMarko> When using a usb modem are there more chances to intrusions ot virus?
[06:23] <friedtofu> n30n: i'm still a newb... guide me, haha - commands?
[06:23] <lubix> Valmarko. that is absurd
[06:23] <n30n> friedtofu: Is it a folder or a file
[06:23] <friedtofu> folder
[06:24] <lupine_85> ValMarko: not really. You're more likely to be exploited though, although ubuntu is pretty good against that sort of thing
[06:24] <DragonRomer`> oh well thanks for your help guys, ill go buy a disk
[06:24] <missing> did u get it ?
[06:24] <DragonRomer`> i hope it works this time :(
[06:24] <lupine_85> if you're using a USB modem, I'd suggest running a firewall (like iptables - GUI frontend firestarter) just to be safwe
[06:24] <lupine_85> safe*
[06:24] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: use the burner I linked for you
[06:25] <vanberge> missing, i think so... if you mean /dev/hdb1 then yes
[06:25] <DragonRomer`> thoreauputic yep
[06:25] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: should work fine
[06:25] <ValMarko> That means that even I'm using usb port for comunications I have no reasons to be worried?
[06:25] <friedtofu> n30n: i'm trying to remove a folder i shared... and it doesnt delete from the "System > Administration > Shared Folders" menu....
[06:25] <missing> kewll
[06:25] <yuv656> DragonRomer`: you could always order some cds from shipit ;-p
[06:25] <missing> but u need to add a folder to the /media
[06:25] <thoreauputic> DragonRomer`: once you have Ububntu installed iso burning will be a breeze - just right click the ISO and hit burn :)
[06:26] <missing> so u can mount windows there
[06:26] <ValMarko> tanks
[06:26] <thoreauputic> gah Ubuntu ( /me can't type)
[06:26] <vanberge> ok.  just create an empty folder in root then?
[06:26] <n30n> friedtofu: ohhhhh go to properties of the folder you are trying to delete
[06:27] <n30n> friedtofu: somewhere in there it should give you the file location/source
[06:27] <missing> so for example if your mount point is /media/windows
[06:27] <missing> yes
[06:27] <vanberge> missing, i created /ntfs
[06:27] <missing> kewl
[06:27] <missing> okay
[06:27] <missing> now we need to edit the /etc/fstab with sudo
[06:28] <missing> and put this at the end of you fstab
[06:28] <friedtofu> n30n: oh, i'm just trying to remove it from being Shared.... not deleting the whole thing
[06:28] <n30n> friedtofu: indeed.
[06:28] <mindflow> Can anybody help me resolve this error: The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[06:28] <mindflow>   libfontconfig1: Depends: fontconfig-config (= 2.3.2-7ubuntu2) but 2.4.2-1 is installed ?
[06:28] <n30n> friedtofu: it's a learning experience, my friend.
[06:28] <friedtofu> n30n: haha, yeah ... i was just trying to share between two computers...
[06:28] <lupine_85> mindflow: where it has = it means it "muist" have that version installed
[06:29] <n30n> friedtofu: did it not work out?
[06:29] <missing> /dev/hdb1 /media/ntfs ntfs nls=utf8,umask=0222 0 0
[06:29] <lupine_85> so you can override it if you like with --force-deps (bad idea), or you can install the requested version with sudo apt-get install fontconfig-config=2.3.2-7ubuntu2
[06:29] <mindflow> lupine: I can understand that but I don't want to downgrade my own system. God knows what happend
[06:29] <missing> add this to you fstab
[06:29] <missing> /dev/hdb1 /media/ntfs ntfs nls=utf8,umask=0222 0 0
[06:29] <_goofy_> how do i edit what options a
[06:29] <n30n> friedtofu: sometimes windows and linux don't like to share with eachother at first
[06:30] <missing> then after u do that run this command as root
[06:30] <missing> mount -as
[06:30] <missing> mount -a
[06:30] <mindflow> lupine: Can I have several versions in paralel?
[06:30] <friedtofu> n30n: i was trying to share linux with linux o.O
[06:30] <vanberge> i'd rather do the command... i only need to do it once!  :-)
[06:30] <uMISTA> is there QEMU chat rooms?
[06:30] <lupine_85> mindflow: probably not
[06:30] <missing> ohh
[06:30] <snax> can someone remind me how you set up a dpkg file redirect so that a file from a package gets installed somewhere else/with a different name (usually so you can write your own wrapper script to use the redirected copy)
[06:30] <friedtofu> n30n: well its sharing now... but i needa know how to remove the shared folders afterwards.... :/
[06:30] <Jiraiya> Y a un francais svp

[06:31] <n30n> friedtofu: find the physical location of the file, not the vertial veron of it in the shared folders manager
[06:31] <mindflow> lupine: The trouble started when I tried to install a debian package in ubuntu. Can I somehow undo that without reinstalling my whole system?
[06:31] <Jiraiya> y a un gros probeme
[06:31] <missing> sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/ntfs/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222
[06:31] <Jiraiya> je sais
[06:31] <missing> its that command there
[06:31] <cablesm102> mindflow, just uninstall the package through synaptic.
[06:31] <nzhomie> yeah
[06:31] <ubox> is thr a way to increase adsl bandwdith?
[06:32] <missing> in BSD its a little diferent
[06:32] <missing> but thats the linux command
[06:32] <arrenlex> Jiraiya: Non, je ne parle pas francais, pardonnez-moi :( Je ne peux pas t'aide. Allez a #ubuntu-fr pour les hommes qui parle francais, svp.

[06:32] <mindflow> cable: Will that not break my system further?
[06:32] <nzhomie> talk to your isp about adsl bandwith
[06:32] <vanberge> missing, so, "mount -a /dev/hdb1 /ntfs"
[06:32] <missing> no
[06:32] <missing> sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/ntfs/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222
[06:32] <nzhomie> no it will just un install the app that you installed
[06:32] <nzhomie> uninstall *
[06:32] <ubox> no i mean from my place
[06:32] <mindflow> ok, I will give it a try
[06:32] <missing> venberge: sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/ntfs/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222
[06:33] <nzhomie> ubox : i think you can only get more bandwith if you talk to your isp
[06:34] <ubox> oh ok
[06:34] <_goofy_> how do i edit what options are shown after the quit applit is clicked?
[06:34] <SilentDis> nzhomie:  if all your neighbors had wi-fi, and you setup a box with a bunch of wifi cards, and then aggrigated them... ;)
[06:34] <missing> vanberge: did it work?

[06:36] <SilentDis> nzhomie:  sorry, saw you comment about getting more bandwidth.  I was just being goofy :)
[06:36] <nzhomie> a right
[06:36] <n30n> elfreakz: do you know if it is from the speakers or the systems motherboard
[06:36] <nzhomie> i was just explaining to ubox on how to get more bandwith
[06:37] <Jiraiya> Salut svp c'est vraiment important un francais svp
[06:37] <fyrestrtr> !fr
[06:37] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[06:37] <n30n> elfreakz: additionally, if you turn the speakers off, does this sound subside?
[06:37] <thoreauputic> Jiraiya: you're a slow learner aren't you ?
[06:37] <SilentDis> nzhomie:  my method works too... just takes a lot of work and is not... umm... above-board.  lol
[06:37] <Jiraiya> me bann pour rien
[06:37] <Jiraiya> j sais pas parler francais
[06:38] <friedtofu> n30n: well.. i found the real folder, i click properties, i hit "do not share" i hit ok, and its still sharing
[06:38] <elfreakz> n30n, if i turn off the speaker there's no sound
[06:38] <TiG4> *** Does anyone know if it is possible to simply Run a game through Cedega without actually "Installing" it
[06:38] <SilentDis> don't smite me!
[06:38] <thoreauputic> :D
[06:38] <missing> Tiga: well it has been know to work i did it with zuma
[06:39] <thoreauputic> SilenceGold: I just gaged him - I don't like to gag because of langage, but it creates noise
[06:39] <SilentDis> TiG4:  I'm a cedega user myself.  from what I can tell, no, it isn't.  the way it uses Wine means it needs to put files somewhere.
[06:39] <thoreauputic> *gagged
[06:39] <SilentDis> TiG4:  it's just the way they wrote the scripts
[06:39] <GaiaX11> Could anyone test this for me: wget http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/12B83718.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[06:39] <TiG4> SilentDis, whenever i try to install the game. and it asks for the next cd, cedega wont recognize the next cd
[06:39] <fyrestrtr> TiG4: how would you get the files onto your machine?
[06:40] <TiG4> fyrestrtr, I already have them on from my windows partition
[06:40] <elfreakz> n30n, u there?
[06:40] <n30n> elfreak: hold on
[06:40] <GaiaX11> It is the public key for PLF repositories, but here i get a 404 error
[06:40] <missing> anyone else need help?
[06:40] <elfreakz> ok
[06:40] <missing> im bored
[06:41] <SilentDis> TiG4:  what game?  also, this probably isn't the best room for this... but it looks a little slow, so unless thoreauputic has objections (please don't smite me!)  we'll continue :)
[06:41] <n30n> elfreakz: you could try upgrading to 6.1
[06:41] <n30n> elfreakz: Or turn off system sound.
[06:41] <_goofy_> how do i edit what options are shown after the quit applit is clicked?
[06:41] <fyrestrtr> GaiaX11: its 404 here also.
[06:41] <missing> no idea
[06:41] <TiG4> SilentDis, It's FSOne
[06:41] <n30n> elfreakz: Have you restarted your system since this problem began?
[06:41] <elfreakz> n30n, i already unchecked PLAY SYSTEM SOUND in sound preference
[06:41] <tonyyarusso> !plf | GaiaX11, fyrestrtr
[06:41] <ubotu> GaiaX11, fyrestrtr: PLF is the Penguin Liberation Front. For more info see: http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf. PLF is down indefinitely pending a new maintainer; see http://plf.zarb.org/. see also !seveas
[06:41] <SilentDis> TiG4:  FSOne?  is it in the transgaming db?
[06:41] <elfreakz> n30n, yes already restarted
[06:41] <TiG4> SilentDis, Nope. :)
[06:42] <missing> goofy i think thats a kernel thing since i recompiled mines it doest show any ubuntu things witch is better for me
[06:42] <n30n> elfreakz: It is possible that there is a sound card error, and upgrading to 6.10 would solve this error.
[06:42] <fyrestrtr> tonyyarusso: oh thanks, I didn't even know what it was.
[06:42] <elfreakz> n30n, how do i upgrade?
[06:42] <fyrestrtr> TiG4: you might have better luck at #winehq -- maybe someone knows a workaround.
[06:43] <GaiaX11> !seveas
[06:43] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:43] <elfreakz> n30n, anything like auto upgrade like in xp windows update?
[06:43] <SilentDis> TiG4:  I was about to suggest the same thing, a wine group hehe.  i've never herd of the game, so I don't know what it 'uses' for resources (directx version it's looking for, etc)
[06:43] <_goofy_> missing: well i dont have the option to shutdown or restart......i have to logout 1st
[06:43] <fyrestrtr> _goofy_: are you running XGL?
[06:44] <n30n> elfreakz: gksudo "update-manager -d"
[06:44] <SilentDis> elfreakz:  you can do a quick check of your packages from the command prompt.  sudo apt-get update, then sudo apt-get upgrade
[06:44] <missing> elf: its a command that goes like this sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[06:44] <n30n> elfreakz: type that into your terminal screen
[06:44] <_goofy_> yes im runnung xgl
[06:44] <elfreakz> n30n, i heard from some chatters here last few days, that 6.10 is not stable
[06:44] <fyrestrtr> _goofy_: its a known bug in XGL.
[06:44] <missing> ohh
[06:44] <missing> i know what youre talking about
[06:44] <n30n> elfreakz: I have had few problems with it.
[06:44] <_goofy_> its verry anoying
[06:44] <rredd4> grub sometimes does not load (i get a black screen before grub is to show on the screen) and sometimes it will load.  Do I need to reinstall grub or is there some other way?
[06:44] <missing> right click on one of the bars at the bottom
[06:45] <missing> and add the shutdown pannel
[06:45] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help
[06:45] <elfreakz> n30n, but 6.10 will solve my sound problem?
[06:45] <fyrestrtr> well, I had one problem -- where the strange UUID of the hard disks was "wrong", I just did a quick edit to fstab and fixed that.
[06:45] <SilentDis> !info moblock
[06:45] <ubotu> Package moblock does not exist in any distro I know
[06:46] <n30n> elfreakz: If the problem is with the sound card, then it the most likely solution
[06:46] <SilentDis> ahhh!  *ducks away from thoreauputic*
[06:46] <n30n> elfreakz: the easiest rather
[06:46] <thoreauputic> SilentDis: relax
[06:46] <elfreakz> n30n, if i upgrade to 6.10 what happen to all my application in here?
[06:46] <n30n> Theres an ubuntu 7.04?
[06:47] <tonyyarusso> !feisty | n30n
[06:47] <ubotu> n30n: The next version of Ubuntu (7.04; codenamed "Feisty Fawn"), it should be released in April 2007. At the moment it is alpha. Schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule - Specifications (goals): https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/feisty - Help in #ubuntu+1
[06:47] <SilentDis> thoreauputic:  sorry, it's reaction.  there's so seldom an op here, it's usually bad when one shows up *giggle*
[06:47] <n30n> elfreakz: Upgrade only modifies and adds system and kernal files, it does not effect programs
[06:47] <xipietotec> SilentDis: It's not in the repo, it's Peerguardian for Linux
[06:47] <xipietotec> Unfortunately it's blocking the sourceforge CVS servers
[06:47] <thoreauputic> SilenceGold: it's our policy to remain non ops unless needed - keeps the temperature down :)
[06:48] <n30n> tonyyarusso: Oh, i see why seeing it as an upgrade option confused it.
[06:48] <elfreakz> n30n, is there any site that saying about this sound problem?
[06:48] <n30n> elfreakz: you could always google it. "strange sounds in ubuntu linux" should do the trick.
[06:49] <missing> elf: im curious what sound problems i wast here
[06:49] <SilentDis> xipietotec:  sorry.  still learning a bit around the edges.  never had direct experience with it, so I'm googling it now.  never hurts to learn ;)
[06:49] <n30n> missing: His system speakers are making consistant beeping noises
[06:49] <n30n> missing: that stop when he turns off the speakers
[06:49] <wxywxy> ...

[06:54] <SilentDis> XiXaQ:  i personally believe so, yes.  it'll be a bit slow around the edges though with gnome.  but other than that, it should work well on 256mb ram
[06:54] <missing> elffreak: do u have an intel board?
[06:54] <elfreakz> n30n, hmmm i will try.. but how
[06:54] <supervisor> fine  silentdis

[06:56] <elfreakz> n30n, the Software Updates still in progress of searching
[06:56] <ubun> what is X-video and how do i get it? i dont see it in synaptic
[06:56] <missing> hmm.. and u have your headphone panel connected? the one that goes to the side or to the front?
[06:56] <XiXaQ> SilentDis, nice to know :) I'm running VMWare server and I'm trying to find out how much RAM I should allocate for each machine.
[06:56] <SilentDis> n30n:  it only takes one to squelch you... roflmao
[06:56] <SilentDis> XiXaQ:  256-384 will run them fine :)
[06:56] <n30n> SilentDis: I was just wondering...
[06:56] <thoreauputic> n30n: it varies with time of day etc.
[06:57] <SilentDis> n30n:  and I was just being goofy ;)
[06:57] <elfreakz> n30n, why the software update too so long? is it hang or anything?
[06:58] <missing> elffreak: now that i remember i had the same problem but quake3 would tell me the sound was muted then i connected the panel and the mute went away but i did get a beep now that i remember

[07:07] <Epidemik> can someone help me partition my harddrive?
[07:07] <n30n> elfreakz: you'll need to enable multiverse and universe repositories
[07:07] <Epidemik> please
[07:07] <elfreakz> n30n, hmmmm
[07:07] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: what do you need help with?
[07:07] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: i want to partition my harddrive
[07:08] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: for installation or another hard drive?
[07:08] <Epidemik> fryestrtr: it says system->administration->disks
[07:08] <Epidemik> but that doesnt exist
[07:08] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: install gparted.
[07:08] <SilentDis> krustofski:  you could be right on that lol.  i know i herd it a couple days ago... but with a music collection this big on random... it's hard to remember :P
[07:08] <bretticus> anybody here setup a wintv card recently?
[07:08] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: The one i currnetly have in there. do i need to boot of live cd to do this?
[07:09] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: sudo apt-get install gparted?
[07:09] <krustofski> lol it was streaming on di.fm earlier today
[07:09] <krustofski> and im just going nuts now
[07:09] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr there it goes i think...when i reformat disk will i have to reinstall ubuntu
[07:09] <Epidemik> ?
[07:09] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: livecd comes with gparted, is should be there. The installer will launch a partition editor for you if you choose 'manual partition'.
[07:10] <SilentDis> krustofski:  Found it.  Eiffel 65 "Blue" :)
[07:10] <krustofski> lol no no
[07:10] <krustofski> thats not it
[07:10] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: if you reformat the root partition (the / ) then yes.
[07:10] <krustofski> blue is something else
[07:10] <krustofski> this has a female vocal
[07:10] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: do i need to go off live to reformat entire thing?
[07:10] <krustofski> im gonna slice my throat
[07:10] <krustofski> bbl
[07:10] <SilentDis> krustofski:  darn.  rofl
[07:11] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: no, you can do that from the live cd.
[07:11] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: just start the installation process.
[07:11] <SilentDis> could an op please change the topic to "Welcome to #ubuntu!  Supporting Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and finding that damn song that's stuck in your head!" :D
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> SilentDis: kubuntu is in #kubuntu
[07:12] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr but i already have ubuntu installed, do i need to go to livecd to reinstall?
[07:12] <SilentDis> rofl
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> SilentDis: and song discovery is in #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: no, just boot into your system. Open up a terminal, and type sudo apt-get install gparted
[07:13] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr okay ive done that now what do i do...?
[07:13] <Epidemik> i dont see the button to reformat
[07:14] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: you need to run gparted.
[07:14] <Epidemik> i want my hdd to appear as if it just came outa the box
[07:14] <rocky123> hello eveyone
[07:14] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: then you'll see all the buttons :P

[07:14] <rocky123> can anybody tell me which version of video4linux is installed with the edgy kernel
[07:14] <elfreakz> n30n, the repository might be no longer available/could not be contacted bcos of network problem. if available and older version of the failed index will be used.otherwise the repository will be ignored. check your network connection and the correct writing of the repository address in preferences

[07:15] <rocky123> can anybody tell me which version of video4linux is installed with the edgy kernel 2.6.10.-generic
[07:15] <deep> Epidemik, first select your disc : )
[07:15] <xipietotec> If anyone is familiar with Moblock I could seriously use some help, its currently blocking sourceforge cvs servers
[07:16] <xipietotec> and I do not know how to edit the block list
[07:16] <Epidemik> deep theres three....sorry im such a noob
[07:16] <Epidemik> deep the delete option is greyed out....
[07:16] <deep> Epidemik, you dont know which one is which?
[07:16] <n30n> elfreakz: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[07:16] <Epidemik> deep i want all of them gone
[07:16] <mindflow> kudos to calblesm102! He is the package master!
[07:16] <elfreakz> n30n, why should i use edgy?
[07:17] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/generalities/gparted.htm
[07:17] <elfreakz> n30n, i mean im on 6.06 now?
[07:17] <deep> Epidemik: everyone totally clear?
[07:17] <Epidemik> deep, so it is just like when i pulled th HD outa the boxx for the first time
[07:17] <cablesm102> thanks, mindflow
[07:17] <Epidemik> deep exactly
[07:17] <n30n> elfreakz: the documents has older verson codes too
[07:17] <n30n> somewhere in there
[07:17] <timpino> Hi Everybody!
[07:17] <elfreakz> ok
[07:17] <deep> Epidemik, first off, what filesystem you want on it?
[07:17] <n30n> elfreakz: if you look around you should find 6.06 too
[07:18] <ninjaboy> I just installed ubuntu, but its unable to find my usb mouse. what should i do? :/
[07:18] <timpino> I'm thinking about buying a mouse for my laptop to have with me on the go, I would love if it had a thumb-button, antbody know one?
[07:18] <Epidemik> deep FAT32 i believe but then again im pretty nooby
[07:18] <n30n> Epidemik: fdisk -l
[07:19] <fyrestrtr> timpino: the microsoft mouse does.
[07:19] <SilentDis> ninjaboy:  this is a bit of a workaround, and not a direct 'solution' to the issue... but do you have one of those little usb>ps2 dongles and a PS2 port on your box?
[07:19] <Epidemik> n30n in teminal?
[07:19] <n30n> Epidemik: indeed.
[07:19] <deep> Epidemik, okay, then just select a disc, then in the middle there will be this big bar, just rightclick it and you will have a lot of options
[07:19] <deep> Epidemik, there you can format it to fat32
[07:19] <timpino> fyerstrtr: I M$ mouse? holy shit buying from the devil! :) Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out
[07:20] <Epidemik> deep...which disk do i select
[07:20] <ninjaboy> SilentDis: i have to admit im totally blank. im not sure what i have or don't. all i know is that i used ubuntu a bit before, and then i got it working.
[07:20] <ninjaboy> just a plain usb mouse i suppose.
[07:20] <Epidemik> n30n. thanks but i dont think that did anything
[07:20] <deep> Epidemik, well, since your going to format all of then, it doesnt matter so much.
[07:20] <deep> Epidemik, you might want to format one of them to something else then FAT32 though, since you want an OS too.
[07:20] <Epidemik> deep- okay i'll start with /dev/hdg1...
[07:20] <n30n> Epidemik: you said yo uwerent sure if it was fat32, fdisk tells you what type they the partitions are i believe
[07:21] <Epidemik> deep.... what do you mean by that lol
[07:21] <SilentDis> ninjaboy:  I was talking a workaround.  many usb mice and keyboards come with little adapters to make their stuff work in PS2 ports.  not an perfect solution, but if it works...
[07:21] <Epidemik> n30n okay thanks
[07:21] <keeganX> How would I solve mplayer saying it can't find a -vo
[07:21] <deep> Epidemik, well, windows want an NTFS filesystem, and linux preferly an EXT3 or an reisersfs.
[07:21] <Epidemik> okay guys... im gonna come clean and hopefully this will help you guys help me
[07:21] <mindflow> Can Somebody help me find mozilla-browser mozilla-psm packages?
[07:21] <Epidemik> I wanna get windows back
[07:21] <deep> Epidemik, so one of the discs cant be an fat32
[07:21] <arrenlex> keeganX: You have a video file? Run mplayer from the command line with -vo xv and pastebin all the output: mplayer -vo xv file.avi
[07:22] <n30n> Epidemik: i duel boot ^.^
[07:22] <timpino> ninjaboy, I've used a USB mouse with just a regular PS2 protocol worked like a charm
[07:22] <Epidemik> i wanna put linux on a diff harddrive
[07:22] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: if you just want windows back, pop in a Windows installation CD, reboot your computer, and have Windows format your disk. You don't need to go through all this.
[07:22] <mindflow> apt_get gives me Package mozilla-browser is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[07:22] <mindflow> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[07:22] <mindflow> is only available from another source
[07:22] <mindflow> E: Package mozilla-browser has no installation candidate
[07:22] <supervisor> thanks
[07:22] <Epidemik> n30n thats the longterm plan
[07:22] <ninjaboy> SilentDis: well all i have is this mouse i got from a friend. nothing more. ps2 protocol. is that something i need to install? :P
[07:22] <ninjaboy> im a bit embarassed.
[07:22] <timpino> ninjaboy: also if the mouse is wireless, make sure it's connected :P made that mistake myself
[07:22] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr i tried that and it said it couldnt recognize the harddrive....
[07:22] <deep> n30n died :(
[07:22] <ninjaboy> hehe, its not wireless.
[07:23] <ninjaboy> i know that much. lol
[07:23] <Epidemik> i thought that was cause i hadnt formatted it...
[07:23] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: no, that's not why.
[07:23] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: it recognizes unformatted harddisks just fine.
[07:23] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: wll mine is formatted in EXT3
[07:23] <timpino> ninjaboy, what you probably have to do is edit your X config
[07:24] <Epidemik> should it still be reconized?
[07:24] <mindflow> How do I do this:  (You'll need to have "universe" and "multiverse" Ubuntu repositories enabled in your APT settings.)?
[07:24] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: that's fine, it will just say 'unknown partition type'.

[07:24] <ninjaboy> timpino: i have no idea how to do that.
[07:24] <SilentDis> ninjaboy:  you probably will have to dive into your x.conf... but one thing before you do... got a usb disk or something else to test that usb port... just to be certain that's not the problem?
[07:24] <timpino> ninjaboy: there is a graphical interface to it, but I usually do it by hand...
[07:25] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr. i know this isnt the right place for windows help but...it says something like no harddrive attatched. i take outh the install disk and it takes me to Linux just fine...whats wrong?

[07:25] <mindflow> Thanks ubotu
[07:25] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: how many disks do you have in your machine?
[07:25] <keeganX> arrenlex: pastebin is taking forever to load up
[07:25] <mindflow> Thanks SilentDis ;-)
[07:25] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr. 1 at the moment, my friend has my other one which i plan to put ubuntu on once i get XP working on this one
[07:25] <timpino> ninjaboy: there are loads and loads of tutorials on how to set up X.conf
[07:25] <keeganX> arrenlex: there we go!
[07:26] <tom_kelleher> so I read on digg about a new kernel. should I update?
[07:26] <keeganX> arrenlex: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36780/
[07:26] <timpino> ninjaboy: not as hard as it sound TBH
[07:26] <SilentDis> mindflow:  nt :)
[07:26] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: okay, then the easiest option for you is -- boot from the livecd, run gparted from there, and delete all partitions.
[07:26] <arrenlex> keeganX: You can always use pastebin.ca if ubuntu's is slow.
[07:26] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: not unless there is something compelling in the new kernel that you need.
[07:26] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: and that should fix it? have you installed windows before?
[07:27] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: heh, before? Installed? I do it every day (almost).
[07:27] <arrenlex> keeganX: And what was the command you ran?
[07:27] <SilentDis> tom_kelleher:  not sure what they're going with in feisty... edgy is running 2.6.17 as it is... what kernel were you reading about?
[07:27] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; I think it was mostly security stuff, but I'm not 100% sure.
[07:27] <tom_kelleher> SilentDis; I believe they were talking about 2.6.19
[07:28] <thoreauputic> currently feisty is 2.6.19 - there's talk of 2.6.20
[07:28] <tom_kelleher> I read that too
[07:28] <jishin> how can I change NICs order persitently, like eth0 for MAC 0, eth1 for MAC 1 ....
[07:28] <keeganX> arrenlex: I ran this  mplayer -vo vx ~/Desktop/pauly_shore_gets_punched_in_the_face.wmv
[07:28] <wyld> what is the command to delete a file in the command line?
[07:28] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: oh cool i guess... so i should trust you heh. i think ive trusted you with stuff like this before so here goes. Ill be right back i have the live/install CDs for about 10 different distros on my desk so i gotta sort through thme heh
[07:28] <ninjaboy> timpino: the graphical interface... alot of stuff in there. which one do i choose?
[07:28] <tom_kelleher> but I also heard Feisty is too unstable to use day to day
[07:28] <elfreakz> software updates 6.06 why it didnt say there's update/upgrade too 6.10???
[07:28] <thoreauputic> wyld: rm

[07:30] <Epidemik> meh fyrestrtr. i installed from Ubuntu 5.10 Install disk, not live cd...so would a gento live CD work?
[07:30] <deep> mindflow :D
[07:30] <SilentDis> the lysdexic santa worshipper was told to llik by his god O.o
[07:30] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: install disk IS a live cd.
[07:31] <Epidemik> i dont think 5.10 was
[07:31] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: livecd just means that it boots up into a desktop. For some stupid reason, Ubuntu started calling them 'desktop cds'.
[07:31] <elfreakz> fyrestrtr, its not recommended to update using apt-get ???
[07:31] <tom_kelleher> I think 5.10 had two CDs, a install and live
[07:31] <timpino> ninjaboy: there is a section called mouse or something at the top, that's were you should be tinkering
[07:31] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr...okay im gonna go check it i guess
[07:31] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: if you have an install cd, then surely it has some sort of partition editor. It doesn't really matter.
[07:31] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: if you have fast net connection, download the gparted livecd and run it.
[07:32] <_goofy_> can you change premissions on a usb disk.....
[07:32] <fyrestrtr> elfreakz: no.
[07:32] <tonyyarusso> tom_kelleher: Correct.  In Dapper they added the ability to install from the Live CD, and now ShipIt only sends that one.  You can use the old style CD (now called "alternate") if you need special options or don't have enough RAM, or just like it
[07:32] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr. okay wish me luck, if im not back in 25 minutes, start praying for my survival hehe
[07:32] <fyrestrtr> _goofy_: depends on the file system running on it.
[07:32] <Epidemik> thanks for the help once again
[07:32] <Epidemik> you rock
[07:32] <Epidemik> same goes for you deep and if you see n30n tell him thanks to
[07:32] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: yeah from Dapper onwards they did this desktop cd business.
[07:32] <deep> Epidemik, okay :D np : )

[07:35] <catsy> hi there i have difficulties setting up my adsl connection i'm currently on windows
[07:35] <tom_kelleher> does anybody know how I can connect to, and at bare minimum print from a networked HP printer
[07:35] <edog^> on a fresh ubuntu install, with ifconfig I'm seeing that my machine has two ip addresses even though I have one network card.  What's the deal with that?
[07:35] <Lam_> !dd
[07:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:35] <ninjaboy> timpino: i have no idea what im doing her im sad to say
[07:35] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: just add it as a network printer with the hp drivers?
[07:35] <Phlosten> catsy, ethernet or usb?
[07:35] <ninjaboy> here.
[07:35] <mindflow> arrenlex: Will that build from source? I am running ppc
[07:36] <fyrestrtr> edog^: where do you see the two addresses?
[07:36] <arrenlex> mindflow: All packages in ubuntu exist for i386, amd64, and ppc.
[07:36] <mindflow> great
[07:36] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; that easy huh... does HP have good Linux support then?
[07:36] <fyrestrtr> arrenlex: not all ;)
[07:36] <arrenlex> mindflow: apt-get will automatically select and install the correct version. All you need to do is install democracyplayer.
[07:36] <edog^> fyrestrtr, using ifconfig
[07:37] <arrenlex> fyrestrtr: They have to. They can exist for MORE, sure, but they must have those three.
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: its one of the better. HP drivers work with other printers too. For more info, look up your printer at linuxprinting.org
[07:37] <nothlit> Whats the diff between democracyplayer and zudeo
[07:37] <elfreakz> how to stop the timer when dual boot?? its like after few second it auto login to ubuntu.. i want to stop the timer

[07:37] <edog^> I have 192.168.0.100 and 192.168.0.101 which doesn't make sense because I have another machine already using 101
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> elfreakz: hit esc
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> edog^: pastebin the output of ifconfig
[07:37] <elfreakz> fyrestrtr, how if im not infront the computer... it will go to ubuntu.. then i have to restart and boot again

[07:59] <tonyyarusso> !amaranth | yoshig3
[07:59] <ubotu> yoshig3: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using this repository: deb http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ubuntu edgy stable
[07:59] <droolubuntu> fyrestrtr, , i get blank screen + blinking cursor bootup..n extrememly slow booting on edgy
[07:59] <yoshig3> tom_Kelleher: I thought I did but they were 9x29, not 9x31
[07:59] <Unity> new here, how to get administrator privaledges in cedega? is prompting me for it
[07:59] <droolubuntu> sorry that was an error of me talkin to myself LOL
[07:59] <dr-nix> it would be nice if nvidia worked with the ubuntu ppl a bit so that binary packages for ubuntu would show up
[07:59] <fyrestrtr> droolubuntu: sounds like a bad burn on your disk.
[07:59] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: I'm still getting extremely slow graphical response, and it's slugging down my system.
[07:59] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: I have the newest drivers and all that jazz.
[07:59] <arrenlex> dr-nix: They're there.
[07:59] <thoreauputic> !cedega > Unity
[08:00] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr what was supposed to happen?
[08:00] <droolubuntu> fyrestrtr, many others r havin the same prob...and i already checked the ubuntu edgy disc...
[08:00] <christian1222> arrenlex: its not those codecs, i have already gotten all those, i am running 6.10 if that helps
[08:00] <Unity> k cool
[08:00] <arrenlex> christian1222: How are you trying to play it?
[08:00] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: it will make your disk brand now. Did you type p and see the output? It should show no partitions.
[08:00] <christian1222> arrenlex: i can hear the sound, just not see the video
[08:00] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr : yes
[08:00] <arrenlex> christian1222: Yes, because you do not have wmv codecs.
[08:00] <fyrestrtr> droolubuntu: what others? I didn't. I've installed edgy on 4 machines now.
[08:00] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; whats your hardware?
[08:00] <christian1222> arrenlex: ive tried playing it through mplayer from terminal, as well as through gui
[08:00] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: now, type w and hit enter.
[08:01] <dr-nix> arrenlex:  last nvidia driver i installed i had to go into the code and modify to get it to compile .. (but that was their sound driver though)
[08:01] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: Good enough. It ran great in windows. GeForce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR PCi
[08:01] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr , okay
[08:01] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: then, reboot with your Windows install cd.
[08:01] <christian1222> arrenlex: and ive tried totem and gxine
[08:01] <arrenlex> christian1222: Does /usr/lib/win32 contain anything?
[08:01] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: if it doesnt work will it boot into linux of is linux gone?
[08:01] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: it will work :)
[08:01] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: but just incase ... lol
[08:01] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; I did the apt get in a terminal, but I don't thin, it installed
[08:02] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: well then those linux cds will come in handy :P
[08:02] <droolubuntu> fyrestrtr, see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=291263
[08:02] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr also is it in NSTF (or whatever that was) format
[08:02] <christian1222> arrenlex: it says that i dont have that directory
[08:02] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: do you have the universe/multiverse repositories enabled?
[08:02] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr :P I love you
[08:02] <arrenlex> christian1222: Then you do not have the codecs you need.

[08:03] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: your hard disk is attached to your computer how? Is it internal or external?
[08:03] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: any ideas?
[08:03] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr internally but i may have done it wrong
[08:03] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; hm... well I'm no expert or anything on this, so be sure to ask around a bit more. But perhaps you should do a fresh install with no Nvidia drivers and try again.
[08:03] <droolubuntu> anywhere i can get firefox2 debs for dapper?
[08:03] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr anything else i should know before i do this?
[08:03] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; I believe so. Are the in the source list? and if so which ones?
[08:03] <arrenlex> droolubuntu: Why not use the official tarball?
[08:03] <Rebecca> if i want KDE as my GUI should i install kubuntu or ubuntu.. and if so why?
[08:03] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: well your hdg was weird. What kind of computer is this?
[08:04] <arrenlex> Rebecca: kubuntu.
[08:04] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: With no nvidia drivers my Xserver will not start. It errors, and I am forced to use my integrated card.
[08:04] <arrenlex> !kubuntu | Rebecca
[08:04] <christian1222> arrenlex: im doing that right now
[08:04] <ubotu> Rebecca: Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[08:04] <pvangarde> Does anybody have winetools-0.9jo-III.tar.gz, Winetools website is down
[08:04] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: you should have a listing like deb http://kw.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse
[08:04] <deep> droolubuntu, isnt the firefox that is in repos firefox 2?
[08:04] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; I mean do a fresh install with generic drivers.
[08:04] <christian1222> thanks, im slowly learning to use linux, and just trying to get everything i normally use working while i learn the basics
[08:04] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: Lol, dont even begin to talk about my computer
[08:04] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: my baby was $30 in a garagesale
[08:04] <christian1222> arrenlex: see above 2 lines
[08:04] <pvangarde> Anybody use wine here?
[08:04] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: with a different country code (mine is kw) in your /etc/apt/sources.list -- a quick way to check it is to type grep -v '^#' /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:04] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: bought a $40 gfx card and it worked
[08:04] <Rebecca> ubotu: i know this
[08:04] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: oh lawd.
[08:05] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: barly
[08:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i know this - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:05] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: but its not too shabby of a computer
=== guerrero is now known as aburrent
[08:05] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: this is basically a fresh install. I couldn't get my x server to work with my graphics card without the nvidia drivers.
=== aburrent is now known as guerrero
[08:05] <Rebecca> just wondering if kubuntu is outdated or is KDE setup on ubuntu tricky?
[08:05] <arrenlex> christian1222: Welcome to the Linux ship :)
[08:05] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: okay well good luck, it should work just fine.
[08:05] <christian1222> arrenlex: thanks
[08:05] <thoreauputic> Rebecca: if you prefer KDE install Kubuntu, and no
[08:05] <Rebecca> thoreauputic: ok :)
[08:05] <Rebecca> thanks  :0
[08:05] <Rebecca> :)
[08:05] <arrenlex> Rebecca: Absolutely not, kubuntu is in tip-top shape; it's developed concurrently with ubuntu and is exactly the same but for the GUI.
[08:05] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: AMD 2000+ (OCed to 1.7 GHz), 13 GB Harddrive, nVidia Geforce 6200
[08:06] <thoreauputic> Rebecca: note that there is a channel #kubuntu as well
[08:06] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr:for 70 USD id say i did okay
[08:06] <llama32> Rebecca: you can still install KDE on normal ubuntu - effectively turning it into kubuntu... kubuntu is exactly the same, but with kde as default
[08:06] <fyrestrtr> my my -- 13 GB -- I think my temporary internet cache is bigger than that :P
[08:06] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; yea, I have those.
=== guerrero is now known as aburrent
[08:06] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: lol
[08:06] <Rebecca> thoreauputic: cool bananas :)
[08:06] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: then type sudo apt-get install hplip
[08:06] <pvangarde> Seriously, doesn't anyone use WINE?
[08:06] <thoreauputic> Rebecca: :)

[08:06] <arrenlex> Epidemik: What old man's trash did you dig a 13-GB hard drive out of? xD
[08:06] <ThePub> pvangarde: only when I'm eating duck
[08:07] <llama32> frisbee
[08:07] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; so Ubuntu won't work 'out of the box'
[08:07] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr:the guy said he thought it was 20 GB, i got home and was somewhat pissed but he gave me another HD, i just cant find it right now. i think my firiend has it
[08:07] <thoreauputic> pvangarde: someone no doubt does - what is your question?
[08:07] <arrenlex> pvangarde: I use Wine. Problems?
[08:07] <thoreauputic> !anyone
[08:07] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:07] <pvangarde> thoreauputic: i need the new winetools file, the winetools website is down
[08:07] <Epidemik> arrenlex: 30 USD in a garage sale and ive spent many hours on this beast,
[08:07] <Epidemik> arrenlex good deal for me :D
[08:07] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: Not if I try to use my graphics card. If I use my intel integrated card, it will.
[08:07] <tundejeg> how do i view a created group
[08:07] <pvangarde> winetools source file
[08:07] <fyrestrtr> pvangarde: try your luck at #winehq
[08:07] <thoreauputic> pvangarde: #wine-hq I think

[08:07] <Epidemik> lol the gfx card cost more than the whole computer
[08:08] <pvangarde> thank you!
[08:08] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr what was weird about my harddrive?
[08:08] <thoreauputic> ah #winehq may be right
[08:08] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; perhpas thats the issue?
[08:08] <arrenlex> pvangarde: I advise you not to go to #winehq with winetools questions. You will be crucified.
[08:08] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: But this graphics card was mentioned specifically to work.
[08:08] <pvangarde> really? why?
[08:08] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: other than the unlucky size?
[08:08] <pvangarde> I just need someone to send me winetools-0.9jo-III.tar.gz
[08:08] <arrenlex> pvangarde: The wine people hate winetools for the same reasons that, and even more than, ubuntu people hate automatix.
[08:08] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: oh, its already there then :) Is this a recent upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[08:08] <tundejeg> how do i view a created group
[08:08] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: before i told you about the size :D you said something was weird
[08:09] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: hdg
[08:09] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: This graphics card works because it runs glxgears and beryl, but everything is so laggy.
[08:09] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; What I mean is, perhpas your getting bad proformance becuase it's trying to use the Intel GPU not the Nvidia one
[08:09] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: But wouldn't that make it not work at all?
[08:09] <fyrestrtr> Epidemik: its a strange device id for a disk, normally they are hda or hdb
[08:09] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: lol i didnt know what i was doing when i installed Ubuntu, prolly just hit enter a whole bunch of times
[08:09] <nothlit> Though with wine you can always rm -fr ~/.wine && wineprefixcreate
[08:09] <tundejeg> how do i view a created group
[08:09] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; this is a fresh Edgy install
[08:09] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: Because it's outputting from my graphics card, my graphics card is plugged into my monitor
[08:09] <Epidemik> fyrestrtr: Here i go, talk to you later
[08:09] <llama32> can i completely upgrade from 5.10 to 6.10 over the internet [i guess with apt] ?
[08:09] <Epidemik> bye deep if youre still here
[08:09] <tundejeg> how do i view a created group
[08:09] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: okay well either case the drivers are installed.
[08:10] <deep> take care Epidemik :)
[08:10] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: you can add the printer from system > administration > printing
[08:10] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; yea, that would make sense, it's just the only thing I can think of that may be causing issues. Like I said I'm no expert on this.
[08:10] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: How would i disable it then?
[08:10] <FreeNet> hi question: for entertainment wise... which is better? ubuntu or fedora?
[08:10] <arrenlex> llama32: Yes.
[08:10] <arrenlex> !upgrade | llama32
[08:10] <ubotu> llama32: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes

[08:10] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: I have it set to use PCI on boot in my bios
[08:11] <pvangarde> arrenlex: yep, they wouldnt send it
[08:11] <arrenlex> pvangarde: Told you. =P
[08:11] <arrenlex> pvangarde: You should just wait until the site comes up.
[08:11] <arrenlex> pvangarde: Note winetools will not work with recent version of wine.
[08:11] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: double click new printer, then select network printer, then from the drop down, select HP DirectJet -- type the IP address of your printer, and then click Next, select it from the list of given HP printers (it should be there).
[08:11] <arrenlex> pvangarde: recent being greater than 0.9.3 (current is 0.9.27 I believe)
[08:12] <pvangarde> arrenlex: I have 9.22
[08:12] <tom_kelleher> yoshig3; I really wish I knew why you were getting bad proformance, like I said. Ask around a bit more, I'm sure somebody will know. In the mean time I'll look into it for you, if I come across anything I'll let you kow.
[08:12] <yoshig3> tom_kelleher: Everyone suggests the same thing. "Drivers, drivers, drivers." But I have the newest drivers, so that can't be the problem.
[08:12] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: what is the problem you are having?
=== VerdROusseausit is now known as VerdROusseausit2
[08:13] <pvangarde> arrenlex: its actually the server that hosts the file thats down, not the actual winetools website.. it has been like that for some time now

[08:13] <Music_Shuffle1> The same one about window drawing speed still yoshig3 ?
[08:13] <christian1222> arrenlex: i still cant stream it
[08:14] <yoshig3> Music_Shufflel: Yeah, exactly. It's a bit better with beryl, but it's still extremely slow, and Counter-strike gets terrible FPS when it should be getting great fps.
[08:14] <AnI> hi hi just one question can ubuntu be installed on a usb thumbdrive?
[08:14] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; that was easy, but it's only using the basic driver.
[08:14] <christian1222> arrenlex: i can watch it in mplayer, but not in totem, and i still cant stream wmv in firefox
[08:14] <yoshig3> Music_Shuffle1: it's as if I dont' have a graphcis card, but have the capabilities of running 3d programs.
[08:14] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: what do you want to do? scan from it?
[08:14] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: is direct rendering running for you?
[08:14] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: yeap
[08:15] <arrenlex> christian1222: You're going to have to pick a player, I'm afraid. Mplayer and totem conflict with firefox and you will probably get firefox trying to use totem to play the files.
[08:15] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; well on the site you gave me, there are two drivers the basic and one that gives scanning, papers status, ink levels, all that stuff too.
[08:15] <Music_Shuffle1> mplayer conflicts with FF?
[08:15] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: how is glxgears fps WITHOUT xgl or aiglx?
[08:15] <arrenlex> christian1222: Remove the totem-mozilla package, and make sure you have mozilla-mplayer installed.
[08:15] <AnI> Just use Opera
[08:15] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: show me the exact url.
[08:15] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: about 1000fps.
[08:15] <arrenlex> Music_Shuffle1: MPlayer conflits with totem in firefox, is what I said.
[08:15] <Music_Shuffle1> Oh ok. Just wondering. :D
[08:15] <christian1222> arrenlex: how do i remove the totem-mozilla package?

[08:22] <elfreakz> where can i get theme for ubuntu?
[08:22] <Bray> Like... I want to start up WoW, but I get an error each time... so... I dunno, an action log I guess you could call it?
[08:23] <tonyyarusso> !themes | elfreakz

[08:23] <arrenlex> Bray: Just copy the output and save it to a file?
[08:23] <elfreakz> tonyyarusso, ok...
[08:23] <yoshig3> Bray: I suggest that if you want to game, use windows. Ubuntu is terrible graphically. It looks pretty, but I've had nothing but bad experiences with trying ot get it to work.
[08:23] <nothlit> Bray, wine wow.exe > /home/user/wowerrors.txt
[08:23] <jb0nd38372> is there an easy way I can watch or log any output Xserver has?  I have an issue, when my screensaver is in use, and the sceen locks to the password field it is black and never shows me the password prompt
[08:24] <arrenlex> yoshig3: I disagree. Graphics on Linux are hit and miss. Usually Nvidia is hit and ATI is miss, but not always. It's about 50-50.
[08:24] <yoshig3> arrenlex: I can't get my card to work for nothing. I've been at it for days.
[08:24] <arrenlex> jb0nd38372: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[08:24] <yoshig3> arrenlex: It works, but I get extremely slow performance.
[08:24] <Bray> yoshig3, I would, but all of my Windows installation disks are either broken or corrupted. That's what happens when you have younger siblings. Also, my installation of Windows on this computer got effed, and it's a very proficcient gamer
[08:25] <arrenlex> yoshig3: And my card worked out of the box with 3D acceleration using open-source drivers. You are a miss, and I am a hit. It's 50-50.
[08:25] <jb0nd38372> arrenlex: Thank you... Going to try and create the situation and figure out what is causing xserver to crash or never restore video.
[08:25] <christian1222> arrenlex: so it is working on one site, but on another, it appears to be working, saying it is connecting, then it just goes to saying "stopped"
[08:25] <yoshig3> arrenlex: I use nvidia, with a card specifically supported by ubuntu.
[08:25] <christian1222> arrenlex: any ideas?
[08:25] <arrenlex> christian1222: What sites?
[08:25] <nothlit> Bray, you could always try cedega cvs
[08:25] <Bray> nothlit, I would, but I don't have any money to get it
[08:26] <christian1222> arrenlex: its a secure site for my work
[08:26] <arrenlex> christian1222: Ah. That explains it.
[08:26] <christian1222> arrenlex: do you know of any other good places to check it?
[08:26] <arrenlex> christian1222: Right-click on the movie and go to configure.
[08:26] <Bray> nothlit, the only reason I'm trying to get it to work with wine is just that
[08:26] <shoby> whos there?
[08:26] <paolo> Hi :). is it possibile to auto-mount a cd when inserted?
[08:26] <christian1222> arrenlex: ok
[08:26] <arrenlex> christian1222: There, check "connect to RTSP media over TCP".
[08:26] <yoshig3> arrenlex: Any ideas?
[08:27] <jb0nd38372> yoshig3: Did you install nvidia official or beta drivers?  I'm running an Nvidia 7950 and have had good luck with World of Warcraft and other windows based games.  I'm also "knock on wood" running Beryl, with kiba dock, it crashes the window manager occasionally but for the most part is stable enough to use
[08:27] <nothlit> Bray, i said cvs
[08:27] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; are you still there?
[08:27] <nothlit> Bray, go google how to get it
[08:27] <arrenlex> yoshig3: It refuses to give you 3D acceleration?
[08:27] <Bray> nothlit, so I take it it's free?
[08:27] <nothlit> Bray, the cvs compiled version is free
[08:27] <Bray> nothlit, aha, I see, thank you
[08:27] <aNi`> Hey yeah itz possible to have ubuntu on USB here is the wiki for it https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[08:27] <christian1222> arrenlex: ok, that worked
[08:27] <christian1222> arrenlex: thanks again
[08:27] <arrenlex> christian1222: Glad to hear it :)
[08:27] <aNi`> arrenlex did u get dat?
[08:27] <aNi`> itz awesome
[08:28] <arrenlex> christian1222: No problem. Had the same problem trying to make it work with comedy central.
[08:28] <aNi`> i wish they roll off a automated installer
[08:28] <aNi`> but the wiki is pretty good
[08:28] <shoby> hi
[08:28] <arrenlex> aNi`: I told you it was possible. Have fun!
[08:28] <arrenlex> !hi | shoby
[08:28] <ubotu> shoby: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:28] <shoby> any one chatting
[08:28] <yoshig3> arrenlex: No, I get 3d acceleration, but it's EXTREMELY laggy. Like, say I try to do something as simple as scroll a webpage or xchat's chat. it is extremely laggy.
[08:28] <arrenlex> shoby: In a channel with 843 people, yes, lots are chatting.
[08:29] <arrenlex> yoshig3: That's NOT normal. o_O
[08:29] <yoshig3> jb0nd38372: I'm using beta.
[08:29] <arrenlex> yoshig3: Is it like that right now? What does "glxinfo | grep ender" say?
[08:29] <arrenlex> yoshig3: If it's like that, you're better off using the open-source nv driver.
[08:30] <nothlit> shoby, if you need help, just state your question, if you want to chat, you can go to #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:30] <jb0nd38372> yoshig3: hmm which Nvidia card?  Before getting this one I was using a 6200 turbocache, and it ran things ok.. Hardware 3d accel worked, too, using the same drivers
[08:30] <yoshig3> jb0nd38372: nVidia GeForce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR PCI
[08:31] <yoshig3> arrenlex: But aren't those super unstable? and glxinfo | grep render or ender?
[08:31] <arrenlex> yoshig3: ender, because I forget if the r is a capital or not so I just leave it off. =P
[08:31] <snax> the nv driver is stable, just not accelerated
[08:31] <snax> afaik
[08:31] <arrenlex> yoshig3: the nv driver is a lot more stable than the nvidia driver. But not accelerated.
[08:31] <nothlit> yoshig3, you're using the 9742?
[08:32] <jb0nd38372> yoshig3: while you and arrenlex talk, i'm gonna google and see what I can find, I have another machine with that card, never even thought about linux on it, maybe i'll figure out something too :)
[08:32] <yoshig3> jb0nd38372: thanks
[08:32] <yoshig3> arrenlex: it says yes I get direct rendering and then displays my card.
[08:32] <yoshig3> nothlit: No, 9329, I can't find the 9742.
[08:32] <kelvie> Anyone here tried using a separate X session for running games?
[08:33] <nothlit> yoshig3, 9239 is definitely not beta
[08:33] <VMT2007> a better question is has anyone tried playing games
[08:33] <kelvie> eh?
[08:33] <yoshig3> nothlit: Well that's what it said lol, see?
[08:33] <jb0nd38372> yoshig3: No problem.. heck i'm new at linux / ubuntu too, but i'm determined and google / trial and error hasn't failed me yet... "kock on something"
[08:33] <yoshig3> !nvidia
[08:33] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:33] <nothlit> yoshig3, 9631 is the latest stable
[08:33] <yoshig3> nothlit: I have 9629, my fault.
[08:34] <kelvie> VMT2007: ?
[08:34] <sc4ttrbrain> i stupidly rewrite /boot/grub/default  ,should i copy that file from other ppl,or i need to reinstall grub ?
[08:34] <yoshig3> nothlit: Where can I get the 9631 and how do I install it?
[08:34] <nothlit> yoshig3, theres a non beta of that now btw
[08:34] <yoshig3> jb0nd38372: I don't know what to do, and what do you mean google/ trial and error?
[08:35] <nothlit> !amaranth | yoshig3
[08:35] <ubotu> yoshig3: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using this repository: deb http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ubuntu edgy stable
[08:35] <ndlovu> my (edgy) system seems pretty unstable after applying some recent updates. anybody else experiencing the same thing?
[08:35] <yoshig3> nothlit: see, it only shows 9629.
[08:35] <nothlit> yoshig3, that version should be the non beta version though
[08:35] <yoshig3> nothlit: I am using those. That's where I installed from
[08:36] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; did I loose you?
[08:36] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone...give me your /boot/grub/default ..please
[08:36] <nothlit> yoshig3, oh then I would recommend using the nv drivers, downgrading, or asking nvnews
[08:36] <jb0nd38372> jb0nd38372: I mean I use google to extremes and try something, if it doesn't work or breaks, and i'm unable to back track, i'll just start fresh, even if that means reloading.  Google is a powerfull search engine if you use the right syntax and search strings
[08:36] <yoshig3> nothlit: nv drivers don't work
[08:36] <nothlit> yoshig3, i suppose you could get 9631 from nvidia directly
[08:36] <nothlit> yoshig3, you mean your install started with no x?
[08:36] <jb0nd38372> lmao... but apparently I like talking to myself too
[08:37] <yoshig3> nothlit: If I try to use my nVidia card, yes
[08:37] <sc4ttrbrain> i stupidly rewrite /boot/grub/default  ,should i copy that file from other ppl,or i need to reinstall grub ?
[08:37] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: sorry, I'm at the office so I got busy with someone.
[08:37] <nothlit> ndlovu, it might be better if you could better describe your instabilities
[08:37] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; that's no problem I hope I'm not disturbing you
[08:38] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: okay what you need to do, is to install the following packages hpijs hpijs-ppds linuxprinting.org-ppds and hpoj
[08:38] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; can I do that with the package manager?
[08:39] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone just give me your /boot/grub/default ! please
[08:39] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: once you have done that, then sudo hp-setup -a ip.address.of.printer
[08:39] <rapid> sc4ttrbrain, grubconfig should make one
[08:39] <nothlit> sc4ttrbrain, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh grub
[08:39] <nothlit> oh
[08:39] <yoshig3> nothlit: any ideas?
[08:39] <nothlit> nm listen to rapid's advice
[08:39] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: yes, just type sudo apt-get install hpijs hpijs-ppds linuxprinting.org-ppds hpoj and hit enter
[08:39] <ndlovu> okay, let me rephrase. after applying some recent updates (which seemed to focus on gnome and gtk), nautilus seems to freeze very frequently, especially it seems when browsing samba mounted shares. anyone else experiencing that?
[08:40] <sc4ttrbrain> rapid: grubconfig can fix my stupidly written /boot/grub/default ?
[08:40] <nothlit> sc4ttrbrain, you do know the configuration file location is /boot/grub/menu.lst, and not default right?
[08:41] <sc4ttrbrain> nothlit yes
[08:41] <sc4ttrbrain> nothlit: ,actually its bit complicated, let me tell u
[08:41] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: grub-set-default will fix /boot/grub/default
[08:41] <familia> hi
[08:41] <yoshig3> nothlit: No ideas? Well I guess ubuntu just isn't for me, it's been working other than the graphics, but I can't live without my games. Gonna have to find me another windows CD.
[08:41] <kintaro0e> hi guys...how to redirect lsof output to a file?
[08:42] <fyrestrtr> kintaro0e: lsof > somefile.txt
[08:42] <familia> i have problems with my geforce
[08:42] <nepali|busy> rage,
[08:42] <kelvie> Anyone here know if only one X server can have DRI on at any one time?
[08:42] <drcode> hi all
[08:42] <familia> i have ubuntu
[08:42] <drcode> I have computer without internet
[08:43] <fyrestrtr> kintaro0e: are you just trying to search it?
[08:43] <nothlit> kintaro0e, if you need to write it to someplace other than your home folder you need to use '| sudo tee file.txt'
[08:43] <Bray> Hm, anyone know how to actually download the cedega cvs binaries? I found a tutorial on how to install them, but nothing on downloading them
[08:43] <drcode> is there cd  that I can download packges for easyubuntu?
[08:43] <nothlit> drcode, describe how you connect to the internet and you network setup
[08:43] <fyrestrtr> Bray: I suppose you would check them out of cvs using the cvs command line tool.
[08:43] <drcode> I use modem 33k
[08:44] <yoshig3> nothlit: So you start helping me then quit? Sweet.
[08:44] <kintaro0e> ok
[08:44] <fyrestrtr> drcode: do not use easyubuntu.
[08:44] <drcode> I will be easy if I can download dvd or cd?
[08:44] <Bray> fyrestrtr: When I tried doing the cvs command, it said "Command not found"
[08:44] <fyrestrtr> Bray: you should install it then, sudo apt-get install cvs
[08:44] <drcode> also automtix download from internet
[08:44] <nothlit> Bray, try another howto, or use #linux
[08:44] <drcode> I have xubuntu
[08:44] <nothlit> !compile | Bray
[08:44] <ubotu> Bray: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[08:45] <nothlit> !automatix | drcode
[08:45] <ubotu> drcode: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[08:45] <Bray> Well hot dang, cvs installed
[08:45] <Bray> Easier than I thought it would be...
[08:45] <fyrestrtr> Bray: generally, you'll find that with ubuntu :)
[08:45] <drcode> so ?
[08:45] <drcode> what I can use?
[08:45] <drcode> is there dvd of ubuntu packges?
[08:45] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Been using it for only a week and i already love it
[08:45] <drcode> that I can download?
[08:46] <igor_> hi, could anybody tell me where could i find a good presentation of linux
[08:46] <fyrestrtr> drcode: for multimedia stuff, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[08:46] <yoshig3> Can someone please provide me wiht some help?
[08:46] <nothlit> fyrestrtr, easyubuntu uses repo's, its not recommended but its not recommended against
[08:46] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; you sir are a genius!
[08:46] <drcode> is there ubuntu dvd for packges?
[08:47] <fyrestrtr> drcode: no.
[08:47] <drcode> so I can use it to install packges without internet?
[08:47] <fyrestrtr> tom_kelleher: got it working then?
[08:47] <Bray> fyrestrtr: How do I compile cvs? Or do I need to?
[08:47] <ubox> hey all
[08:47] <GeneralZarkawi> Bray, no compile, install
[08:47] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; prints perfectly!
[08:47] <fyrestrtr> Bray: no, you don't. Its installed already. Continue with the instructions on checking out the cvs tree.
[08:47] <drcode> k
[08:47] <drcode> thnx
[08:47] <tonyyarusso> drcode: Yes, there is.  You can download it from the ubuntu web site
[08:47] <ubox> !openswam
[08:47] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Thanks a lot, you've been a big help
[08:47] <tonyyarusso> drkm: It also comes with the Ubuntu Book
[08:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about openswam - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:48] <fyrestrtr> !openswan | ubotu
[08:48] <ubotu> openswan: IPSEC utilities for Openswan. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:2.4.5+dfsg-0.2 (edgy), package size 1536 kB, installed size 5568 kB
[08:48] <kishan> drcode u can dowload the packages individually and install
[08:48] <ubox> thnks
[08:48] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: okay, I'm going to try to help you.
[08:49] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: first thing, I need you to post your Xorg.0.log to pastebin.
=== nepali|busy is now known as nepali
[08:49] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: you'll find it in /var/log/
[08:49] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: brb.
[08:50] <x-r00t-x> hello . can anyone tell me how to format memory card ?
[08:50] <rapid> igor_, take a look at youtube and search for xgl :)
[08:51] <rapid> igor_: or www.onetux.com has a great XGL graphics video
[08:51] <fyrestrtr> x-r00t-x: mount it first (by plugging it in, and then making sure it shows up on your desktop). Then use gparted to format it.
[08:51] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36788/
[08:51] <x-r00t-x> fyrestrtr,  tnx :P
[08:51] <tom_kelleher> fyrestrtr; you wouln't know how I could scan from the printer would you?
[08:51] <nothlit> fyrestrtr, format something that is mounted? ^.-
[08:51] <ThePub> which process is the nautilus-cd-burner part of?
[08:52] <nothlit> ThePub, could you rephrase that?
[08:52] <Bray> fyrestrtr: You're rather popular tonight it seems
[08:52] <x-r00t-x> fyrestrtr, its doesnt work
[08:52] <gotit> sudo: alien:command not found , what should I do
[08:52] <nothlit> gotit, sudo aptitude install alien
[08:52] <x-r00t-x> gotit, sudo apt-get install alien
[08:53] <expo> hi I am trying to upgrade from hoary to edgy and I got the following problem while upgrading: problems while excecuting /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_1%3a7.1.1ubuntu6.2_powerpc.deb
[08:53] <nothlit> gotit, alien is not something that is particularly safe to use so if there are other alternatives for you, you should take them
[08:53] <fyrestrtr> Bray: yeah, if only it were with the ladies -- then I wouldn't be sitting here helping you slobs :P
[08:53] <gotit> dont have internet access on ubuntu comp, should i try to search for alien file
[08:53] <nothlit> expo, you need to upgrade to dapper first
[08:53] <x-r00t-x> fyrestrtr,  its works :P
[08:53] <x-r00t-x> tnx
[08:53] <fyrestrtr> expo: don't think that's a possible upgrade path.
[08:53] <igor_> rapid, no i meant in ooo word processr style
[08:54] <x-r00t-x> fyrestrtr, i found the memory card but i cant format it
[08:54] <fyrestrtr> nothlit: sure it is possible :)
[08:54] <gotit> nothlit: why alien is not safe, its on the web help to use it
[08:54] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: pastebin the output of glxinfo
[08:54] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36788/
[08:54] <rapid> igor_, theres heaps of documentation all over the web, try google linux
[08:54] <fyrestrtr> x-r00t-x: is it read only?
[08:54] <nothlit> gotit, because rpm packages are designed for a specific system and setup, which may not be the same as how ubuntu is set up
[08:54] <ThePub> nothlit: /usr/lib/nautilus-cd-burning/mapping-daemon is running.  tbh, idk what it is, but I imagine it's part of the nautilus-cd-burner package (which apt confirms), so therefore it must have something to do with burning cd's.. I have no burning, so the conlussion is it must be an unecessary process.
[08:55] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36789/
[08:55] <mike> #tor
[08:56] <x-r00t-x> fyrestrtr, no
[08:56] <gotit> nothlit: i am trying to install my intel graphic card , cause i think some screen savers are too heave for it
[08:57] <nothlit> gotit, well you definitely do NOT want to install any drivers with alien
[08:57] <gotit> nothlit: what should i do than
[08:58] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: is your internal video card disabled?
[08:58] <nothlit> gotit https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Video?highlight=%28intel%29
[08:58] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: I believe it is, it's set to PCI in the bios, but is there anything else I can do to ensure that it's disabled?
[08:58] <x-r00t-x> fyrestrtr, i am done :P
[08:59] <x-r00t-x> tnx
[08:59] <rapid> theres a new network if anyones interested irc.moonet.org check it out, its only small but just starting out. #linux
[09:00] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: did you specify the pci id of your nvidia card in the device section of xorg.conf?
[09:00] <Bray> This is more confusing than I thought it would be... alright, so according to the amazing fyrestrtr, it's compiled and installed and all that jazz... how might one go about playing WoW? And would it work if I had it installed in Wine to use it in cedega?
[09:00] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: yes
[09:00] <GeneralZarkawi> !moo
[09:00] <gotit> nothlit: i did that for the resolution, and it fixed my problem , but some screen savers are not running fine
[09:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about moo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:01] <nothlit> Bray, you'll need to install it in cedega i believe
[09:01] <jamesbrose> How do I find the UUID of a harddrive?
[09:01] <nothlit> !uuid | jamesbrose
[09:01] <ubotu> jamesbrose: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[09:01] <Bray> nothlit, is it basically the same as installing it in wine? Eg. cedega installer.exe
[09:01] <nothlit> Bray, try man cedega ... i wouldn't know
[09:02] <fyrestrtr> Bray: to play WoW, you need to read http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=5606&iTestingId=7491
[09:02] <mista> can anyone tell of a good hardware room, having problem witha mobo and need some help on it
[09:02] <Bray> fyrestrtr to the rescue! Haha, thanks
[09:02] <tonyyarusso> mista: There's a ##hardware I think - sometimes helps
[09:02] <thoreauputic> mista: #hardware ?
[09:03] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: hrmm....what kind of monitor do you have?
[09:03] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: Any ideas?
[09:03] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: Crappy Compaq MV 540, but the monitor shouldn't make any difference.
[09:03] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: is it LCD or CRT?
[09:03] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: CRT
[09:04] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: show me the device section that you have for it.
[09:04] <Frogbert> hello
[09:04] <Syco54645> so i was upgrading to eft and it died on me, then my power went out.  it died right at the x upgrade so now i am stuck.  can anyone give me any help?
[09:04] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: Device section?
[09:04] <Frogbert> Could someone please help me with a language/keyboard problem I am having?
[09:05] <huXfluX> hello! which encryption is better? blowfish or serpent ?
[09:05] <jpiccolo> you dont have a backup of your xconfig
[09:05] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: from xorg.conf -- where you identify the monitor.
[09:05] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: just re-start the upgrade, it will pick up where it left off.
[09:05] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: Lemme just paste my xorg.conf.
[09:06] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: oh no it wont... i have restarted it 3 or 4 times.  always throws the same error.
[09:06] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: and that is....???
[09:07] <Syco54645> dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_1%3a7.1.1ubuntu6.2_i386.deb (--unpack)
[09:07] <Syco54645> that is the start of it, i dont want to flood
[09:07] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: delete that file
[09:07] <RaFromBRC> anyone know why my PPC live cd would keep spitting out "authentication token is no longer valid; new one required" ?
[09:07] <huXfluX> hellllllllo?
[09:07] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36790/
[09:07] <Bray> fyrestrtr: That site you showed me is rather helpful when it comes to Wine, but I need help installing and running WoW with cedega cvs

[09:07] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_1%2a7.1.1ubuntu6.2_i386.deb
[09:08] <elfreakz> i cannot remove hdd icon on my desktop?
[09:08] <fyrestrtr> Bray: cedega is wine with a few tweaks.
[09:08] <tonyyarusso> huXfluX: Bah, that wasn't what I was hoping for.  If nobody answers, it probably means they don't know.  Try asking in a little while when some more people have joined.
[09:08] <fyrestrtr> Bray: to get cedega up and running, you need to download the source via cvs, and then compile and build it.
[09:08] <RaFromBRC> it's happening on both dapper and edgy w/ CDs that have already worked... but now neither of them will let me in
[09:08] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: i did that and it didnt work still.  it is complaining with this trying to overwrite `/usr/X11R6/bin', which is also in package xmame-sdl
[09:09] <Syco54645> and i cannot remove the xmame-sdl package
[09:09] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: ah, I think I found your problem.
[09:09] <Bray> fyrestrtr, Ah, I see... how might I get the source? I found a howto on compiling and building, so that's not a problem
[09:09] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: hrmm ... you are quickly venturing into a zone that I like to call 'reinstall from scratch zone' :P
[09:09] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: If you have, I will elaboratly sex you.
[09:09] <Syco54645> Bray: cedega isnt as good as wine is now
[09:09] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: now I don't know if I want to tell you.
[09:09] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: i really hate upgrading package based distros
[09:10] <Syco54645> Bray: wine can play alot of games that cedega cannot
[09:10] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: have you tried  sudo dpkg --config -a  and or sudo apt-get -f install ?
[09:10] <Frogbert> does anyone here know anything about getting a japanese keyboard to work correctly?
[09:10] <Bray> syco54645, WoW crashes and dies with the 1.12 update, and I've tried all the tricks, so I figured that I'd try cedega
[09:10] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: the apt-get -f install doesnt work
[09:10] <jpiccolo> cedega isnt free either is it
[09:10] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: try the other one :)
[09:10] <Syco54645> Bray: the cedega source is really old
[09:11] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: okay here is your problem, your refresh rates for your monitor are wrong. Your monitor's horizontal is 31.5-54 and vertical is 50-120 -- change xorg.conf to reflect that, save it, and restart X.
[09:11] <Bray> jpiccolo: It isn't unless you get the cvs, which is what I'm working on doing
[09:11] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: --config is an invalid option
[09:11] <elfreakz> how to remove the hdd icon on desktop?
[09:11] <fyrestrtr> Bray: for WoW you have to install the latest wine from source with patches. I had to do it when I was running it on Dapper.
[09:11] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: I wondered why I couldn't get more than 53hz in 800x600. That could be the rpoblem....
[09:12] <jpiccolo> Bray, oh ok, you search the forums?
[09:12] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: I'm not exactly sure how to edit it properly
[09:12] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: ah sorry - sudo dpkg --configure -a
[09:12] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: hit alt+f2, then type gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:12] <jpiccolo> what is a 64bit PCI-X slot?
[09:12] <Bray> fyrestrtr: So I can't just go into, say, Add/Remove and download and install it via that?
[09:13] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: its ok, but the process was halted because of too many errors
[09:13] <Bray> jpiccolo: No, actually, someone here told me about it... I can't remember who though
[09:13] <fyrestrtr> Bray: no, its the price you have to pay to play WoW (other than the subscription, of course)
[09:13] <RaFromBRC> nobody has seen this when booting from a live cd: "Authentication token is no longer valid; new one required.  You are required to change your password immediately (root enforced)"?
[09:13] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: hmm - your system is very sick, methinks
[09:13] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: well yes, it all happened because it told me to move the bin folder for the xorg upgrade
[09:14] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Well darn. So all I would need to do is install Wine via source, compile it and all that good stuff, then I can play WoW?
[09:14] <Syco54645> the update died and never started back up since
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: you want to change HorizSync and VertRefresh lines to reflect the numbers I posted. Yours should look like HorizSync 31 - 54 VertRefresh 50 - 120
[09:14] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: It's not allowing me to edit xorg.conf becaues I accidentally typed in my password wrong earler. What can I do to reenter it?
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> Bray: aye.
[09:14] <jpiccolo> i would check the forums and google, WoW is a very popular game, i would think there are how-tos out there
[09:14] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: can you move it back ? sounds odd unless you got the command wrong...
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: close the program, then hit alt+f2, type gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and try it again -- with the right password.
[09:14] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Ahh, ok, you have been a hufe help! Danke sehr
[09:15] <Bray> *huge
[09:15] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: what do you mean move it back?
[09:15] <fyrestrtr> glad to be of hefp
[09:15] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: reverse the command that caused the problem
[09:15] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: you *did* take notes of what you did , right?
[09:16] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: oh i did reverse the move, and it is still borked.  it wont let me remove xmame-sdl no way no how.  can i force a remove
[09:16] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Ahhhh, now I see why you tossed me to that site! It has a nice section named "How to install Wine so World of Warcraft works"
[09:16] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: i remember what i did yes
[09:16] <fyrestrtr> Bray: amazing, isn't it? :P
[09:16] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: are you upgrading from Dapper to Edgy?
[09:16] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: didn't work.
[09:16] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Indeed it is. Thanks again
[09:16] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: yes i am
[09:16] <jpiccolo> damn server boards are expensive
[09:16] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: i was using the update-manager
[09:16] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: hmm I can't remember the command but it's a dpkg --force-overwrite or something of the kind - check in man dpkg
[09:17] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: Had to nano it =\
[09:17] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: will do
[09:17] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: well as long as you get it to edit and save.
[09:17] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: now restart X with the saved settings, and note the FPS.
[09:18] <bobby> whats the difference between aricrack and aircrack-ng
[09:18] <fyrestrtr> bobby: the same as between Star Trek, and Star Trek: The Next Generation
[09:19] <rapid> I agree.
[09:19] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: so "31.5 - 54.0" and "50.0 - 120.0"?
[09:19] <thoreauputic> fyrestrtr: you mean even more lame ? /me runs  ;p
[09:20] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: yes, but sans quotes
[09:20] <fyrestrtr> thoreauputic: lol I was waiting for someone to say that.
[09:20] <thoreauputic> :D
[09:20] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: well that didnt work either
[09:20] <bobby> has anyone ever got kicked of this channel?
[09:20] <advcomp2019> i am having issues with ubuntu 6.10 on a compaq v4000 going into hibernate
[09:20] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: Sorry to keep bothering you, but sans quotes? There were no quotes in the xorg.conf before I chaned it.
[09:20] <thoreauputic> bobby: oh yes
[09:21] <fyrestrtr> yoshig3: yes, you typed them in your reply. I just wanted to make sure that you don't type the quotes in xorg.conf, otherwise X won't start.
[09:21] <nante> greets to all... how do i reconfigure my cdrom? i can not access it in xubuntu but i can access it in windows
[09:21] <fyrestrtr> bobby: you can try to find out ;)
[09:21] <paolo>  Hi.. I've edited fstab and changed noauto to auto for the cdrom; however it doesn't mount automatically the cdrom yet...
[09:21] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: hmm - out of ideas then - basically sounds like you need to identify the package then make the other one overwrite where needed
[09:21] <OkinawaInstructo>  /msg nickserv register betzold
[09:21] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: alright, saving, rebooting....I'll tell you what happens. If x doesn't start, though, I'm screwed, so I won't be back if it doesn't start.
[09:21] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: sometimes the easiest thing
[09:21] <Syco54645> is the one that you never try
[09:21] <fyrestrtr> OkinawaInstructo: might want to change the password now.
[09:21] <Syco54645> i am an idiot
[09:22] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: ?
[09:22] <Lam_> does suspend work properly?
[09:22] <Syco54645> thoreauputic: dpkg --remove xmame-sdl
[09:22] <Lam_> dapper would usually freeze
[09:22] <Syco54645> i thought i tried it before i came in
[09:22] <Syco54645> guess i didnt
[09:22] <bobby>  fyrestrtr  na im good
[09:22] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: ...
[09:22] <thoreauputic> Syco54645: heheh - ah well
[09:23] <advcomp2019> i had 6.06 and it worked just fine
[09:23] <fyrestrtr> nante: cdroms don't require much configuring, other than the odd case of scsi cdroms.
[09:23] <fyrestrtr> nante: what is the problem?
[09:23] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: what is the ... for?  i figured it out eventually.  not bad for during finals week and needing the box to get some code off of for class... my term project.  you would think i would have backed that up first.
[09:23] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: the naked dancing.
[09:24] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: and I would have assumed you tried the --remove already :)
[09:24] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: oh well that was called for
[09:24] <Syco54645> i thought i did
[09:24] <nante> fyrestrtr: i used that cdrom drive to install xubuntu 6.10, but i can no longer read from it now... i tried to boot windows, and i can access it fine
[09:24] <fyrestrtr> well glad you are on your way :)
[09:24] <Syco54645> i was so mad that i logged in as root just so that i didnt have to keep doing sudo
[09:24] <fyrestrtr> now please put your clothes on. Shakira's hips may not lie -- yours are.
[09:25] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: sudo -i
[09:25] <fyrestrtr> nante: does it mount?
[09:25] <Bray> I feel kind of dumb asking this, but how do I download the entire wine development package?
[09:25] <Syco54645> fyrestrtr: yes i know, but i have been using linux for years and years and years.  i am stubborn and i enabled root.
[09:25] <fyrestrtr> Bray: from their site.
[09:25] <fyrestrtr> Syco54645: ooh okay (I did that too) :P
[09:26] <nante> fyrestrtr: it does not mount. there is a bunch of errors in the dmesg command, i cant quite remember it because its at home
[09:26] <Bray> fyrestrtr: Of course! Why didn't I think of that! I'll tell you why! Because I'm a bit of an idiot, lol
[09:26] <advcomp2019> can people see my text?
[09:26] <fyrestrtr> nante: could it be a bad cd?
[09:26] <Syco54645> Bray: if you are still trying to get cedega working, it isnt worth it.  wine works much better now.
[09:26] <fyrestrtr> advcomp2019: you need to plug in the keyboard.
[09:26] <nante> fyrestrtr: no because i just let my kid watch dora the explorer from windows last night

[09:29] <advcomp2019> i have a compaq v4000 that ubuntu 6.10 can not got into hibernate but when i had 6.06 it worked just fine
[09:29] <deep> NineTeen67Comet, i love wzd :)

[09:30] <deep> NineTeen67Comet, wzd uses site commands, quite easy to configure =)

[09:42] <advcomp2019> is anyone having hibernate problems with ubuntu 6.10
[09:42] <Bray> Alright, while installing Wine I got this error at the "make" part: make: *** No rule to make target `depend'.  Stop.
[09:42] <Bray> What should I do?
[09:43] <Bray> I typed "make depend" and got that error
[09:43] <Pie-rate> cypher1: i already have all of the codecs installed, and i'm trying to play a CD, not an MP3
[09:43] <yoshig3> did fyrestrtr leave?
[09:43] <cypher1> advcomp2019, i had but it is solved now
[09:44] <cypher1> advcomp2019: you can look at bug 66637 which may help you
[09:44] <nox-Hand> thoreauputic: I think they should add Alsaconf to Ubuntu in next release...
[09:44] <thoreauputic> nox-Hand: it was removed because it caused more trouble than it solved
[09:45] <yoshig3> Anyone know how to install the LATEST nVidia drivers?
[09:45] <capiCrimm> -lGL returns a linker error, although /usr/include/ exists and -GLU works. Compiles without it as well, but I'd rather have it in there?
[09:45] <nox-Hand> thoreauputic: Ah, ,bugger.
[09:45] <thoreauputic> nox-Hand: that's a quote from one of the developers
[09:45] <nox-Hand> Well, why is there no binary install package?
[09:45] <thoreauputic> ? because it was removed?
[09:46] <nox-Hand> thoreauputic: Yes, but why can't you just get it with apt? Like, optional
[09:46] <capiCrimm> yoshig3, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA#Method_One or ubuntu wiki

[09:46] <umer> how to explore to c drive
[09:46] <thoreauputic> nox-Hand: ask the developers - it is deprecated apparently
[09:46] <advcomp2019> cypherl, did you give me the right bug number
[09:46] <cypher1> advcomp2019: are you facing the same problem as in bug 66637 ?
[09:46] <Pie-rate> umer: there is no C drive.
[09:46] <capiCrimm> no one knows why it wouldn't be able to find GL, I even used -I, but it just doesn't see it, so weird.
[09:46] <Pie-rate> there is only /
[09:46] <cypher1> advcomp2019: hold on let me check again
[09:47] <nox-Hand> thoreauputic: Hmn, okay

[09:49] <Pie-rate> umer: be more specific please. Are you asking how to get to your Windows XP partition from ubuntu?

[09:57] <Bray> yoshig3: Same here. He seems to know just about everything ever.
[09:57] <kane77> anyone can help me?
[09:57] <Bray> !ask|kane77
[09:57] <ubotu> kane77: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:57] <kane77> how do I turn on the wlan on laptop
[09:58] <Bray> kane77: Well what I do is I just hit the little button on my laptop that turns the card on, then I go to Applications>System>Networking and it shows up in there
[09:58] <Pie-rate> !wifi
[09:58] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:58] <el_> i have problem making command make 4. Run the make command make
[09:59] <kane77> Bray, well thats what it does in windows but not in ubuntu...
[10:00] <kane77> Bray, when I boot to windows first turn the wlan on and reboot to ubuntu it works otherwise it doesnt...
[10:00] <Bray> kane77: Works just the same for me. My wireless connection doesn't show up unless I turn the card on. Then I usually just set up a static IP because it's just easier that way
[10:00] <advcomp2019> one more thing is how do i get the wifi and mute lights to work on the v4000 too
[10:00] <el_> make command cant execute, it say no target specified and no makefile found.stop.
[10:01] <aWu> hello guys
[10:02] <yoshig3> fyrestrtr: hallo.....please come back....we need you....
[10:02] <Bray> kane77: Make sure Networking is closed. Turn on your card. It may start blinking, it may not. After you turn it on, bring up the Networking window and it should have something along the lines of "WiFi connection." Click the box to the left of it until there's a check mark in there, and it should work. That's what I do for mine anyway
[10:02] <el_> make command cant execute, it say no target specified and no makefile found.stop.
[10:03] <yoshig3> I really wish ubuntu would work better...I like it so much yet it has so many problems
[10:03] <yoshig3> If it wasn't as buggy it would take over the world
[10:03] <yoshig3> but it has so many problems T.T
[10:03] <Bray> yoshing3 It's not buggy so much as it is not as user friendly as Windows
[10:03] <yoshig3> It is buggy lol, it's free, free = terribly crappy normally, but ubuntu isn't too bad for free. I know it's not user friendly, but things that should work dont, I.E. my graphics lol
[10:03] <Bray> Which is why 80% of computer users use Windows
[10:04] <bobby> yoshig3: use somethign else
[10:04] <yoshig3> bobby: I'm about to but I don't want to have to
[10:04] <yoshig3> I truly enjoy ubuntu
[10:04] <yoshig3> I just wish it worked better.
[10:04] <bobby> yoshig3: what are you thinking about using?
[10:04] <Bray> yoshig3: I take it you installed your latest graphics drivers?
[10:04] <yoshig3> bobby: Probably go back to windows xp, or vista when it comes out.
[10:04] <deep> people have the wrong idea of user friendly..
[10:05] <Pie-rate> Bray: 80%? Don't you mean 95%?
[10:05] <yoshig3> bray: working on that now. if they fix my problems, I shall be extremely happy.
[10:05] <bobby> deep: totally...too many wrong presuppositions from there windows days
[10:05] <aWu> zzz
[10:05] <deep> Exacly
[10:05] <Bray> Pie-rate: No, I mean 80. 19% is Mac, 1% is Linux. Mind you these are rather rough numbers.
[10:06] <Pie-rate> deep: how is the windows user's idea of user friendly wrong?
[10:06] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: Well, windows actually works most of the time....
[10:06] <advcomp2019> i picked ubuntu because the other version on this compaq v4000 did not work with the ipw2200 very easy or just made the AP go crazy
[10:07] <deep> Pie-rate, well, for example, "user friendly" is considered as "simple", which is wrong
[10:07] <Bray> yoshing3: I have a free copy of Vista Ultimate in reserve for me that I'll get on my birthday; January 5th. About a month before the public release.
[10:07] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: exactly, why shouldn't ubuntu just work? and why is it "wrong" to expect it to just work?
[10:07] <deep> i saw this example once, about vim.
[10:08] <Bray> Dag nabbit, I always want to add an "n" to your name, yoshig.
[10:08] <deep> in vim, to delete 3 words, you just press d, 3, w. in windows, [ctrl]  + [shift]  + [<]  x3, [delete] 
[10:08] <Bray> I miss fyrestrtr, lol
[10:08] <mindflow> Hi. Anyone here got experience with setting up a TV card?
[10:08] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: it's not, and it should work. They shouldn't have released it claiming it works if it doesn't. I don't consider ubuntu stable, but it is definately much much cooler than windows.
[10:11] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: Although if I can't get my graphics working I'm definately switching back, no questions asked.
[10:11] <Bray> yoshig3: Amen to it being much cooler than XP. Though Vista (with Aero, of course) is about 1000 times better than Ubuntu
[10:11] <deep> A normal windowuser would go nuts and start typing, and when nothing happends they will say "Linux sucks", and install windows again..
[10:11] <yoshig3> Bray: Although Vista is a ubuntu clone somewhat, using the same "passworded admin"
[10:11] <jareth_> yoshig3: ubuntu = unix. nothing "should" work out of the box without manual configuring.
[10:11] <Pie-rate> Bray: how is vista better?
[10:11] <Bray> yoshig3: I don't mind that much at all.
[10:11] <el_> i cannot remove application in add/remove.. its say please use advance manage?
[10:11] <Storm> Hi guys i have ths project i'm busy with... NEED HELP! I have two Debian 2.6 servers one acting as a router and the other running Apache Web Server. My problem is that i have to set up a firewall, the one thats currently running does not allow any access from external addresses.
[10:11] <yoshig3> jareth_: That's why ubuntu is free, it doesn't work right. You pay for windows because they spend LOTS and LOTS of money on it making SURE it works.
[10:11] <yoshig3> jareth_: Although, windows is not a fun OS.
[10:11] <jareth_> yoshig3: ypu have to get it working yourself.
[10:11] <Bray> Pie-rate: Let's see. You don't need to type a rediculous amount of crap to install something. It always works right. You don't have to download drivers for everything you have just to get it all working. I could go on, but that seems sufficient.
[10:11] <richard-blaine> hello guys, what does the daily-build of edgy eft signify? im talking about http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/, does it mean the ISO includes the edgy release with updated packages?
[10:11] <dwa> Ubuntu is free because it doesn't work right? that's a classic
[10:11] <jareth_> yoshig3: ubuntu is not like " we support all sort of hardware available out of the box"
[10:11] <yoshig3> jareth_: Yeah, and unless I have a magic wand, it's just not happening. I've done everything possible to get it to work correctly, and it just won't.
[10:12] <yoshig3> jareth_: Ubuntu needs to focus on making and maintaining graphics drivers
[10:12] <lupine_85> ha
=== DreamThief|off is now known as DreamThief
[10:12] <dwa> yoshig3, that's not Ubuntu's job
[10:12] <jareth_> yoshig3: ubuntu can't unless hardware vendors create open source drivers.
[10:12] <lupine_85> it's not ubuntu's job to write graphics drivers
[10:12] <yoshig3> you guys know what I meant, fine, nVidia
[10:12] <dwa> hardware makers should get off their buts
[10:12] <lupine_85> nvidia do that.. and nouveau
[10:13] <jareth_> yoshig3: that's the whole f*cking prob ;)
[10:13] <advcomp2019> i have xandros on my desktop with windows and ubuntu.  my mom booted into xandros and she did not like it at all.  she was lost.
[10:13] <yoshig3> Well I don't think nVidia cares much about ubuntu
[10:13] <Pie-rate> bray: why are you in here if you think windows is better than linux? i for one will not be switching to vista because i like the freedom and security of ubuntu
[10:13] <lupine_85> you're probably right
[10:13] <lupine_85> like it matters :)
[10:13] <jareth_> yoshig3: you could be right about that...
[10:13] <dwa> the nvidia drivers are not half bad though
[10:13] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: yeah that's all nice but ubuntu just plain doesn't work correctly for me, I have installed just about every driver possible for my card and it will still not work right.
[10:14] <dwa> you obviously haven't tried an ati card yet
[10:14] <yoshig3> dwa: They are if they say they work great for my card and do not >.>
[10:14] <Bray> Pie-rate: I'm in here because I'm trying to get WoW working with Ubuntu, and because I think VISTA solely is better than Ubuntu. XP can kiss Ubuntu's ass
[10:14] <jpiccolo> i switched when i had to call microsoft every time i reinstalled a copy of xp that i bought
[10:14] <krivenok2> Is it possible to forward syslog messages via the network to remote host (using arbitrary port number, not 514)?
[10:14] <jareth_> yoshig3: from linux user perpect you could even think about boycotting the vendors who do not give proper drivers to the community
[10:15] <yoshig3> jareth_: Yeah but they don't care, they know that very very few people are going to use ubuntu. Ubuntu needs to charge, lets say, 20$ for a copy so they can pay nVidia to make drivers. I'm sure that's what windows and apple do.
[10:15] <Han> What'
[10:15] <Pie-rate> Bray: Vista will be just as insecure as every version of windows before it. I'm sure of it and I won't be switching to it. That aside, what problems are you having getting WoW working?
[10:15] <Han> What's the name of the debian console application to manage service? (not bum)
[10:15] <jareth_> yoshig3: for that go to another distro.
[10:16] <advcomp2019> the only reason i have windows xp still on my desktop is to play games like need for speed: carbon and a few other games that will nor work in wine in linux
[10:16] <yoshig3> jareth_: But ubuntu is nicer than the rest of the linux distro's lol
[10:16] <jareth_> yoshig3: various distros include proprietary drivers
[10:16] <Bray> Pie-rate: Well currently I'm having problems compiling Wine. I get this error when I type "make depend": make: *** No rule to make target `depend'.  Stop.
[10:16] <yoshig3> advcomp2019: Do you get extremely crippled performance using wine?
[10:16] <jareth_> yoshig3: well than quit complaining :)
[10:17] <advcomp2019> with some games but not all of them
[10:17] <yoshig3> jareth_: I will as soon as nVidia decides to be nice to ubuntu :D
[10:17] <Pie-rate> Bray: Don't bother, go to winehq.com, add the ubuntu repository to synaptic, and install wine from that.
[10:17] <jareth_> yoshig3: share your thought with the guys an girls from nvidia ;)
[10:17] <Pie-rate> Bray: that'll get you 0.9.27, the most recent version, and it works perfectly for me
[10:17] <Bray> Pie-rate: You mean you can play WoW?
[10:18] <Pie-rate> Bray: Yes
[10:18] <malt> is there any online tools that does scans to test a sites security?
[10:18] <Bray> Pie-rate: Really... So I've been bothering with this for nothing?
[10:18] <Pie-rate> Bray: you're probably following an old guide that's telling you to use a patch?
[10:18] <yoshig3> jareth_: Truthfully I think it's just too much a hassle to get ubuntu working right now. Maybe later on when they get everything right, but right now it takes way too long to config it to working even similarily to windows or anything usable for everyday use
[10:18] <Pie-rate> Bray: pretty much
[10:18] <Bray> Pie-rate: Yeah, and it's also trying to get me to install .24
[10:18] <jpiccolo> what are you talking about nvidia makes drivers for linux
[10:18] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: Craptastic ones
[10:19] <Pie-rate> Bray: Yeah, starting with .26 it works with WoW "out of the box"
[10:19] <echosystm> whats a good size for swap partition?
[10:19] <echosystm> i put 5gb
[10:19] <jpiccolo> why do you say that
[10:19] <echosystm> ive got 1gb ram
[10:19] <jareth_> yoshig3: you have to be willing to put a lot of time into a few certain things. i agree with that.
[10:19] <Bray> Pie-rate: Son of a mother... well I think you may have saved me a bunch of time... only time will tell, lol
[10:19] <yoshig3> echosystm: I let ubuntu do it for me, but try 2gb.
[10:19] <yoshig3> jareth_: Yeah, I'm pretty computer-savvy, but not enough for linux.
[10:19] <jareth_> yoshig3: but still the question is. who is to blame for that to happen?
[10:19] <jpiccolo> joshig3, why do you say that?
[10:19] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: If they were good drivers, wouldn't they be working for me?
[10:20] <yoshig3> jareth_: No one really except Ubuntu developers...they aren't doing a bad job, just need to try to make it a little more idiot-proof/friendly
[10:21] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, what are you having problems with?
[10:21] <yoshig3> BTW, is there anything like beryl for windows? If so...I'm going straight back to windows
[10:21] <AlexC_> Hey Guys,
[10:21] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: complaining about Ubuntu in an Ubuntu channel isn't likely to win you a lot of friends :)
[10:21] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: Extremely crappy performance.
[10:21] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: what graphics card do you have?
[10:21] <yoshig3> GeForce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR PCI
[10:21] <advcomp2019> one main reason for the poor performance with wine on my desktop is that i have an ati video card and i have been having problems with the drivers in linux
[10:21] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: nvidia drivers perform perfectly for me, just as good as they did on windows
[10:21] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, what card do you have?
[10:21] <yoshig3> thoreauputic: You weren't here for the whole conversation
[10:21] <mixandgo> hi, is there another mirror for Beryl ? cause berryl-mirror.lupine.me.uk is not working
[10:21] <AlexC_> I'm having some trouble with GRUB and Error 17. I have Ubuntu on a SATA hard drive, and a spare storage FAT32 IDE Hard drive. Ubuntu will boot fine if the IDE hard drive is disconnected, but I get GRUB error 17 when it is connect,
[10:21] <AlexC_> any ideas?
[10:22] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: especially when you are really complaining  about proprietary drivers, apparently
[10:22] <Bray> Pie-rate: How do I add the .deb to Synaptics?
[10:22] <yoshig3> thoreauputic: Don't try to put me down right now, I'm not in the mood for it.
[10:22] <Pie-rate> Bray: 1 sec figuring it out
[10:22] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, are you the one trying to run WoW?
[10:23] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: I'm not trying to put you down - i ubderstand that this is frustrating
[10:23] <Pie-rate> Bray: settings->repositories->third party
[10:23] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: I've tried every driver for nVidia cards possible, besides 9631
[10:23] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: No, I wouldn't dare try that with the performance I'm getting. I can run it in windows, but until my drivers decide to work correctly, it's not even worth trying
[10:23] <kane77> err.. how do I format usb flash disk?
[10:24] <_goofy_> fdisk
[10:24] <yoshig3> Although, after using ubuntu, it's like "How can people NOT figure out things in windows." It's so much simpler lol
[10:24] <yoshig3> Every time I think of someone asking for help in windows...just makes me chuckle inside
[10:24] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, run glxgears -printfps
[10:24] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, what does it say
[10:24] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: I get 1000fps without beryl and 500 w/
[10:24] <Mathieu> any idea when sylpheed-claws-gtk2 will be compiled to a deb for feisty amd64?
[10:25] <Han> What's the name of the debian console application to manage services? (not bum)
[10:25] <holycow> yoshig3, after using linux i wonder how people manage to actually do anything in windows
[10:25] <holycow> its all hidden behind a giant maze of wizards
[10:25] <holycow> you don't actually learn how to use a computer
[10:25] <Mathieu> (the source of sylpheed-claws-gtk2 is more recent than the .deb, and the existing .deb is not installable...)
[10:25] <thoreauputic> Mathieu: try #ubuntu+1
[10:25] <yoshig3> holycow: Not me, I can run windows pretty easily. That's why I want to learn ubuntu, windows is boring....
[10:25] <holycow> you get to memoriza thousands and thousands of wizards
[10:26] <StuckMojo> hi. is there something akin to debian experimental? (i.e. packages.qa.debian.org)
[10:26] <yoshig3> holycow: You shouldn't have to, that's why they're called wizards lol
[10:26] <Han> lets discuss ubuntu for a change
[10:26] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: imagining someone asking for help with windows has always made me part queasy, part "LMAO", and part homicidal
[10:26] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: lol
[10:26] <holycow> yoshig3, unless one understands WHY something operates the way it does a wizard simply lets you drive your directly into a brick wall
[10:26] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, why are you using linux then?
[10:26] <thoreauputic> guys, windows discussions -->> either #windows or $ubuntu-offtopic
[10:27] <holycow> anyway it doesn't matter
[10:27] <thoreauputic> heh #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[10:27] <Bray> Alright, I got the updates and stuff for wine, that mean WoW should work now? I'll give it a try and see if something bad happens again, lol
[10:27] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: Because it's nice, but if I can't get my graphics card to work I won't be
[10:28] <yoshig3> Actually, you know, this sucks. I'm going to reinstall windows once I get my cdkey back.
[10:28] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: have you considered upgrading your GPU? geforce 4 is pretty old
[10:28] <yoshig3> later on guys
[10:28] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: have a nice life :)
[10:28] <yoshig3> It was cool while it lasted
[10:28] <eMaX_> hi all
[10:28] <yoshig3> Thanks for all the attempted help
[10:28] <eMaX_> how can I exclude a package from the package update manager?
[10:28] <yoshig3> But ubuntu is just too un-workin for me
[10:29] <yoshig3> It shouldn't be this hard to install graphics card drivers lol
[10:29] <holycow> yoshig3, thats cool.  windows is the best solution for you.
[10:29] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: a geforce 6600 would be fairly cheap and would work perfectly, i'm sure
[10:29] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: I only have PCI lol
[10:29] <Pie-rate> holycow: oooooooooh, burn
[10:29] <yoshig3> holycow: ouch.
[10:29] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: well no wonder.
[10:29] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: OK - we got the point - see you whenever
[10:29] <Bray> XD, I forgot how to start WoW... I never did make it so I could just "wine wow.exe" because it didn
[10:29] <Bray> t
[10:29] <Bray> work before
[10:29] <holycow> it wasn't meant as an insult tho
[10:29] <Pensacola> what's the standart port for outgoing mail on an imap server?
[10:29] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: Yes I know I shouldn't expect much out of the card but it did better in windows than it is in ubuntu, that's why I've been trying to get it fixed for the past 3 days.
[10:30] <yoshig3> I will say one thing though. Linux networking pwns the hell out of windows.
[10:30] <Bray> Yaharr, I found it, lol
[10:30] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: if you aren't happy no-one is forcing you to stay with ubuntu
[10:30] <holycow> yoshig3, well maybe we can stop talking about linux vs windows
[10:30] <holycow> its really pointless
[10:30] <Pie-rate> Bray: once you've installed WoW, you need to change config.wtf so that it sets gxapi to opengl, and some sound things
[10:30] <eMaX_> I have a package that ubuntu thinks to be "broken" and wants to overwrite with one from the repository that I do not want. how can exclude a package "x" from the package manager?
[10:30] <holycow> if you like win use it, no skin off of our back
[10:30] <thoreauputic> holycow: +1
[10:31] <holycow> if you have a question ask it
[10:31] <SilentDis> 'lo :)
[10:31] <holycow> if we can't fix my appologies
[10:31] <yoshig3> ono, it's the thor-holy team!
[10:31] <holycow> you are always free to buy an ms licence right?
[10:31] <Bray> Pie-rate: Did all those already, lol
[10:31] <holycow> yoshig3, i really don't mean to be insensitive
[10:31] <yoshig3> lol, buy?
[10:31] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: this is getting close to trolling, sorry
[10:31] <yoshig3> BUY? PAY for an OS?
[10:31] <yoshig3> WTF is that
[10:31] <holycow> infact i compleetely understand your frustration and that you are just venting
[10:32] <holycow> but there are 900 + people in the room, venting is not really productive under such circumstances
[10:32] <wiking_> how to configure Picasa to show images full screen, not to fit screen ( http://81.198.237.8/Screenshot.png )
[10:32] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: please stop or I will have to ask you to leave - stay on topic or go
[10:32] <yoshig3> thoreauputic: I completely understand, it probably sounds like I'm trying to put ubuntu down, but I'm really not. I really do like it, it just doesn't work for me
[10:32] <Pie-rate> Bray: then go into the World of Warcraft directory, and type "wine WoW.exe" (case sensitive) and it should run
[10:32] <holycow> yoshig3, so stop editorializing and ask your question.
[10:32] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: OK - just stay on topic, please
[10:32] <echosystm> hmmm
[10:32] <yoshig3> Okay then. Make my graphics card work.
[10:32] <echosystm> what kind of system specs do you reckon you need to run VLC and ssh?
[10:32] <holycow> what chipset, what model?
[10:33] <holycow> echosystm, not a heck of a lot
[10:33] <yoshig3> I don't know what else to ask, I've pastebinned just about everything on my system, installed just about every driver, and god knows what else
[10:33] <jpiccolo> to run ssh
[10:33] <holycow> anything that boots a basic install will run ssh
[10:33] <holycow> i think you can run ssh on a watch
[10:33] <Pie-rate> yoshig3: stick around for a while, i'm doing some research
[10:33] <jpiccolo> a hamster and a wheel?
[10:33] <holycow> >_>
[10:33] <echosystm> right, so, i should be able to run ubuntu w/ blackbox on a fanless computer right?
[10:33] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: I tried but I can't find ANYONE with the same problems as me
[10:33] <holycow> yoshig3, what chipset and what gfx card
[10:33] <crazy_penguin> /whosi DBO
[10:33] <yoshig3> Pie-rate: I've even found people with my same card that aren't experiencing the problems
[10:34] <holycow> yoshig3, stop we don't care
[10:34] <holycow> yoshig3, what chipset and what video card?
[10:34] <yoshig3> holycow: Intel chipset, Geforce4 MX 4000 128MB DDR PCI
[10:34] <CyaNox> hi, Is there a version of ubuntu that has Apache 2.2?
[10:34] <Bray> Pie-rate: dag nabbit, it's doing the same thing it did last time... it pops up with some weird designs on the screen and a large square cursor
[10:34] <echosystm> i need a fanless computer of some type
[10:34] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, what problems are you having
[10:34] <echosystm> for my bedroom
[10:34] <yoshig3> holycow; give me a second to type, quit putting me down, I get it.
[10:34] <bXi> is there a way to read pure data from an usb device
[10:34] <boink> CynaNox: maybe feisty?
[10:34] <echosystm> so i can run my hax while im sleeping lolol
[10:34] <znejk_> anyone who got the i810 driver to work with s-out?
[10:34] <holycow> yoshig3, cool your close to having pretty good hardware.  link to your problem or brief explenation?
[10:34] <boink> but Feisty isn't stable
[10:34] <boink> otherwise, you can just compile it yourself. apache22 compiles nicely on ubuntu
[10:35] <CyaNox> boink: Its for testing so stable is not what I require.
=== zak is now known as llama32
[10:35] <holycow> echosystm, well for ssh only check this out: gumstix.com
[10:35] <boink> I would say compile it yourself
[10:35] <holycow> >_>
[10:35] <yoshig3> holycow: Well, I'm getting extremely poor performance. You know how it is when you don't have a graphics card drivers, like when you try to scroll a webpage, and it's super laggy to scroll?
[10:35] <yoshig3> holycow: Also, my windows draw extremely slow.
[10:35] <echosystm> do you reckon if i get something old and slow enough i can run it fanless?
[10:35] <holycow> echosystm, you need to define your requirements better
[10:35] <holycow> yoshig3, cool you need the nvidia accelerated drivers not the nv open source drivers
[10:35] <echosystm> ive got a p2 400mhz here
[10:35] <echosystm> with 128mb ram
[10:35] <boink> like a 486? sure, that will run fanless
[10:36] <echosystm> should be able to run vlc ok
[10:36] <yoshig3> holycow: And, if I drag my windows around, they decide they want to redraw 5K times until I stop dragging, and the icons on the desktop decide to redraw over and over.
[10:36] <yoshig3> holycow: I have 9629.
[10:36] <holycow> yoshig3, how far did you get in installing the proprietary drivers?  please tell me you didn't use th envidia installer?
[10:36] <echosystm> im pretty sure the cpu doesnt actually have a fan at all
[10:36] <Bray> echosystm: Blech... I didn't know anybody ran such cruddy systems anymore, lol
[10:36] <llama32> i was in here an hour ago asking about updating 5.10 to 6.06/6.10, and someone gave me a link... i can't seem to find it again on the ubuntu wiki, could someone point me towards it again?
[10:36] <echosystm> just the psu and chipset
[10:36] <yoshig3> holycow: No, used repo's and apt-get
[10:36] <Pie-rate> Bray: that's strange.
[10:36] <echosystm> i dont Bray, its in the shed ;)
[10:36] <boink> !update
[10:36] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  i had a similar problem with my nvidia card.  ran the envy scripts, it did all the work for me, and now I'm running fine :)
[10:36] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
=== Seveaz is now known as FeistyFawn
[10:36] <boink> !tell llama32 about updatedb
[10:36] <Bray> echosystm: Haha, that works
[10:36] <holycow> yoshig3, cool, how far did you get in installing the accelerated proprietary drivers?
[10:36] <yoshig3> SilentDis: Envy scripts? link? Info?
[10:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about updatedb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:36] <boink> !tell llama32 about update
[10:36] <yoshig3> holycow: what do you mean?
[10:36] <Bray> Pie-rate: I know it is. It's so freaking annoying too
[10:37] <yoshig3> SilentDis: Thanks, gonna look over that
[10:37] <echosystm> cool!
[10:37] <echosystm> thanks for the link jpiccolo
[10:37] <advcomp2019> i have one question, and i know it is off the topic.  i have a imac g3 with 64mb of memory.  what is the best linux for it?
[10:37] <Pie-rate> Bray: are you sure its wine 0.9.27?
[10:37] <yoshig3> holycow: What do you mean, how far did I get? All the way through, I assume.
[10:37] <Bray> Pie-rate: I think I've given up ever playing WoW on my laptop with Ubuntu anymore
[10:37] <holycow> yoshig3, well ubuntu comes with the nv open source drivers installed by default.  most noobies think those are the real drivers from nvidia but they are not.
[10:37] <holycow> yoshig3, did you follow this:
[10:37] <holycow> !nvidia
[10:37] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:37] <Bray> Pie-rate: Of course I'm sure, lol
[10:37] <jpiccolo> echosystm, really small too, theres a couple on newegg
[10:37] <yoshig3> holycow: BTW, x won't start with my card without the nVidia drivers, nv causes xserver to crash.
[10:37] <Bray> Pie-rate: Even if it weren't, it would be 9,26
[10:38] <yoshig3> holycow: yes
[10:38] <Pie-rate> Bray: are you running an nvidia card?
[10:38] <malt> is there anyway to bridge two totally different 56k lines to make 128k?
[10:38] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  they're just a 'simple' way to get the latest nvidia binary blob drivers from nvidia's website.  they work like a charm :)
[10:38] <Bray> Pie-rate: Nope, an integrated Intel card
[10:38] <holycow> yoshig3, okay cool.  you have the driver changed from nv to nvidia in your xorg.conf file right?
[10:38] <holycow> *nod* on nv crashing x
[10:38] <yoshig3> holycow: Of course, I wouldn't be able to use xchat if I didn't. I wouldn't be able to use x at all...
[10:38] <Pie-rate> Bray: what does "glxinfo|grepdirect" give you?
[10:38] <holycow> yes you would
[10:39] <holycow> you can use vesa instead
[10:39] <Bray> Pie-rate: I'll tell you in a sec
[10:39] <holycow> okay so you are then running nvidia binary drivers and you get these problems?
[10:39] <yoshig3> holycow: No I wouldn't, it doesn't start out  of the box.
[10:39] <holycow> impossible
[10:39] <holycow> vesa works on everything
[10:39] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  if you're missing the restricted drivers, the nvidia driver won't work, that's true.  I'm not trying to push you here, hun, and yes, doing it yourself DOES help you learn what's going wrong... but those envy scripts just save so much time... lol
[10:39] <Pie-rate> Bray: its also likely that an integrated intel card will have a lot of trouble running WoW with reasonable FPS, have you tried it on windows?
[10:39] <jpiccolo> !VIA C3
[10:39] <yoshig3> holycow: Well it didn't. I had to use a laptop next to my computer and get terminal commands off of here
[10:39] <Bray> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b
[10:39] <Bray> direct rendering: Yes
[10:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about VIA C3 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:40] <Bray> Yes I have tried it in Windows and it runs very well
[10:40] <yoshig3> SilentDis: yeah I know I'm going to try them as soon as I can
[10:40] <yoshig3> SilentDis: I really hope it fixes it. If it does....oh boy I'll rape you most likely
[10:40] <holycow> yoshig3, allright cool.  from that i would basically suggest to go back to windows.  thats a very difficult problem to resolve over irc
[10:40] <Pie-rate> Bray: what's that libGL warning from?
[10:40] <Pie-rate> Bray: wine?
[10:40] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  O.O
[10:40] <holycow> yoshig3, either its a driver issue or its a hardware issue
[10:40] <Bray> Pie-rate: From when I did "glxinfo |grep direct"
[10:41] <yoshig3> holycow: That's what I'm saying! basically, I think it tried to use my integrated card. So, I installed with my integrated card because my power source is too small to run my HD, processor, GPU and CDROM
[10:41] <_DeXteR_> a
[10:41] <holycow> yoshig3, what i would do my self is either go out and buy a new vid card or replace the mobo my self to something i know that works 100%
[10:41] <Pie-rate> Bray: that line does not contain the word "direct"
[10:41] <Pie-rate> Bray: I find that extremely hard to believe
[10:41] <kraut> moin
[10:41] <yoshig3> holycow: So I installed it, put my graphics card back in, which then xserv wouldn't start, so I had to install the nvidia drivers from terminal(you know, no X)
[10:41] <yoshig3> holycow: and here I am after sevral driver updates.
[10:42] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, did the live cd work fine?
[10:42] <yoshig3> holycow: and the card is brand new.
[10:42] <holycow> yoshig3, *nod* you know we do hit once in a while system hardware and configs that are just impossible to work with ... i had one bizarre situation with a friend where debian just died on a specific piece of hardware, yet the identeical mobo/system on another box was fine
[10:42] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: yeah but on my integrated
[10:42] <Pie-rate> Bray: ACtually, i don't, that's probably stderr
[10:42] <Bray> Pie-rate: What about the "direct rendering: Yes" part?
[10:42] <Pie-rate> Bray: one sec
[10:42] <Pie-rate> Bray: that's a good thing
[10:42] <advcomp2019> i am having a hard time finding a linux os for a imac g3 with 64mb.  i know it is off the subject but i need to be able to get on the web and word process.  and upgrading the mem is not able to be done
[10:42] <holycow> yoshig3, *nod* i wouldn't even bother spending more time.  it sounds like you did everything right.  i think its cool you tried, sorry we can't help.
[10:42] <yoshig3> holycow: I think it has something to do with magnetism...and the earth...and the ubuntu god...
[10:42] <jpiccolo> yoshig3, where do you live?
[10:42] <Bray> Pie-rate: A ray of hope perhaps?
[10:42] <holycow> yoshig3, believe it or not ... there are strange things like that
[10:42] <yoshig3> jpiccolo: IL.
[10:43] <yoshig3> holycow: lol, after all of this, I'm willing to believe it.
[10:43] <echosystm> um
[10:43] <holycow> i have one case right now, i can prove it too.  one woman has a computer in one room that reboots on shutdown IF THE SYSTEM is only place in that room
[10:43] <Pie-rate> Bray: does wine display the same error when you run it?
[10:43] <holycow> anywhere else on the planet the system shuts down
[10:43] <echosystm> do i want to enable edgy-security universe repository?
[10:43] <yoshig3> holycow: WEIRD.
[10:43] <Bray> Pie-rate: the libGL warning?
[10:43] <thoreauputic> echosystm: yes
[10:43] <Pie-rate> Bray: yes
[10:43] <echosystm> mkays
[10:43] <Bray> Pie-rate: Yes
[10:43] <SilentDis> holycow:  grounding issue to the outlet?  that's the only thing I can think of lol
[10:44] <yoshig3> holycow: lemme try what silent suggested...
[10:44] <echosystm> howcome that isnt with the edgy universe thing above?
[10:44] <echosystm> i never noticed it before
[10:44] <holycow> SilentDis, i cannot explain it dude, it is the most bizarre thing ive ever seen.  i is something that can be replicated
[10:44] <Pie-rate> Bray: googling, but so far no forum posts about it have been resolved
[10:44] <yoshig3> SilentDis: how do I install this thing? Just double click it?
[10:45] <Bray> Pie-rate: Well dang... I'll look around also, see if I can find anything
[10:45] <holycow> yoshig3, install what?
[10:45] <yoshig3> holycow: use the envy script
[10:45] <yoshig3> holycow: it's a .deb
[10:45] <Pie-rate> Bray: do you think you could paste the entire output of "wine WoW.exe" to
[10:45] <Pie-rate> !paste
[10:45] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:45] <holycow> yes ... but what does that do?
[10:45] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  you pulled the .deb file for your distro, right?
[10:45] <holycow> also what SilentDis said, it has to be a deb made for your version of ubuntu
[10:45] <yoshig3> SilentDis: Yeah, it says for Ubuntu Edgy 6.10
[10:46] <Bray> Pie-rate: Yeah, just a sec
[10:46] <yoshig3> holycow: this is the filename envy_0.7.3-0ubuntu3_all.deb
[10:46] <nothlit> yoshig3, double clicking on it should open it with gdebi, from there you can install it
[10:46] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  after you pull the .deb file, you can either dbl click it, and it'll run graphically, or... you can do a sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb
[10:47] <yoshig3> SilentDis: I like graphics :D lol
[10:47] <jpiccolo> we noticed
[10:47] <yoshig3> Alright guys, gonna try. I'll brb with results, or not be able to get on ubuntu at all because X won't start lol
[10:47] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  once it's installed, nothing will happen.  that's good, believe it or not lol
[10:47] <yoshig3> SilentDis: yeah, shouldn't i have to restart X?
[10:47] <Bray> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36808/
[10:48] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  after it's installed, hit ctrl-alt-f1 to drop to a term, log in, do a quick sudo killall gdm (kills x, gdm, etc), then type envy, and follow the prompts
[10:48] <jpiccolo> if you cant start X how are you going to click it
[10:48] <Bray> Pie-rate: There's the paste
[10:48] <holycow> SilentDis, what is this envy dealy?
[10:48] <nothlit> !x | yoshig3
[10:48] <ubotu> yoshig3: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto

[10:49] <spaceeman> Puis-je parl ici en franais ?
[10:49] <BattiS> glxinfo give me errors "Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"." and i have the nvidia driver installed, and it works :S
[10:49] <holycow> SilentDis, is this official ubuntu?
[10:49] <spaceeman> UTF-8 ?
[10:49] <thoreauputic> spaceeman:  /join #ubuntu-fr
[10:49] <holycow> why would anyone use this?
[10:49] <nothlit> Is this official Nvidia install script that hard to most people?
[10:49] <Narada> any way of installing java se6 yet? :)
[10:49] <SilentDis> holycow:  basically, it does everything to make sure you get a full and proper install of the latest nvidia binary blob drivers direct from the nvidia website.
[10:50] <nothlit> BattiS, you know its direct rendering in glxinfo?
[10:50] <yoshig3> well, brb.
[10:50] <holycow> SilentDis, i get what it does, i'm wondering if its official or yet another automatix like nonsense?
[10:50] <SilentDis> holycow:  no.  they're the ones off nvidia.  latest (both nvidia and legacy in script)
[10:50] <SilentDis> holycow:  oh god no lol
[10:50] <holycow> SilentDis, does this bypass the package manager?
[10:50] <holycow> sure looks like it
[10:50] <holycow> if it does it should be banned from suggestion in here
[10:51] <nothlit> holycow, if it has a launchpad page it has some endorsement
[10:51] <SilentDis> holycow:  it relies entirely on apt-get, looking at the scripts.
[10:51] <Pie-rate> Bray: I found a couple things suggested by various forums to try. Try running "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and changing the "Driver" line under the "Device" section to "Driver "vesa""
[10:51] <SilentDis> holycow:  no.  it just scripts it.
[10:51] <nothlit> holycow, things that aren't installed with the package manager are not always things that shouldn't be suggested
[10:51] <BattiS> nothlit, yes?:S
[10:51] <rausb0> !beryl
[10:51] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[10:51] <holycow> nothlit, that is such a rare situation ... a situation not likely something that a noob should actually run into
[10:52] <nothlit> lol, why does ubotu say that envy uses perl when launchpad says it uses python?
[10:52] <holycow> nothing wrong with learning how to use linux, but damnit package managers really should be renamed to sanity managers
[10:52] <SilentDis> holycow:  i shall be right back... x is doing goofy weirdo stuff.  guess 4 days is about it's limit, what with hopping in and out of games and all lol.  brb :)
[10:52] <nothlit> holycow, it is, if the nvidia/ati drivers from the repos don't work for them... which isn't that uncommon
[10:52] <holycow> SilentDis, good to know it uses apt ... its important to have a sane way out
[10:53] <FirstStrike> hmm..odd
[10:53] <nothlit> BattiS, are you trying to get beryl working?
[10:53] <FirstStrike> which is nothing in the grand scheme of things
[10:53] <holycow> nothlit, nonsense
[10:53] <FirstStrike> if x is unstable after 4 days..
[10:53] <BattiS> nothlit,  yes :D
[10:53] <reverseblade> !!! I was successfully running beryl. But suddenly it stopped showing the title bars and frames. Also when I open my terminal it shows a white rectangle on the screen. Any solution for this ?
[10:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I was successfully running beryl. But suddenly it stopped showing the title bars and frames. Also when I open my terminal it shows a white rectangle on the screen. Any solution for this ? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:53] <holycow> nothlit, for the ubuntu usergroup, if they cannot install drivers using a package manager they really should be using windows or whatever until we get our stuff to a point where they can
[10:53] <BattiS> how did u know?:D
[10:53] <Bray> Pie-rate: When I did the "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" command, it prompted me for my password and nothing else happened.
[10:54] <reverseblade> oh sorry
[10:54] <holycow> nothlit, i might agree if we were talking about debian users or something
[10:54] <reverseblade> *** I was successfully running beryl. But suddenly it stopped showing the title bars and frames. Also when I open my terminal it shows a white rectangle on the screen. Any solution for this ?
[10:54] <nothlit> holycow, no i'm saying the drivers from the repos don't always work, and thats when users could install the one directly from the manufacturer
[10:54] <Doow> reverseblade: #beryl is a good place to talk about beryl
[10:54] <SilentDis> that's better :)
[10:55] <holycow> reverseblade, #beryl
[10:55] <reverseblade> Doow, I am there but everyone is sleeping there
[10:55] <Pie-rate> Bray: did you put in your password?
[10:55] <bimberi> !envy =~ s/erl/ython/
[10:55] <ubotu> I'll remember that, bimberi
[10:55] <reverseblade> holycow, everbody is sleeping there
[10:55] <nothlit> BattiS, make sure you've enabled xgl correctly if thats what you're trying to do
[10:55] <holycow> reverseblade, beryl, glx, aiglx, and all that jazz is very alpha or pre alpha.  don't expect any sense of stability when using that stuff
[10:55] <Bray> Pie-rate: Yeah, and it just brought up "bray@bray-laptop:~$" again
[10:55] <Doow> reverseblade: oh, usually a lot of people, much more active than #ubuntu-xgl at least
[10:55] <holycow> reverseblade, yeah we cannot really help with beryl tho, its esoteric, bleeding edge and changes frequently
[10:56] <reverseblade> holycow, I know, but it was working perfectly. Suddenly it stopped. So it has the potential to work. this is why I am chasing it
[10:56] <nothlit> reverseblade, run beryl inside a screen session so you can monitor the errors, the use of screen is outside the scope of this channel
[10:56] <Pie-rate> Bray: that is pretty strange...
[10:56] <holycow> reverseblade, we try to focus on helping new users iron out basic ubuntu related issues
[10:56] <Bray> Pie-rate: I think my laptop is haunted, lol
[10:56] <Pie-rate> Bray: type gedit
[10:56] <reverseblade> holycow, I know, I 've been in this channel since 2 years
[10:56] <BattiS> nothlit, i can reinstall my nvidia driver, but it works so fine for me xD
[10:56] <holycow> ah okay sorry :)
[10:57] <Bray> bash: gedit: command not found
[10:57] <reverseblade> nothlit, how to do it ?
[10:57] <Pie-rate> Bray: .................. O.o
[10:57] <SilentDis> reverseblade:  basics first:  did you try a quick ctrl-alt-backspace to reset the window manager?  or even a reboot?  sounds like emerald stopped working for some reason.
[10:57] <reverseblade> SilenceGold, yes I tried both
[10:57] <Bray> Pie-rate: I take it that's no good?
[10:57] <Pie-rate> Bray: sudo apt-get install gedit
[10:57] <reverseblade> SilentDis, Yes I tried both.
[10:57] <bimberi> tonyyarusso: nice cloak :)
[10:58] <tonyyarusso> bimberi: Yay!
[10:58] <nothlit> reverseblade, the use of screen is outside the scope of this channel, install the package screen, and theres a great howto on the gentoo wiki, google gentoo wiki TIP screen
[10:58] <Bray> Pie-rate, alright, now let's try that other command again
[10:58] <reverseblade> SilentDis, I rebooted my computer, I added beryl-manager and emerald to my startup. It was working this morning. But somehow now I have this issue
[10:58] <SilentDis> reverseblade:  weird.  sudo apt-get install emerald emerald-themes (a quick reinstall)?
[10:58] <Bray> Pie-rate: There we go, now it opened up
[10:59] <Pie-rate> Bray: are you running 6.10 edgy? when i installed ubuntu it came with gedit already installed
[10:59] <nothlit> How is someone missing gedit?
[10:59] <Pie-rate> nothlit: that's what i'm wondering
[10:59] <reverseblade> SilentDis, I have never seen a reinstallation solved anything in linux. But I am gonna give it a shot right now
[10:59] <nothlit> Bray, what version of wine are you using?
[10:59] <holycow> its not possible, it must of been manually uninstalled
[10:59] <Pie-rate> nothlit: he's using .27
[10:59] <Bray> Pie-rate: Yeah, I'm using edgy... it might be because I'm using Xubuntu...
[10:59] <nothlit> reverseblade, its worked for me before
[11:00] <Bray> nothlit: 9.27
[11:00] <Pie-rate> Bray: that'd do it
[11:00] <reverseblade> nothlit, reinstalling ? fixed no title bars syndrome ?
[11:00] <holycow> Bray, in that case ... #xubuntu :)
[11:00] <bimberi> !away > chable
[11:00] <SilentDis> reverseblade:  nor have i, but I'm at a loss too lol
[11:00] <chable> sorry
[11:00] <msun> Help.  Newbie.  I am using the GUI and want to take ownership of a folder that I don't have permissions on.  Can I do this WITHOUT opening a terminal and having to "sudo" ?
[11:00] <chable> its this xchat
[11:00] <nothlit> reverseblade, no i had beryl working fine, but reinstalling a package has fixed something before
[11:00] <chable> im on 2 different ircds
[11:00] <holycow> msun, no
[11:00] <nothlit> msun, alt+f2 gksudo nautilus
[11:00] <jpiccolo> how would i find out the I/O address of my network card
[11:01] <chable> and if i /ame , on one of them , it goes on both
[11:01] <nothlit> jpiccolo, ifconfig
[11:01] <reverseblade> nothlit, how do I reinstall ? remove and install ?
[11:01] <SilentDis> msun:  yes... sortof...
[11:01] <holycow> msun, the idea behind permissions is that you get access to stuff you don't own basically.  you haveto learn to jump into admin situations via sudo, only administrator can change things like that.
[11:01] <holycow> ... that you DON'T get ...
[11:01] <holycow> anyway :)
[11:01] <nothlit> reverseblade, you could purge/remove and install again, or just use the reinstall argument in apt-get or aptitude
[11:01] <jpiccolo> nothlit, but its not finding my network card
[11:01] <Pie-rate> holycow: there should be a way to do that without a terminal
[11:02] <holycow> Pie-rate, well nothlit told you
[11:02] <Bray> holycow: Bah, those jerks don't know anything
[11:02] <msun> OK, I am trying alt-f2 route to nautilus ...
[11:02] <SilentDis> msun:  alt-f2, gksu nautilus.  that'll get you a root nautilus window.  you can change anything from there... but be careful, you can also fsck your system royally :)
[11:02] <deep> !hi
[11:02] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[11:02] <deep> :)
[11:02] <Bray> holycow, all the smart people are here, lol
[11:02] <holycow> you start up a 'tool' via gksudo or sudoe
[11:02] <chable> anyone knows why i cant hide thise Warning messages ?
[11:02] <holycow> you can do it with any tool running with priviledges
[11:02] <nothlit> jpiccolo, lshw -C network , make sure somehting actually comes up
[11:02] <holycow> the terminal just happens to be one tool
[11:02] <holycow> gksudo nautilus
[11:03] <SilentDis> holycow: thank you :)
[11:03] <holycow> etc. lots of ways to do it, people on say terminal because it really is very quick.  other than that use your imagination :)
[11:03] <bimberi> ... run from <ALT>F2  (no terminal needed :) )
[11:03] <echosystm> can anyone here recommend a text editor (preferably gtk) which has syntax highlighting etc. ?
[11:03] <holycow> Bray, oh so very clever way to wiggle some attention in here :)
[11:03] <yoshig3> Well
[11:03] <Pie-rate> echosystem: vim
[11:03] <yoshig3> that helped a little bit
[11:04] <yoshig3> but windows are still drawing slowly..../cry
[11:04] <Bray> holycow: I do what I can :)
[11:04] <echosystm> thankyou Pie-rate
[11:04] <holycow> msun, what i meant is that you dont' have a choice about sudoing a tool to change the permissions, but you cannot do it as a user that doesn't actually own the files.
[11:04] <Bray> Pie-rate: That little fix didn
[11:04] <nothlit> echosystm, gedit has syntax highlighting rofl
[11:04] <msun> actually let me rephrase my question.  i was running another distro which messed up on me.  my username was jeff.  now i reinstalled a new distro in / and have a new username jeff2 which i created just to be safe.  now i want the original "jeff" files.  what's the best way to get them?
[11:05] <echosystm> also, anything with a wysiwyg panel?
[11:05] <msun> shall i just create a new "jeff" and remove the jeff2 ?
[11:05] <yoshig3> holycow: Helped a little bit, but it still seems like windows are struggling to install. Also, when I ran envy, it said my card was unsupported by the drivers.
[11:05] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  just curious here.. how much physical ram is in the machine?
[11:05] <echosystm> doesnt need wysiwyg editing as such, just a preview panel
[11:05] <nothlit> msun, you could do that
[11:05] <echosystm> i really like that
[11:05] <echosystm> :P
[11:05] <Pie-rate> Bray: you need to restart X
[11:05] <yoshig3> SilentDis: 512
[11:05] <eMaX_> ne1 knows how to exclude a package from the package database / auto update?
[11:05] <Pie-rate> Bray: I don't know how to do that on xubuntu
[11:05] <echosystm> nothlit, im not running gnome
[11:05] <nothlit> eMaX_, sudo aptitude hold packagename
[11:05] <SilentDis> msun:  can you access the files at all?  (read access)
[11:05] <nothlit> echosystm, oh... um eclipse?
[11:05] <Bray> Pie-rate: The commands are all the same as on Ubuntu, and xfce is so like Gnome that it hurts
[11:06] <holycow> msun, gksudo nautilus and copy paste the files from jeff to jeff2 folder.  but ...
[11:06] <msun> yes, i can access them.  i was worried if i created a new user jeff it might somehow destroy or write over the existing /home/jeff folder
[11:06] <Pie-rate> Bray: try ctrl+alt+backspace (MAKE SURE YOU SAVE ANY WORK FIRST)
[11:06] <nothlit> bray, nah xfce is pretty different, they just both use GTK
[11:06] <yoshig3> SilentDis: Is that a clue to anything? Envy said my card was unsupported by the drivers....
[11:06] <msun> i'd actually like to just use the username jeff anyway
[11:06] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  ok.  i'm just trying to think of any other bottlenecks that might be causing that is all.
[11:06] <sc4ttrbrain> !.bashrc
[11:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bashrc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:06] <sc4ttrbrain> !bashrc
[11:06] <holycow> msun, the problem is that you will need to change the permissions recursively once the files are in your jeff2 folder.  you will need to open up a terminal and do something like chown -R jeff2.jeff2 somefolder/somefolder
[11:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bashrc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:06] <nothlit> msun, no just create the user and it will use the same home folder if you setup your home partition correctly
[11:07] <msun> OK
[11:07] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  did you grab the legacy ones?  i *think* your card is in legacy
[11:07] <nothlit> msun, theres a tool for it System -> Administration -> Users and Groups
[11:07] <holycow> msun, always make sure to have backups tho :)
[11:07] <Bray> Yeah, that worked, so now should I try running WoW?
[11:07] <holycow> what SilentDis said sounds correct
[11:07] <holycow> yoshig3, that would explain the crashing
[11:08] <Pie-rate> Bray: yeah
[11:08] <nothlit> yoshig3, do you need the nvidia legacy drivers?
[11:08] <yoshig3> SilentDis: No, because it said specifically on the drivers page that anything "GeForce4 MX" and above was not considered legacy
[11:08] <yoshig3> Lemme try to find the legacy list
[11:09] <Carnage\> What am I supposed to do in order to get my network device eth0 to obtain an ip from a dhcp server upon startup?
[11:09] <Carnage\> Currently, I have to do sudo dhclient eth0 to do so...
[11:09] <Pie-rate> Bray: working?
[11:09] <SilentDis> yoshig3: i'd almost say give it a wherl on legacy anyway.  you've got envy to 'fall back' on to fix it all for you (it pulls bad/old drivers as part of it's script)
[11:10] <yoshig3> SilentDis: True, envy is a magical thing
[11:10] <yoshig3> SilentDis: Because I have no other computer at the moment to find the commands to install drivers, so envy is pretty great
[11:10] <Bray> Pie-rate: Well a pop-up came up and said something along the lines of "Hardware changed. Wanna go back to default?" To which I said "No" and then my screen flickered as a bunch of things showed up on the Terminal and it said that 3D accelleration wouldn
[11:11] <Bray> *wouldnt work
[11:11] <Pie-rate> Bray: dammit. what does glxinfo|grep direct say?
[11:11] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  i was rather happy with it when I found it :)
[11:11] <Mikel0> help! my swap has been deactivated
[11:11] <_goofy_> reboot
[11:11] <yoshig3> SilentDis: I think I may have bought the crappiest nVidia card available, but it's the only nVidia card I could find that was PCI near my house...which...was....walmart XD
[11:11] <nothlit> yoshig3, you can use a console webbrowser like w3m ( which is installed by default) or link2/elinks for help when you don't have X.
[11:12] <Bray> X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
[11:12] <Bray>   Major opcode of failed request:  142 (GLX)
[11:12] <Bray>   Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
[11:12] <Bray>   Serial number of failed request:  16
[11:12] <Bray>   Current serial number in output stream:  17
[11:12] <yoshig3> console web browser? How does that work?
[11:12] <yoshig3> !pastebin | Bray
[11:12] <ubotu> Bray: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:12] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  x.x
[11:12] <yoshig3> sorry Bray I couldn't resist lol
[11:12] <_goofy_> walmart cards are crap....i work in the electronics dept.
[11:12] <Bray> yoshig3: I was gonna say, lol, it's not THAT big
[11:12] <stefg> Does anyone know wether there will be backports of openoffice.org 2.1 and vlc 0.8.6 to dapper? ... (LTS means Long Term Support,heh :-) )
[11:12] <yoshig3> lol I know I was just givin ya crap
[11:12] <nothlit> yoshig3, try typing w3m google.com in a console
[11:13] <Pie-rate> Bray: type mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf~ /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:13] <yoshig3> nothlit, you windows user!
[11:13] <Bray> yoshig3: I figured just as much, lol
[11:13] <echosystm> whats the diff between apt-get and aptitude?
[11:13] <nothlit> yoshig3, what?
[11:13] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  I hit up compusa and grabbed an evga one.  real basic card, virtually nothing 'extra' in the box... but it's a 7600gs with 256mb ram on it :D
[11:13] <yoshig3> You said console, not terminal lol
[11:14] <nothlit> aptitude has package searching and showing, and can mark packages as automatic so dependencies can automatically be uninstalled
[11:14] <yoshig3> SilentDis: I used ot have an eVga GeForce4 Ti4200, but the fan died on it pretty quickly
[11:14] <sc4ttrbrain> lynx google.com ;)
[11:14] <nothlit> yoshig3, the alt+f1-6 are virtual consoles silly
[11:14] <yoshig3> SilentDis: It was a decent card while it lasted
[11:14] <echosystm> cool
[11:14] <echosystm> thanks
[11:14] <echosystm> :)
[11:14] <Bray> mv: overwrite `/etc/X11/xorg.conf', overriding mode 0644?
[11:14] <yoshig3> nothlit: oh my bad, and wow, that's really cool
[11:14] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  heh, i got a box of various sized fans just sitting here.  if it fails, i shrug and throw another at it lol
[11:14] <yoshig3> nothlit: the w3m
[11:14] <Pie-rate> Bray: sorry, forgot to tell you to do sudo
[11:14] <Bray> Pie-rate, ah
[11:14] <msun> i'm using gksu nautilus and want to change permissions on a directory RECURSIVELY ... is that possible?
[11:15] <Pie-rate> Bray: answer n and then do the same command with sudo in front of it
[11:15] <nothlit> yoshig3, you can even get graphics/images in the console if you use framebuffers/directfb/or libsvga, but that's something for another day :)
[11:15] <nothlit> yoshig3, or even movies/videos :)
[11:15] <yoshig3> nothlit: that's truly amazing dude
[11:15] <Pie-rate> Bray: does WoW look like this, by any chance? http://forums.fedoraforum.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=10712
[11:15] <SilentDis> msun:  that sorta thing would be much easier from a console...
[11:15] <nothlit> msun, yes,
[11:15] <yoshig3> nothlit: never thought I'd see browsers in a console type app
[11:16] <Bray> Pie-rate: No, in fact, it looks a lot worse
[11:16] <nothlit> msun, right click on the parent directory, choose the permissions, and there should be a button near the bottom of the properties windows that says apply to everything inside or something alone those lines
[11:16] <yoshig3> Anyone have a list of legacy nVidia cards?
[11:16] <SilentDis> nothlit:  watching movies in a console using the ascii driver is a trip *giggle*
[11:16] <yoshig3> I think mine JUST might be one, but I'm not exactly sure
[11:16] <nothlit> yoshig3, they've been there for a long time :) thats what browsers were like in the beginning :P
[11:16] <nothlit> yoshig3, gimme a sec i'll grab the list
[11:17] <yoshig3> nothlit: Well, wow
[11:17] <msun> nothlit .. i was hoping there would be such a button, but no such luck.
[11:17] <Bray> Pie-rate: btw, when I did that command it prompted me for my password (which I gave) and the brought up a command line again
[11:17] <yoshig3> nothlit: I never thought something like that was possible
[11:17] <Bray> *then
[11:17] <nothlit> msun, there should be, lemme take a look
[11:17] <yoshig3> nothlit; If I knew this, I'd be running terminal linux on my old comps!
[11:17] <SilentDis> yoshig3: check nvidia.com.
[11:17] <Pie-rate> SilentDis: ascii driver?
[11:17] <Pie-rate> Bray: yeah then it worked
[11:17] <wackum> yo!
[11:17] <Pie-rate> Bray: restart X again (ctrl alt backspace)
[11:18] <Pie-rate> save work, of course
[11:18] <wackum> any russians?
[11:18] <Bray> Pie-rate: ok
[11:18] <nothlit> msun, its on the permissions tab, on the bottom, Apply permissions to enclosed files.
[11:18] <nothlit> msun, you are using ubuntu and not xubuntu, right?
[11:18] <nothlit> yoshig3, http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_32667.html
[11:18] <msun> noth: yup ubuntu 6.06.1 but i don't see it! d'oh!
[11:19] <SilentDis> pie-rate:  i had that going on my old dapper install... there's a movie player, or, i should say, a driver that'll let you output DVDs to a framebuffer, that framebuffer kicks it out as ascii-art text for you to watch lol
[11:19] <nothlit> SilentDis, aa / or caca
[11:19] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: actually you can do almost anything without X ( mail, copy files etc etc and even look at pictures)
[11:19] <Bray> I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that I should try WoW again
[11:19] <Bray> lol
[11:19] <yoshig3> nothlit: Well, damnit, it's not on there. My card is not legacy.....
[11:19] <thoreauputic> yoshig3: there are limits of course :)
[11:19] <SilentDis> !ru | wackum
[11:19] <ubotu> wackum:    #ubuntu-ru       /  Pozhalujsta vojdite v #ubuntu-ru dlq pomoshchi na russkom qzyke
[11:20] <yoshig3> nothlit: which means, this is gonna be just about impossible to find my problem lol
[11:20] <SilentDis> nothlit:  I can't remember anymore... you're probably right
[11:20] <Bray> Pie-rate: Well I'm still getting the messed up picture, but this time it had sound!
[11:20] <eMaX_> how can extract all files from a deb without installing them
[11:20] <nothlit> yoshig3,go to nvnews and search the forums, or google for it with your card, you might get lucky
[11:20] <sirmis> is there alsa 1.0.13 available to install ?
[11:20] <Pie-rate> Bray: yeah it should be exactly the same as before
[11:21] <zezom> is their a default root password for root after an install?
[11:21] <Bray> Pie-rate: I see, ok
[11:21] <nothlit> SilentDis, oh i was asking which one you were using
[11:21] <nothlit> !sudo | zezom
[11:21] <ubotu> zezom: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:21] <zezom> thanks nothlit
[11:21] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  as I said, you can always try the legacy drivers.  i THINK there's an envy for it as well.  check the site :)
[11:21] <SilentDis> !envy | yoshig3
[11:21] <ubotu> yoshig3: envy is a Python script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[11:21] <yoshig3> SilentDis: alright, lemme look.
[11:21] <Bray> Pie-rate: I should really go to bed, but we're actually making progress... so I think I'll stick around, lol
[11:21] <SilentDis> nothlit:  i'll have to muck with it again sometime.  it really was eye candy stupid lol
[11:22] <sirmis> 
[11:22] <nothlit> ooh someone fixed the envy factoid
[11:22] <sc4ttrbrain> Hey , how to see pictures or videos in terminal? (in ascii maybe ;) )
[11:22] <SilentDis> nothlit:  watching SW Epi4 in ascii-art was just funny :)
[11:22] <nothlit> SilentDis, lool :)
[11:22] <sc4ttrbrain> !ascii-art
[11:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ascii-art - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:23] <nothlit> sc4ttrbrain, use mplayer, and -vo aa or caca
=== _greenie_ is now known as _greenie
[11:23] <sc4ttrbrain> thanks
[11:23] <nothlit> caca is color ascii
[11:23] <osfameron> sc4ttrbrain: also check out JavE which does batch conversions, as well as being an excellent ascii art editor
[11:23] <osfameron> though it's non-opensource still iirc, it's free
[11:23] <yoshig3> nothlit: I don't know how to search on nvnews, there's no button....
[11:23] <wizo> hey, i installed flash for mozilla, and it works for playing videos on youtube, but not videos on spikedhumour, anyone has any idea why that is so?
[11:23] <SilentDis> nothlit:  it was 'classic' black and white what I was playing with, had to be aa :)
[11:24] <sc4ttrbrain> lol, thanks dude ! :D
[11:24] <Bray> Pie-rate: Will you be on later? As in like... around 2 Pacific Standard time?
[11:24] <Bray> PM that is
[11:24] <yoshig3> nothlit: nvnews categorizes everything under a GeForce6 into the legacy forums
[11:24] <nothlit> yoshig3, check the forums
[11:25] <nothlit> wizo, which version of flash
[11:25] <wizo> erm, 7 i believe
[11:25] <nothlit> @time Pacific
[11:25] <Ubugtu> Current time in Canada/Pacific: December 13 2006, 02:25:36
[11:25] <wizo> i downloaded it from the adobe site and installed it
[11:25] <Pie-rate> nothlit: i found aaxine
[11:25] <Bray> nothlit: That's AM btw, lol
=== igor_ is now known as igcek
[11:25] <nothlit> Bray, 24/h time :P
[11:26] <Pie-rate> nothlit: downloading now, i should be in for some entertainment
[11:26] <yoshig3> nothlit: I am, but I can't find a search button lol...do I have to be registered just to search?
[11:26] <Bray> nothlit: Right you are
[11:26] <nothlit> Pie-rate, ahh, you don't like ,player?
[11:26] <nothlit> yoshig3, can't remember
[11:26] <jpiccolo> how would i set forcedeth for my network card?
[11:26] <nothlit> yoshig3, i think so
[11:26] <nothlit> Pie-rate, mplayer*
[11:27] <Linux-noobi> !ati
[11:27] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:27] <Pie-rate> nothlit: ROFL!
[11:27] <Pie-rate> nothlit: sweeeeeeeeeeeet
[11:28] <nothlit> Pie-rate, :D
[11:28] <nothlit> Pie-rate, why are you using aaxine instead of mplayer?
[11:28] <Bray> Pie-rate: Hey, I'm gonna head out... will you be on around 14:00 for a little more help? lol, I feel so useless
[11:28] <Bray> Pacific that is
[11:28] <nothlit> wizo, have you tried 9?
[11:29] <wizo> nothlit, i will try that now
[11:30] <znejk_> anyone got any luck with i810 and tv-out?
[11:30] <wizo> oh btw, is there anyway to check if the laptop fan is working or alive?
[11:30] <Pie-rate> nothlit: Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x3c3)!
[11:30] <Pie-rate> weird
[11:30] <wizo> cause my laptop has been shutting down by itself and it feels really hot and i never hear the fan running anymore
[11:30] <jpiccolo> nothlit, lshw -C network doesnt show anything
[11:31] <Pie-rate> nothlit: I was just looking for anything that would play it as ascii art
[11:31] <nothlit> Pie-rate, mplayer does it, just look at all the -vo options
[11:31] <znejk_> is there a laptop channel btw?
[11:31] <Bray> wizo: If the fan doesn't run it might have something to do with your mobo/BIOS.  My laptop never gets hot anyway, so it doesn't matter to me
[11:31] <echosystm> i think i'm in love with xfce4
[11:31] <serishema> wizo: i had that problem with my acer aspire 3620, was caused by a huge matt of dust jamming it
[11:31] <nothlit> Pie-rate, mplayer -vo aa / mplayer -vo caca
[11:31] <Bray> echosystm: Ain't it great?
[11:32] <Pie-rate> nothlit: ok
[11:32] <echosystm> its f*cking fantastic!
[11:32] <wizo> oh
[11:32] <echosystm> :P
[11:32] <wizo> my laptop fan was making weird sounds before.,
[11:32] <disident> hi
[11:32] <SilentDis> nothlit:  shame on you, teaching new people to lo-fi everything.  *giggle*
[11:32] <Pie-rate> nothlit: don't have mplayer downloaded, working on that now
[11:32] <Bray> wizo: You may want to make sure it's clean then, lol
[11:32] <thoreauputic> echosystm: we don't discriminate on the basis of sexual preference, no matter how odd ;p
[11:32] <disident> Is the wifi with wpa and ipw2200 broken on edgy please?
[11:32] <Pie-rate> nothlit: color should be nice too :)
[11:32] <Bray> ALRIGHT! G'NIGHT EVERYONE! See some of you later perhaps??
[11:33] <Pie-rate> disident: its hard to find drivers
[11:33] <Pie-rate> Bray: i'm in here all the time
[11:33] <yoshig3> Hey nothlit: whenver my ubuntu boots, up, it shows an error right before loading X, and I can't exactly make it out. It's like..."can't allocate memory" or address or something
[11:33] <disident> Pie-rate, ipw2200bg?
[11:33] <SilentDis> have fun in the land of nod bray :)
[11:33] <wizo> hrm...
[11:33] <Bray> Pie-rate: Good thing, lol, I'll need your help still, XD
[11:33] <Pie-rate> disident: do you have drivers for your wifi card yet?
[11:33] <bobby> disident: i am using using a wpa card with wpa currently
[11:33] <nothlit> SilentDis, oh lol i have a whole folder of bookmarks named Console Obsession :)
[11:33] <disident> Pie-rate, yes it's have been working for a while
[11:33] <wizo> im trying to get the flash9 for linux, but it doesnt seem to have anyway when i go to flash player 9 under downloads, it sends me to the flash 7
[11:33] <disident> Pie-rate, now it's broken no ESSIS association
[11:33] <Bray> SilentDis: I dream of Jeenie! Except Jeenie is named Natascha! Bow chicka bow wow!
[11:34] <Pie-rate> disident: ah ok, yeah you can get wpa and ipw working, i don't exactly know how though
[11:34] <Pie-rate> !wpa
[11:34] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:34] <Pie-rate> bah.
[11:34] <Frogbert> can somebody help me configure scim?
[11:34] <Frogbert> pelase
[11:34] <nothlit> yoshig3, sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop                 and then startx and look at the error
[11:34] <disident> thx ubotu
[11:34] <Frogbert> please*
[11:34] <serishema> ok here we go upgrading (hopefully it will be an upgrade) my 2003 server box to ubuntu-server
[11:34] <SilentDis> nothlit:  i'm not sure if that should be shared with the world, or hidden behind an entire roll of duct tape, never to emerge into daylight again.  ROFL
[11:35] <nothlit> roofl
[11:35] <bobby> disident: if you had been using it, and set it up the way the channel suggested then pkill the wpa process and start it up again
[11:35] <disident> ok bobby
[11:35] <yoshig3> nothlit: I can't look at the error, it loads X or ubuntu too fast, I'm not sure which one it shows before. But also, a guy with a nVidia GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP card is using legacy drivers...I would assume this applies to PCI as well?
[11:35] <bobby> disident: by channel i mean the guide on ubuntuguide.org
[11:35] <yoshig3> nothlit: http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=47654&highlight=nVidia+GeForce4+4000+linux
[11:35] <disident> ok
[11:36] <jpiccolo> anyone think they can help me get my network card working
[11:36] <Pie-rate> nothlit: rofl, this is cool, think it'd work over ssh?
[11:36] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  should be in your log files... cat /var/log/messages i think...
[11:36] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: what's the problem?
[11:37] <wizo> i don`t think they have flash player 9 for linux
[11:37] <nothlit> Pie-rate, mabbe
[11:37] <yoshig3> SilentDis: cat?
[11:37] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, well the only way i have been able to get anything to see my network card was gentoo live cd
[11:37] <SilentDis> !cat | yoshig3
[11:37] <ubotu> yoshig3: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[11:38] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, ifconfig shows only the loopback
[11:38] <nothlit> yoshig3, ok,... install screen... and then type screen -S xorg... and startx inside it... then reattach to it with screen -x xorg
[11:38] <SilentDis> well, that was rude ubotu...
[11:38] <nothlit> oh ok SilentDis has a better suggestion...
[11:38] <nothlit> i'm biased toward screen and away from error logs lol
[11:38] <serishema> jpiccolo: sounds like the kernel doesn't know about your network card
[11:39] <serishema> jpiccollo: you will need to find out what type of network card you have and then load the appropriate kernel module using modprobe
[11:39] <jpiccolo> serishema, how can i get it o know about
[11:39] <yoshig3> nothlit: I don't really understand what you're saying
[11:39] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  cat is a simple program that, as I showed you, will just write out a file to your console.  that way, you can see the last lines easily, and pick out that message
[11:39] <jpiccolo> serishema, i did a modprobe forcedeth
[11:39] <yoshig3> so it's under log SilentDis?
[11:39] <nothlit> SilentDis, nooo tell people to use less, not cat
[11:39] <jpiccolo> then restart my network, no work
[11:39] <yoshig3> what file exactly would lit be, do you know?
[11:40] <Frogbert> hello, could someone please help me configure support for Japanese input?
[11:40] <SilentDis> nothlit:  good point lol
[11:40] <lovloss> The guys in #winehq sent me here. How does ubuntu handle the 'sound' tab in winecfg? It crashes every time i click on it. They say it is because my computer has no immediate midi support. Would this hurt my ability to access programs?
[11:40] <nothlit> yoshig3, /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[11:40] <serishema> jpiccolo: try scanpci? or is that a freebsd command. Sorry i haven't used linux in forever that's why i'm here cos i know i'll get stuck later in my server install
[11:40] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: what do you get in /var/log/messages & what does lspci say about the card? & what's card's make/model?
[11:40] <serishema> there we go, frogzoo knows :-)
[11:40] <Rebecca> well, my spanking new 320gb drive doesnt spin up.. so ill have to do the install another day. thanks for your help though peoples :)
[11:40] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  try this command:  less /var/log/messages
[11:41] <Rebecca> serishema: there is always something ;)
[11:41] <serishema> don't tell me that XD
[11:41] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  that'll let you view your messages log.  since the system is actually starting, it's not pausing on it, that error you were talking about should show up in there
[11:41] <Rebecca> serishema: that's why i just buy a new hdd for reinstalls ;)
[11:41] <serishema> rebecca: i would too if i wasn't a broke student.
[11:41] <lovloss> partition your data seperate from your system files :)
[11:42] <Rebecca> serishema: ahhhh. :)
[11:42] <woo> Could ubuntu install using RAID 0?
[11:42] <serishema> lovloss: reformatting is needed in this case because this is a miagration from 2003 server to ubuntu-server 6.10
[11:42] <nothlit> Actually ubuntu has a gui log viewer
[11:42] <Rebecca> lol
[11:42] <lovloss> ohhhh
[11:42] <frogzoo> !alternate | woo
[11:42] <ubotu> woo: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[11:42] <Pie-rate> nothlit: how do i display the video in the console instead of in a new window?
[11:42] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  you'll probably just wanna hit <end> on your keyboard to jump to the bottom of that log, too
[11:42] <wizo> is ubuntu 6.06 dapper?
[11:42] <lovloss> So nobody knows how to add midi support in ubuntu? is it considered a restricted format?
[11:42] <frogzoo> wizo: yes
[11:42] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, lspci gives me a bunch of unknown devices
[11:43] <SilentDis> yoshig3:  <esc> quits, of course
[11:43] <wizo> thanks
[11:43] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: so you have a card you don't know what it is, & neither does ubuntu?
[11:43] <SilentDis> wizo:  yes
[11:43] <woo> thanks
[11:43] <SilentDis> lovloss:  heya :)
[11:43] <lovloss> SilentDis: Hey you :3
[11:43] <serishema> where'd the automatic LAMP install option go in server 6.10?
[11:43] <SilentDis> lovloss:  worth a try...
[11:43] <SilentDis> !midi | lovloss
[11:43] <ubotu> lovloss: Trouble playing MIDI files? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
[11:44] <yoshig3> SilentDis: AGPgart is finding my intel card....
[11:44] <nothlit> Pie-rate, i'm not sure... I could look in man mplayer, but its a REALLY big manual
[11:44] <lovloss> As usual, SilentDis knows his stuff
[11:44] <lovloss> who is he, Shuttleworth? ;D
[11:44] <AlexC_> Hey,
[11:44] <Rookie_> !ati
[11:44] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:44] <serishema> never mind i guess i can just install apache and stuff later, would probably need to be manual since i want mod_mono and all that ASP .NET compatable stuff
[11:44] <AlexC_> I can't find a guide on how to install Beryl on ATI, XGL and Gnome
[11:44] <AlexC_> anyone know of any?
[11:44] <jrib> 3!beryl | AlexC_
[11:44] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, well the manual says its a realtek 8201CL PHY
[11:45] <jrib> !beryl | AlexC_
[11:45] <ubotu> AlexC_: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:45] <Helpmeee> ive just installed ubuntu but when i boot it everything goes black, can it be a graphic realeted problem?
[11:45] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, the motherboard is nvidia based
[11:45] <lovloss> AlexC its annoying, go to #beryl and talk to them. sometimes the actual devs are there.
[11:45] <serishema> helpmeee: sounds similar to the problem i had running the latest ubuntu on virtual pc, have you tried doing ctrl+alt+f1  and then editing /etc/X11/Xorg.conf to specify different graphics settings
[11:46] <Helpmeee> havent tried that :)
[11:46] <nothlit> Pie-rate, if theres no X to open it to, it will display in console though, don't worry
[11:46] <selinuxium_> Helpmeee: ctrl+alt+f1 and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:46] <nothlit> AlexC_, wiki.beryl-project.org
[11:46] <yoshig3> nothlit: I'm going to try the legacy drivers
[11:46] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, gentoo loaded the nic with forcedeth as far as i could tell
[11:46] <nothlit> yoshig3, ok, good luck!
[11:46] <serishema> that's even easier.
[11:46] <Helpmeee> ok
[11:47] <Helpmeee> i like easy
[11:47] <selinuxium_> :)
[11:47] <serishema> sounds like there's click through wizards and stuff in linux now. My last experience with linux was like 4 years ago.
[11:47] <selinuxium_> Helpmeee: when complete run    sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[11:47] <Helpmeee> when should i press ctrl+alt+f1 ? ;p
[11:47] <Pie-rate> nothlit: i tried sshing to localhost, it doesn't work
[11:48] <serishema> helpmee: if you are already at a prompt, you don't need to
[11:48] <Helpmeee> ah
[11:48] <yoshig3> nothlit: No script magic for legacy T.T
[11:48] <selinuxium_> Helpmeee: Are you sure you have install the desktop version?>
[11:49] <selinuxium_> Helpmeee: not the server....
[11:49] <yoshig3> !legacy
[11:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about legacy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:49] <yoshig3> legacy drivers link nothlit?
[11:49] <yakumo> anyone familiar how to burn dvd video, i have VIDEO_TS And AUDIO_TS Folders i try to burn it using k3b and selected the burn dvd data project but i still can't play it on my dvd player...
[11:49] <yoshig3> !nvidialegacy
[11:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidialegacy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:49] <Helpmeee> im sure that i installed desktop
[11:49] <nothlit> yoshig3, oh ok, go make me find the link :P
[11:49] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, you there?
[11:49] <Helpmeee> with alternative cd
[11:49] <Helpmeee> or something like that ;
[11:49] <Pie-rate> nothlit: is there a limit to how much bandwidth ssh can use?
[11:49] <echosystm> hrm. how do you get synaptic to popup the root password prompt when running as a user?
[11:49] <nothlit> yoshig3, http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-7184.html
[11:49] <yoshig3> nothlit: lol I don't know where to find it....there's about 400 different guides on installing the drivers and just as many versions lol
[11:49] <echosystm> you need xdm/gdm installed hey?
[11:50] <yoshig3> nothlit: Thanks so much :D
[11:50] <nothlit> Pie-rate, i don't think so, i've fowarded x over ssh
[11:50] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: which distro?
[11:50] <serishema> pie-rate: and sftp can easily saturate a 100Mbit link on anything better than a p100
[11:50] <nothlit> yoshig3, look at what ubotu messaged, you, you'll need those
[11:50] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, i am trying ubuntu 6.10 but gentoo was the only one that saw the nic
[11:50] <nothlit> Pie-rate, well it worked fine for me in ctrl+alt+f1
[11:51] <nothlit> Pie-rate, didn't ssh to myself though
[11:51] <yoshig3> nothlit: Yeah I was about to ask...how do I install these things, they're .run packages...and will I really need new headers? envy updated my headers I believe
[11:51] <Helpmeee> where can i find the latest nvidia driver for linux?
=== igor_ is now known as igcek
[11:52] <serishema> nvidias site probably has their binary driver
[11:52] <jpiccolo> helpmeee, nvidia.com
[11:52] <Helpmeee> ive already tried nvidias homepage, and the file size is 4,4mb. but the speed is so slow. it will take 1h 10min
[11:52] <yoshig3> serishema: This is the nvidia site, it's legacy drivers
[11:52] <yoshig3> !nvidia
[11:52] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:52] <yoshig3> or try envy
[11:52] <echosystm> Helpmeee. did you try the drivers in the repository?
[11:52] <Helpmeee> Noo
[11:52] <yoshig3> !envy
[11:52] <ubotu> envy is a Python script that eases installation of the official Nvidia drivers. Please see http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html . Developers may be interested in https://launchpad.net/products/envy
[11:52] <nothlit> Pie-rate, ok i just sshed over putty and it seems to work
[11:53] <echosystm> use apt-get to install:
[11:53] <echosystm> linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[11:53] <echosystm> nvidia-glx
[11:53] <selinuxium_> Helpmeee: if you need to just get it working select vga from the driver list during the dpkg-reconfigure. Then you can work within the gui
[11:53] <echosystm> then run nvidia-xconfig
[11:53] <echosystm> and you should be right to go
[11:53] <nothlit> yoshig3, that page also has a readme you know :)
[11:53] <yoshig3> When switching from normal to legacy nvidia drivers, do I need to change my xorg?
[11:53] <echosystm> yes
[11:53] <yoshig3> to nv I'm guessing?
[11:54] <echosystm> no
[11:54] <nothlit> the script should help you do that, or you can prolly use nvidia-xconfig
[11:54] <echosystm> i think its nvidia-legacy
[11:54] <echosystm> or something like that
[11:54] <Helpmeee> ok
[11:54] <Pie-rate> nothlit: it doesn't work right
[11:54] <Helpmeee> ill try that
[11:54] <serishema> does anyone know what the minimum connection speed and latency for remote X to work useably is. Specifically would it have a chance of being useable via a 3G/UMTS datacard?
[11:54] <echosystm> im pretty sure i remember them having a different name
[11:54] <Helpmeee> then ill come back here with updates ;)
[11:54] <Pie-rate> nothlit: it's really screwed up
[11:54] <nothlit> Pie-rate, try using mplayer to resize the video on the fly maybe?
[11:55] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: I've seen a report the sis900 driver works, what do you get after 'modprobe sis900 ; dmesg | tail -2
[11:55] <yoshig3> nothlit: what script? I'm totally lost her man
[11:55] <yoshig3> *here
[11:55] <Pie-rate> nothlit: what?
[11:55] <nothlit> serishema, depends  on what you mean by usable... you can do data/simple things, but no games or videos... there will be some lag
[11:55] <nothlit> serishema, you also may need to choose compression/encoding and limiting the colors
[11:55] <SoftIce> hi, is thee a consol network configuration tool once setup has been completed
[11:56] <SoftIce> similar to that of the server build setup?
[11:56] <nothlit> yoshig3, oh theres a nvidia-legacy-glx package from ubuntu btw
[11:56] <serishema> nothlit: sounds like it would probably anoy me if i was editing code over it and such.
[11:56] <nothlit> yoshig3, forgot about that
=== niere_ is now known as niere
[11:56] <yoshig3> nothlit: is here a ! for that?
[11:56] <nothlit> serishema, probably, use a console editor?
[11:57] <SoftIce> anyone?
[11:57] <nothlit> Pie-rate, try #mplayer
[11:57] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, i get a thing about forcedeth.c and sis900
[11:57] <yoshig3> nothlit: how would I go about running nvidia-legacy-glx ?
[11:57] <serishema> nothlit: i suppose multiple ssh windows would do the same job as remote X actually if i think about what i'd use it to do
[11:57] <yoshig3> apt-get nvidia-legacy-glx ?
[11:57] <jpiccolo> because i have tried foredeth
[11:58] <nothlit> Pie-rate, i'm no expert and that sort of thing falls outside the scope of this channel
[11:58] <nothlit> serishema, just use one ssh session + screen lol
[11:58] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: what's it say?
[11:58] <Lynoure> SoftIce: I do my command line network configuration usually just by editing /etc/network/interfaces by hand
[11:58] <nothlit> yoshig3, do you know how to install packages in ubuntu?
[11:58] <tovella> i just read an article about Mandriva's "LInux to go" (http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/12/0820259)  I love Ubuntu, and I wish such a thing could be considered a suggestion for the team.
[11:58] <yoshig3> nothlit: not really, I've followed guides but most of it is jibberish to me
[11:59] <yoshig3> nothlit: I feel worthless T.T

[11:59] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: cool, now 'sudo ifup eth0'
[11:59] <serishema> nothlit: i'm trying to avoid the overhead of virtual pc when doing linux stuff on my laptop you see. Maybe there's a way i could get the ubuntu environment to run ontop of colinux?
[11:59] <nothlit> yoshig3, ok, im gonna 'spam' you with ubotu messages
[11:59] <yoshig3> alright.
[12:00] <sc4ttrbrain> hey,i can see movies in ascii but how to see picture files(in ascii too)?

[12:00] <jpiccolo> such*
[12:01] <nothlit> serishema, if you're trying to do ssh, theres putty, and colinux easily lets you install gentoo debian and (red hat?) i think
[12:01] <tovella> selinuxium_: ok.
[12:01] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: can you see what might be the right interface from 'ifconfig -a' ?
[12:01] <jrib> sc4ttrbrain: cacaview in caca-utils
[12:02] <yoshig3> nothlit: Synaptic couldn't find nvidia-legacy-glx
[12:02] <sc4ttrbrain> thanks :D
[12:02] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, it has lo (loopback) and sit0 (Link encap:IPv6-in-IPv4)
[12:02] <nothlit> yoshig3, did you get those messages? i recommend aptitude first, for sure, but if you need a graphical tool you can use synaptic... also for basic programs (as long as they're not drivers) you can use the add/remove program under applications
[12:02] <selinuxium_> tovella: if you just want to purchase a solution http://www.engadget.com/2005/08/03/ubuntu-h2-another-bootable-usb-linux-distro/
[12:02] <serishema> nothlit: thanks for the info, that's quite a bit of choice with colinux
[12:02] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, i guess its sit0
[12:02] <jpiccolo> ?
[12:02] <yoshig3> nothlit: Yeah I got the messages, but synaptic can't find nvidia-legacy-glx....?
[12:03] <nothlit> !multiverse | yoshig3

[12:03] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: nope
[12:03] <serishema> that's weird a celeron 400 shouldn't boot in about 10 seconds
[12:04] <Sub> serishema, it mightv'e been on hibernation or standby
[12:04] <Sub> most likely hibernate if it was actually off.
[12:04] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, i never thought a nic would be this much trouble
[12:04] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, what is sit0
[12:04] <tovella> selinuxium_: i've seen the engadget link - to expensive for most newbies ( i want to help proliferate the use of ubuntu ).

[12:05] <serishema> oh dear, now i'm at a prompt and don't really know what to do next.

[12:06] <yoshig3> jareth_: Yeah it's enabled
[12:06] <TheGateKeeper> yoshig3, you using edgy or dapper?
[12:06] <serishema> ah, we're sorted. Server has good documentation :-)
[12:06] <yoshig3> edgy, I jsut wanna install the legacy drivers
[12:07] <nothlit> yoshig3, its nvidia-glx-legacy, not the other way around silly :P
[12:07] <TheGateKeeper> yoshig3, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_add_extra_repositories
[12:07] <tovella> selinuxium_ the first link is much different from what Mandriva is doing too.  My impression is they're using squashfs, unionfs, or some such similar.  It's done in a 1GB partition.  I've actually put the Ubuntu live_cd on a usb pen drive to do demos & installations.  Still it would be great if people could just buy it for the $65 or so I paid for my 2GB drive.

[12:08] <spx2_> i havent slept
[12:08] <zeeble> or take print screen
[12:08] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: the plot thickens: "The Ethernet hardware consists of two parts: a PHY chip, and a MAC chip. It's the MAC chip that requires the drivers. RTL8201x is a PHY only chip which does NOT need any driver at all. If you have RTL8201x in your computer system, there must be another MAC chip in the system too. Most likely, the MAC chip is embedded in the chipset. Please contact the board or computer provider to find out which MAC chip is in your system and
[12:08] <zeeble> or use gimp or if you have imagemagick installed, then man import
[12:08] <jareth_> spx2_: try PrtSc?
[12:08] <nothlit> spx2_, applications... accessories... its in there
[12:09] <thoreauputic> or install imagemagick and do  import -window root screenie.png
[12:09] <spx2_> jareth_: and i just hit it ?
[12:09] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: so what's the make/model of the mobo?
[12:09] <jareth_> spx2_: try it!!!
[12:09] <nothlit> yoshig3, just install nvidia-GLX-legacy
[12:09] <spx2_> jareth_: RIGHT! ,thx!
[12:09] <yoshig3> alright
[12:09] <serishema> when setting up /etc/resolv.conf if the machine is a DNS server do you need to include itself in the nameserver list?
[12:09] <SoftIce> can somebody tel me if there a consol tool to setup your network
[12:09] <jareth_> spx2_: works for me on debian...
[12:09] <SoftIce> and not editing devices in networking?
[12:09] <zeeble> hi... i've got a stupid problem.. how do you install apache2? i did apt-get install apache2 once and had deleted the directetories after a removal.. and now when i do apt-get install apache2, i dont get the /etc/apache2 directory
[12:09] <frogzoo> SoftIce: sure: 'sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces'
[12:09] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, its a biostar NF61V Micro AM2
[12:10] <nothlit> SoftIce, you need to elaborate
[12:10] <SoftIce> frogzooI just said not use interfaces in networking
[12:10] <nothlit> SoftIce, are you talking about internet connection sharing, dhcp server, what
[12:10] <SoftIce> nothlit: dhcp/static setup
[12:10] <igge> hello
[12:10] <nothlit> !dhcp
[12:10] <ubotu> dhcp: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0pl5-19.4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 108 kB, installed size 308 kB
[12:10] <zeeble> then edit the file frogzoo said
[12:10] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, ok well the chipset is a MCP61v
[12:10] <SoftIce> noo, not dhcpd
[12:11] <igge> has anybody has any success using bluetooth with ubuntu 6.10
[12:11] <SoftIce> I want to setup my box to either chose between a dhcp client or a static entery
[12:11] <SoftIce> and not edit /etc/network/interfaces
[12:11] <yoshig3> nothlit: According to the readme I don't need to change my xorg
[12:11] <igge> the send file via bluetooth in nautilus just hangs
[12:11] <SoftIce> use the same tool that setup provided on install
[12:11] <nothlit> SoftIce, oh for static you edit /etc/host file
[12:11] <nothlit> yoshig3, thats great
[12:11] <nothlit> zeeble, have you tried dpkg-reconfigure -phigh apache2
[12:11] <SoftIce> nothlit: is there a tool?
[12:11] <nothlit> zeeble, otherwise, PURGE apache and reinstall it
[12:11] <yoshig3> nothlit: lol don't make fun of me lol. brb.
[12:12] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, would it help to go into gentoo and see what they are doing that my nic is working?
[12:12] <nothlit> SoftIce, um theres a graphical tool, but for console the hosts file is pretty straight forward
[12:12] <SoftIce> and to set it to dhcp client?
[12:12] <zeeble> nothlit: i did apt-get --purge remove apache2 and then rm -rf /etc/apache2 and now there dir doesnt get createted.
[12:12] <zeeble> nothlit: and i did try dpkg-reconfigure, without the -phigh of course.let me try that
[12:12] <nothlit> zeeble, i think with apt-get its remove with a purge argument
[12:13] <zeeble> nothlit: yes. apt-get --purge remove <package>
[12:13] <nothlit> zeeble, oh nm misread
[12:13] <zeeble> hm. ok
[12:13] <zeeble> i just want to get A2 running and feel like a retard cos it doesnt!!
[12:13] <nothlit> a2?
[12:13] <zeeble> apache2
[12:13] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: couldn't hurt, no
[12:13] <tonyyarusso> zeeble: Just walked in on this - what about apache?
[12:14] <SoftIce> nothlit *sigh* you dont understand what im trying to do, I have a ubuntu server setup! right. ive moved drives to a new box, eth0 does not exsist only eth1 there are 2 cards in the machine, I cant ping my gateway
[12:14] <SoftIce> so I need to do some tests and to see what the error is!
[12:14] <SoftIce> how do I load eg: to sysutil on freebsd
[12:14] <modern> out of interest
[12:14] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, ok will do
[12:14] <Gumby> SoftIce: your route is probably wrong
[12:14] <SoftIce> to configure the system once the box is setup
[12:14] <SoftIce> Gumby: my route is not wrong, because even if you dont add a default gw, or any route you should still ping the gateway
[12:14] <zeeble> tonyyarusso: um. i had apache2 working, then removed it with apt-get --purge remove apache2 and then rm -rf /etc/apache2/ now.. when i try to apt-get install apache2, it doesnt create the apache2.conf in /etc/apache.. that's what.
[12:14] <SoftIce> as its local to the assigned ip
[12:15] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, ok well the chipset is a MCP61s no MCO61v
[12:15] <SoftIce> is there  atool like sysutil on freebsd
[12:15] <SoftIce> to configure a system once its setup
[12:15] <SoftIce> a consol tool?
[12:15] <Gumby> SoftIce: thats not true at all.  if yor route is wrong the pc doesnt know how to get to the gateway
[12:15] <nothlit> zeeble, so the reconfiguring didn't work?
[12:15] <serishema> never mind, figured out the answer was yes
[12:15] <tonyyarusso> zeeble: Does dpkg-reconfigure?
[12:15] <zeeble> nothlit: doing.
[12:15] <igge> bluetooth and edgy? any ideas?
[12:15] <SoftIce> Gumby: what? ive added an ip address, you should be able to ping any ip on the local lan, eeven the gateway
[12:15] <zeeble> tonyyarusso: dpkg-reconfigure apache2 didnt work. now i'll try it with phigh as nothlit suggested
[12:15] <SoftIce> the IP is correct, the mask is correct and so is the b/c and network
[12:16] <SoftIce> FFS!
[12:16] <Gumby> SoftIce: ok, thats great. how about the routing table
[12:16] <zeeble> nothlit tonyyarusso no.it didnt work. it doesnt even create /etc/apache2/
[12:16] <tonyyarusso> zeeble: any error output?
[12:16] <SoftIce> I just want to know is there at ool similar to sysconfig on fbsd
[12:16] <SoftIce> so I can configure a system once its completed
[12:16] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, bios says it a Nvidia mac
[12:16] <SoftIce> eg: set networking, etc etc
[12:16] <zeeble> tonyyarusso: nothing atall!!
[12:16] <SoftIce> detect hardware
[12:17] <menisk> What's softwae should I use to make an ftp server, as well as an irc server and a dns server?
[12:17] <SoftIce> so and and so on
[12:17] <tonyyarusso> zeeble: Maybe remove the other directories?  (/var/www/, /var/lib/apache2 or something - use 'locate')
[12:17] <SoftIce> menisk: vsftp, unreal ircd, and BIND name serer
[12:17] <zeeble> tonyyserver: yikes. that's crappy work.
[12:17] <zeeble> but let me try.
[12:17] <zeeble> :s
[12:17] <tonyyarusso> menisk: vsftpd and BIND, not sure about irc
[12:17] <nothlit> it doesn't make sense, purging should work
[12:17] <zeeble> i know
[12:17] <Gumby> SoftIce: well, if you know it all (and it seems you do) just open up a console and type net(tab tab)  see what shows up
[12:17] <tonyyarusso> nothlit: Yeah, I'm confused
[12:18] <menisk> Thanks softice, and how to i enable all the repositories to download these through synaptic?
[12:18] <vector_sum> folks, networkmanager used to work, but doesn't anymore, who should I talk to?
[12:18] <zeeble> i thought it would recreate... so i deleted the dir in the first place

[12:18] <vector_sum> lsmod?
[12:18] <SoftIce> no automated tool like in setup
[12:19] <vector_sum> hmm hmm

[12:19] <Gumby> SoftIce: www.google.com will help you find your answers quite easily
[12:19] <nothlit> lshw -C network
[12:19] <Helpmeee> xserver can find my graphics card
[12:19] <Lynoure> SoftIce: sudo lshw  is nice for that
[12:19] <Gumby> SoftIce: lspci or lshw
[12:19] <menisk> Softice, cant device manaher do that
[12:19] <Helpmeee> cant*
[12:19] <zeeble> from the console.
[12:19] <nothlit> menisk, he wants a console tool
[12:20] <zeeble> apt-get reinstall didnt do it either
[12:20] <zeeble> let me purge all apache2 related packages then
[12:20] <Helpmeee> how do i install nvidia drivers in linux?
[12:20] <jrib> !nvidia | Helpmeee
[12:20] <ubotu> Helpmeee: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:20] <nothlit> zeeble, maybe libapache2-mod-php5 is preserving the apache config or something?
[12:21] <nothlit> zeeble, try sudo aptitude purge ~c
[12:21] <zeeble> nothlit: well.. my config isnt anywhere..
[12:21] <zeeble> let me try this.
[12:21] <zeeble> 2 mins
[12:21] <nothlit> zeeble, yeah but it could be trying to preserve the nonexistent config
[12:21] <zeeble> oh
[12:21] <nothlit> i don't know, just reaally guessing here
[12:21] <zeeble> let me purge it too
[12:22] <zeeble> no. could be :)
[12:22] <Helpmeee> ubotu, I cant get into ubuntu I can only access the command line
[12:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I cant get into ubuntu I can only access the command line - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:22] <nothlit> Helpmeee, sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx
[12:22] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, in gentoo i did dmesg and at one point it says "Invalid MAC address detected: xx:xx Please complain to your hardware vendor"
[12:23] <jareth_> Helpmee: w3m https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:23] <serishema> what do people reckon nfs-kernel-server or the usermode one?
[12:23] <jareth_> Helpmee: ubotu=bot ;)
[12:23] <tovella> ubotu: try this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:23] <nothlit> !nfs
[12:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about try this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:23] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[12:24] <nothlit> tovella, ubotu is a bot btw
[12:24] <Gumby> zeeble: which directory is it that you have accidentally removed?
[12:24] <tovella> nothlit: OK thnx.
[12:24] <zeeble> Gumby: not accidentally. i rm -rfed it knowingly. /etc/apache2/
[12:24] <zeeble> after purge removing apache2
[12:24] <vector_sum> does anyone have a clue why networkmanager refuses to do anything sensible? It all started when I used the old network configuration tool to configure for a static ip network; it has said 'no network' ever since
[12:25] <tovella> Helpmeee: try this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:25] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, you there?
[12:25] <serishema> nolith: oh i see. I actually want to install samba. now i'm on the right track
[12:26] <nothlit> !samba | serishema
[12:26] <ubotu> serishema: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[12:26] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: yes, I'm here, not sure what to do here, can't seem to find any reports of it working for people
[12:26] <nothlit> serishema, if you have problems, make sure you uses smbpasswd
[12:26] <nothlit> serishema, used*
[12:26] <nothlit> serishema, and smbfs is pretty great
[12:26] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, i know or they say they got it working but dont say how
[12:27] <zeeble> nothlit: looks like you were correct. removing every apache2* package, including libabapache2-mod-php5 helped.
[12:27] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, gentoo says its using forcedeth.c
[12:27] <Gumby> zeeble: apt-get remove --purge apache2-common && apt-get install apache2-common was the key
[12:27] <nothlit> zeeble, thats great :)
[12:27] <zeeble> Gumby: hm. i removed apache2-common and reinstalled too. so guess that's it then :D
[12:27] <zeeble> thanks all.
[12:28] <nou> hmm concerning launchpad, is there a way to specify the Importance field when adding a comment ?
[12:28] <frogzoo> jpiccolo: yep - you can get the source from nvidia apparently & compile/install that, worth a shot
[12:28] <Gumby> zeeble: I just tested with apt-get install apache2, rm -Rf /etc/apache2, apt-get remove --purge apache2-common, apt-get install apache2
[12:28] <zeeble> meh. it still wont process php5. now to look inside the file
[12:28] <echosystm> the shutdown button in xfce doesnt work, is this because i dont have gdm installed?
[12:28] <jrib> nou: no, only menebers of the QA team can
[12:28] <echosystm> anyone?
[12:28] <geraki> hi folks! I am trying to connect to a pc within my lan and transfer a file with 'scp' (secure copy), should the other pc be running any particular program? I get "connection refused"
[12:28] <jrib> nou: s/menebers/members
[12:29] <Gumby> zeeble: you'll need to purge then again remove the apache php5 module
[12:29] <echosystm> also, will gdm enable synaptic use as a normal user (by entering root password) ?
[12:29] <nou> jrib: ok thx
[12:29] <zeeble> Gumby: which module?
[12:29] <Gumby> zeeble: you have libapache2-mod-php5  installed?
[12:29] <frogzoo> geraki: it needs to be running sshd
[12:29] <zeeble> Gumby: yes
[12:29] <geraki> ok thanks will try
[12:29] <zeeble> Gumby: i installed apache2, apache2-common and libapache2-mod-php5 in one go
[12:30] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, ok, this is a pain considering i dont have network access
[12:30] <Gumby> purge it (apt-get remove --purge libapache2-mod-hp5) and then reinstall
[12:30] <Gumby> I'll have to test to see if mine works in a default install.  one sec
[12:30] <zeeble> Gumby: purge libapachemod and reinstall the whole lot, or jus tthe mod?
[12:31] <mikl> how do you find out what clock speed your RAM is running?
[12:31] <tovella> geraki: you'll find sshd as part of the package openssh-server
[12:31] <nothlit> zeeble, was php5 installed after the apache?
[12:31] <zeeble> nothlit: before
[12:32] <nothlit> zeeble, well :P
[12:32] <zeeble> nothlit: :p
[12:32] <zeeble> geez
[12:32] <zeeble> well, isnt just editing the apache2.conf going to solve that?
[12:32] <jpiccolo> frogzoo, where would i get that?
[12:32] <Gumby> zeeble: like I said, if it was installed after it need to be purged then reinstalld
[12:32] <Gumby> why edit when you can have it automated :)

[12:33] <nothlit> zeeble, maybe, but i'm lazy and wouldn't want to figure out how to do that
[12:33] <zeeble> nothlit: ok ok
[12:33] <nothlit> zeeble, or maybe dpkg-reconfigure php5package
[12:33] <nothlit> and then restart apache
[12:34] <serishema> what do i need to install to use mono with apache?
[12:34] <BlackHawk> hi

[12:34] <mkay_> jrib, sry wrong window :-)
[12:35] <RxDx> what do you guys think about Automatix2 and EasyUbuntu?
[12:35] <zeeble> i wouldnt use em
[12:35] <zeeble> :p
[12:35] <nothlit> !automatix | RxDx

[12:35] <nothlit> !EasyUbuntu | RxDx
[12:35] <ubotu> RxDx: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[12:35] <Gumby> hrm, it apears that php doesnt automagically get setup.
[12:35] <nothlit> easyubuntu isn't recommended against, but why not just do it all on your own :)
[12:35] <mkay_> RxDx automatix and easyubuntu are very helpfull
[12:35] <RxDx> nothlit, i alredy have both installed here
[12:36] <zeeble> php4 got setup fine, Gumby
[12:36] <zeeble> php5 is being a little backward
[12:36] <RxDx> but what do you think is better... easyubuntu or automatix?
[12:36] <ailean> RxDx, Easyubuntu, no doubt
[12:36] <Gumby> zeeble: I just installed apache, installed php5 module, restarted apache, no php support
[12:36] <zeeble> yeah
[12:36] <serishema> damn aptitude crash and it ignores kill (15)
[12:36] <jrib> Gumby: tried   sudo a2enmod php5   ?
[12:37] <nothlit> zeeble, you want both? :O
[12:37] <serishema> oh dear it ignores kill -9 as well i thought that was impossible o.O
[12:37] <zeeble> nothlit: no. just php5
[12:37] <zeeble> i just used the mod

[12:37] <eMaX_> anyone knows what ubuntu-minimal is for and why it is being removed upon install of other packages?
[12:37] <mkay_> RxDx easyubuntu
[12:37] <RxDx> thanks for help dudes
[12:37] <serishema> reboot i guess
[12:37] <nothlit> zeeble, make sure you install phpmyadmin ... and maybe ubuntu-center
[12:38] <nothlit> eMaX_, ubuntu-minimal is for actually making sure your system does anything at al
[12:38] <eMaX_> so why does the package manager try to remove it?
[12:38] <Gumby> jrib: tells me the module doesnt exist
[12:38] <jrib> eMaX_: try:  apt-cache show ubuntu-minimal   to get some info
[12:38] <jrib> Gumby: libapache2-mod-php5  is installed?
[12:38] <eMaX_> I never told him to remove it
[12:39] <Gumby> jrib: yep
[12:39] <jrib> eMaX_: what are you telling him to do?
[12:39] <eMaX_> seems to be a conflict when trying to install chrony, he uninstalls ntpdate and in addition ubuntu-minimal
[12:39] <jrib> Gumby: does /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so exist?
[12:40] <echosystm> anyone, is gdm necessary for shutdown buttons to function ?
[12:40] <Gumby> yep
[12:40] <echosystm> ANYONE
[12:40] <echosystm> :P
[12:41] <jareth_> echosystm: what shutdown buttons do you mean?
[12:41] <jrib> Gumby: strange...
[12:41] <echosystm> in xfce or gnome or kde
[12:41] <tovella> echosystm: no, xdm, kdm may work too.
[12:41] <Gumby> jrib: its not a big deal.  it was for zeeble anyhow and he seems to have left
[12:41] <echosystm> in the menu, there is an "exit" option
[12:41] <jrib> Gumby: oh ok
[12:41] <jareth_> echosystm: buttons inside the windowmanager?
[12:41] <echosystm> which shows a window saying logout, restart, hibernate etc.
[12:41] <Gumby> allthough its somewhat annoying.  hehe
[12:41] <nothlit> echosystm, for gnome/xfce yes i think so
[12:41] <echosystm> yes
[12:41] <echosystm> ok
[12:41] <echosystm> cool
[12:41] <jareth_> echosystm: should function correctly..
[12:42] <nothlit> echosystm, they won't be there for kde... you'll need to use kdm
[12:42] <echosystm> so if i just apt-get install gdm that should all work?
[12:42] <echosystm> im using xfce
[12:42] <nothlit> maybe lol
[12:42] <echosystm> afaik xfce uses gdm
[12:42] <jpiccolo> how do i get ubuntu to show whats it loading at startup?
[12:42] <jpiccolo> like verbose mode
[12:43] <mikl> how do you find out what clock speed your RAM is running?
[12:43] <nothlit> jpiccolo, get rid of the verbose option in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[12:43] <nothlit> err quiet option*
[12:43] <nothlit> lshw -C memory
[12:43] <jpiccolo> on the live cd
[12:43] <tovella> echosystm: xfce will work with xdm, or kdm, as well.
[12:43] <Sub> jpiccolo, push CRTL + ALT+ F1 on startup
[12:43] <nothlit> jpiccolo, edit the boot parameters and make sure it doesn't have the quiet option
[12:44] <jpiccolo> ok
[12:44] <nothlit> jpiccolo, i think you press f9
[12:44] <tk_> hello : i have a problem with the ntfs-3g driver from the universe repository ... i have the package installed and have make the changes in the fstab file (http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009) but after the reboot ...my hda1 and hda4 ntfs partitions are will not work in ubuntu
[12:44] <wizo> ok so i installed flash from the adobe site
[12:45] <nothlit> wizo, make sure you remove the old v7
[12:45] <wizo> err hwo do i do that
[12:45] <serishema> ooh samba can pretend to be a domain controller :-)
[12:45] <nothlit> tovella, i don't think it has shutdown/restart integration
[12:45] <wizo> so i just remove the ibflashplayer.so ?
[12:45] <nothlit> samba can do a ton of things, if you want to read that gigantically large manual
[12:46] <nothlit> wizo, well yes, but removal depends on how you installed it
[12:46] <tovella> nothlit: maybe my memory is wrong... i am quite sleepy.
[12:46] <wizo> doh
[12:47] <tovella> too tired... goodnight all.
[12:47] <overrider> i want to install a irc server for my lan, which has about 100 clients. can anyone make a nice lightweight suggestion?
[12:47] <tk_> the question is : what is the correct syntax to mount my hda1 partition with the new ntfs-3g driver in the fstab file or in the bash
[12:47] <serishema> nothlit: as long as it doesn't demand to be reactivated and then claim your academic license is no good any more :-P
[12:48] <cbx33> hey people using apache 2, I have it listing a number of directories in a particualr path using it's built in list thingy, my problem is this, I have just added authentication to one of those dirs, now it is removed from the list
[12:48] <nothlit> overrider, aptitude search ircd you can look through them all with apt-cache show <packagename>
[12:48] <cbx33> anyway to make it visible in the list again
[12:49] <cbx33> apart from removing the security
[12:49] <nothlit> #apache
[12:49] <nothlit> serishema, rooofl
[12:49] <tonyyarusso> cbx33: Yes, it will do that.
[12:50] <ootput> good day kind patrons. I installed ubuntu 6.10 on my uncles computer, but I wasn't able to get his internet working (as it's dialup, and it's been a long time since I dealt with dialup.) I did manage to briefly read through instructions in Ubuntu's offline help section regarding dialup procedures, but as I'm now offsite, I can't seem to find that exact same set of instructions anywhere on ubuntu's site
[12:50] <cbx33> tonyyarusso anyway to stop it doing that?
[12:50] <tonyyarusso> cbx33: You could always make your own index page - other than that I'm not sure
[12:50] <jrib> !dialup | ootput
[12:50] <ubotu> ootput: You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[12:50] <ootput> I was wondering if any of you could do me a favor and perhaps link me to the documentation that's in ubuntu's healp?
[12:51] <tonyyarusso> cbx33: You could look for indexing options - perhaps
[12:51] <jrib> ootput: help.ubuntu.com has the manual that is in ubuntu's system -> help, but that wiki page is probably "fresher."  Or they may be the same.  May want to check both out
[12:52] <wizo> bah, something went bad
[12:53] <ootput> jrib: thanks mate
[12:53] <ootput> much obliged
[12:53] <wizo> i removed the one that i downoaded from adobe, and tried to install the one by using apt-get install libflash-mozplugin, now it doesnt work
[12:53] <jrib> ootput: np
[12:53] <yuv656> is there a shortcut key in ubuntu to lock my screen? like winkey+L in windows??
[12:54] <frogzoo> yuv656: you can set one: preferences -> kb shortcuts
[12:54] <tonyyarusso> yuv656: You can set one
[12:54] <nothlit> check under system preferences keyboard shortcuts

[01:05] <Pie-rate> i'm thinking about switching to the dvorak keyboard layout, just to confuse anyone that tries to use my computer
[01:05] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[01:05] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: It's kind of cool - I've dabbled a little bit with it so far
[01:05] <sc4ttrbrain> try mine,japanese layout

[01:07] <wizo> how do i find out the installation path of my mozilla required for instaling flash?
[01:07] <tonyyarusso> Pie-rate: Even better, set up your keyboard layout for X and console differently, so you have two different passwords depending on the login prompt
[01:07] <bXi> Pie-rate: get one of these http://www.daskeyboard.com/
[01:08] <AlexC_> Hey,
[01:08] <Pie-rate> sc4ttrbrain: because the dvorak idea is more confusing to anyone that tries to access my computer, and all you need to get into a biometric thingy is the piece of the body that it senses

[01:08] <AlexC_> I have an SATA Hard drive that Ubuntu is installed on, and an IDE Storage hard drive. When ever I connect the IDE Drive Ubutnu will not boot ( GRUB error 17 )
[01:08] <jrib> wizo: is there a reason you aren't just using the flashplugin-nonfree package?
[01:08] <sc4ttrbrain> lol
[01:08] <AlexC_> Also, the LiveCD will also lock up when loading Ubuntu with the IDE Harddrive connected,

[01:10] <oWo2002> Hi all! I upgraded my bow from 512 to 1024 memory. It is not in dual channel. Now, Ubuntu (not only X) hangs peridodicaly. I noticed it happens when I'm using Eclipse, OpenOffice or VNCViewer which use java runtine I think... I tries memtest and mem86 but all seems OK. I use 6.06 Ubuntu version. Any suggestion?
[01:10] <wizo> i think i`ll try and search on how by myself, but thanks

[01:13] <cypher1> anyone using ATI Rage here ?
[01:14] <Pie-rate> i like my silent logitech keyboard anyway, i can type pretty fast on it without making any noise
[01:14] <lupine_85> oWo2002: don't tell it auto. Give it the exact values that are on the sticker on the DIMM
[01:14] <lupine_85> also make sure that it and the other DIMM have the same values
[01:15] <lupine_85> if they don't, setting the BIOS to the lower of the two might work. then again, it might now. RAM is tempermental stuff.
[01:15] <cypher1> i am trying to enable "direct rendering" on ATI Rage Pro. has anyone done that ?

[01:29] <treedreamer> I want to make an e-book:)
[01:29] <twosouls82> treedreamer: why not use pdf?
[01:29] <twosouls82> or dvi?
[01:29] <twosouls82> or ps
[01:30] <serishema> i suggest a format more accessable to non windows clients
[01:30] <twosouls82> :)
[01:30] <twosouls82> indeed
[01:30] <rreck> uMista: what is the problem ?
[01:30] <treedreamer> but i am in china
[01:30] <treedreamer> and some software did not support chinese
[01:30] <twosouls82> treedreamer: chm is ms, there are loads of other formats
[01:30] <twosouls82> cross-platform that is
[01:30] <serishema> as far as i know post script based formats like pdf support chinese language characters fine
[01:31] <rreck> uMista: you just need port forwarding and to route to the linux box as the default gateway
[01:31] <uMISTA> i am trying to learn and wish to use linux as the firewall/internet connection, so i would like to know wht i should read up for sharing out the internet connection for linux something like ip forwarding? maybe thats it?
[01:31] <avis> there are chm readers for ubuntu

[01:33] <avis> carandano, its pretty simple, allow it to write grub to the mbr of the primary hard drive where window resides.  you can boot from your windows cd and go into console recovery should you ever need to wipembr and fixboot remember those two commands.  otherwise i hope you have a pleasant linux experience.
[01:33] <cardanto1> killer1 -- i am wondering how to set up my hard-drive
[01:33] <sapo> :h
[01:33] <mwe> there is a package that provides a cool collection of solitaire card games but I forgot the name of it :|
[01:33] <cardanto1> recommendations -- do i still need to worry about the master boot record, etc
[01:33] <avis> cardanto1, if you have one hard drive its very simple
[01:34] <defrysk_> !xsol
[01:34] <ubotu> xsol: X Solitaire. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.31-5 (edgy), package size 13 kB, installed size 92 kB
[01:34] <avis> cardanto1, yes that is where grub will go
[01:34] <rreck> uMista: it should take two commands and about 15 seconds
[01:34] <cardanto1> i have a 200 gb hard drive -- i was going to install winxp, 2000 and ubuntu
[01:34] <thoreauputic> mwe: there seem to be several card game packages - try  apt-cache search solitaire
[01:34] <avis> cardanto1, do you have unallocated space yet on the windows drive ?
[01:34] <KillerT> card: I suggest having windows installed first and then all u gotta do is install ubuntu to the drive and hit up the mbr with grub and it will have both options
[01:34] <cardanto1> well -- i have partition magic
[01:34] <KillerT> best not to install windows after linux
[01:34] <avis> well you take care of both your windows os then leave plenty of space for linux and come back is my suggestion
[01:34] <tijn> best not to install windows ;)
[01:35] <mwe> yeah. maybe it was xsol. i'll try that one to begin with. thanks
[01:35] <KillerT> lol
[01:35] <cardanto1> yeah -- i have win2000 up, about to install winxp
[01:35] <KillerT> install windows first
[01:35] <KillerT> easier
[01:35] <cardanto1> just want to make sure i leave the options open for ubuntu when needed
[01:35] <thoreauputic> mwe: pysol is pretty cool IIRC
[01:35] <cardanto1> (i am keeping this pc ubuntu)
[01:35] <mwe> I'll try both
[01:35] <cardanto1> (don't worry)
[01:35] <KillerT> partition drive....install windows...install ubuntu....mbr goes grub
[01:35] <defrysk_> !pysol | mwe
[01:35] <ubotu> pysol: X11 solitaire game written in Python. In component universe, is optional. Version 4.82.1-4.1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1458 kB, installed size 6844 kB
[01:36] <KillerT> it will see windows windows wont see linux
[01:36] <cardanto1> Killer1 -- got it that is my plan -- want to know specifics -- right now i have a 200gb ntfs partition
[01:36] <cardanto1> i just changed the win2000 partition to 60gb
[01:36] <KillerT> if u are just trying out u only need like 10 gigs
[01:36] <KillerT> and u need a swap
[01:36] <KillerT> I'm not sure specs on how big u need really
[01:37] <rreck> anyone get vmware to install under ubuntu?
[01:37] <KillerT> swap is like linux virtual memory but it has own partition
[01:37] <juan> hola
[01:37] <thoreauputic> !vmware-player
[01:37] <ubotu> vmware-player: Free virtual machine player from VMware. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.0.2-2 (edgy), package size 11602 kB, installed size 31336 kB (Only available for i386 amd64)
[01:37] <cardanto1> (then i thought, hey -- i should make sure i am doing this right -- so what would my hard drive look like -- and does it matter where these partitions are -- i.e. back when i set up grub with red-hat i needed ot worry about cylinders -- is that fixed?
[01:37] <cardanto1> (i.e. can swap be on the last 10 cylinders?)
[01:37] <KillerT> doesn't matter
[01:38] <rreck> vmware server i meant
[01:38] <avis> will gparted resize reiserfs ok ??
[01:38] <cardanto1> sure? -- o.k. then what sizes can i work with (i know hard drives don't play in decimal)
[01:38] <KillerT> I suggest a partition for windows and then thre for linux /home /root /swap
[01:39] <Everflex> When i make a backup of my system, folllowing this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem, and excluding some dir's in the backup. Then when i restore the backup to my system, will then the directories i didn't include in the backup be lost?
[01:39] <cardanto1> o.k. well -- i will make two 80 gb windows partitions and then leave the rest unpartitioned, and will then allocate for ubuntu
[01:39] <cardanto1> (on the install)
[01:39] <KillerT> home = 500mb I think swap = 500mb (depends on how much ram u have) and whatever for linux I would go 20gb personally so u can try everything kde gnome xfce games all
[01:39] <clay> anyone know of  a good LDAP app that is easy to set up?
[01:39] <avis> you can be ok with 40 gigs but still low on space.
[01:40] <cardanto1> i have 1.5 gb ram -- how much swap?
[01:40] <avis> i always triple my memory for swap
[01:40] <avis> as per LPI instructions
[01:40] <avis> but double works
[01:40] <KillerT> really?
[01:40] <sapo> anyone could help me with me locales problem? :(
[01:40] <KillerT> never heard of that
[01:40] <KillerT> I would think u could use less swap with more ram
[01:41] <avis> he would probably be ok with 3.5 GIGS
[01:41] <nikin> i ame planning to create a HTTP/FTP/SAMBA server for smalloffice use (6 users) would a 350Mhz P2 with 192MB RAM be enogh for that?
[01:41] <KillerT> avis why so much?
[01:41] <avis> to be safe
[01:41] <cardanto1> bottom line: i can leave space at the end of the hard-drive for ubuntu
[01:41] <avis> or 3GB
[01:41] <avis> thats double
[01:42] <cardanto1> ?
[01:42] <KillerT> I have 512ram and 512 swap because i like to have a gig memory and never had a problem
[01:42] <tonyyarusso> nikin: Depends how much load those 6 users were planning to put on it.
[01:42] <avis> yes cardanto1 it actually doesn't matter where linux resides on the hard drive
[01:42] <cardanto1> got it
[01:42] <cardanto1> thanks guys
[01:42] <avis> i had bought a LPI course and was taught to triple it
[01:42] <tonyyarusso> nikin: I have a 1.70 GHZ 512 MB RAM server with a handful of users, and it hardly even registers a load
[01:42] <daviey> anybody here using LVM2?
[01:42] <KillerT> LPI stands for?
[01:43] <avis> linux professional institute
[01:43] <KillerT> u said double earlier
[01:43] <avis> its a certification
[01:43] <defrysk_> avis, not needed to do 1x ram = 2x swap when you have plenty ram
[01:43] <Nippoo> hrm. can anyone tell me why no computers on my network want to use my Ubuntu DHCP server? I'm pretty sure dhcpd configuration is right (in fact, I'm absolutely sure it is), but it doesn't recognize that there have been any IP requests... *sigh*
[01:43] <avis> i'm not lpi certified
[01:43] <rreck> amphi: it looks like its some setuid problem
[01:43] <avis> ok
[01:43] <KillerT> avis: and why do u say it depends where linux is installed
[01:43] <ubox> hey all
[01:44] <avis> KillerT, i said it doesn't matter where linux is on the hard drive
[01:44] <daviey> Nippoo, Hmm, are there any other dhcp servers on the network.  I.e router?
[01:44] <avis> grub can point to any partition
[01:44] <KillerT> oh ok
[01:44] <KillerT> yeah my thoughts exactly
[01:44] <nikin> tonyyarus: for FTP about a 200 Mb up and about 500Mb down a day... mos of it in house. For HTTP: about 150 downloads a day, for Samba aout 750 mb in average
[01:44] <Nippoo> daviey: normally, the router does this. when I disable DHCP on it, all the PCs get confused and say that there isn't a DHCP server on the network...
[01:44] <tonyyarusso> nikin: I'll bet you're fine - try it!
[01:44] <Everflex> is there an included command line browser in Ubuntu?
[01:44] <Nippoo> yet, when it is on, and working, the server has an IP
[01:45] <Nippoo> Everflex: apt-get install lynx.
[01:45] <Everflex> Nippoo, ok, thx
[01:45] <bimberi> Everflex: w3c
[01:45] <tonyyarusso> Everflex: I'm not sure what if anything is default, but w3m, links2, and elinks are all good
[01:45] <nikin> tonyyarus: ok :D and what do you think is the weakest point in the above box?
[01:45] <Everflex> ok
[01:45] <bimberi> Everflex: oops, w3m
[01:45] <KillerT> avis: i know there is a way (with large amounts of ram) to run linux without swap so doubling it when u have a gig of ram i don't think is neccessary anymore is the course outdated
[01:45] <Milky> Hi, I just plugged in my new soundcard (audigy 2 zs) and I can apparently find all its channels in alsamixer, but I can't hear anything...
[01:45] <daviey> Nippoo, try using one machine connected with a crossover cable.  That worked ffor me, but not a switch?!
[01:46] <tonyyarusso> nikin: Probably RAM, dunno
[01:46] <avis> ok i dont know what the LPI standards are anymore i dont even use a server i can afford to allocate a little more to swap
[01:46] <avis> i just have 2GB in my linux box
[01:46] <avis> its all that would fit
[01:46] <KillerT> tony u don't have any to spare eh?
[01:46] <nikin> tonyyarus: ok :D then i go tomoroow and buy it :D
[01:47] <Nippoo> daviey: unfortunately, it's rackmounted, about 200m away from the nearest PC =(
[01:47] <avis> i donate DDR400 ram to ubuntu developers :)
[01:47] <tonyyarusso> KillerT: Actually I do - I took a screwdriver to some old boxes at school, and have some 64, 32, 16, and 8 MB sticks
[01:47] <Nippoo> but I shall have a go, with a laptop
[01:47] <KillerT> avis: because swap uses the hard drive as ram and it is slower r/w access u would do better not having it
[01:47] <avis> i see ok
[01:47] <KillerT> tony: pc13?
[01:47] <Nippoo> haha 64MB sticks =)
[01:47] <KillerT> 133 rather
[01:48] <tonyyarusso> KillerT: I'm honestly not even sure - haven't looked them up yet
[01:48] <Nippoo> KillerT: I suspect it's probably more like 13. =)

[01:52] <avis> KillerT, what is your point ?  if i have spare memory i want to donate to ubuntu developers why does that matter so much to you ?

[01:58] <KillerT> do they even have that package
[01:58] <avis> gharz perhaps you need to take a look at your sources.list
[01:58] <avis> or update  apt-get update etc
[01:59] <gharz> i'm planning to install VMWare and installing linux-headers is one of the procedures :(

[01:59] <gharz> yes i am

[01:59] <KillerT> yeah?

[02:02] <KillerT> uncomment
[02:02] <thoreauputic> gharz: possibly you don't have the security repos enabled
[02:03] <avis> KillerT, i was asking thoreauputic
[02:03] <KillerT> avis relax man
[02:03] <rreck> ok everyone who is dying for the answer, vmware server needed ia32-libs libdb2
[02:03] <KillerT> it's all gravy
[02:03] <thoreauputic> avis: yes I think so - but might have been disabled by mistake or similar

[02:04] <avis> true :)
[02:05] <TommBJ> I'm working on a project for 'roaming profiles' in ubuntu using sshfs/pam and fuse. Does anyone know if this has been done before? I can't seem to find any documentation on this :/
[02:06] <Pie-rate> is there a program that'll record songs from an internet radio station to ogg files and organize them properly? :)
[02:06] <thoreauputic> TommBJ: on sshfs or particularly with pam?
[02:07] <thoreauputic> Pie-rate: have you tried streamtuner with streamripper?
[02:07] <serishema> i'm having problems with bind.
[02:07] <serishema> i can't use rndc to control the server, it gives connection refused
[02:07] <thoreauputic> Pie-rate: it won't convert them for you, butyou can use for example mp32ogg for that
[02:07] <TommBJ> thoreauputic: The problem with not using pam is that it has to fetch a password from elsewhere, use no password for remote site at all, or have a static key/certificate in each users homedir. I've found some information on sshfs/fuse though.
[02:08] <thoreauputic> TommBJ: I use sshfs with ssh keypairs ( to avoid passwords)
[02:08] <serishema> ahh interesting bind apparently failed to start for some reason
[02:08] <avis> thoreauputic, over ssh aren't the passwords encrypted ?
[02:08] <thoreauputic> TommBJ: but yeah, i guess that's static
[02:09] <Pie-rate> neat, thanks thoreauputic
[02:09] <TommBJ> thoreauputic: Doesn't that mean a file has to be in each of the users homedir?
[02:09] <thoreauputic> avis: the point is to use rox-filer with sshfs in my case :)

[02:30] <name> nothlit: great help ^^
[02:31] <Zambezi> nothlit, Thanks for your effort trying to umount my _stupid_ iPod. ;-)
[02:31] <frogzoo> name: have you tried 3rd level choosers under keyboard preferences? not sure if this will do it but worth a look
[02:31] <name> but then how to map the key?
[02:32] <frogzoo> name: well you could just find a keyboard layout that does it
[02:33] <frogzoo> name: otherwise you'll need to play with xmodmap
[02:33] <danny> ok, 2nd try: can anyone confirm, that the dapper hal update fixes the automounter (security policy) issue? i am using edgy and unfortunately hal dapper is more recent than hal edgy.
[02:34] <VincentMX> hi
[02:34] <name> frogzoo: nah
[02:34] <name> frogzoo: i want US layout
[02:34] <name> but want my german signs
[02:34] <frogzoo> name: try with US international
[02:34] <danny> is noone here using usb-flash drives?
[02:34] <VincentMX> i have installed the ati drivers, but games are still very slow
[02:35] <thoreauputic> danny: no, not *one* of the 900 people here use usb flash drives
[02:35] <nothlit> VincentMX, glxinfo | grep render
[02:35] <thoreauputic> danny: what's the question?
[02:35] <frogzoo> name: 
[02:35] <nothlit> VincentMX, check and make sure direct rendering is enabled
[02:35] <rambo3> 
[02:35] <name> frogzoo: how? :)
[02:35] <danny> it's not basically usb-flash related, but auto-mounter

[02:36] <VincentMX> nothlit: how do i enable that?
[02:36] <constrictor> frogzoo: i have installed kismet, how do i configure and use it
[02:36] <danny> i think it is hal related
[02:36] <thoreauputic> danny: I'm not using edgy much, so i'm not sure what the staus of HAL security is on that

[02:51] <serishema> there we go was a permissions problem
[02:52] <nothlit> lol
[02:52] <luc_> maybe through easycam edgy?
[02:52] <chrisjw> weird, my card reader isn't reading my sd card of MS duo
[02:52] <chrisjw> it's just a USB plug in
[02:53] <ProN00b> any guides on how to make sure a printer is working and then setting up a printserver (on ubuntu server) ?
[02:53] <edgy> luc_: unfortunately easycam and easycam2 failed to install the driver so I had to install it manually
[02:53] <PeBe> hi, have tried out edubuntu, but problem to get the screen resolution right. Could some of you look at my xorg.conf

[02:54] <PeBe> or other solutions?
[02:54] <frogzoo> JuJuBee: /dev/ttyUSB0
[02:54] <chrisjw> is there any reason why my card reader shouldn't work?

[02:55] <zak> i'm on 5.10 [i'll get around to upgrading some time] , and im going to install mono/monodevelop [which is a mildly large undertaking, since i'm on dialup] ... is 5.10's monodevelop sufficiently out-dated to warrant me installing a newer version from source [or other non-ubuntu packages] ?
[02:55] <Agiofws> can any tell me WHAT frick option i should use in fstab ubuntu so i can write perms to the disk i mounting ?

[02:56] <frogzoo> Agiofws: user or users   for ext3, for fat you want umask=0000
[02:56] <liw> what's the ubuntu security team mail address?
[02:56] <Agiofws> so its
[02:56] <Agiofws> UUID=6b6e04f7-ab77-43fd-ae2a-02cc64be5dd3 /Thanos         ext3  users,defaults        0       2
[02:57] <Agiofws> is tha it ?
[02:57] <crimsun_> liw: If you need to contact the security team about a bug, please use Launchpad to file a bug against the source package, and mark the security checkbox.
[02:57] <tonyyarusso> liw: There are three different security-related lists on lists.ubuntu.com
[02:57] <frogzoo> Agiofws: you should now be able to mount /Thanos
[02:58] <JuJuBee> Thanks frogzoo, that did it.

[03:03] <drayen> hey all, i'm trying to access my svn on my ubuntu server, but i want to do it via ssh. I think i have it all set up right, i can use svn normaly, but not via svn+ssh:// and im not sure why, It tells me there is no repo, but there is!! see http://pastebin.ca/277673
[03:04] <serishema> haha go me, it was because the server wasn't actually connected to the internet
[03:04] <mythtv1> Im trying to install some matrox drivers and in the process somehow lost libgl.so.1.. anyone know how i can get it back?? :)
[03:05] <Agiofws> frogzoo,   cannot touch `hello2': Permission denied

[03:05] <nder> hi anyone knows how to install modem speedtouch 330?
[03:07] <frogzoo> Agiofws: couple of things to check - UUID & you have write permission to /Thanos before you mount the new fs there
[03:07] <Agiofws> whay should it be ?
[03:08] <frogzoo> what should what be? the uuid?
[03:08] <ThePub> permissions to the location before writing isn't important, it's write permissions after :)
[03:08] <frogzoo> ThePub: if fstab has users, it just ignores the perms of the mount point?
[03:09] <ThePub> frogzoo: not at all, "users" (if you read man fstab) will point out that just makes a partition mountable by users.
[03:10] <ChrisBradley> dude - I just found this awesome mix of music I made a couple years ago
[03:10] <ChrisBradley> oops - sorry
[03:10] <ChrisBradley> wrong channel
[03:10] <nder> anyone knows how to install modem speedtouch 330?
[03:11] <frogzoo> ThePub: so you still need write access to the mount point
[03:11] <Agiofws> frogzoo,   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2006-12-13 13:22 /Thanos  is this ok ?
[03:11] <Agiofws> chmod 466 ?
[03:11] <frogzoo> Agiofws: just try 'sudo chmod 777 /Thanos; mount /Thanos'  & let me know if that worked
[03:13] <kdjfs> hi, where i can find xmms-wma for amd64?
[03:13] <ThePub> frogzoo: not at all, write permissions before and after mount can be very different.
[03:13] <frogzoo> ThePub: of course
[03:13] <ThePub> frogzoo: you don't need write permissions on an umounted point to mount there, you just need permission from fstab if you're not root.
[03:14] <ThePub> frogzoo: once a mount point is active the basic permissions can be changed to whatever suits the systems needs and they will stay between mounts.

[03:17] <linda777> I have a question about video cards that seems to come up a lot in the forums; I've tried all the fixes I've found.
[03:17] <linda777> I just need ubuntu to reprobe my video card, it's giving me plain vanilla.
[03:17] <paradox34690> Hey all...
[03:18] <linda777> No acceleration, no resolution above 1024x768
[03:18] <ThePub> linda777: plain vanilla what?  pudding?
[03:18] <linda777> :) Nope, just generic.
[03:19] <linda777> Generic video card slow-redraw badness.
[03:19] <ThePub> linda777: meaning?  you want 3d acceleration?
[03:19] <nder> anyone knows how to install modem speedtouch 330?
[03:19] <linda777> Yes, and I want higher screen rez.
[03:19] <ThePub> linda777: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:19] <linda777> I tried that.
[03:19] <Samuli^> Hey all.
[03:20] <ThePub> linda777: that will re-run the xord configuration and write whatever preferences you want to the xorg.conf file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:20] <ThePub> s/xord/xorg/
[03:20] <linda777> It seemed from the forums it would do that. But when I run that, it does nothing.
[03:20] <paradox34690> Anyone in here familiar with Ubuntu 6.10 server?
[03:20] <linda777> Uh....
[03:20] <crisp> er
[03:20] <crisp> you just asked that in #ubuntu
[03:20] <crisp> you having a laugh
[03:20] <Samuli^> Does anyone know how to make the nautilus-cd-burner use something else than /tmp for temp-files?
[03:20] <markeib> hey, i've got a problem!
[03:21] <linda777> Sorry, ThePub. I needed to do it as root, it's working now.
[03:21] <paradox34690> well, i don't know where else to ask, so I figured I'd start out here :)
[03:21] <ThePub> linda777: anytime you run a system-wide configuration it should be as root :)
[03:22] <markeib> when i boot and my webcam is plugged in, my soundcard doesn't work. however if i boot without the webcam plugged in, everything works fine. if i plug the cam afterwards it works too.
[03:22] <crisp> id say its a fair bet the answer is yes
[03:22] <nder> anyone knows how to install modem speedtouch 330?
[03:23] <Toma-> markeib: sounds like your webcam is pinching your soundcards /dev entry
[03:23] <frogzoo> Agiofws: no luck? did you check the UUID ?
[03:23] <mjr> markeib, your webcam apparently becomes the default audio device if it's plugged in at boot
[03:23] <markeib> yes, how can i avoid that? ^^
[03:23] <Agiofws> frogzoo,   ok he changed the perms as you sain and MOUNTed with sudo   and it works ONCE he mounts as user  like mount /Thanos  he gets permission denied
[03:24] <drayen> hey all, i'm trying to access my svn on my ubuntu server, but i want to do it via ssh. I think i have it all set up right, i can use svn normaly, but not via svn+ssh:// and im not sure why, It tells me there is no repo, but there is!! see http://pastebin.ca/277673
[03:24] <Toma-> markeib: somewhere in /etc/modules/alias would be the answer
[03:24] <mjr> markeib, see if you can determine from lsmod output which driver drives the webcam audio
[03:24] <linda777> And I'm thinking I have to reboot to get the new resolutions?
[03:24] <cypher1> arghh.. i am unable to enable "direct rendering" with my ATI Rage :(
[03:24] <mjr> markeib, then, in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base , at the end, add "options snd-whatever index=-2" as is done there for a number of drivers
[03:25] <ThePub> linda777: you just need to log out of your current session, CTRL-ALT-F1, log in and do "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm (or kdm) restart"
[03:25] <mjr> markeib, curious though, I'd imagine that the webcam would show as an usb audio device and those are already taken care of by default in said file...
[03:25] <markeib> ok give me some minutes
[03:25] <cypher1> linda777: or just press ctrl-alt-backspace :)
[03:25] <crimsun_> mjr: it is. The only time it won't be present is on a dist-upgrade from Dapper.
[03:25] <paradox34690> as far as anyone here might know, how is ubuntu's support for RAID drives?
[03:25] <Toma-> super
[03:26] <ThePub> paradox34690: the same as any other linux ;)
[03:26] <mjr> paradox34690, can do
[03:26] <AnAnt> how do I make this setting in bind9 : look up *.abc.com from a 192.168.0.5 ?
[03:26] <Samuli^> certainly, sir.
[03:26] <cypher1> does anyone know how to enable "direct rendering" on ATI Rage.. i tried installing the BinaryDriver but it crashed my X
[03:26] <Toma-> took me about 3 minutes to remove all the RAID support, so there is lots
[03:26] <paradox34690> ooooh, perfect. :)
[03:26] <AlexC_> Hey,
[03:26] <mjr> it'll install fine on either hardware or software raid (though with /boot, there's the usual limitation that only raid-1 works)
[03:26] <mjr> (if using sw raid)
[03:26] <AlexC_> Guys - Ubuntu will not boot with my IDE hard drive connect. As soon as I disconect the IDE hard drive, Ubuntu ( which is on a SATA hard drive ) will boot fine.
[03:26] <Agiofws> frogzoo,  it mounts as suer but he conat writetto it if he mounts it as a user if he mounts it as sudo he can write to it as user
[03:27] <AlexC_> Why is this? I need my IDE Hard drive connected as it has all my important fiels on it. It's a FAT32 filesystem,
[03:27] <nder> how can I enter as "root" user?
[03:27] <markeib> mjr: in that file
[03:27] <LjL> Ubotu, tell nder about root | nder, see the private message from Ubotu
[03:28] <jareth_> which tool do I use to check file-format?
[03:28] <markeib> alsa-base, there are already 6 options
[03:28] <ThePub> cypher1: rage128 I don't believe is supported by the binary ati driver, you'd need to use the built-in ati driver.
[03:28] <paradox34690> well, the person i'm asking for recently purchased a SuperMicro server, so I'm fairly certain it will be a HW raid.... only reason I ask about ubuntu's support for it is because this person is saying that the manufacturer only provides support for SUSE, however....      I need to do a software installation for him, and SUSE is incompatible with the software i need to install...
[03:28] <markeib> for example: options snd-usb-audio index=-2
[03:28] <markeib> but they are all index=-2
[03:29] <mjr> markeib, yes. But apparently your webcam isn't covered by them, so you need to add a similar one for its driver (and preferrably report the driver to Ubuntu)
[03:29] <markeib> how do i know which one in this modprobe is the driver of the camera?
[03:29] <mjr> markeib, -2 is just a "magic" index that says that grab the first available index, but _not_ the default one (0)
[03:29] <cypher1> ThePub: but the builtin ati driver is not enabling the direct rendering :( when i switch between windows i can feel the effect of it
[03:30] <Gman> how do i know which /dev/ entry is my serial port?
[03:30] <crimsun_> (no, it's not magic. It means use -2 as a bitmask so that '2' effectively becomes the index.)
[03:30] <mjr> markeib, make sure your camera is plugged in, then lsmod and put the output to pastebin.ca or something, and maybe we'll figure it out
[03:30] <El_Che> anyone here has been able to setup a / in raid 0 in edgy?
[03:31] <markeib> ok i'll go on pastebin.ca thank you in advance
[03:31] <mjr> El_Che, haven't done it, but I'll just make sure you know that /boot can't be raid-0 (only raid-1)
[03:31] <ThePub> cypher1: not to be glib about it, but depending on what you want to do and the resolution you're doing it.  the 128 is a pretty old card.
[03:31] <paradox34690> how can I have a specific command run at system startup?
[03:31] <syock> any network gurus out there? my netstat -t shows a number of connections to a same target, 209-208-66-25.al-is. looks suspicious, how do I manually disconnect them?
[03:31] <markeib> http://pastebin.ca/277702
[03:31] <mjr> El_Che, (root can be raid-0 just fine, just make a separate small /boot )
[03:31] <frogzoo> Agrajag: 'whoami ; ls -ld /Thanos'
[03:32] <El_Che> mjr: done that
[03:32] <El_Che> mjr: explodes in my face
[03:32] <El_Che> mjr: probably the studpid UUID stuff that breaks everything
[03:32] <cypher1> ThePub: but when i was using RHL on it, i guess it had enabled "direct rendering" since i had faced this problem there
[03:32] <markeib> have you seen the link (http://pastebin.ca/277702) mjr?
[03:32] <AlexC_> Guys - Ubuntu will not boot with my IDE hard drive connect. As soon as I disconect the IDE hard drive, Ubuntu ( which is on a SATA hard drive ) will boot fine. Why is this?

[03:32] <cypher1> ThePub: i am on 1024x768 res
[03:33] <cypher1> ThePub: is there any way i can enable direct rendering ?
[03:33] <El_Che> mjr: it all ens in an ugly dependecy loop needing udev
[03:33] <Gman> frogzoo: its got 9 pins (com port in indows) plugs into routers
[03:33] <ThePub> cypher1: make sure 'Load "dri" is present in the Module section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf :)
[03:34] <frogzoo> Gman: probly /dev/ttyS0
[03:34] <Gman> frogzoo: trying to get minicom to work
[03:34] <mjr> markeib, hmh, cat /dev/sndstat and paste that too
[03:34] <markeib> ok
[03:34] <cypher1> ThePub: i checked it is there
[03:34] <Gman> frogzoo: ill try that
[03:35] <markeib> mjr: http://pastebin.ca/277705
[03:35] <VSpike> When I insert a removable storage device and it gets mounted into /media and a link placed on the desktop, what mechanism(s) are doing that?
[03:35] <frogzoo> paradox34690: the quickest, dirtiest hack is put the command in /etc/rc.local
[03:35] <Gwildor> umm, gnome-terminal just....stopped working
[03:36] <mjr> markeib, umm, do you really have the camera plugged in?
[03:36] <Gwildor> it doesnt launch...
[03:36] <Gwildor> anyone have any idea, or similair experience?
[03:36] <markeib> :S
[03:36] <wattage> howdy :)
[03:36] <Gwildor> i have made ZERO changes since last i used it
[03:36] <wattage> URL to ubuntu wiki please
[03:36] <wattage> <3
[03:36] <markeib> oh
[03:36] <markeib> i didn't realize i pulled it out sorry
[03:36] <paradox34690> frogzoo, okay, I'll give that a try, thanks :)
[03:38] <markeib> mjr: http://pastebin.ca/277709 ... this is embarassing
[03:39] <paradox34690> hey, frogzoo, I just thought of something... that little command you just told me, will that also start up something that needs to be (basically) a system service?
[03:39] <paradox34690> ie, even if a user isn't logged in, i need that service to start...
[03:39] <mjr> markeib, weird though, still can't see why that would happen, since apparently your webcam _does_ use the usb-audio driver, and that's already handled in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base, right (you know, the line "options snd-usb-audio index=-2" is there?)
[03:40] <khatahn> what does "laptop-mode" include? just wondering if it's safe to disable it from starting during bootup on a desktop machine
[03:40] <markeib> options snd-usb-audio index=-2
[03:40] <markeib> this one?
[03:40] <markeib> yes it is
[03:41] <AlexC_> Guys - Ubuntu will not boot with my IDE hard drive connected. As soon as I disconect the IDE hard drive, Ubuntu ( which is on a SATA hard drive ) will boot fine. Why is this?
[03:41] <mjr> markeib, yeah. Well, that should prevent what you're saying from happening. Sorry, don't know why it doesn't.
[03:41] <frogzoo> paradox34690: rc.local will get it working, but the proper way is to setup an rc script
[03:41] <markeib> but mjr, can i not make sure that it doesn't use the stupid webcam mic at all?
[03:41] <paradox34690> hmm... okay.... can you point me in the direction of some instructions for doing that?
[03:41] <HuibertGill> !find mc
[03:41] <ubotu> Found: kdebluetooth-irmcsync, libxdmcp-dev, libxdmcp6, libxdmcp6-dbg, libxfce4mcs-client3 (and 121 others)

[03:42] <ubotu> mc: midnight commander - a powerful file manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:4.6.1-5 (edgy), package size 2057 kB, installed size 5944 kB
[03:42] <mjr> markeib, an ugly way to fix the symtom would be to add "blacklist snd-usb-audio" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist , in which case no usb audio device would get used ever
[03:42] <markeib> hmmm
[03:43] <markeib> but that doesn't include an audio usb-stick, huh? that's just seen as some data storage thingy?
[03:43] <chrisjw> quick question, im going to burn a cd now, where is nautilus lol
[03:43] <chrisjw> i thought it would be in applications
[03:43] <Doow> Is there any specific channel for linux gaming on freenode? (or other network might work as well)
=== Guest1843 is now known as ruth___
[03:44] <mjr> markeib, if you're talking about a portable player, yeah, it wouldn't affect your ability to upload songs there
[03:44] <AlexC_> chrisjw: just go to Places-> CD/DVD writer? can't remember the exact name
[03:44] <chrisjw> !!!
[03:44] <chrisjw> thx ~
[03:44] <AlexC_> chrisjw: afaik, nautilus is the file manager/browser
[03:46] <AlexC_> Anyone know why Ubuntu will refuse to boot with an IDE Drive connected? Ubuntu is installed on a SATA Hard drive.
[03:46] <AlexC_> I'd be so happy if someone could help me fix it, I just wanna get off windows lol
[03:47] <Toma-> AlexC_: run it in recovery mode and see what dmesg has to say?
[03:47] <AlexC_> Toma-: how do I do that?
[03:47] <mjr> markeib, of course, you might want to report your problem as a bug of the alsa-base package, maybe the maintainer will know what's wrong...
[03:47] <Toma-> AlexC_: can you get to a grub boot screen?
[03:47] <markeib> mjr:  how and where do i do that?
[03:48] <AlexC_> Toma-: oh yes, it loads grub fine - just when it goes to the Ubuntu boot splash it just locks up
[03:48] <Toma-> AlexC_: ok, there should be an option in grub for recovery mode
[03:48] <the_mug> after upgrading to Edgy. On my updates splash screen... It shows my current Updates (which I can check and uncheck) and it shows a Grayed-out section that reads: Distribution Updates and it has libggi2 and mplayer... I can't check them to be installed... any ideas?
[03:48] <AlexC_> Toma-: ahhhh yes, I know now!
[03:48] <markeib> (can i see if this ubs ommitting works without rebooting?)
[03:48] <Toma-> AlexC_: ok :) give it a spin, much easier to debug from there
[03:48] <AlexC_> Toma-: let me go try that, be back in a min
[03:48] <simontol_> hi
[03:48] <MasterLexx> heya, where cna i find the list of supported hardware in ubuntu?
[03:49] <simontol_> I have to patch usbserial module in kernel
[03:49] <simontol_>  Do I have to compile all from sources to do this?
[03:49] <Toma-> simontol_: as long as you have no follow up questions, no :)
[03:50] <frogzoo> simontol_: you sure you need a patch? what's the problem?
[03:50] <mjr> markeib, http://www.ubuntu.com/support/bugs , and well, at least in principle; sudo rmmod snd-usb-audio while the camera isn't attached, and then reattach, and see if the usb audio device is present in /dev/sndstat
[03:50] <Turgon> the_mug : I got those installed from Synaptic, I looked for those 2 packages and marked them to be updated. I had no problems.
[03:50] <kleftisx> from where can i install Ati Radeon X1300 Drivers for ubuntu ???
[03:50] <khatahn> !ati
[03:50] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:51] <the_mug> Turgon: doh! I didn't think to try that. (I don't use synaptic that much) :-/
[03:51] <Turgon> :-)
[03:51] <simontol_> frogzoo : look here  http://www.junxion.com/opensource/linux_highspeed_usbserial.html
[03:52] <nautilus21e> I can't compile ieee82011, and my wireless isn't working because ofit.
[03:53] <nautilus21e> I think it's a problem with the headers, because I also can't compile ipw2200....but I can't seem to revert back to any other headers.
[03:53] <the_mug> Turgon: whaddaya know. sometimes the obvious things evade me! ;-) thanks that worked!
[03:53] <nautilus21e> I'm using 2.6.17-generic
[03:54] <Turgon> the_mug: You are welcome :)
[03:54] <markeib> ok it worked mjr
[03:54] <markeib> but i want sound without rebooting, this isn't possible?
[03:55] <lewyjh> i need help with flash on websites?
[03:55] <frogzoo> simontol_: you need only recompile the usbserial module
[03:55] <frogzoo> simontol_: assuming the patch works

[03:58] <AlexC_> hey Toma-
[03:58] <chrisjw> I want to share a folder across my network so my pda can map the network share, on windows I can do this easily, I've read up a little bit and seen that I'd have to use samba, isn't there many security vulnerabilities with this?
[03:58] <Toma-> ello
[03:58] <AlexC_> Toma-: end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 8     Buffer I/O error on device sda, sector 24  - I get a load of them
[03:58] <simontol_> frogzoo : I already have tested patch and it works

=== vinux is now known as yournickname
[03:59] <klm-> do I need to install a firewall on my ubuntu dapper to be safely on the net (via firefox and xchat)?
[03:59] <Toma-> AlexC_: run an fsck on it
[03:59] <AlexC_> Toma-: but Windows can read and write to it perfectly
[03:59] <Toma-> from recovery mode
=== yournickname is now known as vinux
[03:59] <Toma-> windows accepts alot of garbage.
[04:00] <AlexC_> Toma-: how would I do that? I get no chance to run any commands, it just tries to load the OS
[04:00] <AlexC_> hehe oh right,
[04:00] <nothlit> chrisjw, samba should be safe if you keep it within your network, also, samba is safer than xp network sharing
[04:00] <Journeyman> boot from a live CD
[04:00] <AlexC_> ahh, yes of course :P
[04:00] <nothlit> !samba
[04:00] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[04:00] <chrisjw> samba runs on port 445 right?
[04:00] <chrisjw> or 139
[04:00] <chrisjw> blah that's net bios i think
[04:00] <AlexC_> fsck ... ok, brb
[04:00] <Toma-> AlexC_: from the recovery console. also try running fdisk on it and just check to see if its readable
[04:01] <AlexC_> ok, I'll try that
[04:01] <Helicobacter> Hi room :)
[04:01] <frogzoo> simontol_: maybe just 'make configure ; make' within the usbserial root directory
[04:02] <simontol_> I'll try
[04:02] <lewyjh> why doesn't it let me copy files into a file...it tells me i don't have the permissions when i am already the root.
[04:02] <lewyjh> is there a way around this?
[04:02] <bendovergt> anyone compiling the new kernel ?
[04:03] <Helicobacter> lewyjh, check the chmod of your file
[04:03] <lewyjh> chmod...
[04:03] <frogzoo> lewyjh: doing thins you don't understand when you're root, is a sure way to screw up your box proper
[04:03] <nothlit> chrisjw, it runs on a few ports actually, just google iptables and samba
[04:04] <Zcruf> ANyone has any tips on mounting an external hard drive? I reinstalled edgy, and it wont automount

[04:05] <nothlit> blaa, ssh also has ftps built into it
[04:05] <hayig2000> is there a stand alone CD for ubunto...to run from only the CD ?
[04:05] <nothlit> blaa, if you get confused on how to use scp
[04:05] <chrisjw> hmm, to remove samba, you just use apt-get remove samba ?
[04:05] <bendovergt> hayig2000, yes.
[04:06] <hayig2000> site?
[04:06] <nothlit> chrisjw, sudo aptitude purge samba

[04:06] <FERAS>  please where I shoud add proxy and port http  and how --
[04:06] <nothlit> blaa, first, you need to enable root login in your sshd_config

[04:07] <humbolt> Where could I have done that? grep -R ppp1 /etc does not find anything supprisingly
[04:07] <Toma-> in the recovery concolse
[04:07] <Toma-> console
[04:07] <nothlit> lewyjh, just move it into ~/.mozilla/plugins ... you may have to create it
[04:07] <AlexC_> Toma-: yeah but where is that?
[04:07] <blaa> nothlit: It 's good?
[04:07] <FERAS> i use live cd I want to use command apt
[04:08] <bendovergt> FERAS, you need to install the CD.
[04:08] <Toma-> AlexC_: im sorry, i gotta go. its the little root@ubuntu# that pops up when you enter recovery mode
[04:08] <nothlit> lewyjh, or if you're trying to do it system wide... you can copy it with alt+f2 gksudo nautilus, that gives you a root permissions filebrowser

[04:08] <lewyjh> nothlit, what is nautilus?

[04:12] <ClayG> unsure
[04:12] <Journeyman> Clarrisa_2008, google: custom bash prompt, or change bash prompt
[04:12] <diskus> ClayG: there's probably no real reason to change to edgy yet
[04:12] <Clarrisa_2008> ok ty
[04:13] <ClayG> diskus, i feel the same way

[04:19] <FERAS> sooooory
[04:19] <nothlit> lewyjh, paste it into /home/lewyjh/.mozilla/plugins/ if those folders are made

[04:20] <hiffy> LjL: Tone doesn't carry over the tubes
[04:20] <tuxub> i am mounting a windows cd in my ubuntu box and some chars in the filname appear with strange symbols. the original filenames have accents. how can I view the filenames correctly?
[04:20] <nothlit> lewyjh, or wherever your home folder is of course :)
[04:20] <hiffy> danke regardless.
[04:20] <robdeman> all: my Ubuntu menu's are missing icons such as add/remove software etc
[04:20] <lewyjh> nothlit, okay.
[04:21] <robdeman> all: I am not sure what I did that made it go waway..
[04:21] <wijnand> robdeman: have you tried the windows solution? :)
[04:21] <LjL> FERAS: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto last paragraph
[04:21] <robdeman> wijnand: what?
[04:21] <wijnand> robdeman: reinstall everything :)
[04:21] <robdeman> wijnand: OMG no
[04:21] <robdeman> wijnand: I just replace Win2003 by Ubuntu
[04:22] <robdeman> wijnand: took me 2 days
[04:22] <pantalaimon_> robdeman, maybe run update-menus
[04:22] <AlexC_> Ubuntu ( which is on a SATA hard drive ) will not boot when I connect my IDE hard drive - I get errors: end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 8 and Buffer I/O error on device sda, sector 24 - can anyone help?
[04:22] <LjL> robdeman: what if you "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"?
[04:22] <ClayG> how do i get the windows like box when you ctrl-altr-delete?
[04:22] <ClayG> taskmanager or whatever where it shows the cpu load
[04:22] <ClayG> with a graph
[04:22] <dreamer> hmm, my soundcard just borked ?
[04:22] <lewyjh> nothlit, is it okay that those files aren't in my home folder?
[04:23] <frogzoo> tuxub: try the 'utf8' option maybe, or play with iocharset
[04:23] <AlexC_> ClayG: it's in Systems -> Admin,
[04:23] <dreamer> I was listening to pandora.com and now all of asudden the sound is repeating
[04:23] <AlexC_> forgot what it's called, though.
[04:23] <tuxub> utf8 is used in ubuntu
[04:23] <dreamer> I closed FF and the soundcard is still repeating
[04:23] <kay_> hi, i am new to ubuntu an dlooking for a way to install openmotif. it doesn't appear to be in the repositories, does it?
[04:23] <tuxub> windows uses iso-8859-1 right?
[04:23] <dreamer> how can I reset the soundcard ?
[04:24] <LjL> tuxub, depends what region you have set, i guess
[04:24] <rambo3> buy default
[04:24] <LjL> tuxub: but the "utf8" option in mounts, IIRC, means to *convert* filenames to utf8
[04:24] <rambo3> so you get tex#".txt
[04:24] <Clarrisa_2008> anyone here use putty alot?  I was curious what your favorite settings are for font/appearance so that the text is more easily readable??
[04:24] <nothlit> lewyjh, sure you can put them in /usr/share/mozilla/plugins
[04:25] <nothlit> i find putty highly readable by default
[04:25] <nothlit> and if i didn't i'd just foward gnome-terminal over x
[04:25] <Clarrisa_2008> I can't see the text very well, it's too light
[04:25] <robdeman> pantalaimon_ what is update-menus ?
[04:25] <robdeman> pantalaimon_: no such command seems to exist?
[04:26] <Clarrisa_2008> light text on black background
[04:26] <lewyjh> nothlit, either way will work?
[04:26] <dreamer> how can I reset the soundcard? pandora.com borked after an hour or something and the sound is 'repeating'
[04:26] <lewyjh> nothlit, this may sound dumb...whats the command for copying and pasting?
[04:26] <frogzoo> dreamer: /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
[04:27] <dreamer> frogzoo: thnx!
[04:27] <psusi> LjL: cool results
[04:27] <frogzoo> dreamer: a sudo in front, btw
[04:27] <nothlit> lewyjh, cp
[04:27] <johnstar> does anyone know how to mount a usb thumb drive before login? Im trying to put a home dir on it
[04:27] <pantalaimon_> robdeman, well i dont know. it exists
[04:27] <dreamer> frogzoo: still borking
[04:27] <pantalaimon_> robdeman, here
[04:27] <lewyjh> nothlit, man...what a e noob...(me)
[04:27] <blaa> nothlit: It 's not work
[04:27] <dreamer> it shuts up during the restart and just keeps going after that
[04:27] <psusi> johnstar: I don't think that's a good idea... you won't be able to login without it
[04:27] <nothlit> lewyjh, if you don't know it i highly recommend you don't use cp with root priveleges until you know what you're doing
[04:27] <rambo3> !fstab > johnstar

[04:28] <prOMiNd> im use Ubuntu 6.10

[04:28] <prOMiNd> toxicfume: hi
[04:28] <blaa> nothlit: I can't upload file to ubuntu server
[04:29] <tuxub> LjL, you were right. windows nero burns with utf8 ... and you have to force it in /etc/fstab with iocharset=utf8 to work
[04:29] <dreamer> frogzoo: any other ideas ?
[04:29] <tuxub> LjL, tnhaks
[04:29] <johnstar> I have a thumb drive with ubuntu installed on it and I edited the cd so there is a user in /media/home/usr   but it gives errors
[04:29] <toxicfume> Does Ubuntu's latest livecd work with the Acer 1692WLMi laptop?
[04:29] <LjL> psusi: is the fsck complaining normal? (my guess was that it had to do with that date discrepancy in the ls diff, which defrag somehow created and which wasn't reflected in the journal... does that make sense?)

[04:30] <dreamer> anybody an idea how to reset the soundcard? reseting alsa-utils doesn't work
[04:30] <blaa> nothlit: thx
[04:30] <psusi> LjL: I got that message too, but have no idea why... since it doesn't seem to have any negative effects though, I ignored it ;)
[04:30] <johnstar> if I edit fstab will it mount before login?

[04:36] <njero> Just wanted to let everyone know: I was in here yesterday trying to get Edgy installed and had a weird partitioning problem where I thought I lost everything... turns out (with help here) I was able to abort the default partitioning which appeared to have locked up. I went back through the install and used manual partitioning (gparted) and it reported that the drive had sector errors. I...
[04:36] <njero> ...think the drive was already like that though and that was what caused the first crash. After fixing them (with chkdsk /f in windows) I was able to install! Thanks!

[05:03] <kishan> humbol:yes u need to use terminsl in the terminsl sudo pppoeconf
[05:04] <kishan> frogzoo i want it to hibernate
[05:04] <fialar> anyone know when UBuntu's kernel image will update to 2.6.18 or .19?
[05:04] <hikenboot> hello all ---I know I need to edit the rc.conf in order to start bind9 and dhcp3 anyone got any directions on how to do this properly?
[05:04] <frogzoo> kishan: now push the power button - your session should be restored
[05:04] <crimsun_> fialar: it won't.
[05:04] <fialar> crimsun_: why's that?
[05:04] <crimsun_> fialar: we don't update kernels for released (frozen) ... releases.
[05:04] <LjL> fialar: releases don't get updates, except for security fixes and fixes to very serious bugs.
[05:05] <LjL> !backports | fialar, except for this
[05:05] <ubotu> fialar, except for this: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[05:05] <LjL> but that certainly doesn't apply to the kernel
[05:05] <fialar> ahh ok
[05:05] <plesnivyjano> which client-server vnc is fastest today ?
[05:05] <fialar> was hoping an update to the ipw2200 driver
[05:05] <crimsun_> officially backporting the kernel would make me a very sad panda.
[05:05] <zub> Hi
[05:05] <zub> I fixed  /etc/fstab
[05:05] <fialar> since it's causing my laptop to lock up hard for 10 seconds, randomly.. complaining about formware problems
[05:05] <Helpmeee> when I try to use "wget" it says "Resolving http://example.com .... failed"
[05:05] <kishan> frogzoo: the problem is when i hibernates it shutsdown completely when i push the power button it restarts completely i mean it boots up again
[05:05] <zub> but still same effect
[05:06] <crimsun_> fialar: you can compile ipw2200 yourself, too :)
[05:06] <zub> that is : i cloned an hd to make a machine with same configuration
[05:06] <zub> and now it does not boot after grub
[05:06] <fialar> crimsun_: yeah I guess, bit it's already embedded in the linux-image-generic
[05:06] <zub> the hardware is different
[05:06] <Dud0er> Hi, are there any wlan monitoring applications out there for (x)ubuntu?
[05:07] <crimsun_> fialar: you can always overwrite it. Not recommended but certainly feasible.
[05:07] <svip> Why does "Layout View" show nothing?  It's supposed to view my keymap.
[05:07] <frogzoo> kishan: do you have a swap part'n configured?
[05:07] <Helpmeee> when I try to use "wget" it says "Resolving http://example.com .... failed" Any idea whats wrong?
[05:07] <veediot> dud0er. monitoring how?
[05:07] <kishan> frogzoo: i do have a swap partition
[05:07] <zub> Sorry, i cloned an hard disk
[05:08] <zub> using gparted
[05:08] <zub> and now does not boot after grub, grub is right
[05:08] <kishan> sorry
[05:08] <zub> i asked you before
[05:08] <Dud0er> as in displaying the signal strength, packets transmitted etc... something simple. I am not talking about a packet monitoring utility like ethereal
[05:08] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: DNS problem, maybe?
[05:08] <zub> you told me maybe could be /etc/fstab
[05:08] <Hooked-on-GL> Hey, in the logout menu of Gnome, theere is only a hibernate button.  I have tried a lot and cant find how to fix it.  Any ideas?
[05:08] <kishan> frogzoo the swap has disappear
[05:08] <zub> true, had to be modified
[05:08] <Helpmeee> DarthLappy, how can i fix this?
[05:08] <zub> but still i get no boot after grub
[05:08] <veediot> Dud0er. Use networkmanager
[05:08] <zub> i see the ubuntu logo
[05:09] <zub> but the progress bar does not go
[05:09] <zub> any other idea of what i could fix?
[05:09] <kishan> frogzoo
[05:09] <zub> grub is ok, fstab is ok
[05:09] <Dud0er> veediot: networkmanager? is it there for xubuntu?
[05:09] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: Is your networking set up?
[05:10] <Helpmeee> DarthLappy: Yah... think so.. Did a text install last night
[05:10] <zub> can anybody help me?
[05:10] <kishan> frogzoo:mine is a dual boot with windows xp is that the reason ,now my swap partion says its unrecoznised
[05:10] <veediot> Dud0er. The network-manager-gnome dock applet should work for you in XFCE, yeah
[05:10] <frogzoo> kishan: are you sharing swap between windows & linux?
[05:10] <Helpmeee> and now i cant get into ubuntu because i get a black screen
[05:11] <zub> frogzoo, any other thing i can fix?
[05:11] <sc4ttrbrain> windows dont use swap (cant)
[05:11] <kishan> frogzoo:if i am right windows doesnot use swap
[05:11] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: I'm not sure about the black screen thing.
[05:11] <DarthLappy> I don't even have Ubuntu installed on anything at the moment.
[05:11] <veediot> Dud0er: you'll also need to install xfce4-xfapplet-plugin
[05:11] <frogzoo> kishan: windows uses swap - question is, did it overwrite the hibernate info?
[05:12] <Helpmeee> DarthLappy: No one is ;) Thats why i need to use wget to download and install nvidia drivers
[05:12] <zub> I don't see any error message, that is also a problem
[05:12] <zub> Otherwise i could help myself
[05:12] <frogzoo> zub: if the hardware diffs are stopping it booting, a clean install's easiest
[05:12] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: Hehe, well do other networking tools work, say ping?
[05:12] <kishan> frogzo: how to check that , i know i made a seperate logical partition
[05:12] <zub> frogzoo, how can the hardware make problems
[05:12] <Dud0er> veediot: fine, i'll take a look at it. Thanks :)
[05:12] <zub> different modules
[05:12] <zub> no problem ever
[05:12] <frogzoo> zub: different drivers
[05:12] <zub> well
[05:13] <zub> kernel has all the modules
[05:13] <zub> so what drivers you talking about?
[05:13] <kishan> frogzoo: i made a seperate partion for everything, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36836/
[05:13] <Helpmeee> Darthlappy: i tried ping it just takes lesser than 1sec and it says: Downloaded 0
[05:13] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: What did you ping?
[05:13] <Helpmeee> google
[05:14] <zub> frogzoo, i never saw a linux disk complaining about different hardware, the modules for every thing are in the kernel.
[05:14] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: Can you wget google then?
[05:14] <Helpmeee> didnt try that
[05:15] <Helpmeee> DarthLappy: Is there any way to check if you have a connection to internet?
[05:15] <frogzoo> zub: if the initrd image won't boot the hardware...
[05:15] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: ifconfig ?
[05:15] <MasterLexx> how can i control at install which bootmanager to install and where to install it?
[05:15] <zub> frogzoo, what you talking about
[05:15] <zub> never saw that EVER
[05:15] <LjL> MasterLexx: you can't, with the Desktop CD
[05:15] <LjL> Ubotu, tell MasterLexx about alternate | MasterLexx, see the private message from Ubotu
[05:15] <DarthLappy> Well, that will show you if you have a working network connection.
[05:16] <MasterLexx> i have alternate cd
[05:16] <Helpmeee> DarthLappy: Ok ;p Ive should have known that ;
[05:16] <zub> frogzoo, how is that there is no error messages?
[05:16] <MasterLexx> but even in textmode i get no choice
[05:16] <LjL> MasterLexx: then it should be doable, but i don't precisely know how
[05:16] <MasterLexx> oem mode the same
[05:16] <robdeman> hi anybody here that can explain why about 50% of my menu items, especially the ones in System -> Administration are gone?
[05:16] <MasterLexx> is it at partitioning?
[05:17] <robdeman> I did do some ubuntu-desktop remove/install, killall gome-panels etc etc but nothing helps
[05:17] <kishan> frogzoo: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36838/ my fstab please check
[05:17] <Helpmeee> DarthLappy: I have like 5-6 of xorg-conf in X11, how do i delete them
[05:17] <DarthLappy> Helpmeee: As in, multiple files?
[05:18] <kishan> i guess my swap partion is said to be unrecoined now
[05:18] <wijnand> DarthLappy: wasn't that rm -rf / ? :)
[05:18] <LjL> MasterLexx: perhaps this has some information https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows , doesn't seem too in-depth though
[05:18] <Helpmeee> Darthlappy: One by one
[05:18] <DarthLappy> wijnand: Hehe.
[05:18] <fuoco> does ubuntu support selinux ?
[05:18] <MasterLexx> i want to use my own bootmanager

[05:19] <Helpmeee> brb
[05:19] <frogzoo> kishan: if you boot up, hibernate immediately, and restart straight away, does it work?
[05:19] <mrlinux> how do i enable mp3 and wma support in rythembox
[05:20] <jrib> !mp3 | mrlinux
[05:20] <ubotu> mrlinux: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[05:20] <kishan> frogzoo: now i checked my swap partion it is unrecozined
[05:21] <LjL> MasterLexx, uh, then i guess you could just skip the relevant step in the alternate cd installer, and do it manually later...
[05:21] <frogzoo> kishan: well, you'll need to boot the live cd, then run mkswap on it
[05:21] <LjL> MasterLexx: i believe if you hit "Cancel" (or the equivalent) in the installer, on most stages it will dump you to a menu that lists the thing the installer would be doing it - that way you can skip the ones you want to avoid
[05:22] <MasterLexx> hmmm, maybe, at me it jumped from one step to the next and i got no option for grub at all
[05:22] <MasterLexx> yes thanks, i will try
[05:22] <kishan> frogzoo: i will fix it the problem is why this happened when i go into hiberanate why my swap dies
[05:22] <LjL> MasterLexx: might be "embedded" in the partitioning-setup step
[05:22] <MasterLexx> maybe
[05:23] <MasterLexx> i know how to handle XOSL and bootstar, so i will stay at them
[05:25] <Moosejaw> anyone here run fulltiltpoker in ubuntu using wine?
[05:25] <kane77> I accidentaly removed open-office while I was editing file... will my document be OK??
[05:26] <zub> frogzoo, can it be that there is some issue with the fact that i copied also the swap?

[05:36] <yoshig3> LjL: I appreciate it, but ubuntu just isn't working out for me. It seems to want to not work more than work for me, so I'm going back to my idiot-proof windows :D But thanks for all of your help
[05:36] <LjL> derekS: not fixed yet, but i don't know if it can be fixed manually, reading the reports
[05:37] <green_earz> hello all, i can not remember the command that lets me see what the boot log out put was. its some thing like : mesges   ??

[05:41] <ValMarko> I'm using open source driver for my ati radeon 9550. I know there's official driver from ati. Should I install it?
[05:41] <LjL> yoshig3, installing things is incredibly easy compared to windows, *if* those things are in the repositories. if they aren't, it can be tough luck, but then myself i didn't have to do that so often (but then again not everybody uses computers to do the same things)
[05:41] <yoshig3> dfwlinuxguy: I kinda like having an OS that just "works", so I've kinda begun to appreciate windows. But ubuntu definately has visuals and security out way before vista
[05:41] <yoshig3> LjL: Yeah, that's a big if too.
[05:41] <rebecca> savvas: .. or anyone?? im having a lot of trouble getting a mere SBlive working here.....
[05:41] <dfwlinuxguy> yoshig3 you should definately use what "works" for you

But hey, it's not because ubuntu is bad- it's because I dont' want to take hte time to learn linux entirely just to get ubuntu to operate correctly for me.

[05:43] <sergevn> dfwlinuxguy: Well i have, in xgl session my keyboard shortcuts doesnt work anymore
[05:43] <LjL> yoshig3, you don't "double click and it's there" in Windows -- you have to go to a site, download the software, then (yes) double click the icon, then go through the installation wizard, then hope it doesn't require other software you don't have, and then possibly reboot

[05:43] <yoshig3> LjL: yeah the rebooting is definately a big hassle, but the wizards are usually for obvious purposes, like install type and location, and aren't usually that long.
[05:43] <LjL> yoshig3: with ubuntu, you either click on Package Manager, click on the program you want, and click Install, or (if from a non-standard repository), click on Software Sources, add the repository, and do the same thing as before
[05:44] <sergevn> dfwlinuxguy: what is aiglx?

[05:47] <n2diy> Helpmee, ok, try /etc/ppp/ppp.conf or something like that.
[05:47] <LjL> nothlit, *you* could figure which -dev packages they needed. most people don't even have a clue what a -dev package is to start with, and if anything, they try and install the non-dev packages... and then again, even myself i sometimes have trouble finding the right -dev (knowing about apt-file and/or auto-apt helps there too)

[05:47] <Rprp`> Hi, how can i change my server time? someonme a idea?
[05:47] <LjL> nothlit, you might be interested in looking at an ancient, experimental and probably incredibly dangerous script i started writing once
[05:47] <dfwlinuxguy> richee...although with edgy I've found that I have to use export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 && xmms to start xmms doublesize..I just created a script to do it for me

[05:48] <ultm8> u could cheat a set the server time via bios ;o)
[05:48] <LjL> nothlit: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoDeb and http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-90602.html
[05:48] <LjL> nothlit: yes, really. i did horrible things with apt-get (or aptitude) in there
[05:48] <n2diy> Helpmeee, yep, I don't go there often.
[05:48] <LjL> nothlit: you're allowed to run it wherever you like, just don't come back and kill me :D
[05:49] <nothlit> LjL, wait is it the one that mashes checkinstall and auto-apt together, and now uses aptitude so the automatic removal stuff is safer?
[05:49] <nothlit> LjL, if it is I saw it on the wiki ^^

[05:49] <LjL> nothlit: well yes, it does that. though i don't really remember if the latest version used aptitude or tried to went back to apt-get, and that sort of thing -- but yeah, i guess it's the one you have in mind (i don't know of others)
[05:49] <robdeman> can I apt-get it?
[05:50] <LjL> yoshig3: ok
[05:50] <richee> dfwlinuxguy: NO dude, what I am talking about is when I click on 0 on the left hand side of the XMMS player or whatever u call it, it comes up with a menu and that menu only has shortcut keys and there no text in them.

[05:51] <LjL> n2diy: if you backup /usr, then you might as well just backup the entire filesystem i guess...
[05:51] <brussel> Is there a howto for ubuntu edgy on how to set up awstats?

[05:51] <richee> dfwlinuxguy: it's still the same
[05:52] <LjL> yoshig3: i can't agree, but perhaps it's just my system that doesn't run it too smoothly
[05:52] <nothlit> I wonder what made sliced bread so much cooler than hand broken bread

[05:53] <lala88> hi
[05:53] <richee> can anyone help me ?
[05:53] <dfwlinuxguy> richee...never seen that particular problem...not sure where to point to next
[05:53] <richee> dfwlinuxguy: ok
[05:54] <LjL> nothlit: anyway the idea (which was only partly and brokingly put into practice) was not just to wrap auto-apt and checkinstall together, but also to obtain packages that are closer to "real" packages -- i.e. listing dependencies (both -dev depends and runtime). the first is achieved by, well, just listing the -dev's that were installed, and the latter by using ld to check which libraries the program seems to want
[05:54] <richee> dfwlinuxguy: Will use rythm box
[05:54] <yoshig3> LjL: It's not super smooth for me either, it's just fun to flop windows around and spin my desktop cube until my eyes cross. The minimizing/maximizing effects are cool too.
[05:54] <g8db2> i have ext2(3?) partition and i use it under windows with Ext2IFS_1_10c.exe but now it seems as not formatted, and i can`t get files from it. what do?
[05:54] <dfwlinuxguy> richee...banshee is pretty cool as well

[05:55] <yoshig3> LjL: What's the superior file system to your knowledge? And no bias lol...ext3, ntfs, fat32, or something else?
[05:55] <LjL> yoshig3: well yeah, but i'd rather just see smooth window movement and resizing (and perhaps some shadows, but only if there isn't a stability price to pay)... the minimize/maximize effects also are slow here, which makes them just annoying
[05:55] <rysiek|pl> dfwlinuxguy: now it's "(EE) AIGLX: DRI module not loaded"
[05:55] <rysiek|pl> dfwlinuxguy: and... "(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to initialize the GLX module; please check in your X" hmm...
[05:55] <yoshig3> LjL: See that's weird. My beryl runs fine but everything else is slow. Lol....weird.
[05:56] <dfwlinuxguy> rysiek|pl I'm checking
[05:56] <LjL> yoshig3, how can you ask for "no bias", everyone's biased ;-) NTFS has some features that i always wanted, chiefly transparent compression (and there's encryption too, though i care less about that). ext3 is very reliable, but lacks just about every feature a filesystem can lack :-D NTFS also can be defragmented online, while ext3 can (though on the plus side, the way it works makes fragmentation much, much less of an issue)
[05:56] <rysiek|pl> dfwlinuxguy: yeah, me too
[05:56] <weswh-> is it possible to set up an ssh server off of the livecd? given you have to install it after you install the system, i imagine not. trying to figure out a way to access the hd in the machine from my laptop, without having to install the system first.

[05:57] <rysiek|pl> dfwlinuxguy: in the meantime I'm upgrading - kernel image and headers, as apt told me
[05:57] <LjL> yoshig3: as for the other Unix-style filesystems (reiserfs, xfs), they're probably nice, but i'd rather just stay with ext3 because of the known reliability... also, i'd like to see a good versioning filesystem, but i'm afraid none of today's OSs don't have one

[05:58] <guest_pranav> is there an easy way to increase swap mm
[05:58] <nothlit> yoshig3, reiserfs is the most popular fast for small files, ext3 most stable, gives you more space, is slower... and xfs, much less support, but great for large files
[05:58] <dfwlinuxguy> rysiek|pl ...you might also try running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg again after you do that and don't check dri when it asks you what modules to load

[05:59] <derekS> LjL: thanks for the courier-authdaemon bug pages... i am looking now, (sorry my boss called me in)
[05:59] <Rage__> loulou: #ubuntu.fr
[05:59] <yoshig3> LjL: From my experience with ubuntu, I've noticed that things compress/decompress MUCH faster. This could be due to the ext3 file system, or it being a tar.gz.
[05:59] <ultm8> #kubuntu
[05:59] <markeib> mjr: hey, it's me again, with the webcam and the soundcard, i rebooted and now even with the webcam not plugged in the sound doesn't work O.O
[05:59] <loulou> G rien compris
[06:00] <dfwlinuxguy> rysiek|pl it just won't add it, but I've always been able to get my video working again in this way when I've had a problem
[06:00] <loulou> T ki toi
[06:00] <LjL> yoshig3, i'm not sure. bz2 is kind of slower than gz (especially when compressing!), it also compresses better though -- it's usually a compromise between speed and compression ratio. but yeah, i guess the filesystem might also make a difference, especially if you're extracting an archive that contains many small files
[06:00] <tuxub> how can I burn a disc with a file with 4GB ??? I tried brasero, gnome baker and k3b and all of them failed to burn the disc
[06:00] <markeib> i will reboot now
[06:00] <LjL> yoshig3: but what i was saying is that NTFS has *transparent* compression anyway, i.e. you can just say, "this file should be stored compressed", and the program will be able to still use it as a normal file
[06:00] <dfwlinuxguy> rysiek|pl there is another reference about dri near the bottom that you might try commenting out
[06:00] <nothlit> tuxub, the ISO filesystem only supports files less than 2gigs, you'll need to split the file
[06:00] <nothlit> !split | tuxub
[06:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about split - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:01] <LjL> loulou: english please
[06:01] <nothlit> tuxub, anyways, look into the split command
[06:01] <loulou> no comprendo !
[06:01] <nothlit> yoshig3, but with linux you can use FUSE and overlay transparent compression over any filesystem
[06:01] <yoshig3> LjL: yeah, like the "compress old files" or "compress this disk" features?
[06:01] <LjL> loulou: then go to #ubuntu-fr
[06:02] <nothlit> that's french? ^.-
[06:02] <loulou> http://www.ubuntu-fr.com
[06:02] <rysiek|pl> dfwlinuxguy: ok, I'll try that as soon as the upgrade's done
[06:02] <LjL> yoshig3: well yeah, but those are just "smart" utilities to reach that function. in general, you can just right click a file/directory, do "Properties", and specify whether you want it to be compressed or not, and encrypted or not
[06:02] <yoshig3> nothlit: That's what I said lol
[06:02] <nothlit> yoshig3, well then i missed it
[06:02] <LjL> nothlit: the last one, no. it's a mixture of spanish and italian, more than anything else :)
[06:02] <tuxub> nothlit, I can burn those type of discs in windows with nero. are you sure?

[06:03] <msun> Q:  I am installing Ubuntu and during the install I need to edit my xorg.conf and restart gdm, but it fails to restart.  Is there a way to do this?  I need to do this so it will display correctly on my widescreen monitor, and using the alternate cd is not an option for me for certain reasons.   is there any way to get this to work
[06:03] <yoshig3> nothlit: No, that's what I mean- It didn't look like french to me either
[06:03] <yoshig3> lol
[06:03] <yoshig3> LjL: LjL, I have a question, and I don't want you to hate me for it. Please. May I ask?(I know don't ask to ask, but this is a dangerous question.)
[06:03] <dfwlinuxguy> msun if it fails to restart, it is likely a problem with your xorg.conf

[06:04] <yoshig3> LjL: I shall :D
[06:04] <msun> Is there a way to stop the installer from using whatever bizarre graphics display mode it keeps going into?  ... to force it to use a standard mode?

[06:07] <Salil> hello I am facing some problem while installing the ubuntu distro ..
[06:07] <msun> oh wait i know why, the installation program is still running in the graphical window while i am in alt-f1 terminal!! DUH.  Maybe if I kill that process first, THEN restart gdm, it will work?  Then I just need to restart the installer program's process?  anyone?
[06:08] <Salil> Installation went through fine ....  but while trying to run update-manager, it ask for root password and when I gave passowrd, it says "incorrect" password
[06:08] <Salil> and came out
[06:08] <Salil> not sure what is going wrong ..
[06:08] <robdeman> could anybody send me the original /etc/apache2/sites-availanle/default ?
[06:08] <dfwlinuxguy> salil...it doesn't ask for root's password, but your username password
[06:09] <Salil> the only difference in the installation was, I have created a root user and assign the password for root user during installtion
[06:09] <nothlit> Salil, you give your regular password
[06:09] <Salil> oh .. no  my root password and username password are the same
[06:09] <Salil> it doesn't work nothlit
[06:09] <nothlit> Salil, you can't create a root account during installation
[06:10] <Salil> during installation it asked for creating a user, there I entered root  and set password
[06:10] <Vorbote> Salil: you may be able to fix up your system by installing user-setup and running it.
[06:10] <Salil> but I can du 'su -' with this credentials

[06:29] <rickest> I cannot find any plf repositories for breezy, is it discontinued?
[06:29] <\lart> I've got a server running the dapper server release.  php5 is installed and working properly with apache (via the standard php5 packages).  I just tried to add php5-snmp and php5-gd, and they both complained about my php5 versions - " Depends: php5-common (= 5.1.2-1ubuntu3) but 5.1.2-1ubuntu3.3 is to be installed"  Seems to me that the php5-gd and php5-snmp packages were never updated.
[06:29] <ArCHoNKoG> jrib, alright.
[06:29] <\lart> anyone have thoughts to share on that?
[06:30] <DarkCookie> doesn't ubuntu have a c compiler preinstalled? my program says no c compiler found in $PATH

[06:32] <dfwlinuxguy> \lart probably the easiest thing to do would be to start synaptic and choose fix broken packages from the menu
[06:32] <jonafan> it must be, or it will throw a fit
[06:33] <jrib> ArCHoNKoG: ok, seems fine to just create it with touch.  Do this command: sudo touch /var/lib/dpkg/lock

[06:47] <Jussi01> rysiek|pl: is lineak in the ubuntu repositaries?
[06:47] <DarkCookie> isn't xwindow preinstalled on ubuntu, and if not where can i get it?
[06:47] <rysiek|pl> Jussi01: easy to check - apt-cache seatch lineak - but yes, it is
[06:47] <Jussi01> thanks!!
[06:48] <rysiek|pl> DarkCookie: xserver is preinstalled, but the header files are not
[06:48] <rysiek|pl> Jussi01: apt-cache search lineakd - that will give you the list off all lineak-related packages
[06:48] <mrlinux> i need help installing my java rpm any help
[06:49] <rysiek|pl> Jussi01: are you using GNOME or KDE, btw?
[06:49] <cyberjunkie> ubuntu doesnt come with KDE? :<

[06:49] <dabaR_> I installed a program called mixxx, from universe, and when I run it, it tells me the audio device could not be opened. terminal output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36850/. I tried killing esd, but no sound. Ideas?
[06:50] <rysiek|pl> bXi: Rosegarden AFAIK
[06:50] <rysiek|pl> but you have to check it

[07:02] <vanberge> im moving to linux completely, but want to keep my email
[07:02] <avis> is your wireless card supported natively ?
[07:02] <eloquence_> its a 3945
[07:02] <eloquence_> it was working OOTB
[07:02] <avis> venberge you should have checked an option in your current email client to leave messages on server
[07:02] <eloquence_> but the ipw3945 driver needs ieee80211 subsystem installed
[07:03] <dabaR_> Zaggynl: no, the point is that once an Ubuntu is released, no new package versions are put in it. If Ubuntu 6.06 releases wityh vlc 1.1, and later vlc 1.7 comes out it can only show up in the backports repository, not as a replacement to the 1.1 released with 6.06.

[07:03] <eloquence_> ubuntu tells me ieee80211 1.1.11 is installed but when i try to install ipw3945 it asks for ieee80211
[07:03] <Zaggynl> ahh okay
[07:03] <dabaR_> vanberge: is there a export option in the menu?
[07:03] <eloquence_> when i tried to install a new ieee80211... i got screwed... wiped away my original wireless connectivity and nobody seems to know how to fix it

[07:14] <avis> i can't believe the day is just beginning
[07:14] <caffiendo> Is there an easy way to resize images?  I want to make thumbnails
[07:14] <Arcad3> hi folks whats new in Ubuntu World?
[07:14] <nothlit> caffiendo, just use gimp
[07:14] <dabaR_> Arcad3: fridge.ubuntu.com planet.ubuntu.com
[07:14] <Arcad3> :)
[07:14] <nothlit> caffiendo, or you can use imagemagic for the command line
[07:14] <avis> caffiendo, i tried that with gimp if you figure out how to crop then resize say 90x90 for ubuntuforums.org i'd love to know how
[07:14] <Arcad3> what shall i use for JAva And Flash desing?
[07:15] <Arcad3> what packages
[07:15] <Arcad3> ?
[07:15] <avis> though i dont know enough about gimp to get my ubuntuforums avator under 20k
[07:15] <cryptid> i am having problem with XGL video playback
[07:15] <caffiendo> nothlit: I'm using gimp, but new to it. Use to Photoshop..
[07:15] <caffiendo> nothlit: I couldn't figure it out in gimp..
[07:15] <ganjaklaus> cryptid: maybe your system / vga is too slow
[07:15] <avis> there is an open source programming language i dont know much try apt-cache search flash
[07:15] <nothlit> Arcad3, lol i'm not sure there is an opensource flash designer
[07:16] <avis> first do an update though apt-get update
[07:16] <avis> i believe there is one.
[07:16] <Arcad3> Java?
[07:16] <astroman> i anyone knows where i can find few command like WC, Diff, Uniq, Cut, Head, Tail that are program in awk ???
[07:16] <avis> java is in the repos
[07:16] <dabaR_> !!gnash
[07:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gnash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:16] <dabaR_> !gnash
[07:16] <avis> its sun-java4-bin
[07:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gnash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:16] <nothlit> caffiendo, what you need to know is that the file/menu system on the gimp window only does things like open documents, you need to use the file menu on the image window
[07:16] <avis> apt-get install that
[07:16] <avis> on dapper you also have to activate it
[07:16] <avis> not on edgy
[07:17] <Pie-rat1> Only 1 of my laptops 2 speakers works. How might I fix this?

[07:18] <avis> long time support
[07:18] <avis> for businesses
[07:18] <nothlit> eloquence_, ubuntu lts is supported for 3 years instead of 1 1/2 onthe desktop
[07:18] <ganjaklaus> eloquence_ LTS means long term support
[07:18] <nothlit> eloquence_, and lts supports the server for 5 years
[07:18] <Pie-rat1> avis: where might i find a laptop guru?
[07:18] <avis> wbpb_ubuntu, #ubuntu-es
[07:18] <Arcad3> and that java in repos has an interface?
[07:18] <astroman> i anyone knows where i can find few command like WC, Diff, Uniq, Cut, Head, Tail that are program in awk ???
[07:18] <dabaR_> eloquence_: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases
[07:18] <avis> usenet or craigslist and you might need to buy another speaker on ebay.
[07:19] <eloquence_> i see itsays long Term Support
[07:19] <eloquence_> but what does that mena?
[07:19] <avis> sun-java5-bin installs the jre for me
[07:19] <Eddie> i need download a copy of the 2.6.18.3 kernel source can i do this via apt-get?
[07:19] <dabaR_> eloquence_: go read the link
[07:19] <eloquence_> what is the functionality difference?
[07:19] <nothlit> Arcad3, for programming java you might look at eclipse
[07:19] <nothlit> eloquence_, ubuntu lts is supported for 3 years instead of 1 1/2 onthe desktop
[07:19] <avis> eddie use synaptic
[07:19] <nothlit> eloquence_, and lts supports the server for 5 years
[07:19] <Eddie> ok i will give it a try
[07:20] <Tomcat_> eloquence_: The functionality difference is that all apps are on a different version.
[07:20] <ToHellWithGA> Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/universe/source/Sources.bz2  MD5Sum mismatch
[07:20] <avis> eloquence_, it means the time that it will be supported with updates and support team and develop is a certain duration of time
[07:20] <ToHellWithGA> does that mean it's out of sync?
[07:20] <nothlit> avis, ubuntu is using 2.6.17
[07:20] <Tomcat_> eloquence_: If you want new things and expect buggy apps, get regular Ubuntu (current is edgy 6.10), if you want absolute stability, get LTS.
[07:20] <dabaR_> ToHellWithGA: #ubuntu+1
[07:20] <avis> yes that is right i forgot i dont keep up i just stay updated.
[07:20] <dabaR_> ToHellWithGA: if you are using feisty, if you got that there by mistake, remove the whole line
[07:21] <ToHellWithGA> dabaR_: it's an apt-get question.  it's not a version specific thing
[07:21] <nothlit> If you want stability, get LTS, if you want absolute stability, get debian stable

[07:21] <ganjaklaus> Anybody on my TV issue?
[07:21] <ToHellWithGA> it's happened before in dapper and edgy and usually resolved itself.  today i'd like to better understand why sometimes there are MD5Sum mismatches
[07:21] <dabaR_> ToHellWithGA: did you ask there? They may know what the case is, since they all use that particular version...
[07:21] <eloquence_> lol
[07:21] <cryptid> ganjaklaus: no i have a nvidia 6600 256mb card with the drivers installed
[07:21] <avis> ToHellWithGA, it means that its checking the file against some hash and its not giving you the correct hash in response for parity reasons ?  i can't explain
[07:21] <Pie-rat1> avis: the speaker isn't the problem, the drivers are
[07:22] <eloquence_> what do ya'll run? LTS or regular?
[07:22] <avis> Pie-rat1, you didn't say that.  give ubuntuforums.org a try.
[07:22] <ganjaklaus> cryptid: what kind of video problems do you have? you got to me more specific
[07:22] <Tomcat_> eloquence_: Regular & ubuntu+1
[07:22] <eloquence_> also, how come there arn't specific releases for dual core as their are for 64bt?
[07:22] <ToHellWithGA> thanks avis.  i'll ask why in #ubuntu+1 for fun
[07:22] <reverseblade> Does nosmp boot option affects the performance severely in general desktop usage cases ?
[07:23] <nothlit> eloquence_, if you need to ask, I recommened you run LTS unless you have some hardware issue fixed in 6.10 (edgy)
[07:23] <Tomcat_> eloquence_: Dual core works by default, amd64 is a different system.
[07:23] <avis> eloquence_, any distro can do dual core with smp kernel
[07:23] <MsgToThePpl> hi, i've a typhoon webcam (0c45:612c) is possible to make it work ?
[07:23] <avis> one of them might happen to be distro specific
[07:23] <cryptid> ganjaklaus: well the movies and DVD that are played lagg alot but he 3d cube fade in and out and all those eye candy works perfectly
[07:23] <nothlit> eloquence_, most of the people giving help in the channel probably run 6.10 or even 6.10 and 7.04
[07:23] <eloquence_> ok ...
[07:23] <eloquence_> I think I will make th emove to edgy then
[07:23] <Arcad3> i run 6.06
[07:24] <eloquence_> i heard there was like so many issues with edgy and so much stuff not working OOTB
[07:24] <Arcad3> is the most  stable and the best Ubuntu ever
[07:24] <Tomcat_> eloquence_: I find edgy buggy, so be prepared. :)
[07:24] <avis> works fine with me
[07:24] <eloquence_> but i also heard ipw3945 works OOTB and a lot of hardware is supported now ...
[07:24] <eloquence_> ?
[07:24] <saxina> Currently using the LiveCD and installing Ubuntu Edgy! :)
[07:24] <avis> eloquence as with anything your mileage may vary
[07:24] <eloquence_> bah

[07:25] <ganjaklaus> cryptid: oly dvd playback crappy or also different video sources?
[07:25] <avis> not much difference in the install its pretty much a piece of cake using the alternate 6.10 cd
[07:25] <eloquence_> there is an older one that is pre-installed the 1.0.6 but ipw3945 needs 1.1.0+
[07:25] <Lattyware> Hey all, I'm trying to help a friend install Ubuntu.
[07:25] <eloquence_> it screwed me up so bad that now i have no wireless :-(
[07:25] <Lattyware> Problem is, that the CD won't load.
[07:25] <Lattyware> And he get's no screen output until he boots windows

[07:26] <Arcad3> gftp
[07:26] <Lattyware> so he can't see how to (and if he) get's into the bios.
[07:26] <Lattyware> to change it to boot from CD
[07:26] <saxina> gFTP is nice, indeed
[07:26] <DarkCookie> k thx
[07:26] <Lattyware> I find gFTP quite buggy actually.
[07:26] <avis> latty is the light on the atapi device coming on trying to boot before it jumps to windows ?
[07:26] <Lattyware> atapi?
[07:26] <avis> yes dvd/cd-rom
[07:26] <DarkCookie> i tried installing gftp and it says i need like glib 2.0 or something
[07:26] <Lattyware> ah
[07:26] <Lattyware> give me a second
[07:27] <pike_> rather use nautilus than gftp and i hate nautilus..
[07:27] <Arcad3> apt-get install gftp
[07:27] <avis> aptitude is nice to use sometimes when your unsure because it will install recommended packages.. ie aptitude install <package>
[07:27] <eloquence_> am i RO?
[07:27] <Pie-rat1> the HD audio device in my laptop doesn't appear to be supported, how do i get drivers for it?

[07:29] <reverseblade> Question: Does nosmp boot option affects the performance severely in general desktop usage cases ?
[07:29] <cyberjunkie> !grub
[07:29] <avis> i'm sorry Lattyware ?

[07:29] <avis> ok
[07:29] <Lattyware> sorry, was a while back, I had to ring him :P
[07:29] <avis> then it might either be a bad burn or a bad md5 hash for that cd.
[07:30] <Nei1> in need help installing Ultra VNC , i have downloaded the .exe but dont know what to do from there...
[07:30] <Lattyware> Nope, I told him to check
[07:30] <Lattyware> Plus it boots on another machine.
[07:30] <caffiendo> avis: u interested in how it's done? it's real easy..
[07:30] <mrlinux> i need help finding a ubuntu driver for a Lexmark t522  what extention should i look for
[07:30] <avis> if your on windows you can download a really lame windows accelerator and download it with 4 simulateneous connections.  it'll be quickest that way.  though most people will tell you to check the md5 of the cd first because it doesn't seem to have burned right
[07:31] <avis> caffiendo,  interested in how what is done ?
[07:31] <nothlit> avis, theres download accelerators for linux too
[07:31] <avis> oh yes

[07:31] <avis> its very nice for console
[07:31] <Lattyware> avis: So yeah, the CD definatly boots on another machine.
[07:32] <caffiendo> avis: you said u needed it for ubunforums.org or something?

[07:36] <avis> and they didn't use wine
[07:36] <lumaQQ> ok
[07:36] <caffiendo> avis: On the image screen, goto the "image" menu on the top, drop down to "Scale Image" from there, just use the up and down arrows to adjust the size to the # pixels needed.  they stay proportionate
[07:36] <lumaQQ> so fluxbox?  and Flex?
[07:36] <psusi> flash is evil, don't use it
[07:36] <avis> ok
[07:36] <avis> i'm going to make a sticky note

[07:38] <psusi> I was reading the other day that some web sites are now being sued for abusing flash under the americans with disabilities act...
[07:38] <psusi> maybe that will finally wake people up and get them to make their web sites bloody compatible
[07:38] <lumaQQ> psusi   america ~ the worlds worst country ...~~
[07:38] <avis> there is beta flash for edgy i believe its worked for me
[07:38] <avis> americans with disabilities act ?
[07:38] <avis> and flash ?
[07:39] <lumaQQ> and as for people not being able to use flash ~~~   thats just dull... i think ill sue the american shopping malls for making the esculators move too fast!
[07:39] <avis> making fun of people with disabilities using flash ?  :/  i dont see the connection
[07:39] <caffiendo> Avis: you can set them to 90x90 there.  File size, when you save, adjust the quality from default 85% to something lower maybe 65%
[07:39] <snype> anyone have a good tutorial for tweaking (x)ubuntu on a laptop
[07:39] <cbx33> lumaQQ, it's a valid point though
[07:39] <avis> ok
[07:39] <psusi> try explaining to a blind person... or someone with a text only browser... or someone on an embeded device, or under linux why they can't use your web site because you built it all out of flash
[07:39] <cbx33> and inded has been won before

[07:40] <avis> lumaQQ, you must live in a 3rd world country and this is not the place for such discussions
[07:40] <psusi> there is a reason we have w3c standards... use them.
[07:40] <cbx33> *bah* gone now....what's the point
[07:40] <cbx33> there's another flash user and abuser ;)
[07:41] <psusi> same retards that abuse flash are the ones that force text color to black assuming that my default background color scheme is white... so it doesn't work too well when I use a white on black color scheme
[07:41] <avis> good point

[07:48] <truz_`24> so after reboot there is no way?
[07:48] <truz_`24> i wish there was a history showing :-)
[07:48] <truz_`24> a top log :-)
[07:48] <avis> top is not a service
[07:49] <Thialfihar> What-ho, chappies!
[07:49] <Nei1> (12:44:57 PM) arrenlex: nothlit: His name is Nei1, because he is l33t. Nei-one.
[07:49] <truz_`24> well, i could create a cron that executes ps aux
[07:49] <Nei1> if this was true i wouldnt be here.....lol
[07:49] <truz_`24> but that'd be hard to analyze
[07:49] <avis> it would be easy with command line though i'm not adept enough to do it myself
[07:50] <holotone> Could somebody tell me how to create a new user via CLI and give them permission to a folder inside another user's home directory?
[07:50] <Thialfihar> I just changed my xorg.conf to have two screens (both connected to the same graphic card) and that works now, got my usual Gnome/Beryl stuff here, but the second monitor is black. I can move the cursor in there to get the default little cross cursor, but no desktop stuff.
[07:50] <Thialfihar> How do I fix that?
[07:51] <buz> those edgy kernel updates of today, they wont boot
[07:51] <buz> thank good i still had dappers kernel around
[07:51] <nothlit> Neil, 'arrenlex, i get lazy with tab completion, i get the name wrong'
[07:51] <crashzor> how to install ubuntu inside Chroot from a othere distro ?
[07:51] <warlocky> where's the ifconfig file stored (the network configuration) ?
[07:52] <arrenlex> nothlit: I think he's saying something to the effect of "if I was l33t, I wouldn't be on this channel".
[07:52] <johns^> warlocky: /etc/network/interfaces
[07:53] <Shizofren> !ping me
[07:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ping me - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:53] <Nei1>  ***arrenlex is insulted. :(. dont be insulted
[07:53] <lumaQQ> I want to put some files into  /usr/share/icons  but it tells me i don have permission to do so....   how do i move things?
[07:53] <Shizofren> why don't work?
[07:53] <johns^> Thialfihar: nvidia card? I've got a working config here: http://docs.yavin4.nl/?content=dualhead
[07:53] <crashzor> lumaQQ, sudo ?
[07:53] <ianp> anyone use dual head on a thinkpad? :)
[07:54] <ianp> intel driver
[07:54] <lumaQQ> crashzoe  yeah  but i cant do that  when i logg in as sudo it says... sudo [-HPSb]  [-p prompt]  [-u username|#uid]

[07:54] <Thialfihar> Aye, johns^. I got TwinView working, but I don't fancy it. Now I set it up to really have two screens, but only the first gets a decent xsession.
[07:54] <avis> though you could not log top since its display is static
[07:54] <avis> full screen
[07:55] <M0E^lnx> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages is a dead link
[07:55] <linda777> I've installed Ubuntu, and only have one user account. However, when I go into the system-->manage users utility, it does not ask me for my password.
[07:55] <jokoon> Hello : is there a known fix to enable keyboard shortcuts in VLC ? Some set in the preferences doesn't work ...
[07:55] <johns^> Thialfihar:The second screen as an extention of the first?
[07:55] <johns^> not 2 times the same?
[07:55] <ubun> how come my sound is so low in ubuntu? i have the system sound max'd and amarok's sound max'd and my speakers volume control maxed, and it's at like 1/5th the volume it should be
[07:55] <crashzor> lumaQQ, try sudo gedit the file you need to edit
[07:55] <lumaQQ> ok
[07:55] <Thialfihar> No, that'd be like in TwinView, right?
[07:55] <pike_> ubun: open a terminal and type "alsamixer" adjust the volume there maybe
[07:55] <crashzor> lumaQQ, WARING you can fuck up you're system this way

[07:56] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.

[07:56] <ubun> pike that worked! :) thanks
[07:56] <crashzor> lumaQQ, sudo su ( and you're root )
[07:56] <Thialfihar> Ohh, I think I found it. Apparently I must startx with an extra parameter to tell it there are two screens.
[07:57] <crashzor> lumaQQ, you're admin right ? :P
[07:57] <lumaQQ> ok
[07:57] <lumaQQ> ight
[07:57] <johns^> Thialfihar: the config on that webpage is ok for a cloned screen, or as an extention of the first
[07:57] <johns^> depends on de xinerama option
[07:57] <craigbass1976> Can someone help me get dansguardian running in dapper?
[07:57] <Thialfihar> Uses TwinView, tho.
[07:57] <linda777> According to the tutorial I'm going through, I should not have access to the user management utility without putting in my password.
[07:58] <Thialfihar> Means it's only one screen, only one desktop, like.
[07:58] <blackgecko> craigbass197: whats worng with your dans
[07:58] <kane77> somebody tell me my system is not broken... (I uninstalled some things and installed them back again... I know its no reason to think my system is broken, but I can't help myself , I'm paranodi... :D))
[07:58] <pike_> linda777: well it shouldnt let you create a new user or anything
[07:58] <snype> !con kolivas
[07:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about con kolivas - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:58] <johns^> Thialfihar: yeah, I used it that way
[07:58] <snype> has anyone used con kolivas patches w/ ubuntu?
[07:58] <linda777> But I can. I can do anything root could do.
[07:58] <craigbass1976> I get something about clamav being outdated.  What in hell does dansguardian 9or any linux program for that matter) care whether or not antivirus is runnin?
[07:59] <Thialfihar> Yo, I got that working as well. But I decided it is not very useful for my setup here. :/
[07:59] <jokoon> Strange, I cycled my keyboard layout, and it reworked
[07:59] <linda777> So either I am misunderstanding about the ubuntu defaults, or I've set something up wrong.
[07:59] <jokoon> some little bug
[07:59] <snype> Thialfihar you talking to me?
[07:59] <Pie-rat1> mmm, its probably best if i install windows on my laptop, at least until linux support for it gets a little better. :( pity really, i love ubuntu, works great on all my desktop machines. ATI needs to die in a fire (but if they could make drivers for linux before they do, that'd be great)
[07:59] <blackgecko> craigbass197: well maybe you compilede with support for clamav
[07:59] <mseney> what is the difference between using linux-image-generic and linux-686?
[07:59] <Thialfihar> Coz one monitor is a pretty old one and the main one is very new... both together in TwinView look silly and also don't enhance working on them.
[08:00] <Thialfihar> Thanks for the url, tho.
[08:00] <johns^> it's all in dutch

[08:00] <craigbass1976> I didn't compile anything, jsut apt-get installed it.  Maybe I should have installed squid too.
[08:00] <kane77> if you run firefox from command line are you getting errors about libpangohack.so???
[08:00] <Thialfihar> Oh, TwinView was also insisting to use my old analog one as the main one for the Gnome panels and such.
[08:00] <Thialfihar> Very annoying.
[08:01] <Pie-rat1> linda777: if you have entered your password for administrative tasks in the last couple minutes, you won't be prompted again
[08:01] <linda777> I thought that might be it, but I completely rebooted, and it only asked me once, when I logged on to the machine.
[08:01] <johns^> Thialfihar: that depends on the conifg
[08:01] <blackgecko> anyone knows why when i try to compile zaptel it cannot find stdio.h ????
[08:01] <Pie-rat1> linda777: that's very strange
[08:02] <linda777> I think so, too. :)
[08:02] <pike_> linda777: been messing with the suoders file?
[08:02] <Thialfihar> Don't think it does. I worked through the entire NVidia reference for TwinView options.
[08:02] <nder> hi I've installed a script for speedtouch330 but when I reboot and put the command: sudo pppd...it says command not found
[08:02] <kane77> somebody please tell me my system is not broken..
[08:02] <linda777> Not intentionally, but I have been futzing around with permissions and groups.
[08:02] <Thialfihar> Also changed the order of monitors here and there. Always picked the CRT as main one.
[08:02] <linda777> So it's entirely possible I hosed something.
[08:03] <Thialfihar> But really moot point by now... I need two separate screens. TwinView won't do it for me.
[08:03] <Black_Heart> Ik heb mijn prive uit staan als je iets te melden hebt dan gewoon in de room
[08:03] <Black_Heart>  dus.. :/ \\ 32073 \\ Mood: =(

[08:03] <linda777> But here's what's odd -- in the CLI, when I try to do su type things, it does make me enter a pw.
[08:03] <nder> any help?
[08:03] <Black_Heart>  trow away you computer =) \\ 32075 \\ Mood: =(
[08:04] <Black_Heart>  problem solved \\ 32076 \\ Mood: =(
[08:04] <blackgecko> anyone knows why when i try to compile zaptel it cannot find stdio.h ????
[08:04] <avis> if during the same session you have entered a sudo password it will allow you to go back to root without one
[08:04] <Thialfihar> In which script is "startx" called?
[08:04] <Thialfihar> I can't find it.
[08:04] <avis> updatedb ; locate pppd
[08:05] <linda777> Hmm. Well, that would explain it, I guess, except for the reboot.
[08:05] <buzzy> !ntfsresize
[08:05] <ubox> i 'apt-get' ed perl-doc, i don't know whr is it?
[08:05] <linda777> I rebooted and went straight to the user management and it let me right through.
[08:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ntfsresize - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:05] <cardanto1> hmm . . . i want to set up a webcam on my linux pc so i can monitor a new baby (4 days old) any thoughts (i would rather not go outside my firewall -- want good resolution)

[08:07] <blackgecko> anyone knows why when i try to compile zaptel it cannot find stdio.h ????
[08:07] <pike_> cardanto1: if you have webcam working you could just use vlc to stream it right?
[08:07] <linda777> Where is the sudoers file?
[08:08] <LjL> linda777: use "visudo" to edit it. why do you need to, anyway?
[08:08] <ubox> i 'apt-get' ed perl-doc, i don't know whr is it?
[08:08] <linda777> I want to just look at it.
[08:08] <LjL> linda777: then visudo
[08:08] <LjL> linda777: or you could just cat /etc/sudoers
[08:09] <LjL> linda777: but anyway if you need to give users root access, don't edit sudoers - just add the user to the "admin" group
[08:09] <cardanto1> pike_ -- what is vlc?
[08:09] <rowdy_rac> hi all
[08:09] <linda777> Now, this is a really stupid question -- but should I even be showing root as a user in my user management utility?
[08:09] <Zaggynl> How is edgy vs dapper? is upgrading from dapper -> edgy a good idea?
[08:09] <m12> The CD I have is Dapper.  If I update, does that mean I now have Edgy?
[08:09] <rowdy_rac> how do i find my public ip from behind a router using shell script
[08:09] <pike_> cardanto1: video lan client it has its own codecs and works on xp and linux etc. gui app
[08:10] <rowdy_rac> or perl
[08:10] <cardanto1> and i have a video streamer driver on my windows box  -- don't konw if my webcam will work in ubuntu
[08:10] <linda777> It was my understanding that ubuntu doesn't have the root account enabled.
[08:10] <cardanto1> pike -- install options?
[08:10] <pike_> cardanto1: can play movies stream them or capture or stream captures.   you can apt-get it
[08:10] <Zaggynl> linda777, it's enabled, but you have to set the password
=== ganjaklaus is now known as bkaKarl
[08:10] <digilink> sudo passwd root will set it
=== bkaKarl is now known as btmgKarl
[08:11] <btmgKarl> Hi my friends. I have the following problem with my radeon 9600 pro vivo: Got it connected with cinch to my tv and I don't get the display cloned anymore to it. It once worked fine - Whilst starting X, having the VGA connected with the cinch I got the display from login on tv. I have no clue why it suddenly stopped. Tried with my other box and it works fine. So I guess it is something driver / xorg.conf specific but i can't figu
[08:11] <btmgKarl> re what it is. Any help is much appreciated
[08:11] <Zaggynl> yeah
[08:11] <linda777> If I set a blank password will it go back to the "out of the box" configuration?
[08:11] <linda777> Meaning, no one can log in as root, all root-level stuff done via sudo?
[08:11] <cardanto1> pike_: sudo apt-get vlc ?
[08:12] <pike_> cardanto1: yeah its in the universe repository as long as you have that enabled
[08:12] <cardanto1> got it
[08:13] <pike_> cardanto1: the video lan client website has alot of howtos. its all gui unless you want to use cli
[08:13] <cardanto1> what about drivers for my webcam (it's actually a dv cam -- with a web feature)
[08:13] <sedsmang> hey can anyone tell me why ubuntu 6.06 is not reading the actual freespace on my flash and sd card?
[08:13] <hume> anyone can recommend me a tool to create forms etc for interacting with a mysql database (preferably html-based)
[08:13] <cardanto1> cli?
[08:13] <cardanto1> command line interface . . .?

[08:15] <wewt> yeah
[08:15] <`4aFkA`> useradd: unable to lock password file  help!!!
[08:15] <rowdy_rac> but is there a way to do it thru a script
[08:15] <wewt> through cmd prompt?
[08:15] <rowdy_rac> yes
[08:16] <mats> `4aFkA`: you ain't sudo, just user
[08:16] <linda777> It let me set it, but only by hand, not by using "generate password."
[08:16] <wewt> netstat
[08:16] <wewt> netstat works lol
[08:16] <fbc> is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?

[08:18] <jokoon> fbc the files are in a NTFS partition
[08:18] <fbc> MikeMcA: if it existed which I think it does, it would be on wiki.ubuntu.com
[08:18] <MikeMcA> fbc: thx

[08:19] <buzzy> guys please help me: i open gparted but it shows me /dev/hda1 witha "!" ==> it says that gparted can't read filesystem (it is windows 2000 filessyetm) how can i resize that partition? please answer me whatever you know!! :D
[08:19] <cgrenier> Amaranth: do you know if anyone has the nvidia kernel modules for the latest kernel?
[08:19] <cyberjunkie> during the install it asked me whether i'd like to mount other hdd partitions onto linux. i thought it would use them to install stuff on them :P so i disabled those..
[08:19] <fbc> buzzy: does the installation not give you an option to resie durring instlalation?
[08:19] <cyberjunkie> any way to get them auto-mounted?
[08:19] <FlyingSquirrel32> How do I get my spell checker to check spanish in OO
[08:20] <pike_> buzzy: there is a gparted livecd you might try..
[08:20] <Roey> OMG what's with these ridiculous names
[08:20] <fbc> FlyingSquirrel32:  Just install the spanish dictionaries through synaptics..
[08:20] <Roey> I can see it now, Ubuntu X:  Crunchy Calamari
[08:20] <fbc> FlyingSquirrel32:  open synaptics, click search and type ES or spanish and click enter...

[08:21] <fbc> FlyingSquirrel32: np
[08:21] <fbc> is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?
[08:21] <buzzy> pike_, isn't it the same?
[08:22] <jokoon> erm
[08:22] <jokoon> removed one by one
[08:22] <inimesekene> now what's going on the ubuntu edgy cd doesn't send any picture to my monitor through DVI (using it right now on winXP)
[08:22] <inimesekene> ?
[08:22] <jokoon> wont do that again :/
[08:22] <navaburo> Whats the ubuntu equivalent of rc.d?
[08:22] <kane77> fbc, "ps -A" would write out processes... nice can lower the priority...
[08:23] <inimesekene> even the "safe graphics mode" has this
[08:23] <navaburo> for an install i am told to copy a file to /etc/rc.d/init.d/<program name>, what should i do instead?
[08:23] <mnoir> navaburo: /etc/init.d/ and the /etc/rcX.d directories
[08:23] <kane77> I have tons of errors when firefox starts (libpangohack.so)
[08:23] <mnoir> the files go in init.d
[08:23] <FlyingSquirrel32> fbc: MySpell is the key. Thanks.
[08:23] <mnoir> links in the others
[08:23] <kane77> I have tons of errors when firefox starts (libpangohack.so) is it seriou problem??
=== klos__ is now known as klos
=== klos is now known as klosi
[08:24] <navaburo> mnoir, so one that says to go into rc.d should go in rc1.d?
[08:24] <ndar> hi when I try to connect appears: timeout waiting for pado packets; unable to complete ppoe discovery
[08:24] <mnoir> no - the # in the name is the runlevel
=== klosi is now known as klosk
[08:24] <navaburo> but i need to put it somewhere right?
[08:25] <navaburo> or just straight into the /etc/init.d/ directory?
[08:25] <mnoir> it might help to know what you are installing and whether a package designed for bsd is going to fly right in linux
[08:27] <mnoir> the start/stop script should go in init.d
[08:27] <sonium> is there no oss kernel emulation in egdy?
[08:27] <ndar> hi when I try to connect appears: timeout waiting for pado packets; unable to complete ppoe discovery
[08:27] <mnoir> does it conform to standard start/stop/reload/etc logic?
[08:27] <sonium> I'm missing a /dev/snd/dsp

[08:31] <NapalmSMiles> !automatix
[08:32] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[08:32] <jokoon> I can't believe it. I have to reselect the wallpaper display style instead the thumbnail just won't show
[08:32] <jokoon> It really needs a fix
[08:32] <fbc> FlyingSquirrel32:  yup I got it too...
[08:32] <jokoon> Ah now it shows

[08:33] <FlyingSquirrel32> fbc: Thanks again
[08:33] <fbc> FlyingSquirrel32:  NP.
[08:33] <NapalmSMiles> automatix is awsome if itll work,it installs everything you need to play media and all kinds of cool toys
[08:33] <fbc> is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?
[08:33] <gnomefreak> buz: look in /boot/grub/menu.lst and paste the one line that has either hda, sda or UUID
[08:33] <gnomefreak> buz: it will be the one line of the new kernel
[08:33] <NapalmSMiles> i haveing  a problem with xgl,im trying to setup 3ddesktop can anyone help?
[08:34] <buz> mhh i'm confused
[08:34] <fbc> I've help four people but no one has bother to help answer my question.
[08:34] <fbc> is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?
[08:34] <NapalmSMiles> theres a prob with my graphics card,im pretty sure has aceleration
[08:34] <buz> all kernels have /dev/hda2 specified as root device which is correct
[08:34] <buz> the only kernel that still works is 2.6.15 left over from dapper upghrade
[08:34] <gnomefreak> buz: not always. change hda2 to sda2 save and try booting into the kernel
[08:35] <buz> even with an ata disk?
[08:35] <gnomefreak> buz: yes
[08:35] <buz> this should be documented i guess
[08:35] <buz> it will bite a LOT of people if the upgrade doesnt run smoothly for them either
[08:35] <fbc> gnomefreak: Is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?
[08:35] <buz> seems like a thoroughly vile thing to do for a security update
[08:36] <gnomefreak> fbc: not sure what ctrl+alt+escape does in windows
[08:36] <gnomefreak> buz: try it let me know if it works
[08:36] <JordiGH> Does Ubuntu have an official philosophical position on freedom? Or are they just "meh, we'll be free only as long as it's practical"?
[08:36] <buz> gnomefreak: lemme reboot
[08:36] <fbc> gnomefreak:  brings up the task manager where you can end tasks, and change priority on tasks..
[08:36] <buz> one way or another i'll come back ;)
[08:37] <navaburo> control shift escape brings up taskmon
[08:37] <NapalmSMiles> free and always will be i think
[08:37] <gnomefreak> fbc: system>prefferences>sessions
[08:37] <pike_> JordiGH: like debian but mellower :)
[08:37] <JordiGH> NapalmSMiles: It's not completely free. It includes binary blobs in its kernel.
[08:37] <ollekalle> question: how do I start my smbd every time my mashine boots?
[08:37] <JordiGH> pike_: Right, is there an official position statement somewhere on the blobs found in Ubuntu?
[08:37] <fbc> gnomefreak: kind like the SYSTEM MONITOR.
[08:37] <NapalmSMiles> so none can help me set up 3d rendering?
[08:37] <NapalmSMiles> noone*
[08:38] <navaburo> NapalmSMiles: what video card?
[08:38] <ianp> JordiGH: philosophies are for philosophers
[08:38] <fbc> Sometimes a run a graphic app that ties up my entire CPU, and I need to find a way to close it after it stops responding...

[08:38] <ianp> I just want my OS to work...
[08:38] <fbc> gnomefreak: Sometimes a run a graphic app that ties up my entire CPU, and I need to find a way to close it after it stops responding...
[08:38] <JordiGH> ianp: Is that a no, then? Ubuntu doesn't have a position statement? I can't find one.
[08:38] <gnomefreak> fbc: install htop or use ps auz or top in tereminel
[08:38] <pike_> JordiGH: not sure maybe we should kidnap mark and force him to write one..
[08:39] <fuoco> i would like to install a newer mesa version, i see debs available in feisty and/or debian - how can i manually backport them to my edgy system ?
[08:39] <gnomefreak> ps aux*
[08:39] <navaburo> NapalmSMiles: you shouln;t have all too much trouble with that card
[08:39] <navaburo> its not an ATI ;)
[08:39] <JordiGH> pike_: Thanks then.

[08:40] <weswh-> is it possible to set up an ssh server off of the livecd? given you have to install it after you install the system, i imagine not. trying to figure out a way to access the hd in the machine from my laptop, without having to install the system first.
[08:41] <navaburo> NapalmSMiles: i cant help you, i am clueless in that dept. Have you tried the manufacturer? sometimes they are helpful
[08:41] <ollekalle> cafeugo_: thanks!
[08:41] <NapalmSMiles> yes apt-get install ssh-server
[08:41] <michiel_> Hello everybody
[08:41] <kane77> how can I get my own pgp key?
[08:41] <NapalmSMiles> lol ill try
[08:41] <navaburo> hello michiel_
[08:41] <cafuego_> weswh-: Just install ssh after booting the livecd
[08:41] <weswh-> NapalmSMiles: when you do apt-get with the livecd, does it look for the install files off of cd? and install it to ram or something?
[08:41] <cafuego_> weswh-: you'll just need to do it each time you boot that cd
[08:41] <michiel_> I have a question which I hope you can answer. I just set up Ubuntu on an older computer and I'd like to primarily use text-mode programs.
[08:41] <michiel_> So is there some way I can make it not boot GDM?
[08:41] <robdeman> ok I have had this problem before... my post-commit under Linux does not do the svn update but when I run the ./post-commit by hand.. it works..
[08:42] <michiel_> So that I can just log in using text mode only.
[08:42] <NapalmSMiles> it also hits up the repos if you have an internet connection
[08:42] <pike_> michiel_: sudo update-rc.d -f scriptname remove
[08:42] <cafuego_> michiel_: 'sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove' will make gdm not start at bootup
[08:42] <navaburo> michiel_: which version of ubuntu
[08:42] <erUSUL> michiel_: install server version it just do that... (or install debian btw)
[08:42] <NapalmSMiles> which you should have if you plan on running ssh
[08:42] <navaburo> ok, that will work
[08:42] <michiel_> Thanks. It's the latest version, by the way.
[08:42] <weswh-> napalm - not really, local network
[08:43] <navaburo> michiel_: also, take a look at Xubuntu, it's light-weight and made for older PCs
[08:43] <navaburo> or the fluxbox window manager
[08:43] <michiel_> Seems that it removed GDM from all system startup links.
[08:43] <cafuego_> michiel_: yup
[08:44] <michiel_> navaburo: I'll check them out. GNOME does run reasonably smoothly on the machine, it's a 400 MHz laptop with 192 MB RAM, but I love the speed at which the text-only mode operates on it. I mostly need it for text-mode applications, anyway.
[08:44] <michiel_> Thanks for your help :)
[08:44] <ubun> how come when i try to launch a python script from a menu that i added with 'alacarte' it doesnt work? it tried making the script executable and i put a #!/usr/bin/env python line in it, and i even tried running it with 'python /foo/bar/bla.py' and nothing launches it
[08:44] <M0E^lnx> automatix doesn't work in edgy
[08:44] <michiel_> Do you also know how to restart the computer from the terminal?
[08:44] <navaburo> sudo halt
[08:44] <ubun> shutdown -r now
[08:44] <erUSUL> michiel_: shutdown
[08:44] <jrib> ubun: what does the script do?
[08:44] <navaburo> or sudo restart
[08:44] <cafuego_> michiel_: 'sudo reboot' (or 'sudo halt' to shut it down)
[08:44] <navaburo> or sudo poweroff
[08:44] <buz> editing grub doesnt help my kernel boot either, still begin waiting for roo then freezes
[08:45] <ubun> jrib it's a game writting in pygame. but it works fine when i run it manually from the shell
[08:45] <kasper1990> Hey guys
[08:45] <michiel_> Hmm, that's a lot of answers :P
[08:45] <mike1980> Hi guys is there a app so I can control ubuntu server remotely with a control panel. Something like a web based control panel like a tripod web host account?
[08:45] <navaburo> Which content managemtne system is most Ubuntu friendly? Joomla, Plone, Mombo, or some other?
[08:45] <jrib> ubun: can I download it and try myself?
[08:45] <cafuego_> michiel_: or control-alt-delete
[08:45] <ubun> jrib yeah one sec lemme get the link
[08:45] <weswh-> NapalmSMiles: it looks like the current versions just need apt-get install ssh, not ssh-server?
[08:45] <Imrahil> navaburo: plone
[08:45] <michiel_> Thanks for the help
[08:45] <mwe> Aren't you allowed to modify GPL software and use it like you want as long as the derived work is GPL as well?
[08:45] <navaburo> mike1980: you mean for a webserver>
[08:45] <cafuego_> navaburo: Try and pick one that is you-friendly instead :-)
[08:46] <mike1980> navaburo: yes
[08:46] <kasper1990> Hey does anyone here know how to print out files to a PDF file?
[08:46] <pike_> mike1980: you could xforward gnome-panel or something i guess
[08:46] <dfcarney> mwe: you can do whatever you like to it.  If you want to redistribute it, you have to license it under the GPL (and provide the original source code + modificaitons)
[08:46] <buz> gnomefreak: editing grub didnt help the least
[08:46] <michiel_> Oh, there's one last thing that I'd like to know... now that I've got a text-only machine, is there some way to get rid of the fancy new usplash?
[08:46] <navaburo> mike1980: thats what i am doing right now actualy... check out conetent management systems like joomla, or plone for the website

[08:47] <fbc> is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?
[08:47] <navaburo> mike1980: and try webadmin for administring the computer itself
[08:47] <mike1980> navaburo: ok cool thabnks
[08:47] <mike1980> navaburo: ok cool thanks
[08:47] <NapalmSMiles> weswh-: not sure,i just had a freind logging in the other day and we used ssh-server,but i was runnning a  5.10 live
[08:47] <navaburo> webadmin works REALY nice
[08:47] <ubun> jrib: http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pelzlpj/jools/
[08:47] <fbc> navaburo: is there any hotkey combination like CTRL-ALT-ESC in Windows, that would bring up a task manager in Ubuntu? To like lower priority on certain tasks?
[08:47] <dfcarney> mwe: in other words, there's nothing that says a company cannot use GPLed code as part of a proprietary, internal system.
[08:47] <navaburo> on debian at least... ubuntu shoudnt care
[08:47] <gnomefreak> buz: not sure than that was a big bug in edgy
[08:47] <kasper1990> Dont you think that the possibilty to print as pdf instead of paper should be available by default?
[08:48] <buz> gnomefreak: are you using that kernel?
[08:48] <sladen> michiel_: remove 'splash' from the kernel command line at boot
[08:48] <gnomefreak> buz: im not using edgy atm
[08:48] <michiel_> Aha, so I'll edit grub for that
[08:48] <mwe> dfcarney: but you need to distribute the full original source code along with the modified code?
[08:48] <michiel_> Thanks
[08:48] <buz> possibly we dont hear about it because people cant boot anymore ;)
[08:49] <gnomefreak> buz: i will work on it tomorrow see if i cant reproduce it here. good place to start is to file a bug on that kernel
[08:49] <buz> well if i could figure out how to file one on the package
[08:49] <buz> the bugs link isnt active
[08:49] <ollekalle> question: Is it possible to run mpg-movies using mplayer from console or do I need to run KDE or similar?

[08:49] <dfcarney> mwe: if someone asks for the source code, you have to provide it.  If it's a derivative work, then just your complete version is all that's required (AFAIK)
[08:50] <dfcarney> mwe: see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt
[08:50] <pike_> ollekalle: i use console mplayer for all my formats. both in linux and xp
[08:50] <drkm> when I have a move in a folder gnome does a type of screenshot as the icon.. when there is a lot of movies in a folder it doesn't do that.. is there anyway to enable it?
[08:50] <nathalia> alguem que tc?
[08:50] <jrib> pike_: I think he means without X, is that right ollekalle ?
[08:50] <navaburo> ollekalle: look up using mplayer or others in a framebuffer virtual terminal

[08:50] <ubotu> nathalia: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[08:51] <pike_> oh well yeah id be like mplayer -vo fbdev filename.mpg

[08:51] <pike_> ollekalle: mplayer -vo help for options

[08:51] <kendra> what is this
[08:51] <buz> gnomefreak: maybe its related to the broken update-initramfs at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/75649
[08:51] <dfcarney> mwe: note: you have to clearly indicate which files you changed, however...  So, often, it's easier to just distribute a patch.
[08:51] <sharperguy> can anyone with beryl and the snow pluging send me snowflake2.png?
[08:51] <Catshrimp> It's my understanding that placing an & after a command keeps the command running.  Yet, when I specify "fbsetbg -f ~/.wallpapers/gnu_forest.jpg &" in .xsession, the command is run, the wallpapers displays for a split second, and then it dissappears again.
[08:51] <mwe> dfcarney: yeah. the license text is heavy reading though. you probably need to talk to a lawyer if you have any doubts
[08:52] <buz> it does seem to generate initramfs files though
[08:52] <mwe> dfcarney: yeah
[08:52] <nothlit> to play mplayer in the framebuffer, you should pass a higher console framebuffer resolution/color
[08:52] <dfcarney> mwe: I find that the GPL is light reading, compared to some of the licenses that Microsoft thinks up.
[08:52] <Amaranth> sharperguy: the snowflake2.png file installed to ~/.beryl/plugins/

[08:52] <chable> anyone knows how to update firefox from 1.5 to 2.0
[08:53] <dfcarney> mwe: there's a FAQ on gnu.org that should answer all of your questions.
[08:53] <gnomefreak> buz: easiest way to find out is run update-initramfs -c -v -k `uname -r`
[08:53] <jrib> Catshrimp: something is probably changing your background afterwards.  You don't need to keep fbsetbg running afaik
[08:53] <Amaranth> !firefox
[08:53] <ubotu> firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[08:53] <mwe> dfcarney: right compared to that it is, but still the interpretation of it. I'll have a look at it
[08:53] <buz> i did a -u -k all
[08:53] <buz> that built something
[08:53] <chable> i have the 1.5
[08:53] <chable> but i want to update it to 2.0
[08:53] <jrib> chable: 2.0 is in edgy
[08:53] <crowley1027> i'm installing ubuntu 2.6?  and it freezes when i install but when i do a CD check it boots up ubuntu.  There's an icon "install" on the desktop and when i get to step 2 (timezone) it freezes.
[08:53] <crowley1027> i'm on it now.
[08:53] <gnomefreak> buz: not the same bug
[08:53] <Catshrimp> jrib: Hm, I'm not sure what would be changing the background back, but I'll check into it.  I'll be back in a few after I try a couple of things
[08:53] <chable> i dont use edgy
[08:54] <Amaranth> chable: ubotu just told you how
[08:54] <ubun> jrib: when i run the python script by putting it's path for the 'command' in alacart nothng happens at all, no warnings or anything pops up. yet if i run the command/path from the terminal it launches fine
[08:54] <buz> no it doesnt seem like it is
[08:54] <crowley1027> only that prograam freezes, but its not really freezed.  its strange
[08:54] <chable> i had some problems with it
[08:54] <dfcarney> mwe: here it is -- http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html   Also, if you're interested, GPLv3 is in the works.
[08:54] <chable> Amaranth thank you
[08:54] <buz> that peculiar one i encountered in other context
[08:54] <jrib> ubun: don't worry, I haven't forgotten :)
[08:54] <serishema> i'm having trouble setting up transperant proxying with squid
[08:54] <Amaranth> chable: want me to make him say it again?
[08:54] <gnomefreak> buz: just file one and i will look for dup when i have the bug report
[08:54] <mwe> dfcarney: yeah. thanks
[08:54] <buz> ok
[08:54] <chable> no i got it Amaranth
[08:54] <serishema> i get an error page saying that direct requests are denied
[08:54] <dfcarney> mwe: no problem
[08:54] <ollekalle> nothlit: "pass a higher cosole"?
[08:54] <lmosher> When I upgraded to edgy I lost (?) the wireless program that lets me specify which network I am on. I can specify my network manually, and still access my saved points... but there's no long a drop-down list of avaiable networks...
[08:55] <chable> anyone of u managed to install the latest nvidia drivers ?
[08:55] <serishema> but if i configure the proxy in the browser that works
[08:55] <gnomefreak> buz: just give me bug number after you file it will al info you can give
[08:55] <chable> from nvidia website
[08:55] <Amaranth> serishema: You should probably know transparent proxying breaks internet and web standards and some web sites will fail to work
[08:55] <Amaranth> chable: They won't help you on dapper
[08:55] <ubun> jrib i think it thinks i'm trying to run a 'directory'
[08:55] <chable> uhm
[08:55] <serishema> amaranth: this is an error page from squid itself
[08:55] <nothlit> ollekalle, yeah use a vga=xxx code in your grub configuration
[08:55] <serishema> amaranth: something to do with acls i think
[08:55] <chable> they destroyed my xserver on edgy
[08:55] <Amaranth> chable: If you're trying to use beryl/compiz with nvidia on dapper you should just upgrade to edgy
[08:56] <crowley1027> i'm installing ubuntu 2.6?  and it freezes when i install but when i do a CD check it boots up ubuntu.  There's an icon "install" on the desktop and when i get to step 2 (timezone) it freezes.  Its not frozen persay because i'm on ubuntu now and its fully functional except the window.  i click next and it just doesn't do anything.
[08:56] <chable> no , it dont want them
[08:56] <chable> but for a better resolution and so
[08:56] <ollekalle> nothlit: alright...
[08:56] <Amaranth> chable: If you don't want beryl or compiz you don't need the latest driver
[08:56] <chable> i wpuld like 75 hz on 1280
[08:56] <crowley1027> oh wait never mind...i didn't click next.
[08:56] <Angryelf> what packages do I need to install in order to create NTFS  file systems?
[08:56] <Amaranth> chable: Or does the one in dapper break X too?
[08:56] <pike_> ollekalle: for some reason i had to use the hex value like vga=0x317
[08:56] <chable> well
[08:56] <nothlit> !ntfs-3g | Angryelf
[08:56] <ubotu> Angryelf: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[08:56] <chable> i downloaded the latest nvidia drivers on dapper
[08:56] <chable> and i got the same errors like in edgy
[08:56] <nothlit> Angryelf, if you just wanted to create the filesystem, you can use gparted
[08:56] <gnomefreak> Angryelf: to create one just use gparted
[08:57] <serishema> !squid | serishema
[08:57] <Amaranth> serishema: I've never set squid up before, sorry. Just mentioning you probably don't want transparent proxying
[08:57] <ubotu> squid: Internet Object Cache (WWW proxy cache). In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.1-3ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 576 kB, installed size 1524 kB
[08:57] <chable> and i had some problems with java , also
[08:57] <Amaranth> chable: Don't Do That
[08:57] <ollekalle> nothlit/pike: ehh... looking for /etc/grub.conf :/ where do I change such settings?
[08:57] <lmosher> In Edgy how do I list the available wireless networks?
[08:57] <Amaranth> !info nvidia-glx dapper | chable
[08:57] <ubotu> nvidia-glx: NVIDIA binary XFree86 4.x/X.Org driver. In component restricted, is optional. Version 1.0.8776+2.6.15.12-1 (dapper), package size 3968 kB, installed size 12252 kB

[08:57] <serishema> amaranth: never had any problem with microsoft ISA server which was a transperant proxy
[08:57] <Turgon> Is it safe to run "sudo fsck" from a terminal window? There was an error (the word "fail" appeared in red) when I rebooted and an automatic check happened, but the system rebooted before I could read what was the failure about.
[08:57] <Catshrimp> jrib: actually, I think I might know what's going on, but don't know how I would correct it.  I have /usr/bin/fluxbox executing last to start the window manager (which would probably be resetting the background).
[08:57] <chable> well ?
[08:58] <Amaranth> serishema: You got lucky
[08:58] <pike_> ollekalle: /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:58] <fyrestrtr> Turgon: no use running fsck on a mounted file system, try man tune2fs
[08:58] <chable> u know if i need to use some other mirrors in source.list ?
[08:58] <buz> gnomefreak: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/75655
[08:58] <ollekalle> pike: thx
[08:58] <gnomefreak> ty buz
[08:58] <Turgon> oki, thx
[08:58] <jrib> Catshrimp: use   session.screen0.rootCommand:    fbsetbg -l   in your ~/.fluxbox/init
[08:58] <chable> those mirrors i use might be weak
[08:58] <Amaranth> serishema: It has nothing to do with microsoft getting something right or linux getting something wrong it has to do with what websites you go to
[08:58] <jrib> Catshrimp: -l just uses whatever was last
[08:58] <comster> I've got a standard Dapper install on vmware, but i no longer want it to start the X login menu, just go straight to console, how can I do this?
[08:58] <Catshrimp> jrib: ah, okay :)
[08:58] <higi_> hi
[08:58] <Amaranth> chable: it's in restricted which is enabled by default
[08:58] <Catshrimp> jrib: thanks dude
[08:59] <dxdemetriou> is there a problem on security repos on edgy? I have GPG error: http://security.ubuntu.com edgy-security Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG 40976EAF437D05B5
[08:59] <serishema> amaranth: in this instance i just don't know how to set up the software properly
[08:59] <buz> now pray i'm the only affected ;)
[08:59] <jrib> ubun: I was trying to avoid installing it, did you just install the deb?
[08:59] <fyrestrtr> comster: remove xdm from the startup scripts?
[08:59] <norberto> de
[08:59] <fyrestrtr> comster: check man update-rc.d
[08:59] <chable> yes but its enabled deppending of my location
[08:59] <cafuego_> comster:  'sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove' will make gdm not start at bootup
[08:59] <buz> dxdemetriou: more likely a bad transfer with your file
[08:59] <chable> so they put the ubuntu mirrors in my country
[08:59] <comster> thanx
[08:59] <ubun> jrib no just the source and i didnt run the setup.py just runnin the actual program script 'jools'
[08:59] <chable> which lacks some skillz i guess
[08:59] <ubun> which is an executable python script
[08:59] <jrib> ubun: heh easy enough, ok
[09:00] <Doow> Is there any way to make gnomes Clock to start the week on monday instead of sunday? I don't see it in the options.
[09:00] <ubun> it runs if i type ./jools from it's pwd, but it doesnt work if i type it's full path on the terminal like '/foo/bar/jools'
[09:00] <ubun> it says it's a directory :/
[09:00] <Cool123> whoa
[09:00] <Cool123> This is a huge #
[09:00] <jrib> ubun: right, I was going to suggest, doing a cd into that directory and then executing jools
[09:00] <fyrestrtr> ubun: you need to type sh /foo/bar/jools
[09:00] <jrib> ubun: (in your launcher)
[09:01] <ubun> fyrestrtr: still says it when i type sh first
[09:01] <ubun> oh frmo the laucher, lemme try
[09:01] <jrib> cd foobar; python jools   maybe
[09:02] <lmosher> In Edgy how do I find/list any available wireless networks?
[09:02] <ubun> yeah still doesnt work when i do 'sh' before the path. lemme try cd ;
[09:02] <pike_> lmosher: example:  iwlist ath0 scan
[09:03] <eMaX_> re
[09:03] <ubun> Details: Failed to execute child process "cd" (No such file or directory)
[09:03] <jrib> ubun: write a small shell script then
[09:03] <pike_> lmosher: you can do graphically but im not familiar with gnome tools
[09:03] <lmosher> pike_, Isn't there a GUI for that? I have all my locations saved from when I had Dapper, but in dapper I could pick the network from a list. Edgy I have to type the ESSID.
[09:03] <eMaX_> anyone here knows whether and how I can switch off temporarily the boot splash screen in ubuntu in order to see the boot messages? In SuSE it is something like just hitting Esc. Is there a way to do that in Ubuntu?
[09:03] <fyrestrtr> lmosher: just use NetworkManager :)
[09:04] <sladen> ubun: writing a '/bin/cd' is really quite hard.  I did once write one though... perhaps that's not what you intended
[09:04] <evolus> anyone knows hon can i install my wifi card belkin F5D7001 ?
[09:04] <pike_> lmosher: heard good things about wifi-radar if you want to install
[09:04] <fyrestrtr> eMaX_: edit the grub boot line and remove 'splash' and 'quiet' from it.
[09:04] <chable> i want to install some gdm theme
[09:04] <chable> but i get errors like invalid format
[09:04] <DarK_MaN> uname -a whei i cand renam this

[09:04] <gnomefreak> chable: is it a .tar?
[09:04] <Doow> eMaX_: I know there was an easy way in ubuntu 6.06 some F-button iirc, but seems they removed that in 6.10, or at least harder to access.
[09:04] <chable> tar.gz
[09:05] <chable> from gnome-look.org
[09:05] <gnomefreak> chable: untar it than install the theme
[09:05] <chable> didnt managed to install any
[09:05] <jrib> ubun: sh -c "cd /home/jasonr/temp/jools-0.20/jools; python jools"      modify that approriately as your command
[09:05] <lmosher> pike_, I'll check that out thanks!
[09:05] <Doow> eMaX_: nm, fyrestrtr knwe =)
[09:05] <chable> it must be .tar ?
[09:05] <The_Machine> is there an easy way to join a windows domain (2000) in ubuntu?
[09:05] <gnomefreak> chable: untar it

[09:07] <ubun> and then it complains that i dont have matchin quotes :/

[09:11] <gnu> I have, I was talking about drivers, etc
[09:11] <gnomefreak> buz: you need to install each icon seperate or use system>admin>login screen to use the gdm
[09:12] <ubun> gnu maybe your video card's stuff
[09:12] <gnu> geforce
[09:12] <jrib> ubun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36876/ is mine

[09:24] <jokoon> Kinda complicated, I'll try the beta available on the adobe site
[09:24] <MinceR> hi
[09:24] <jrib> TheVault: easy way, just type:  /join #ubuntu-classroom

[09:34] <jdong> mseney: no more generic
[09:34] <jdong> mseney: no more 686 I mean
[09:34] <jdong> mseney: generic replaces 686
[09:34] <mseney> im so confused on that
[09:34] <jamesbrose> whats the thing in vi to save but carry on working?
[09:35] <gnomefreak> jdong: i havent run into it yet but if i see one ill let you know. most likely l-r-m is gonna be the issue (unless ofcourse theres an easier answer without knowing the issue) ;)
[09:35] <mseney> like right now i have linux-headers-generic and linux-headers-686 installed
[09:35] <jdong> gnomefreak: found one person who can accurately reproduce it
[09:35] <jdong> gnomefreak: investigating it
[09:35] <gnomefreak> oh good
[09:35] <MinceR> jamesbrose: :w
[09:35] <veediot> jamesbrose: esc : w
[09:36] <mseney> jdong, why is there a linux-headers-686 ?
[09:36] <gnomefreak> jdong: let me know what you find. i have a pc ill be throwing edgy and nvidia on
[09:36] <jdong> mseney: it's an alias to generic
[09:36] <gnomefreak> mseney: you have that left over from an upgrade
[09:36] <jdong> mseney: all -686 in Edgy just points to generic
[09:36] <jdong> mseney: it's so that a smooth upgrade transition would result
[09:36] <MystaMax> Hello, how do i find out a users UID and GUID via the CLI???
[09:36] <unimatrix9> i have edgy and nvidia gforce
[09:36] <mseney> i never had anything 686 selected before so do i just remove them now?

[10:03] <Shiner421> no have not seen beryl
[10:04] <Shiner421> but I did try out mandriva linux before going to ubuntu
[10:04] <MystaMax> pike_, trappist, Zakir thanks for response. I'm not sure I know how to read this. it says webdevtest:x:1000:1000:webdevtest.
[10:04] <kitche> Zakir: 3d desktop is a piece of software
[10:04] <Shiner421> ok I got mplayer, now it wont let me install it
[10:04] <Zakir> kitch, thanks... I thought that he was looking for a more 3-d looking windows manager

[10:05] <MystaMax> ID <username> is alot easier
[10:05] <Shiner421> yea that link u gave me for mplayer worked, however, it requires me to compile it from source and that I cannot yet do
[10:05] <avis> God lord my child is calling another man dad.
[10:05] <nothlit> Shiner421, yes the 3ddesktop package is in ubuntu
[10:05] <Shiner421> cool how do I get to it?
[10:06] <narvik86> Shiner421: you can download codecs for mplayer's page, codecs are binary so you just have to copy them into right place, no need to compile anything
[10:06] <Shiner421> hmm ok im lost
[10:06] <Shiner421> oh wait
[10:07] <Shiner421> I think I got ya
[10:07] <Shiner421> now the problem is I have no idea where the right place is
[10:07] <narvik86>  The default directory is /usr/local/lib/codecs/
[10:09] <Shiner421> ok that directory does not exist on my system
[10:09] <see-g__> Shiner421: there's a README file in the codec package telling you where to put the codecs
[10:10] <narvik86> Shiner421: /usr/lib/codecs in ubuntu should work
[10:10] <see-g__> just do a mkdir /usr/lib/codec [am I right?] 
[10:10] <Shiner421> that directory also does not exist
[10:10] <narvik86>  /usr/lib/codecs <- exist on mine machine, so create it
[10:10] <see-g__> I'm not sure about the codec directory anyways so don't put them into /usr/lib/codec unless the README says so
[10:11] <Shiner421> ok this is not going well :(
[10:11] <Shiner421> no readme in the archive
[10:11] <kane77> how do I turn on the spell checking in open office??

[10:12] <see-g__> or use that one ;)
[10:12] <Shiner421> ok it worked this time, but how do I now move all those files over to the right directory, the file manager I am using (no idea which one) doesnt seem to have a copy option
[10:13] <ph8> anyone ever got a laptop's built in SD card reader working in ubuntu?
[10:13] <see-g__> it might be easier to open your shell, cd into the codec-directory and copy them over...

[10:16] <Shiner421> man that sucks, I spent 4 hours last night figuring out how to get my video drivers installed
[10:16] <see-g__> shiner: rebooting fixed that for me...
[10:16] <serishema> shiner421: this is caused by the time and date being incorrect when you first installed it, setting the wrong timezone can cause this problem too

[10:26] <Music_Shuffle> scorp123, sometimes, but only if I like...have it running, pull the keyboard out, and then try to plug it back in. And only with certain keyboards.
[10:26] <Red-Sox[away] > It works in Konq, but it's waaay behind

[10:26] <scorp123> @red sox: Nope, usually you should have sound in Flash ... maybe your mixer settings are wrong?
[10:26] <scorp123> @Zakir: Only happens with Ubuntu 6.10 ... No problems with other Linux distros or Windows ...

[10:34] <unimatrix9> how do i get fsck to run at next boot?
[10:34] <La_PaRCa> Hey guys. Can anyone tell me in which package I can find the Math/Random.pm perl module?
[10:35] <jrib> !fsck | unimatrix9
[10:35] <ubotu> unimatrix9: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[10:35] <crimsun_> !find Random.pm
[10:35] <pike_> njero: you can just gksudo gedit /etc/group
[10:35] <ubotu> File random.pm found in gnump3d
[10:35] <unimatrix9> thnx
[10:35] <scorp123> @unimatrix ... it should run automatically if something is wrong
[10:35] <LjL> La_PaRCa: just try a random package
[10:36] <unimatrix9> well got a freeze, so hard reset the pc
[10:36] <unimatrix9> but no fsck?
[10:36] <unimatrix9> on boot, so thats odd  right?
[10:36] <La_PaRCa> LjL, meaning?
[10:36] <LjL> La_PaRCa: sorry, a bad joke =) but look at the bot, it's got an answer

[10:37] <jrib> ba5e: aptitude
[10:37] <mc44> La_PaRCa: <ubotu> File random.pm found in gnump3d
[10:37] <ba5e> cheers jrib
[10:37] <scorp123> @Unimatrix: It depends what filesystem you are using ...
[10:37] <nolimitsoya> unimatrix9, not if the filesystem is journaled
[10:37] <unimatrix9> ext 3 , wich is default ?
[10:37] <psusi> I don't know about ext3 but reiserfs doesn't need fsck'ed at boot ( dirty shutdown or no ) because of the journal... unlike ext2
[10:37] <nolimitsoya> thats journaled alright
[10:38] <kane77> how do I view processes running (with their load)?? (in console)

[10:38] <Megaqwerty> How do I access a network printer that isn't connected to a computer?
[10:38] <La_PaRCa> LjL, nope, wrong one
[10:38] <unimatrix9> ah
[10:38] <unimatrix9> ok cool
[10:38] <Megaqwerty> (It has a Direct Ethernet connection to the network)
[10:38] <Music_Shuffle> amrnet, if you have a great set of plugins, not really.  Otherwise though, you might benefit from stuff like session restore, etc.
[10:38] <scorp123> @unimatrix: ext3 is pretty rock solid ... if the system claims everything is OK, you probably don't need fsck
[10:39] <Megaqwerty> !defrag
[10:39] <ubotu> defragmentation is not needed for Ext3 and ReiserFS filesystems. They are much more efficient in their allocation of storage units.
[10:39] <unimatrix9> ok, fine, its not the defragmentation i was worried about
[10:39] <aeromix> how can I get to know which process use /var/lip/dpkg ?
[10:39] <amrnet> Music_Shuffle: but session restore is already in the old firefox.. mm perhaps i put it as a plugin
[10:39] <psusi> that isn't exactly true.... or at best is a matter of opinion
[10:39] <scorp123> lsof
[10:39] <unimatrix9> its the hardfreeze and reset of pc ...
[10:39] <scorp123> @aeromix:  use "lsof"
[10:39] <Megaqwerty> can anyone help me? ^^^^^^^
[10:40] <nolimitsoya> Megaqwerty, no ;)
[10:40] <Music_Shuffle> amrnet, yeah, its a plugin in the old. Hence why I said that if you have a really nice plugin setup like I used to...the difference is minimal really. =/
[10:40] <unimatrix9> that might have upset filessytem,.
[10:40] <ba5e> even after defragging a linux fs it makes almost no difference! :)
[10:40] <scorp123> @MEGA:  If the printer connects directly to your LAN, it has some Printer Service running, no?
[10:40] <amrnet> Music_Shuffle: thanx a lot friend ok will skip it then :)
[10:40] <ba5e> even with HEAVY fragmentation
[10:40] <nolimitsoya> unimatrix9, your filesystem is journaled. it cant be brought out of balance by hard resets
[10:40] <nolimitsoya> unimatrix9, your data can though...
[10:40] <psusi> if you want you can install the defrag package to defragment ext2/3 ( updated to support ext3 in feisty )... of course, you probably don't need to, and it may eat your data so have backups.
[10:40] <drkm> is there any sort of key combination I can press to switch between desktops in gnome?
[10:40] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: probably. I don't know, it belongs to the school
[10:40] <ailean> drkm, Ctrl+Alt+left or right
[10:41] <unimatrix9> ah
[10:41] <Music_Shuffle> =] 
[10:41] <unimatrix9> well i turn in then
[10:41] <unimatrix9> no worries
[10:41] <unimatrix9> :)
[10:41] <unimatrix9> bye night all
[10:41] <psusi> ba5e: if it is heavily fragmented of course it makes a difference.... but it tends not to get very fragmented unless it is nearly full

[10:41] <njero> pike_, jrib: worked, thanks
[10:41] <Megaqwerty> nope
[10:41] <njero> I think I need to grant some rights to the others now.. but it did what I wanted!
[10:41] <drkm> ailean: thanks
[10:41] <ba5e> psusi: not really...have you seen the tests done? there is a thread in the forums
[10:41] <ailean> drkm, np
[10:42] <ba5e> read-ahead in linux kernel is excellent
[10:42] <scorp123> @MEGA: are you now in that LAN, e.g. the printer is running?
[10:42] <psusi> ba5e: yes... I have done them myself... and I recently updated the defrag package to support ext3
[10:42] <ba5e> psusi: which defrag? in windoze?
[10:42] <psusi> ba5e: read-ahead has nothing to do with wasting seek time due to fragmentation
[10:42] <psusi> ba5e: no, the one in linux of course.
[10:42] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: yes, both
[10:43] <nolimitsoya> psusi, might you know of a good way to defragment jfs2 filesystems?
[10:43] <psusi> nolimitsoya: I don't know much about jfs, sorry...
[10:43] <ba5e> psusi: but if the seek time is transparent...it does not matter!
[10:43] <nolimitsoya> psusi, ok, thank you anyways :)
[10:44] <scorp123> @MEGA: what I would do is to run "nmap" and do a port scan of your LAN. Read the manual page!!! You can limit the portscan to certain ports. I would suggest to limit it to these ports: 136, 138, 139, 631, 9100
[10:44] <psusi> ba5e: when you are doing sequential bulk data reads, seek time is VERRY apparent
[10:44] <scorp123> @MEGA: this scans for Windows shares (printers too can be shared that way), it scans for CUPS printer shares, and it scans for UNIX-style lpd printer shares running on port 9100
[10:44] <njero> does anyone have more info on etc/group and what all of the various labels mean and are safe to change?
[10:44] <Dybber> does anyone know how i can get totem, rhythmbox or another player to play monkey audio files (.ape)
[10:44] <ba5e> psusi: yes that is true.. like with DV editing/authoring
[10:44] <scorp123> @MEGA: nmap would thus spit out probable candidate IP addresses for that printer ...
[10:46] <psusi> ba5e: exactly.... or big tar files, deep md5sum checking, or compiling
[10:46] <scorp123> @MEGA: there is a user-friendly GUI frontend for "nmap":  "nmapfe". Install that one too ...
[10:46] <Megaqwerty> that's alright...I'll keep looking
[10:46] <pike_> nmapfe
[10:46] <scorp123> @MEGA: or "knmap" .... thats a front-end too for KDE
[10:46] <Megaqwerty> are you sure there isn't an easier way to find it?
[10:46] <psusi> ba5e: the other thing you can do is locate frequently accessed files at the start of the disk, which is usually faster than the end
[10:46] <scorp123> @MEGA: not without knowing its IP address ...
[10:46] <nolimitsoya> how (terrible) is performance with zfs through fuse?
=== [a] freebsd_fan is now known as freebsd_fan
[10:47] <scorp123> @MEGA: Most IT admins usually attach a sticker or a label to network printers ... are you sure your IT admin didn't leave one too?
[10:47] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: dang, that's nowhere as easy as windows...curses
[10:47] <Megaqwerty> oh...good idea
[10:47] <Megaqwerty> brb
[10:47] <scorp123> @MEGA: Actually it's very easy once you know the printer's IP address ...
[10:48] <_SKiTZO> while trying to make ndiswrapper work with a broadcom bcm4310 wifi card using the recommended driver, everything works great until i actually do the modprobe ndiswrapper.
[10:48] <_SKiTZO> it then complains that my kernel is 32bit while the driver is 64bit. how can i make ndiswrapper choose the 32bit version
[10:48] <_SKiTZO> ?
[10:48] <ba5e> psusi: thats true, its good practive to have ur system partition right at the front
[10:48] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: nope didn't stick it on there :(
[10:48] <emilia> does anyone know if theres anything i can use to see my ubuntu partition from winxp?
[10:48] <mike1980> Can anyone please give me a mirror to download the "ubuntu server" ?
[10:48] <scorp123> @MEGA: your IT admin sucks :D
[10:48] <gyaresu> !nvidia > gyaresu
[10:49] <ba5e> emila: yes try ntfs-3g if you need write access
[10:49] <emilia> ba5e, no the other way around
[10:49] <kitche> emilia: fs-driver.org to get the ext3 driver
[10:49] <emilia> see ubuntu from xp
[10:49] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: I know. They are actually extremely incompetent
[10:50] <ba5e> emilia: you can use IFSDriver to view etx2/3
[10:50] <psusi> Megaqwerty: printers -> add -> windows printer -> browse for printer on network ; works for me
[10:50] <ba5e> sorry ext2 or 3
[10:50] <emilia> kitche, hrmm i tried that one, it shows up as drive F:, but when i try to open it,  it says i have to format it
[10:50] <Phuzion> Anyone here have any good recommendations for a usenet binary downloader?
[10:50] <ba5e> that mounts them too :)
[10:50] <scorp123> @MEGA: Yeah, try that too ... it might work if it's a windows shared printer
[10:50] <Megaqwerty> psusi: "Yes, I try that, however it doesn't show up there...I don't think:
[10:50] <Megaqwerty> *tried
[10:50] <psusi> ba5e: you can use the defrag package to move frequently accessed files to the front of the partition
[10:50] <scorp123> @MEGA: OK, might be a UNIX printer then ... What brand is it btw ... HP?
[10:51] <mike1980> Can anyone please give me a mirror to download the "ubuntu server" ?

[10:55] <rance> can someone remind me of the program that you use when compiling from source that "automagically" creates a package for unsinstall purposes
[10:56] <kitche> rance: check install
[10:57] <sysrage> is there an apt-something that i can do to show what i have installed so i can search just what i have installed?
[10:57] <sysrage> like i wanna know which flash plugin i have installed
[10:58] <drkm> I just unmounted a partition to make a change to it.. is there anyway I can reload my fstab again so it remounts rather than having to restart?
[10:58] <burner> sysrage, dpkg -L |grep flash
[10:58] <bimberi> sysrage: dpkg -l | grep flash
[10:58] <njero> would you add normal users to plugdev group or is that a horrible security violation?
[10:58] <sysrage> thanks
[10:58] <sysrage> upper or lowercase? :)
[10:58] <rance> drkm: why dont you just remount the drive manually
[10:58] <Phuzion> Anyone here have any good recommendations for a usenet binary downloader for Linux?

[11:00] <njero> anyone have a link on safe security practices? users and groups?
[11:00] <scorp123> @rance: I use "checkinstall" myself .... highly useful little tool, that.
[11:01] <drkm> bimbi: thanks
[11:01] <njero> Google has a lot of useless info about it (at least in all of the first page links)... I am looking for a wiki or something
[11:01] <bimberi> drkm: np :)
[11:01] <drkm> bimbi: do you know if ubuntu has a feature like when you install it.. where it finds your partitions and redoes the fstab?
[11:02] <rance> scorp: thanks, I have some software that only comes from source due to license, and I like to be able to uninstall it if needed
[11:02] <kitche> njero: well there is many books that are good but the internet isn't that great of a place to look from what I know
[11:02] <rance> or package it and distribute it to clients
[11:02] <bimberi> drkm: yes the installer (usually) does a good job of that
=== flaco is now known as latuss
=== latuss is now known as latusss
[11:02] <drkm> bimbi: is there a way I can have it do that again without having to reinstall?
[11:02] <njero> kitche: bummer... I was just trying to find something that would make sure I wouldn't give up root :)
[11:02] <scorp123> @rance: dito. Same here!
[11:02] <MystaMax> psusi, How do I change the password of the user that is currently logged in via CLI???
[11:02] <scorp123> passwd
[11:03] <kitche> njero: well here is a good practice don't run daemons on your desktop :) like openssh and such

[11:04] <sysrage> so i take it the latest flash9 isn't on the ubuntu repositories yet?

[11:06] <rizhun> hi, i'm trying to set up my wireless card.  I've had a look at the documentation, and it mentioned a driver i needed.  i've grabbed the driver with synaptic and restarted networking but no luck.
[11:06] <scorp123> @KITCHE: Why wouldn't that be "good practice"??? I too am running OpenSSH everywhere. I simply need it.
[11:06] <rizhun> do i need to manually add it into /etc/networking/interfaces ?
[11:07] <bimberi> rizhun: try configuring it via System -> Administration -> Networking (which sets up that file)

[11:07] <ubotu> rizhun: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

[11:07] <rizhun> bimberi, it doesnt appear in there and i cant see an 'add'

[11:07] <Frederick> folks wich is the keystroke to  on an american kb?
[11:08] <scorp123> @KITCHE:  That's only true if you leave your firewall open and allow SSH from everywhere ... Which is not true in my case.

[11:19] <Belter_> I have just install KDE core, all went fine, now how do I install yast as I cannot alter the creen resolution?
[11:19] <gigikent> yes
[11:19] <HymnToLife> yast ?
[11:20] <rance> yast?
[11:20] <scorp123> yast iis from SUSE
[11:20] <scorp123> This is UBUNTU
[11:20] <HymnToLife>  isn't that the SuSE package manager ?
[11:20] <gigikent> well i gues i will put on my network server...restart...go in windows... and install after that.
[11:20] <psusi> vlt: can you just say screw it and reboot? ;)
[11:20] <gigikent> i wish you a nice night or day or morning
[11:20] <user-land> Do you know what the Kernel upgrade contains ?
[11:20] <gigikent> and see you tommorow
[11:20] <vlt> psusi: Not now.
[11:20] <Belter_> sorry how do I change the screen resolution then, just came over from Suse recently, sorry.
[11:20] <gigikent> when i hope i will be ubutunu
[11:20] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: you here?
[11:20] <scorp123> yes
[11:20] <scorp123> Couldn't reply to you
[11:20] <gigikent> i'll be here tommorow
[11:21] <Megaqwerty> oh
[11:21] <Megaqwerty> scorp123:well, do you have the solution?
[11:21] <quijote> \molinux
[11:21] <scorp123> @MEGA: yes
[11:21] <Megaqwerty> cool
[11:21] <leviathan> hi!!
[11:21] <gigikent> bye bye everyone
[11:21] <scorp123> @MEGA:  become root ... e.g. sudo su -
[11:21] <user-land> bye
[11:21] <rance> Belter_:  The default k/ubuntu install detects the MAX resolution of your montior, MOST Of the time, thats too hard to see and I have to back it down somewhat
[11:21] <ubox> !bye
[11:21] <Megaqwerty> k
[11:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bye - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:21] <Megaqwerty> then what?
[11:21] <ubox> :)
[11:22] <scorp123> Give me the output of this:  ifconfig -a
[11:22] <user-land> Did any of you install the new Linux headers ?
[11:22] <rance> Belter_: from kdes run command prompt enter "kdesu kate" and open the "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" file
[11:22] <Belter_> That is what it has done and I want to set it to 1024x768
[11:22] <Megaqwerty> !paste
[11:22] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:23] <wyld> when I try to install java runtime, I'm told to download a file, give it to root, and then copy it to /tmp. why?
[11:23] <scorp123> just give me the line saying:  "eth0 .... something"
[11:23] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36897/
[11:23] <rance> Belter_: in the screen section you should see a list of color depths and screen resolutions
[11:23] <rance> Thats what you need to change to get your resolution what you want it to be, remember to make a backup of your xorg.conf file first
[11:24] <scorp123> inet addr:10.6.2.101  Bcast:10.6.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0 ..... F****** !!!!
[11:24] <scorp123> @MEGA:  F**** dude, you're on a 10.x.x.x class A network .... that means 16777216 hosts!
[11:24] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: i see some kind of a problem here...lay it on me
[11:24] <leviathan> somebody can say to me that it means this? checking dynamic linker characteristics... cat: /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf: No such file or directory
[11:24] <leviathan> GNU/Linux ld.so
[11:24] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: I told you I had a big network! :-D
[11:25] <scorp123> We do a portscan in there might get you really into some trouble
[11:25] <leviathan> and how I fix that...
[11:25] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: yeah, not to mention the time it would take ;)
[11:25] <scorp123> @MEGA: do you have a windows box somewhere or access to one?
[11:25] <Megaqwerty> yeah...but they are like 1/2 ghz
[11:26] <scorp123> @MEGA: maybe you can write down the settings Windows has about that printer?? OR ask an admin ??
[11:26] <Megaqwerty> would take forever to boot one
[11:26] <Wakesater> can someone tell me why my fonts are too big
[11:26] <Wakesater> i just did a clean install
[11:26] <Megaqwerty> hmmm....h/o
[11:26] <Wakesater> resolution is good, but my fonts are unreadable

[11:26] <wyld> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36898/ I need help with this installation, what file do i need to download and where do i get it, because i've looked for it on the site that is specified, and i can't find it there
[11:26] <scorp123> @MEGA .... OK, maybe we can limit the scans
[11:27] <scorp123> as "root" ....  apt-get install nmap
[11:27] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: I'm using that comp's ethernet cable have to disconnect...h/o
[11:27] <Megaqwerty> ubuntu comes with nmap btw
[11:27] <scorp123> ah OK ... just to be sure
[11:28] <Belter_> Hi Rance I opened the file, what do I edit
[11:28] <scorp123> @MEGA:  ok .... let's scan
[11:28] <scorp123> @MEGA:  nmap -p 9100 -O 10.6.2.1-255
[11:29] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: back
[11:29] <compilerwriter> Can anyone here help me get my evolution data backed up?
[11:29] <arias> Hi, im new here. anyone who know how to do, if you want to look at another computerscreen ?!
[11:29] <scorp123> @MEGA:  this will scan hosts 10.6.2.1 up to 10.6.2.255 ... hopefully that printer has an IP address similar to yours, so we don't need to scan millions of hosts ...
[11:29] <Megaqwerty> scorp: did you need that windows computer's specs?
[11:29] <Megaqwerty> I have the window open
[11:29] <scorp123> Does it have that printer configured?
[11:30] <Megaqwerty> yeah
[11:30] <Mastastealth> arias: you mean with VNC?
[11:30] <Megaqwerty> at least one of them
[11:30] <Megaqwerty> a laserjet 1320 pcl 5e
[11:30] <scorp123> OK; take a piece of paper and write down their settings .... e.g. click onto "Properties", and check if you see queue names, IP addresses, Service ports, and stuff like that. Click around, write down as much as you can.
[11:31] <Megaqwerty> I have the computer right next to me
[11:31] <Megaqwerty> I can just give you whatever u need
[11:32] <scorp123> @MEGA: what does it say in "properties" ??
[11:32] <arias> no i meant sow i can see the same thing on the other screen

[11:33] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: looking...
[11:33] <arias> YES !
[11:33] <arias> exactly
[11:33] <Mastastealth> arias: ok, do you know what graphics card you have?

[11:34] <arias> hmm. I got no idee.. :/
[11:34] <buzzy> !grub
[11:34] <arias> who to look it up ?
[11:34] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: there is one checked..."IP_10.6.204.51 Standard TCP/IP Port <Printername>
[11:34] <scorp123> yeap, that's it !!

[11:34] <scorp123> write down that IP
[11:34] <scorp123> 10.6.204.51
[11:34] <Megaqwerty> k
[11:34] <Megaqwerty> it has been logged
[11:35] <Mastastealth> arias: hmmm...I'm not really sure! I'm looking it up, but do Intel, ATI, or NVIDIA sound similar?
[11:35] <scorp123> So in CUPS you should be able to add this IP "10.6.204.51" as a standard UNIX printer which should be listening on port 9100
[11:35] <jhaquo> hi. i installed apache, and would like to use some JSP files, is there a module for that?
[11:35] <Megaqwerty> k
[11:35] <Belter__> how do I uninstall KDE Core in terminal
[11:35] <Megaqwerty> cool
[11:35] <Megaqwerty> THANKS!
[11:35] <scorp123> This thing being a laserprinter it probably speaks PostScript, so Linux should support it out of the box
[11:35] <arias> yes
[11:35] <neosa-chris> belter sudo apt-get remove kde
[11:35] <kitche> jhaquo: you need tomcat for JSP pages
[11:36] <arias> i have an IBM LapTop
[11:36] <littlesniper> hello
[11:36] <Belter__> cheers m8
[11:36] <neosa-chris> your welcome
[11:36] <akio> where is the wireless support for the ubuntu channels?
[11:36] <arias> with intel Centrino
[11:36] <jhaquo> kitche is that an apache extension? or antother server?
[11:36] <neosa-chris> Anyone need any help?
[11:36] <akio> neosa
[11:36] <Mastastealth> arias: I see 2 commands that could help, "glxinfo" or "lspci". Type either into your terminal, and see if you see Intel, ATI, or NVIDIA...
[11:36] <neosa-chris> mmhmm akio
[11:36] <littlesniper> I would like to know if my installation of ubunto can be a desktop system as well as a server system (mainly ssh and portforwarding)
[11:36] <neosa-chris> Give me questions
[11:37] <Mastastealth> arias: My guess will be its an intel chip, but just make sure
[11:37] <akio> im looking to support my broadcom chipset
[11:37] <kitche> jhaquo: another server or if you want to call it a servlet container
[11:37] <akio> its a 4311
[11:37] <akio> familiar?
[11:37] <arias> where to find terminal ? haha its my first time using ubuntu
[11:37] <scorp123> @jhaquo :  Nope, TOMCAT is an application server which is used to serve JSP pages and Java stuff ...
[11:37] <neosa-chris> No i'm not... sorry... Do a google search for it.. i'm possitive you'll find wikis and forums
[11:37] <neosa-chris> :-)
[11:37] <Mastastealth> arias: lol, its ok. It's in Applications -> Accessories
[11:37] <akio> i have
[11:37] <neosa-chris> I've had to do hte same thing and it does... work..
[11:37] <neosa-chris> wow....
[11:37] <arias> yeah i saw it now ^
[11:38] <neosa-chris> hmm
[11:38] <neosa-chris> Does it give you an error... or just not detect it... or what?
[11:38] <neosa-chris> open up a terminal and type lspci
[11:39] <arias> i got like 100000 words
[11:39] <Belter_> sorry could you tell me how to unistall KDE core entireley again in terminal, had a power cut this end
[11:39] <akio> 02:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-PCI Card (rev 01)
[11:39] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: it was asking for an http:// address...should I put in http://10.6.204.51 ?
[11:39] <Mastastealth> arias: ok...look for something specific to "graphics"
[11:39] <neosa-chris> haha blter_
[11:39] <arias> intel corporation
[11:39] <neosa-chris> Hmm... I don't think i remember how to get rid of everything...
[11:39] <Belter_> not funny buddy
[11:40] <neosa-chris> experiment with the sudo apt-get remove tool
[11:40] <Belter_> what did you give me before Chris
[11:40] <neosa-chris> instead of KDE include kde-core kdecore
[11:40] <scorp123> @MEGA: ... ahem, no .... You should be able to add this IP as a network printer in your printer setup.
[11:40] <neosa-chris> i told you last time sudo apt-get remove kde
[11:40] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: for a cups printer right?
[11:40] <Mastastealth> arias: An Intel Graphics chip? 865, or 915 number somewhere?
[11:40] <vlt> There is no file system mounted and no swap partition used on /dev/hdc. WTF could be a reason for "BLKRRPART: Device or resource busy"?
[11:40] <scorp123> @MEGA: no ... UNIX printer ... aka "lpd" printer.
[11:40] <XiXaQ> how do I exit from X?
[11:40] <Belter_> thanks Chris
[11:40] <Megaqwerty> oh ok
[11:40] <neosa-chris> kk
[11:41] <akio> ctrl alt backspace
[11:41] <littlesniper> hello, I would like to know if my installation of ubuntu can be a desktop system as well as a server system (mainly ssh and portforwarding)
[11:41] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: what do I put in "Queue"?
[11:41] <kitche> littlesniper: yes
[11:41] <neosa-chris> Yes littlesniper
[11:41] <neosa-chris> Of course
[11:41] <XiXaQ> akio, no, that restarts X. I want to exit.
[11:41] <neosa-chris> Linux was made to do that. We just made linux excellent in another field too :-)
[11:41] <neosa-chris> (desktop environments)
[11:41] <akio> log out
[11:41] <kitche> XiXaQ: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[11:41] <XiXaQ> littlesniper, indeed it can. And probably should be.
[11:41] <littlesniper> well in the documentation of the installation it says to choose if i want a desktop installation or a server one
[11:41] <arias> 945GM/GMS/940GML
[11:41] <XiXaQ> kitche, thanks.
[11:42] <littlesniper> how should i do to get both then ?
[11:42] <arias> is the only i can find i think :/
[11:42] <scorp123> @MEGA: play with the settings ... ideally you should just need to add the IP address and the port (9100), that's it. Or go to that Windows machine again and check if there is any setting we might have missed yet ...
[11:42] <neosa-chris> You already have SSH capabilities
[11:42] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: where do I put the port?
[11:42] <Megaqwerty> 10.6.204.51:9100?
[11:42] <neosa-chris> if you type in a terminal ssh 192.168.2.4 (example)
[11:42] <Mastastealth> arias: ok good. So we know you have an instell chip. So, you have both moinitors plugged in currently?
[11:42] <neosa-chris> it should be fine... SSHing a box...
[11:42] <XiXaQ> kitche, then startx afterward?
[11:42] <scorp123> let me check ...
[11:42] <arias> yes
[11:42] <scorp123> Are you using GNOME or KDE??
[11:42] <arias> and the computer is restarted too
[11:42] <littlesniper> yes but i want it to have sshd
[11:42] <kitche> XiXaQ: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start but startx works also
[11:42] <neosa-chris> hmm... sudo apt-get install ssh-server
[11:43] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: GNOME
[11:43] <TheGateKeeper> what's the ls option to list file permissions?
[11:43] <kitche> TheGateKeeper: ls -l
[11:43] <littlesniper> and to be able to act as an internet gateway
[11:43] <neosa-chris> o helllzzzz idk how to do that
[11:43] <neosa-chris> haha
[11:43] <neosa-chris> the gateway thing... no idea
[11:43] <littlesniper> so i need the ipforwarding stuffs and such
[11:43] <jhaquo> any good tutos on how to install and setup tomcat plz?
[11:43] <TheGateKeeper> thanx kitche
[11:43] <Megaqwerty> scorp123: I don't need the port
[11:44] <drkm> I've just mounted a new partition I've created and it has a lost+found folder on it... do I need to keep this or can I remove it?
[11:44] <Mastastealth> !dualmonitor
[11:44] <scorp123> ah, OK
[11:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dualmonitor - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:44] <neosa-chris> jhaquo google is your friend... so are the ubuntu forums www.ubuntuforums.org
[11:44] <Megaqwerty> I just printed a test page...and as the guy looking over my shoulder just said...IT LIVES!!!!!
[11:44] <serishema> drkm: you shouldn't delete the lost+found directory, it's used by the disk checker
[11:44] <scorp123> @MEGA: ha, cool :D
[11:44] <littlesniper> should I download the cd for the desktop or for the server then ?
[11:44] <scorp123> @MEGA: so you can print now :)
[11:44] <littlesniper> (blush)
[11:44] <drkm> serishema: even if its just a partition to store non-system files on?
[11:44] <Megaqwerty> yup
[11:45] <neosa-chris> desktop if you want to use it as a computer too...
[11:45] <Mastastealth> arias: ok, I'm reading a wiki ok this, you know how to install programs? Open System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
[11:45] <neosa-chris> but if its going to only be used for a server... then just dload the server edition.. it works fine
[11:45] <neosa-chris> and be sure to install LAMP when you install the server
[11:45] <serishema> drkm: not sure, i'd leave it be though
[11:45] <crowley1027> http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/rtorrent
[11:45] <drkm> serishema: oki dokie
[11:45] <arias> yeah
[11:45] <crowley1027> i want to install http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/rtorrent but I'm not sure if i have all the packages needed to run it.  how do i check?
[11:45] <juan> Hi please, what should I do after instaling php5 and mysql?
[11:45] <devnull_> hello i was in the middle of upgrading to the newest release and i have errors with packages i can't get around
[11:46] <devnull_> i have tried apt-get -f install and tried to manually remove and reinstall the packages with dpkg -i and dpkg -r
[11:46] <neosa-chris> juan what is your goal..??? what are you looking to do
[11:46] <neosa-chris> i like to install phpmyadmin
[11:46] <neosa-chris> its a good program to have :-)
[11:46] <Mastastealth> arias: ok, it says you'll might want a program called "i810switch", if  u can search for it.
[11:46] <juan> I've checked php5 is ok, but how I check is mysql is running?
[11:46] <Mastastealth> I'm reading this wiki article: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[11:46] <bimberi> crowley1027: are you installing offline (no net connection)?
[11:46] <drkm> I've just added: "/dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 ext3 defaults 0 0" to my fstab to load a new partition, but I can't write to the partition as a normal user.. what have I done wrong?
[11:46] <Mastastealth> near the bottom you see for Intel chips...
[11:47] <littlesniper> neosa-chris: you mean with the desktop cd i can have simple server services ?
[11:47] <crowley1027> no im installing it from http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/rtorrent
[11:47] <neosa-chris> you can use it as a desktop but use all the server softwares on it.. it'll just run slower littlesniper
[11:47] <crowley1027> or i will be.
[11:47] <Adil> hi, i installed ubuntu for AMD64
[11:47] <serishema> drkm: you need to grant rights to it
[11:47] <neosa-chris> if its goign to be only a server then install the server CD with LAMP (option when installing) littlesniper
[11:47] <devnull_> how can i continue and install when a post install script for a package keeps failing
[11:47] <scorp123> yo dudes and gals ... cool channel here! It's midnight now, time for me to get some sleep (or transform into a werewolf ... whatever comes first ;-)  ... )  Thank you + Bye bye .... :)
