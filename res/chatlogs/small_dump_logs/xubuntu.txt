[01:35] <xubuntu72w> hello all. was hoping for some advice. I'm trying to install 14.04 on my media PC to replace windows 7. I see the initial menu and choose install. the xubuntu splash screen comes up. spins for a sec then the PC locks up. any tips?
[01:36] <HassanCehef> maybe an issue with the graphic card drivers.
[01:37] <HassanCehef> xubuntu72w, did you try the "Try Xubuntu" option, instead of Install?
[01:37] <xubuntu72w> its running onGIGABYTE GA-MA785GMT-UD2H AM3 AMD 785G with a nvidia card
[01:38] <xubuntu72w> should I disable the external and use the on board for install only mayne
[01:38] <xubuntu72w> maybe°
[01:38] <HassanCehef> I really don't know.
[01:38] <xubuntu72w> I tried the try option same issue
[01:38] <HassanCehef> oh.
[01:39] <xubuntu72w> year. not really new to buntu but not a master either
[01:39] <xubuntu72w> I'll start with the video tho. gives me someplace to go with. thanks hassancehef
[01:40] <HassanCehef> you are welcome. Happy new year with xubuntu :)
[01:40] <xubuntu72w> thanks. same to you. if I can get this running right I will be lol
[02:03] <nerdistmonk> Is there any particular reason that openjdk is rendered totally useless by default? how do i go about getting a working cacerts file installed so i can run anything?
[02:58] <holstein> nerdistmonk: what are you trying to run?
[02:59] <nerdistmonk> well minecraft for starters
[03:00] <holstein> http://www.howtogeek.com/198476/how-to-install-minecraft-on-ubuntu-or-any-other-linux-distribution/
[03:00] <nerdistmonk> sigh nevermind.
[03:00] <holstein> when i have to use java, i use the PPA
[03:00] <nerdistmonk> the ppa doesnt work for me
[03:00] <nerdistmonk> because libreoffice needs openjre
[03:01] <nerdistmonk> and if you try to remove openjre it just attempts reinstallation of another version
[03:01] <holstein> nerdistmonk: you can get around that with libre
[03:01] <holstein> anyways, just let a volunteer know if you have a question.. you can also use #ubuntu since its not related to xubuntu or xfce, and there may be a larger crowd there using java..
[03:02] <nerdistmonk> i just gave up and tossed it all out
[03:02] <nerdistmonk> openjre should be working fine out of the box but its not
[03:02] <holstein> nerdistmonk: it doesnt ship "out of the box"..
[03:03] <nerdistmonk> well neither does the java ppa...
[03:03] <holstein> sure.. im just addressing what compromises i personally accept when running java applications
[03:04] <holstein> ppa's are not officially supported, but, i run that ppa when i have to use java.. and i cant find a work around
[03:04] <holstein> typically works, no problem.. never had an issue using libreoffice afterwards..
[09:36] <roo79x> Hi all happy new year!, I have been trying to make my own empty trash quicklists but everything I have read and tried will not work? I have tried a few rm commands but everything I try fails, also any item I put into trash has a locked icon over it? does anyone have any ideas please? xubuntu 14.0.1 64bit
[10:16] <roo79x>  Hi all happy new year!, I have been trying to make my own empty trash quicklists but everything I have read and tried will not work? I have tried a few rm commands but everything I try fails, also any item I put into trash has a locked icon over it? does anyone have any ideas please? xubuntu 14.04.1 64bit
[10:22] <brainwash> roo79x: what did you try exactly and what was the result (error/warning messages)?
[10:24] <brainwash> roo79x: regarding the lock icon -> https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=144695
[10:25] <roo79x> thanks I'll read up before I get back to you
[10:28] <roo79x> the main script I used to use on other ubuntu distros is here https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33140680/Linux/general/scripts/scripts/my01delete-trash-script.sh
[10:29] <roo79x> and a secure delete script I have tried here https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33140680/Linux/general/scripts/scripts/madmatts-delete-trash.sh
[10:31] <brainwash> do these scripts generate any errors when run in a terminal window?
[10:33] <brainwash> also, do they only fail in xubuntu, but work fine in other ubuntu distros?
[10:34] <roo79x> have not tried them in a while but last time no... will run them now the delete trash script is just rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*/*
[10:34] <brainwash> right, it's a pretty simple script
[10:34] <brainwash> maybe you should ask in #bash for help with shell scripts
[10:36] <roo79x> ok just ran my01delete-trash-script and it worked no errors and it deleted the items in the trash
[10:40] <brainwash> roo79x: problem solved then?
[10:42] <roo79x> ok just ran madmatts-delete-trash.sh and it worked no errors and it deleted the items in the trash... but neither script will work from a quicklist on docky that I have created?
[10:44] <brainwash> quicklist? do you simply select the script like a file or is the script actually executed?
[10:45] <brainwash> you could create a desktop launcher and check if it works this way
[10:47] <roo79x> the script is executed, when I right click an icon on docky there is an option in the menu I named empty trash, when I click the option in the menu the script is meant to run.. I'll try the launcher idea and see if that works thank you
[10:59] <reggie-man> My discs aren't automounting.
[11:00] <bjorn_> Hi, someone knows how to change the default browser to chromium when I click links?
[11:02] <brainwash> bjorn_: did you try to change it via settings manager > preferred applications?
[11:15] <bjorn_> brainwash, , yes. but I havent restarted... maybe Ill try that
[11:16] <brainwash> bjorn_: a relog should be enough, but I doubt that it's needed
[11:17] <bjorn_> brb
[11:21] <bjorn_> brainwash, It worked after relog
[11:21] <brainwash> bjorn_: great :)
[14:00] <reggie-man> I put a new .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications, but it's not showing up in the menu.
[14:13] <brainwash> reggie-man: does it show up and work properly if you place it on the desktop?
[14:14] <brainwash> reggie-man: maybe it's assigned to the "other" category
[14:15] <brainwash> try the menu editor (menulibre) to locate / move it
[14:18] <aramo> Hi! I've installed xubuntu on old asus eee pc. I have video tearing an all kind of videos. How to fix this?
[14:20] <brainwash> aramo: look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2212418
[14:25] <reggie-man> I figured it out, brainwash. I had nodisplay set to true.
[14:38] <aramo> thanks
[14:39] <cfhowlett> aramo, install the correct video driver?
[14:45] <reggie-man> Yeah, aramo, try installing the proprietary driver. Aslo, I know it can be frustrating, but sometimes you have to be patient in support channels.
[14:47] <aramo>  cfhowlett: lsmod shows i915 driver
[14:48] <aramo> I have intel vga chip. Does it have proprietary driver?
[14:52] <holstein> aramo: shouldnt need one
[14:53] <holstein> aramo: i have an EEE with an unsupported intel chip for GPU.. but, the others i have used, and setup, and own *all* just work "out of the box"
[14:56] <aramo> holstein: i have Intel 915 chip
[14:57] <aramo> lsmod shows that i915 driver is loaded
[14:57] <holstein> aramo: there are no drivers for intel  like that
[14:57] <holstein> aramo: the linux kernel is modular.. so, the kernels are "baked" into the kernel. you dont need to install drivers for *most* hardware
[14:57] <aramo> holstein: but i915 kernel module what is it?
[14:57] <aramo> sure that is why I think that there should be no issue with driver
[14:57] <holstein> aramo: intel typically provides support for linux, and will just work "out of the box"
[14:58] <holstein> aramo: that is why i think you are assuming an issue with the driver
[14:58] <aramo> but  what about tearing. On Lubuntu I didn't have video tearing. On Xubuntu I have it.
[14:58] <holstein> aramo: are you comparing lubuntu 14.04 with xubuntu 14.04?
[14:59] <aramo> yes
[14:59] <aramo> let me check the link provided by brainwash
[14:59] <holstein> aramo: lubuntu and xubuntu *are* ubuntu.. same kernel, same drivers.. same plumbing. same repos
[14:59] <brainwash> ..different window manager
=== SonikkuAmerica is now known as S-USA|0x07df
[14:59] <holstein> aramo: could be, you have not updated one or the other with an upgrade that "Fixes" support
[14:59] <holstein> could be the xubuntu/xfce compositor
[14:59] <holstein> could be misconfiguration.. etc
[15:01] <brainwash> aramo: the first step would be to disable the built-in compositor (settings manager > window manager tweaks > last tab)
[15:03] <brainwash> now xubuntu should behave similar to lubuntu
[15:06] <holstein> aramo: look for, and apply all upgrades, turn off compositing, check your performance with something other than flash video in a web browser, and let the volunteers know how it works..
[15:19] <aramo> Composition was turned off. Everything is up to date.
[15:20] <holstein> aramo: its on by default, AFAIK.. check and make sure that is *is* turned off
[15:20] <holstein> it is*
[15:20] <aramo> I've disabled it before.
[15:20] <holstein> aramo: sure. just check and make sure its off now, though
[15:20] <aramo> done
[15:21] <holstein> aramo: and, you can even try turning it on, and see if it improves, and elaborate about what exactly is tearing and how
[15:21] <aramo> If I turn it on. I will have worst performance when moving windows etc...
[15:21] <holstein> aramo: you will? or you do? have you tried? if not, please try it, and also, share what exactly is tearing, and how?
[15:22] <aramo> I've tried
[15:22] <aramo> ok
[15:23] <holstein> aramo: i have *many* of those netbooks. and i dont expect amazing performance from then with video playback, or 3d graphics rendering
[15:24] <aramo> holstein: sure but I have tearing when I play very simple small videos. I cannot play any youtube videos
[15:25] <holstein> aramo: youtube is using flash.. adobe doesnt provide a current flash version to general linux. you must use the pepperflash version they provide for the chrome browser if you need current flash suport
[15:25] <holstein> http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
[15:26] <aramo> What about html5 video streaming
[15:26] <holstein> there are ways to run that flash in chromium and firefox if you prefer, but, when troubleshooting what you are asking about, i'll just install the chrome browser, and test with flash content in the current flash version, after comfirming my version here http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
[15:26] <aramo> that youtube provides
[15:26] <holstein> aramo: sure, but not for everything
[15:27] <holstein> aramo: youtube doesnt state, "bring any old low-powered device that you have decided to run an unsupported operating system on here and we'll make sure you have smooth video playback"
[15:27] <holstein> aramo: it can be challenging, i understand, but, please try and use the current version of flash in your tests, and try and remove, as i suggested before, web playback from your testing
[15:29] <aramo> The problem is that I saw that this old netbook played well these video files that I have with an old version of ubuntu and with recent lubuntu version as well
[15:29] <aramo> is there any way to decrease rendering quality to improve performance?
[15:32] <holstein> aramo: sure.. but, what video is the issue? what codec? what are you playing it on? when troubleshooting, i use my known-good video files that are well supported in the vlc player, and i *dont* test flash playback in that setup.. or html5 video playback.. what are you using, friend? what file? what filetype? what player?
[15:33] <aramo> holstein QuickTime video files with VLC player
[15:33] <aramo> I have similar result with default parolee player
[15:33] <holstein> aramo: try testing with something that is well supported, in vlc.. ogg video, etc
[15:34] <AgAu> quicktime... eww :P
[15:34] <aramo> ok)))
[15:35] <holstein> aramo: nothing about xubuntu/ubuntu/linux is preventing any of that content from working. but, its all quite closed, and doenst promise desktop linux playback
[15:37] <aramo> btw: how to check available RAM?
[15:37] <holstein> aramo: the operating system will be able to utilize the ram as needed. its pretty much *all* available..
[15:38] <holstein> aramo: you can use something like "top" to check what resources are being used and how
[15:38] <aramo> maybe there is no enough memory, I just wonder why I play those videos with Lubuntu
[15:38] <holstein> aramo: http://askubuntu.com/questions/142505/is-there-an-application-that-can-show-memory-usage-in-a-similar-manner-to-top for example
[15:39] <holstein> aramo: sure, and that is a good thing to test for, and work out.. but, the ram is the *same* in both lubuntu and xubuntu.. and, i have many of those type machines with similar specs
[15:39] <aramo> 1 GB ram should be enough anyway...
[15:39] <holstein> no doubt, more ram is better.. but, it doesnt fix apple quick time video support in an unsupported operating system, or flash support.. etc
[15:45] <aramo> holstein: btw vk videos are ok with 360p quality
[15:45] <holstein> aramo: vk?
[15:46] <aramo> 480p is tearing
[15:46] <holstein> https://vk.com/just_vid ?
[15:46] <aramo> its a russian facebook like social network where you can share videos :-)
[15:46] <holstein> aramo: what format? are they promising desktop linux playback?
[15:47] <aramo> it is html5 streaming
[15:47] <holstein> anyways.. thats what i would expect kfrom a low spec laptop..
[15:47] <aramo> everything above 360p is tearing
[15:47] <holstein> aramo: sure. and i suggest, again, *not* testing with streaming video like that..
[15:48] <aramo> You recomment to have several videos of open well supported formats?
[15:48] <holstein> could be, lxde is freeing up more background system resources, allowing you to squeak more performance out.. but, i think you'll find, with more "apples to apples" comparison, that xubuntu and lubuntu are quite similar in playback performance
[15:49] <holstein> aramo: formats that can and do promise desktop linux playback.. thats what i test with
[15:49] <aramo> btw: Happy New Year)
[15:49] <holstein> aramo: cheers!
[15:50] <aramo> I use Gentoo on my personal computers. But often people ask me to fix their laptops or to install any system on it. Most of them need to have any internet access and to have Skype working
[15:50] <aramo> that is it
[15:50] <aramo> You do a great job here my friends
[15:50] <holstein> skype is also not a "good" test.. since they dont support linux officially any longer
[15:50] <aramo> sure it is a bad test but, it is something that people need
[15:51] <holstein> aramo: sure, but that doenst change the fact that they are welcome and able to support linux.. its all open here, and they are welcome and encouraged to give people what they "need"
[15:51] <holstein> there is little that the linux desktop communities can do to faciliate support, since its all closed
[15:52] <aramo> sure
[15:52] <aramo> BTW: a while ago I found Viber Android version spy on users. Don't use that.
[15:53] <holstein> aramo: well, i think we would need to factually define a few terms.. like "spy", etc.. but, im sure there are more appropriate security channels..
[15:54] <aramo> It requests an access to the camera and call log :-) frequently without any reason for that
[15:54] <aramo> YOu do nothing but Viber tries to access the camera
[15:54] <holstein> aramo: sure. let them know you have an issue with it..

[21:20] <frasson> Then I did a cleanup (instructions to actually convert ubuntu to xubuntu, but I was using ubuntu-gnome)
[21:20] <frasson> The cleanup was the following: sudo apt-get remove nautilus gnome-power-manager gnome-screensaver gnome-termina* gnome-pane* gnome-applet* gnome-bluetooth gnome-desktop* gnome-sessio* gnome-user* gnome-shell-common compiz compiz* unity unity* hud zeitgeist zeitgeist* python-zeitgeist libzeitgeist* activity-log-manager-common gnome-control-center gnome-screenshot overlay-scrollba* && sudo apt-get install xubuntu-community-wallpapers && sudo apt-get autore
[21:20] <frasson> move

[23:28] <gowned> knome, what if I get rid f the package?
[23:28] <knome> gowned, then you won't have xscreensaver.
[23:28] <gowned> knome, which means, no screensavers?

[23:29] <gowned> where do I ask who is the maintainer?
[23:29] <knome> http://packages.ubuntu.com/vivid/xscreensaver tells us there is no specific ubuntu maintainer
