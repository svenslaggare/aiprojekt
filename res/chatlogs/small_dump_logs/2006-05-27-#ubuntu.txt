[05:07] <AlwaysIcey> shoo.
[05:08] <AlwaysIcey> I've got it installed and working.  I just need to create a startup script to call apachectl start.
[05:08] <iguananed> am I in the right channel for someone to help me get tv-out working?
[05:08] <Dr_Willis> iguananed,  perhaps. :P what video card ya got?
[05:08] <Ahmuck> just hook it up to the pickup and pull real hard.  you have tv out
[05:08] <Ahmuck> *snicker*
[05:08] <iguananed> nVidia V9520-x
[05:09] <Ahmuck> sorry, i could not resist :-(
[05:09] <Dr_Willis> iguananed,  you install the nvidia drivers yet?
[05:09] <iguananed> from what I gather it has the FX5200 chipset
[05:09] <Dr_Willis> !nvidia
[05:09] <ubotu> Help about installing the nVidia drivers on Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[05:09] <iguananed> yeppers
[05:09] <iguananed> got nvIdia settings working too
[05:09] <Dr_Willis> iguananed,  heh - on my machine - when i had the tv out hooked up and nvidia drivers.. the silly thing defaulted to the tv out.
[05:09] <iguananed> tried using nvtv
[05:09] <humbraro> AlwaysIcey: i can send you my apache init script, and it should be easy enough to edit for apache2.2 binaries
[05:09] <AlwaysIcey> Hmmm..  Is there a list of what you can get with the ! command?
[05:09] <AlwaysIcey> That would be great.

[05:11] <humbraro> AlwaysIcey: there you go, just make sure that it points to the binaries that you have installed
[05:11] <Flannel> erm, RENAME TABLE table1 TO table2

[05:11] <AlwaysIcey> I take it you sent it to my e-mail address?

[05:13] <Flannel> zoe: do it in your package manager.

[06:24] <wizzermetimers> have a good day
[06:24] <evilelf> babo, from my understanding, you are currently building a web site/application. One of your tasks is known as QA (Quality Analysis, Testing purposes) and it requires the proper environment for you to test your work with. You should've setup a machine (Dual boot, different workstations, etc) and have a strict procedure defined so that you can guarentee your work. The alternatives proposed (wine, emulation) do not provide you a reliable debugging pla
[06:24] <evilelf> tform and certainly isn't acceptable in a professional environment.
=== yoda is now known as lakcaj
[06:25] <DBO> evilelf, full emulation such as KQemu is quite reliable...
[06:25] <linux_galore> pvd2006: I had some weird problems with mplayer . I ended up copying /root/.mplayer/  to /home/username/  then  chwon -R username  /home/username/./mplayer  seemed to fix all the problems

[06:56] <watson541> wierd, it always worked for me :(
[06:57] <watson541> anyways
[06:57] <watson541> hda isnt a partition its a hrd disk :)
[06:57] <watson541> so maybe you should specify a real aprtition :)

[06:57] <technel``> cfdisk won't run though =\
[06:57] <technel``> meheren, Well I think /dev/hda is incorrect

[06:58] <watson541> err.. hda1
[06:58] <technel``> meheren, "fdisk" says I need to specify a drive, "fdisk /dev/hda1" says it isn't found, "cfdisk" says "Cannot open disk drive"
[06:58] <watson541> thats because HDA is the drive  not HDA!!!!
[06:58] <watson541> hda1 is a partition
[06:58] <meheren> can you open window in /dev ?
[06:59] <watson541> hda is the drive
[06:59] <meheren> see if theres a /dev/hda1 or two...
[06:59] <watson541> geez
[06:59] <meheren> or somethin remotelly close

[07:04] <Samuli^> watson541, many people have partition just for grub.
[07:04] <watson541> technel``: i dont know because i never had to use that flag, i always used 'grub-install /dev/hda'
[07:04] <phenom> eggzeck, my taskbar is not showing in Wine though?
[07:04] <linux_galore> technel``: ok  hda hdb   are hardisks,  now say i want to see the first partition on the first hardisk I look at hda1, now another quirk is the MBR isnt on a partition its on the first sector on the primary master hardisk ie hda  not the first partition

[07:04] <eggzeck> phenom: again, wine has a taskbar?
[07:04] <phenom> eggzeck, As far as I've read, yes it does :)
[07:05] <watson541> technel``<-- my guess is, that flag is used for just that..installing to a partition, but are you sure thats what you want to do?!
[07:05] <technel``> watson541, Now when I run that command it says mkdir: cannot create directory `/boot/grub': Permission denied
[07:05] <phenom> taskbar/toolbar.. the bar at the bottom of the screen

[07:05] <watson541> technel``: i hate to ask, but are you running this as sudo or root?
[07:05] <technel``> linux_galore, When I installed the drives, I thought the 160gb was master and 30gb was slave, but according to Ubuntu, it is the other way around
[07:05] <eggzeck> phenom: I think you're incorrect :)
[07:06] <phenom> eggzeck, enlighten me
[07:06] <technel``> watson541, I have not used the ubuntu boot disk before, I don't know how to get in as root
[07:06] <linux_galore> technel``: check the jumpers on the hardisk, master is defined by that
[07:06] <technel``> linux_galore, If I have everything installed though, won't that mix it all up?
[07:06] <Samuli^> technel``, just use sudo.
[07:06] <phenom> technel, rtfm

[07:09] <Samuli^> maybe use failsafe mode at grub.
[07:09] <technel``> linux_galore, Ok, so if I check the HD jumpers and they are wrong, switch them, is that going to screw up my partition on my second hard drive and my larger one with XP on it?
[07:09] <GaiaX11> technel``, if you want to use root, just do:  sudo passwd root
[07:09] <wegstar> got to command line... ctrl+alt+ f1 or something.. and yes, apt-get is still there...
[07:09] <Mysta> d
[07:09] <linux_galore> technel``: yes
[07:09] <eggzeck> GaiaX11: you don't have to incluse 'root' to do that :)
[07:09] <Samuli^> wegstar, do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[07:09] <technel``> GaiaX11, Ah, nice
[07:09] <wegstar> ok...
[07:09] <Samuli^> or kubuntu- if you prefer KDE

[07:10] <Samuli^> or apt-get thinks you do anyways.

[07:11] <phenom> lol dangit.. that was the tutorial for making root also
[07:11] <Samuli^> wegstar.. well no.. it seems you have really badly broken dependencies.

[07:12] <wegstar> oh
[07:12] <eggzeck> GaiaX11: running 'sudo passwd' does essentially the same as 'sudo passwd root'. And another thing, you do not need to 'sudo su', just 'su' heh.
[07:12] <GaiaX11> Do you mean about the other way of accessing root.  Didn't you?
[07:12] <Samuli^> wegstar, but ask around, maybe someone knows a solution.

[07:12] <Samuli^> wegstar, my solution is to uninstall what apt-get -f install wants and then install ubuntu-desktop again.
[07:13] <GaiaX11> But, I set up a new passwd for root
[07:13] <wegstar> Samuli^: no risk of removing my current data?
[07:13] <wegstar> i.e. word documents..?
[07:13] <GaiaX11> Apart from the same user pass

[07:18] <humbraro> babo: can't comment on that since i don't run it on a laptop
[07:18] <wegstar> so I should use apt-get, always?
[07:18] <GaiaX11> eggzeck, just to know the two ways. Which is not a bad thing! :-)
[07:18] <Sandy16> wen i try to install wine its NOT working...
[07:18] <Samuli^> wegstar, maybe you can solve the whole thing my plugging your ubuntu-comp into internet and updating everything.
[07:19] <wegstar> ok
[07:19] <nomin> since the next ubuntu installs in a live session, is it possible to surf the internet while it is installing?
[07:19] <wegstar> apt-get upgrade?
[07:19] <babo> humbraro: so if I install dapper now, the only difference between it and the release version will be some updates (which I can just click to install right ?)
[07:19] <wegstar> or something else?

=== No1Viking [n=micke@h-83-140-104-3.ip.rixbredband.se]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:41] <humbraro> phenom: you use them at the command line, or put them into your .bashrc
[07:41] <iand> hallo
[07:42] <humbraro> as an example, the 'ls' command doesn't by default show directories and such in different colors
[07:42] <Xichtli> i have been using ubuntu for about 12 days
=== donvella [n=don@CPE-203-45-144-104.qld.bigpond.net.au]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:42] <humbraro>  but if you do a 'alias ls='ls --color' ' it'll show ls in color from now on
[07:43] <Samuli^> wegstar, did you update already?
[07:43] <humbraro> and you can do thos sorts of things with any command
[07:43] <wegstar> It refuses to update
[07:43] <eggzeck> humbraro: I believe in Ubuntu it does :)
[07:43] <Samuli^> wegstar, so umm.. what does apt-get -f install say now?
[07:43] <wegstar> remove 162 MB of stuff
=== e91 [n=icon@202.78.195.42]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:43] <humbraro> eggzeck: check out your ~/.bashrc and you will see that exact entry in there to make it default
[07:43] <spikeb> oh dear

[07:44] <ubotu> restricted is, like, totally, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats  Most of the formats listed there can be replaced by !FreeFormats
[07:44] <phenom> humbraro, I'm new to Linux :)
[07:44] <humbraro> i might be guilty of using a bad example though :)
[07:44] <phenom> humbraro, That didn't make sense
[07:44] <eggzeck> humbraro: I don't have to check it. I was telling you that I think in Ubuntu there is already an alias for 'ls', alias='ls --color=auto' ;)
[07:44] <Samuli^> wegstar, well I can't tell you any easy way.. Remove what apt-get wants and then install ubuntu-desktop again.
[07:44] <eggzeck> humbraro: by default :)
[07:44] <whitesuit> hi, anyone solved the sound out of sync problem with flash videos?
[07:45] <humbraro> hehe
[07:45] <wegstar> hmm
[07:45] <iand> does anyone know if the opengl libraries work the same on all platforms?

[07:45] <wegstar> I can't back up my home directory right now...
[07:45] <humbraro> ok, phenom, i'm gonna pm you and we'll get this worked out
[07:45] <Samuli^> you have broken dependecies because of the way you did stuff and I'm guessing that's what you must do to get that solved.
[07:45] <iand> or do they have different commands?
[07:46] <Xichtli> sometimes my desktop managerm icewm refuses to log me off
[07:46] <Xichtli> then i am forced to sudo shurtdown
[07:46] <Xichtli> isnt that strange??
=== RoninGurl [n=RoninGur@ip68-98-76-77.ph.ph.cox.net]  has joined #ubuntu
=== nalioth is now known as nalioth_zZz
[07:47] <RoninGurl> can someone refresh my memory how you can find a file in bash if you know the name but not the directory. its something like "find . -name 'file'"
[07:48] <Xichtli> does anyone else use icewm ??
[07:48] <Xichtli> find / -name filename
[07:48] <watson541> RoninGurl: i always use the 'locate' database, 'locate -u' ro index then 'locate <file>'
[07:49] <RoninGurl> yah well the server doesnt use locate.
[07:49] <watson541> shucks
[07:49] <watson541> I can never remember the find command either, thats why i use locate :)
[07:49] <spikeb> find / -name file
[07:49] <Xichtli> exactly what i say
[07:49] <babo> damn, how do I mount my usb ? I've looked in /var/log/dmesg and it doesn't suggest which dev my usb is at ... ? Shouldn't it be detected automatically ?
[07:49] <GaiaX11> RoninGurl, find . -name 'file' will serch in the current directory
[07:50] <iand> what is the command for deleting a whole directory?
[07:50] <whitesuit> no one knows the solution to the sound/flahs problem?
=== Zane42 [n=Zane42@72.24.110.69]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:50] <watson541> i wonder if i could turn that find command into an alias while we're on the subject :)
[07:50] <Xichtli> rm -r is recursive, allowing you to remove a whole directory
[07:50] <Zane42> I have a gig of ram, how much swap do I need if any?
=== stjepan [n=stjepan@83-131-64-30.adsl.net.t-com.hr]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:50] <RoninGurl> r will bug you a lot
[07:50] <iand> including the directory itself?
[07:50] <Xichtli> <- no sound
[07:50] <RoninGurl> use -fr *
[07:50] <RoninGurl> while inside the directory
=== gina [n=gina@70-58-195-208.ptld.qwest.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:51] <iand> ok
[07:51] <Madpilot> Zane42, with 1Gb, you probably don't need any - my box runs fine on 1Gb w/ no swap...
[07:51] <Xichtli> <- wish he had a gig of ram
[07:51] <Xichtli> babo i use usb drives
=== spikeb has a gig of ram and swap
[07:51] <iand> i would like to anounce that i am now accepting ram donations
[07:52] <Xichtli> i remember editing my fstab file
[07:52] <Zane42> Second question.  If I want to convert from reiser to ext3 so I can better handle large video files, how would I go about that?
=== Madpilot is actually contemplating a 2nd Gb - would help with graphic/DTP apps...
[07:52] <Sandy16> how can i send a message to another user (if he is conneted thrugh GUI) just like write in the terminal
[07:53] <watson541> lol, i did this 'alias look='find / -name'  :) so i dont have to remember
[07:53] <humbraro> watson541: alias look='find / -name $1'
[07:53] <watson541> isit case sensitive though?
[07:53] <humbraro> ok, that was wierd
=== jeiky [n=jake@ppp-68-251-58-178.dsl.chcgil.ameritech.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:54] <RoninGurl> found it! its "find . -name "filename" - print"
[07:54] <humbraro> watson541: it ought to be
[07:54] <watson541> humbraro: it is but i dont want it to be
[07:54] <RoninGurl> and thats recursive too.
[07:54] <jeiky> what tool do i use to reformat this partition on my external hard drive?
[07:54] <watson541> thats funny we both thought of the same name for the alias!
[07:54] <watson541> i swear i was up in my backlog when i typed that so i didnt see
[07:54] <humbraro> watson541: well, all unix filenames are case-sensitive, maybe somebody more knowledgable than I can figure that out

[07:55] <watson541> humbraro: well i knew that part, i just need to make the find command not case sensitiver, so if i search for 'foo' it will show me 'foo' and 'Foo' :)

[07:55] <spikeb> hmm
[07:55] <Madpilot> watson541, "man find" - I'm sure there's a switch for that
[07:56] <watson541> yeah umm, we dont suggest man pages here, i lready got in trouble for that the other day :)
[07:56] <watson541> i know how to use man as we al do, i just wondered if anyone knew offhand
[07:56] <humbraro> watson541: what Madpilot  said, or you could use regular-expression voodoo, which is over my head
[07:56] <lakcaj> watson541: find -iname
[07:56] <lakcaj> find ./ -iname "*blah*"
[07:56] <lakcaj> for example
[07:57] <RoninGurl> lakcaj, i already found the command. its  "find . -name "filename" - print"
[07:57] <phenom> humbraro, did you get my response in the IM?
[07:57] <watson541> lakcaj: thank you, i will try that one, big help, im not in the mood for man-page diving atm :)
[07:57] <humbraro> phenom: no...hmm
[07:57] <squiggly>  DANCE DANCE
[07:57] <watson541> if it wa something i seriously wanted/needed i would do it on my own, but this is something that just popped out of me watching the conversation :)
[07:58] <humbraro> phenom: do you have a button with my name on it?

[07:59] <RoninGurl> some jerk decided to get infected with the PHP.RSTBackdoor virus.

[08:00] <squiggly>  /thumbdrive, babo
[08:00] <squiggly> make sure you mount it
[08:00] <UNH2LY> gnome mounts it for you
[08:00] <UNH2LY> should show up on the desktop
[08:00] <squiggly> haven't used ubuntu in a while, but i'm pretty sure thats it
[08:00] <UNH2LY> or show up in /media
[08:00] <waky> yes
[08:00] <waky> ubuntu mount the usb stick
[08:00] <waky> you must only wait
[08:01] <GaiaX11> RoninGurl, Are talking about this virus in Linux?
[08:01] <phenom> humbraro: I am trying to get Wine to run Warcraft 3 with the -opengl parameter so it plays smoothly, not 1FPS
[08:02] <squiggly> anyone know any good python channels besides the one on freenode?
[08:02] <humbraro> ok, i have absolutely no experience with warcraft or its options, so take the following with a large bucket of salt
[08:02] <phenom> hehe ok
[08:02] <babo> squiggly, ?
[08:02] <phenom> same thing as running other apps with parameters
=== apt-abhi [n=prlab@59.93.56.77]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:03] <iand> you also have to edit a file to make it do opengl
[08:03] <humbraro> phenom: exactly, just that we want to make it more permanent
[08:03] <iand> i dont recall what it was though
[08:03] <babo> ok, but what if gnome doesn't mount it ?
[08:03] <phenom> Yes
[08:03] <stjepan> do you use sudo? Isn't sudo very insecure? Malicious software can easily get root access with sudo. Isn't this dangerous?
[08:03] <iand> well you gotta do it somehow
[08:04] <Sandy16> how can i open flash files on ubuntu Dapper Drake
[08:04] <spikeb> !flash
[08:04] <ubotu> Installation & troubleshooting for Flash is covered in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[08:04] <FreeZey> any1 install dapper yet?
[08:04] <humbraro> so, you want to open up /home/phenom/.bashrc
[08:04] <FreeZey> i got a question for why its hanging on this dam package
=== tangent_ [n=tangent@modemcable248.105-130-66.mc.videotron.ca]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:04] <humbraro> and it'll have lots of stuff in it already
[08:04] <spikeb> FreeZey: i have
[08:04] <wegstar> Samuli^, it's installing... and apparently the problem is fixed
[08:04] <humbraro>  at the end of the file, enter this:
[08:04] <GaiaX11> FreeZey, me too
=== upt1me [n=upt1me@24-179-136-112.dhcp.fdul.wi.charter.com]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:04] <phenom> Done
[08:05] <FreeZey> spikeb: it says unpacking replacement hplip-data
[08:05] <FreeZey> because the install failed originally
[08:05] <FreeZey> so i had re run the command
[08:05] <humbraro> alias mynewwarcraftcommand='warcraft --option1 --option2 --etc'
[08:05] <humbraro> phenom: see what i mean?
=== jason22 [n=sldkfjsl@cpe-72-226-231-160.rochester.res.rr.com]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:05] <phenom> Yes
[08:05] <humbraro> cool
[08:05] <spikeb> FreeZey: i never ran into problems
[08:06] <humbraro> try that out and lemme know if it works
[08:06] <FreeZey> i have no idea why its runnin into this damproblem tho
[08:06] <FreeZey> makes no sense
[08:06] <phenom> so mynewwarcraft command can can be "playwarcraft" and the ='warcraft is the directory where the warcraft EXE is?
[08:07] <FreeZey> whats the command to completey remove the install and start out fresh?
[08:07] <FreeZey> would it just be like
[08:07] <humbraro> phenom: no, its the warcraft executable file
[08:07] <phenom> ok
[08:07] <humbraro> phenom: i don't know what its really called, since i don't play it
=== TecnoVM64 [n=tecnovm@unaffiliated/tecnovm64]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:07] <phenom> warcraft3.exe :)
[08:08] <humbraro> so i wasn't that far off :)
[08:08] <FreeZey> cause when it broke i ran sudp apt-get install -f
[08:08] <Samuli^> wegstar, cool :)
[08:08] <killapop> FreeZey: apt-get remove packagename
[08:08] <wegstar> :).. I just hope the installation of ubuntu-desktop doesn't replace my Desktop folder ;)
[08:08] <FreeZey> yeah i know that command
=== whitesuit [n=angelus@200-158-80-133.dsl.telesp.net.br]  has left #ubuntu ["Leaving"] 
[08:08] <spikeb> wegstar: it doesn't
[08:09] <phenom> Humbraro, so this would work? alias warcraft='war3.exe -opengl
[08:09] <phenom> All I would have to do is type in war3.exe?
[08:09] <wegstar> yay!
[08:09] <FreeZey> i don;t even know the dam package name for dapper tho
[08:09] <humbraro> phenom: if it's an .exe, its probably not in your "path"
[08:09] <phenom> So I would have to point directally to it instead of just ufing the file name
[08:09] <humbraro> phenom: so use the "absolute" path, i.e. /path/to/windows/directory/which/contains/warcraft.exe
[08:10] <killapop> FreeZey: did u install using dpkg?
[08:10] <FreeZey> first i did gksudo
[08:10] <FreeZey> then i just ran strait sudo
[08:10] <humbraro> phenom: so, alias warcraft='wine /media/windows/warcraft.exe --options --opengl'

[08:11] <UNH2LY> been running it for a few months
[08:11] <paul_> what you guys talking about?
[08:11] <FreeZey> well no i ran the apt get
[08:11] <FreeZey> no dpkg at all
[08:11] <paul_> not to crowbar myself into your conversation
[08:12] <killapop> FreeZey: then apt-get remove should do it
[08:12] <UNH2LY> well yeah, thats what i meant apt-get dist-upgrade
=== maciek [n=maciek@camarillo-cuda1ac-19.ventca.adelphia.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:12] <FreeZey> yeah but whats the package name
[08:12] <Madpilot> paul_, #ubuntu is a tech support channel for Ubuntu, mostly. If you just want to chat, try #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:12] <FreeZey> dist-upgrade didn;t work for me
[08:12] <humbraro> phenom: lemme know how that works out, and i'll be back in a minute
[08:12] <killapop> FreeZey: hplip-data?
[08:12] <FreeZey> yeah
[08:12] <FreeZey> now it won;t even run tho
[08:12] <FreeZey> to finish the install
[08:12] <paul_> how do i get there?
[08:13] <killapop> FreeZey: what is it... some printer drivers?

[08:13] <FreeZey> no idea wtf it is

[08:13] <phenom> Humbraro, No such file or directory?
[08:13] <killapop> FreeZey: so why u intalling it

[08:13] <squiggly> newer ones anyway
[08:13] <FreeZey> cause it comes with the upgrade
[08:13] <FreeZey> i just let it install all the packages
[08:13] <squiggly> propietary drivers &etc
[08:13] <Madpilot> squiggly, HP printers usually do fine in Linux...
[08:14] <squiggly> Madpilot, I haven't gotten my Deskjet to run under Linux
[08:14] <killapop> squiggly: yup.. they work for me too
[08:14] <Madpilot> squiggly, my HP Deskjet 5740 runs just fine
[08:14] <squiggly> i have to run some crap that i downloaded from their website to use my printer
[08:14] <squiggly> i'm using a 3930
[08:14] <iand> hp laptops are awful though
[08:15] <killapop> FreeZey: did it go thru with the upgrade?
[08:15] <FreeZey> no thats what i am sayin it failed on me
[08:15] <FreeZey> i wanna remove the whole upgrade
[08:15] <FreeZey> the entire thing
[08:15] <FreeZey> i want to take it off
[08:15] <FreeZey> start fresh

=== jack is now known as jack-
[08:15] <phenom> Humbraro, nogo

=== wegstar thanks Samuli^
[08:16] <spikeb> stjepan: yes, no, no it can't, no it isn't.
[08:16] <Madpilot> stjepan, read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo please - you're wrong about sudo...
[08:16] <killapop> FreeZey: if it didnt go thru... it might not have installed all the packages for the upgrade...
[08:16] <varsendagger> !cvs
[08:16] <ubotu> from memory, cvs is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source network-transparent version control system; it helps to manage releases and to control concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. See: https://www.cvshome.org/
[08:17] <FreeZey> killapop: i know it didn't install everything what i am asking is how do i remov all of it
[08:17] <humbraro> phenom: how do you normally run warcraft?
[08:17] <Madpilot> squiggly, the 3930 isn't listed at linuxprinting.org, but the 3920 & 3940 are both listed as working "Mostly" with the free HP-supplied drivers...
[08:17] <killapop> FreeZey: sorry... I've never come across that situation... wont be able to help ya!
[08:17] <squiggly> Hum...
[08:17] <FreeZey> ok
[08:17] <humbraro> phenom: like, do you run a command from a terminal, or double-click on an icon, etc
[08:17] <squiggly> anyone know of any Python channels besides the one on this network?
[08:18] <phenom> Humbraro, Terminal, I'd like to make it an Icon for double clicking tho
[08:18] <humbraro> phenom: ok, alias first, icon second :)'
[08:18] <phenom> ok im trying to make the alias
[08:18] <killapop> FreeZey: one question tho- did u run dist-upgrade using the repositories from the newer version
[08:19] <phenom> Humbraro, alias warcraft="/home/phenom/Desktop/Documents/Games/Warcraft/war3.exe"
[08:19] <killapop> FreeZey: in ur sources list
[08:19] <FreeZey> the command i ran when i wanted to upgrade was gksudo "update-manager -d"
[08:19] <FreeZey> thats all i ran
[08:19] <humbraro> phenom: you need to put the --opengl option after that
[08:19] <phenom> Humbraro, I'm just trying to get the alias to run befor I worrie about performance hehe
[08:20] <humbraro> and its single quotes, not double
[08:20] <humbraro> so ' not "
[08:20] <varsendagger> how the heck do i use cvs?
[08:21] <killapop> FreeZey: then ur safe i think.. cos the -d switch is just to check if upgrading to the latest devel release is possible or not
[08:21] <killapop> FreeZey: it doesnt do the upgrade itself

[08:31] <odin_> is it normal for the volume on all media programs to be lower than sound effects of other programs, even with its volume turned all the way up?

[08:32] <phenom> should i logout and try it now?

[08:36] <humbraro> in the name box, call it warcraft
[08:36] <UNH2LY> that right there is a great feature of gnome

[08:44] <Samuli^> I'm using totem-xine-plugin and firefox. Works very nicely.
[08:45] <nomin> Samuli^, I just installed debian sarge on another pc and I can record streaming video with kaffeine, but debian has a newer version of kaffeine.  Ubuntu breezy does not have the latest kaffiene that can record streaming video.
[08:45] <Samuli^> nomin, and sarge does? that's odd.
[08:45] <phenom> hombraro, Yes! Thanks abunch!
[08:45] <Samuli^> anyways, Upgrade to dapper :)
[08:45] <humbraro> that might be the only package that debian has thats newer than any other distro
[08:46] <nomin> Samuli^, but dapper is unstable and the next stable ubuntu is coming out soon.
[08:46] <humbraro> phenom: cool, have fun with that
[08:46] <Samuli^> nomin, it's dapper that's coming out and I can tell you it's not unstable at all.
[08:47] <Samuli^> to me it's been a lot more stable than breezy ever was for over 3 weeks now.
[08:47] <nomin> Samuli^, than why haven't they officially announced it yet?
[08:47] <odin_> will dapper fix the problem of firefox spontaneously closing, and too much activity resulting in a random system crash?

[08:50] <odin_> Samuli^:  is there any simple reason for that?  at least good to know that I'm not the only one having that problem
[08:51] <Samuli^> odin_, I guess it's because that's the first thing programmed to close if there's a need to free memory.
[08:51] <humbraro> Samuli^: no probs with anything, running services, nothing stripped down, hell, even gnome loads faster than it did when i used slack

[08:56] <Samuli^> KDE 4 will be interesting too.
[08:56] <nomin> if you want to record streaming videos, I think the newest version of kaffeine is the easiest to use.  I'm going to see if I can backport the latest one from dapper.
=== humbraro wishes kde would dedicate 1 whole release to polish
[08:57] <nomin> Samuli^: are you able to record streaming videos?
[08:57] <spikeb> kde 4 will be neat, yes, but if history is any guide, i won't be able to stand it

[08:57] <Samuli^> But I think not.
[08:58] <harrisonK> ahhhg 17 minutes til ubuntu-5.10-i386.iso is done.. i will not rest until success is mine
[08:58] <nomin> kaffeine on debian sarge does it very easily.

[08:59] <mustard5> what annoyed me was how much xubuntu dapper looked like gnome when I first loaded it up
[09:00] <spikeb> that's the default look upstream now, mustard5
[09:00] <killapop> humbraro: also learned that mamusha is good for mum and mamushka is not so good
[09:00] <humbraro> mustard5: by default, yes, but its whole drawing engine is so different than gnome, that i can't get used to it
[09:00] <Samuli^> killapop, nope.
[09:00] <killapop> Samuli^: then u should
[09:00] <Samuli^> killapop, I'll try that as I have vlc installed already.
[09:01] <Samuli^> though totem-xine does everything I want anyways.
[09:01] <killapop> Samuli^: im just in the process of testing and putting together a set of tools for audio video production on linux and vlc is good for streaming media
[09:01] <mustard5> spikeb, yeah its a bit of a 'who moved my cheese' situation...I'll get used to it eventually
[09:01] <killapop> Samuli^: im not to big a fan of totem... xine in itself I dont mind

[09:12] <Samuli^> It is? cool.
[09:12] <Apostle^> Samuli^, all i do is install it or what?
[09:12] <Samuli^> Yeah I guess.
[09:12] <Apostle^> my headset shows up as dsp2
[09:12] <Apostle^> not sure why...
[09:12] <Apostle^> maybe because it's bluetooth

[09:13] <Samuli^> And after install make sure your skype-link in applications starts sky_dsp_hijacker instead of skype.
[09:13] <Apostle^> sky? or skype
[09:13] <eumario> I need a way to make the boot up to modprobe snd_intel8x0, so that I'll have sound when it boots up.  The second problem, is that on my 400 MHz, I've got a Wireless Adapater Setup through the latest release of the NDISWrapper, but it's not connecting to my Wireless Router, so it's left without internet connection.
[09:13] <Samuli^> Apostle^, that's normal. You're soundcard is dsp and you're other soundevices are dsp2,3 etc.
[09:14] <nomin> Samuli^: can you do fullscreen, forward, and rewind with these videos:  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement/view/

[09:14] <watson541> i know it doesnt fix the problem, but its a wokaround :0
[09:15] <eumario> watson541: That is what I did.  Making it non-executable prevents hotplug from loading up, but my sound doesn't load up.  I have to modprobe it, and restart Gnome.
[09:15] <Apostle^> Samuli^, any fix on why skype takes an hour to load?

[09:16] <eumario> watson541: Basically, I just need to figure out, where to place the modprobe command, to probe for the snd_intel8x0, so it'll load up the sound, before GDM even kicks in.

[09:21] <nomin> phenom, I use K3b.  Works great.
[09:21] <Samuli^> phenom, it's the program you use to go through files.
[09:21] <phenom> will K3B work on Gnome?
[09:21] <Samuli^> it will.
[09:22] <watson541> eumario: so i would put it in 3 or 4 tob be safae
[09:22] <Samuli^> just looks ugly and starts slowly.
[09:22] <nomin> phenom, yes.  You just need to install the kde libs.  Synaptic automatically does it.
[09:22] <eumario> watson541: Yeah, was thinking about 4, cause that's just right before 5.
[09:22] <watson541> heh eumario :)
[09:22] <nomin> I run a few kde apps just fine
[09:22] <Samuli^> anyways, dapper has this CD/DVD Creator in 'places' where you can drag and drop files and then push 'write cd/dvd'
[09:23] <nomin> phenom, just check k3b for installation in synaptic and it installs everything.  It's pretty simple.
[09:23] <Samuli^> I don't remember if that was there in breezy, but I'm getting not.
[09:23] <phenom> Nomain, I'll try. is K3b drag'n'drop friendly?

[09:24] <Tidus> nomin: it also supports drag/drop from naut / konqueror

[09:28] <vmadmin> ok again any protection on smtp for postfix to stop hackers and spam

[09:52] <nomin> scabootssca, Red Hat is a company that has it's own linux distro.  Since linux is open source, any other distro can use the RPM system.  Red Hat created it, but any distro can use it.

[09:59] <eumario> leojstewart: Sec here.

[10:04] <eumario> leojstewart: Remember, we're statically assigning an IP Address to your computer.  In other words, your computer won't ask the Router for an IP Address, your telling the Router your at this IP Address.

[10:58] <FeestBijtje> ive used this faq on my work
[10:59] <hobojoe> OK maybe I'm going about this all the wrong way,I was trying to follow the dapper guide for the latest NVidia drivers. I've manually installed my own 2.6.16 kernel. Now when i try to follow the nvidia installe how-to it requests I install the linux-header package for my kernel so the nvidia driver can use it. But compiling by hand I don't have that package to install.

[10:59] <hobojoe> Can this still be done with my kernel or do I need to install a kernel-image and kernel-headers from the repo.
[11:00] <FeestBijtje> hobojoe, whats the error
[11:01] <Almenfors> hum.. i must have done something wrong here. ive put up samba account. but when i try access my server from lan i get no access directly.
[11:01] <hobojoe> FeestBijtje: It says in the Nvidia Latest Howto that i need to do this "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`"
[11:02] <hobojoe> but it errors out saying can't find linux-restricted-modules-2.6.16-ck3

[11:02] <FeestBijtje> hobojoe, do: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.16-ck3
[11:02] <hobojoe> I originally followed the Breazy nvidia install using the method #2
[11:03] <hobojoe> same problem, Can't find package
[11:03] <hobojoe> I followed the second method for breezy which required making your own headers for the driver.
=== brovold [n=brovold@ti112210a080-7002.bb.online.no]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:04] <hobojoe> But now with dapper, all methods require the restricted modules in the repo. I don't have any precompiled kernels installed. So i was wondering Do i need to use one ?
[11:04] <fourat_> how to get X started at boot
[11:04] <Almenfors> is there any command to list current accounts in samba.
[11:04] <hobojoe> OR can i get it working with dapper and this kernel, Because the same method (using the nvidia installer) doesn't work with dapper and 2.6.16
[11:04] <DBO> hobojoe, you are not required to use the restricted modules to install nvidia in dapper
[11:04] <FeestBijtje> hobojoe, i don't know lots about the dapper drake version

[11:05] <DBO> its not the same as breezy
[11:06] <hobojoe> oh ok, yeah It was complaining about symlinks, that why I thought the method was shot

[11:39] <linux_galore> binks: should keep em busy
[11:39] <DBO> anonymouse, argle... I wonder why the heck its doing that...  file a bug report?
[11:39] <anonymouse> so now I'm trying to think if i can just merge a branch onto the unionfs at run time
[11:40] <anonymouse> but unionctl is not installed!
[11:40] <tony_> hi when using chown how can i specify all users? 'Anybody' doesnt work.
[11:40] <xor_not_and> is the module even packed with the kernel?
[11:40] <binks> http://gcompris.net/-en-  << this looks like the trick to start with thanks alot Again why i love ubuntu the people make this distro great
[11:40] <DBO> anonymouse, sudo apt-get install unionfs-utils (maybe?)

[11:43] <hastesaver> shriphani, it's the way to edit the sudoers file.
[11:43] <DBO> xor_not_and, for the most part, newer kernel, newer modules, more packages...
[11:43] <shriphani> ok
[11:43] <xor_not_and> visudo is X11 user manager
[11:43] <shriphani> is it the only way ?
[11:43] <hastesaver> shriphani, and the sudoers file keeps the list of who is allowed to do what with sudo

[11:44] <tony_> Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file.

[03:26] <pandasan71> For pdf, OpenOffice and export as pdf
[03:26] <XVampireX> The look and feel
[03:26] <odin> wait, scratch xfce
[03:26] <XVampireX> and applications
[03:26] <pandasan71> Thanks, people
[03:26] <shoofle> never heard of xfce...
[03:26] <linux_galore> odin: xfce is a minimal desktop for systems with a small ram footprint

[03:26] <pavlix> hastesaver: so... i should expect similar here :-)
[03:26] <XVampireX> And some say memory requirements
[03:26] <linux_galore> I used xfce for 4 years lol
[03:26] <XVampireX> There are other ones
[03:27] <hastesaver> pavlix, similar to what? Ubuntu is very similar to Debian, if that's what you're asking
[03:27] <WarOfAttrition> xfce is medium minimal. if you want really minimal, try fluxbox
[03:27] <hastesaver> or ratpoison
[03:27] <linux_galore> XVampireX: kde and gnome are full blown desktops, there are alternates like xfce if you have not allot of ram ie 64mb
[03:27] <pavlix> hastesaver: no.. that's not what i'm asking, that's what i already know..
[03:27] <fyrestrtr> if you want *really* minimal, try xdm.
[03:27] <XVampireX> I know
[03:27] <linux_galore> yeah ratpoison will run on 8mb of ram

[05:08] <cjfp> my terminal (aterm) is displaying some garbage characters locally, but it works fine over ssh.  any way to fix it?

[05:08] <esox> But I have another question. I'd like to grant the user `backuppc' just reading rights for files, but reading and excute rights for directories. How can this be achieved?
[05:08] <soundray> wizzlefish: exit any program that uses sound before you use another, then.
[05:08] <QMario> For some reason installing ekiga's dependent packages wants it to be removed.

[05:47] <slackern> Xenguy: what kind of device is eth0 connected too? does it support more than 10mbps and halfduplex?

[05:50] <slackern> Xenguy: thats called autonegotiation.
[05:50] <Xenguy> slackern: OK, so I need to check the specs on the modem
[05:50] <soundray> speedsix: plug it in, wait till it's mounted, then enter mount. It's most likely the last line, and most likely of the format /dev/sdX with X corresponding to a partition on the USB device.

[06:01] <Frogzoo> stfn: k3b for sure
[06:01] <ompaul> stfn, in such a case I tend to use K3B myself and make the file that is to be burnt in a real directory

[06:05] <Noeve> I'm having trouble with my Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet card on Ubuntu Breezy - I just can't seem to get any networking. Does anyone have any ideas ?
[06:06] <stfn> ompaul, Frogzoo: thanks for the suggestions.  I will try GnomeBaker first since i'm running Gnome everything else.  I was really impressed with the simplicity of the UI (right-click "Copy Disk..." why thank you, Ubuntu, that's exactly what I want to do :) until it didn't work :P )

[06:57] <premier69> when trying to logon to my windows computer from ubuntu over the lan displays this error message: the folder contents could not be displayed, is this becouse i have password enabled on my xp pc? i could access another win xp comp on my lan not using a password
[06:57] <Dr_Willis> it should be a /dev/sd##
[06:58] <MisterN> FOAD: adapt ~/.mtoolsrc

[06:58] <FOAD> MisterN: adapt it.. how?
[06:58] <Dr_Willis> premier69,  i tend to make user and passwords wihh the same name/pass on both windows and my linux box's
[06:58] <arrick1> premier69, more than likely the password is encrypted for that system

[06:58] <MisterN> FOAD: first you need to find the device name
[06:58] <DjHardtrac> hello
[06:58] <Dr_Willis> may want to try out some of the other samba browser tools to see if you can get a better error/info.
[06:59] <MisterN> FOAD: then add a line like drive i: file="/dev/sdg1" to ~/.mtoolsrc
[06:59] <premier69> arrick1 what does that mean?
=== hastesaver [n=hastesav@unaffiliated/hastesaver]  has joined #ubuntu
[06:59] <FOAD> ok...
[06:59] <premier69> Dr_Willis i could make a new user account on my xp with the same as my linux has
[06:59] <premier69> Dr_Willis tho, that shouln't matter, right?
[06:59] <arrick1> sometimes there is encryption with your XP box password that ubuntu will not enterpret correctly, therefore XP will not allow login
[07:00] <hastesaver> watson540, you were right; the cable connecting the cd drive to the motherboard was loose. Fixed it
[07:00] <premier69> arrick1 ok, i'll test making a no password account
[07:00] <Dr_Willis> premier69,  you could.. you also could make sure you are in the same 'workgroup' may help - samba can be really really picky at times.. and the gnome tools just dont give a lot of options and error info at times.
[07:00] <Dr_Willis> premier69,  i much perfer 'smb4k'
[07:00] <watson540> hastesaver: me? right? there's a first time for everything :)
[07:00] <premier69> Dr_Willis smb4k?
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> premier69,  thats the name of a kde based samba browsing tool
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> theres dozens of other samba browsing tools out there. Gnome and kde both have their SMB://// based tools.
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> !samba
[07:02] <ubotu> I guess samba is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba or http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/samba2/book/toc.html

I am trying to set up an ubuntu NFS server-  After I do "apt-get install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common portmap", and then I do "dpkg-reconfigure portmap" "rpcinfo -p" only shows portmapper and status- And I believe portmap, nfs, and mountd should ALL show up- How do I get portmap, nfs, and mountd to all run?

[09:55] <nickrud> dbcalo, off topic, but they're equivalently useful to their users
[09:55] <weazzle> enlightenment is complicated
[09:55] <nickrud> rendo, what issue?
[09:55] <Spliffster> help, what can i do if my cdrom-drive is not detected ?
[09:56] <rendo> Thunderbird 1.5 script, it installs but I can't run thunderbird in breezy
[09:56] <dbcalo> how so weazzle?
[09:56] <weazzle> dbcalo: I don't get how the desktops work. I like xfce better. However, I think the best is AfterStep.
[09:57] <rendo> And if I try apt-get install mozilla-thunderbird it says something about maxdepth with the chrome registry.... I tried looking on the ubuntu forums and there's nothing about it. :/
[09:57] <acke> all the lines that start with deb is enabled
[09:57] <dbcalo> haven't hread of that one.
[09:57] <acke> gnomefreak removed # on lines starting with #
[09:57] <gnomefreak> acke: leave the # infron tof the very first line?

[09:57] <weazzle> it is pretty sweet
[09:57] <gnomefreak> acke: the comments still have the # there right?
[09:58] <acke> gnomefreak still commented away
[09:58] <weazzle> however, for ease of use, xfce is probably the best

[11:37] <babyboy> real emergency lmfao
[11:37] <DBO> !ask
[11:37] <ubotu> Just ask. Questions in the channel should be specific, informative, complete, concise and on-topic. Information like hardware make, model and output of commands that you used pasted onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org is important.
[11:38] <gdb> enyc: Yes, I understand it's June 1st.  Is that slated to have SELinux installed and enabled by default based on the Fedora model?
[11:38] <enyc> gdb: I think that the reelase-after-dapper[6.06]  is likely to uinclude some proactive security whatnet.
[11:38] <gdb> Ah, ok, sounds good.
[11:38] <enyc> gdb: I dont know
[11:38] <babyboy> well i changed the users and groups bit like my udername i moved it from the admin group so i cannot do sudo su or login in anywhere as root or use any app..... that reqires root :(
[11:38] <babyboy> any idea?
[11:38] <enyc> gdb: really... 6.06(dapper) is a stable release to keep on suppert
[11:38] <gdb> I come from a Fedora background and I'm checking out Ubuntu because I like the philosophy behind it and the single CD installation.  I'm pretty lost when it comes to managing a Debian-like system, though, so it's all a learning experience for me.

[11:39] <babyboy> i tried that

[11:40] <babyboy> yer cnt i just do what u sed log in as root from recovery and type that command in?
[11:40] <babyboy> that should bring me bak to root priv?
[11:40] <DBO> ompaul, he said it didnt work
[11:40] <gdb> I don't care for Debian's library of CDs and I'm sort of tired of Fedora's development cycle so I'm looking for something I can be comfortable with.  So far, I'm liking Ubuntu and I'm looking forward to it getting up to speed on some of the newer techologies.  And I'm patient about it. :-)
[11:40] <ernie_r> is there a tool in the breezy badger distro that shows info about your ra0 wireless device? in particular, the channel it's currently using?
[11:41] <Ng> babyboy: when you reboot into recovery mode you should jus get a root shell, the command I gave will put your user back into the admin group and let you perform root tasks with your password
=== Brujah [n=Markus@200.63.222.240]  has left #ubuntu ["Kopete] 
[11:41] <babyboy> thank you very much Ng, ompaul and DBO :) much apreciated
[11:41] <ompaul> babyboy, not how I read it, I read he could not carry out root work, and my understanding was that he has not said anything about recovery/single user mode :-)
[11:41] <ompaul> babyboy, last line not for you --- DBO :-) ^^
[11:42] <gdb> Ng: Speaking of that (the question you just answered), is there a write up on configuring the system to enforce entry of the root password when booting to single user mode ala Solaris? "Enter root password for single user mode or press CTRL-D for normal startup: ".
=== bulloc [n=bulloc@44.Red-83-56-35.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:42] <DBO> ompaul, I see, I read it wrong then.  In which case, yes you are right =)  Single user mode ftw here
[11:42] <Ng> gdb: yeah, just set a root password
[11:42] <babyboy> np thank you. :) brb
[11:42] <Ng> !tell gdb about root
[11:42] <gdb> Ng: Ah, ok, so it's already set up that way.  Thanks.
[11:42] <gdb> Yeah, I like how root is locked by default.
[11:42] <gdb> So simply setting a password will cause the system to enforce its entry when booting single user mode.
[11:43] <Ng> gdb: should do, yep. That's a behaviour inherited from Debian
=== zhangxx [n=zhangxx@221.220.214.234]  has joined #ubuntu

[11:43] <blue-frog> looking for someone familiar with timeoutd pls
[11:43] <gdb> Have to find something new to do with it starts to get boring. ;-)
[11:43] <ompaul> gdb, loose the root password and good bye, you are also vunerable to password attacks  on root
[11:44] <Ng> ompaul: good bye?
=== luisito [n=vidalito@250sosua109.codetel.net.do]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:44] <gdb> ompaul: Ah, yes and no. :-)
[11:44] <Ng> ompaul: never passed "init=/bin/sh" to the kernel? ;)
[11:44] <|neo> roryy: it didn't work
[11:44] <ompaul> Ng, loose it and you can't get in well there is that but how do you do that if grub won't let you there :)
[11:44] <gdb> ompaul: I don't allow any incoming network save ssh and I use the AllowUsers directive in sshd_config so it's impossible to log into root from anywhere other than the console or via su so I'm not too concerned about it. :-)
[11:44] <Ng> ompaul: boot grub from a floppy/cd ;)
[11:44] <gdb> That being said, your own account is a root password on ubuntu.
[11:45] <DBO> Ng, at that point why not just modify /etc/shadow with a live cd...
[11:45] <gdb> Since you're in the admin group and they only need know YOUR password to "sudo exec bash --login"
[11:45] <roryy> |neo: perhaps uninstall and reinstall; otherwise i don't have any solution, sorry.
[11:45] <Ng> ompaul: basically you should never assume that you have any real level of security if someone has physical access to the machine
[11:45] <ompaul> Ng, physical access is always a good chance we better all use 2048 bit keys with huge strong passwords quick :-)
=== HymnToLife [n=fkraiem@dyn-213-36-154-13.ppp.tiscali.fr]  has joined #ubuntu

[11:46] <|neo> roryy: i already tryde that i gess i have to reinstall all the operative system
[11:46] <DBO> gdb, you can change that behaviour
[11:46] <Ng> |neo: as in you just erased the init.d script?

=== tuxmaniac [n=aanjhan@60.254.67.17]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:47] <gdb> ompaul: Well, then you're no doubt aware that the risk incurred by setting a root password on an Ubuntu system is extremely small.
[11:47] <ompaul> gdb, and so you walk away from the keyboard and leave an open terminal ;-)
[11:47] <gdb> Madpilot: indeed. lol
[11:47] <racookier> how to change password?
[11:47] <Ng> |neo: you could either download the package manually (packages.ubuntu.com) and unpack it and grab the file by hand, or take a backup of your apache config and documentroot, then remove it with apt-get and the --purge option and re-install it, that should do the trick
[11:47] <|neo> ng : yes  the apache initialization script
[11:47] <gdb> ompaul: I absolutely do when I'm at home.
[11:47] <jhenn> racookier: passwd
[11:47] <gdb> I don't at work, but that has nothing to do with security.
[11:47] <DBO> Ng, the risk isnt external, the risk is PEBCAK...
[11:48] <me> i havea fresh ubuntu
[11:48] <Madpilot> racookier, changing your own pw? System->Admin->Users & Groups
[11:48] <Ng> ompaul: fair enough, I do tend to err on the side of teaching people to suck eggs in here :)
[11:48] <me> why doesnt it have like all the stuff i nee
[11:48] <gdb> It's so Ken Spillman doens't send out an "I'm feeling pretty today!" email to my entire director group.
[11:48] <me> like
[11:48] <me> GCC
[11:48] <me> and stuff already installed
[11:48] <racookier> how to change password?... the root password (by default none)
[11:48] <luisito> I mounted my Kingston memory stick manually in the terminal and then I did rm -r to remove all the files in it. Now ubuntu doesn't mount it automatically when inserted and neither manually. it says that sda1 doesn't exist.!

[11:48] <Madpilot> racookier, you don't need a root pw...

[11:48] <DBO> wait... I didnt mean to say that to ng... *goes back to bed*
[11:48] <racookier> i want to change it
[11:48] <Ng> me: because most people don't need that. Installing the build-essential package will pull in the most useful compilation tools
[11:48] <Madpilot> me, install build-essential for GCC & such
[11:48] <ompaul> !tell racookier about sudo
[11:49] <ompaul> racookier, read that page from the bot, and it will tell you all you want to know
[11:49] <me> Madpilot, ??
[11:49] <blue-frog> gdb you can also use the admin account thru su via a normal account and exit as soon as you are finished
[11:49] <gdb> What's the name of the bot so I can ask it questions directly?
[11:49] <Ng> ubotu
[11:49] <Madpilot> gdb, ubotu
