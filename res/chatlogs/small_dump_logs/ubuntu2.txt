[01:56] <shreezbot> I'm doing an upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10...  My upgrade seems to be stuck at "Processing triggers for man-db"...  Is it normal to sit at this step for a really long time?  How long should I wait?  Is my installation hosed now?
[01:58] <Iszak> shreezbot I would have stayed on 12.04 until 14.04 came out..
[01:59] <shreezbot> Yea, I have a history of making bad decisions...
[02:00] <Beldar> shreezbot, make sure no popups are hiding on the screen.
[02:00] <TJ-> shreezbot: No it isn't normal... but before you do something drastic, open a terminal and check the log files being written by the upgrade process  "ls -latr /var/log/dist-upgrade" for clues as to where it has got stuck

[02:10] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: sounds like its ending lines with \r instead of \n for some reason

[02:14] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: well eol is undefined
[02:16] <shreezbot> Just FYI, there was a hidden window that I could not see through VNC.  I had to log directly into the box to see the hidden window asking if I wanted to restart...  :)
[02:16] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: what terminal are you using?
[02:17] <apb1963> hitsujiTMO: xterm... however, it also happens in a VT with linux term
[02:17] <TJ-> apb1963: lshw does that while it is scanning... did you give it any arguments?
[02:17] <apb1963> TJ-: I tried -class ... makes no difference with or without
[02:19] <TJ-> apb1963: Are the pciid data files installed?
[02:19] <apb1963> TJ-:  no idea
[02:19] <apb1963> TJ-:  how can I tell?
[02:19] <TJ-> apb1963: This might help give you a clue: "strace -o /tmp/lshw.log -f lshw" and then review the log-file from the last entries backwards
[02:21] <apb1963> TJ-:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6671271/
[02:23] <apb1963> I see two interesting lines:  ioctl(2, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, {B38400 opost isig icanon echo ...}) = 0

[02:24] <apb1963> TJ-:  Yes
[02:24] <apb1963> TJ-: Otherwise it just sits forever
[02:24] <apb1963> TJ-: unless maybe I'm just impatient and need to give it more time?  I typically wait about 10 seconds or so... maybe a little more.
[02:24] <TJ-> apb1963: I'm comparing the log file with one generate here .... yours ends just after its finished reading the device descriptions... I see the exact same entries in my log-file... but yours stops just where mine goes on to start scanning the hardware nodes
[02:25] <TJ-> apb1963: More time :)
[02:25] <apb1963> how long?
[02:25] <TJ-> apb1963: Hmmm ... 30 seconds? And run it with that 'strace' command again so we can review what it was doing
[02:26] <apb1963> ok, i'm running it... let me know when you feel it's been long enough :)

[02:39] <Neytiri> how would i specify what ip address to use on a multiple ip system that does redirection and nat
[02:42] <hitsujiTMO> id address for what exactly?
[02:42] <Neytiri> ip*
[02:43] <Neytiri> well i have 4p public ip addresses
[02:43] <Neytiri> and i want to foward traffic on a specific port on address1 to another server
[02:43] <hitsujiTMO> ok, what do you exactly want to specify an ip for and is this a ovh/kimsufi server?
[02:44] <Neytiri> its a ovh server yes
[02:44] <hitsujiTMO> :)
[02:44] <Neytiri> i am using it for ddos protection of my minecraft servers
[02:44] <Neytiri> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 25565 -j DNAT --to-destination 2.4.5.8:25565
[02:45] <Neytiri> that will forward for all of the address on the box
[02:45] <Neytiri> how do i specify jsut 1
[02:46] <hitsujiTMO> Neytiri: if its all the one server then its not going to prevent a ddos attack. but ovh typically have a good enough infrastrcture to minimise ddos attacks at least
[02:46] <Neytiri> i have multiple servers ad different locations
[02:46] <Neytiri> jsut the 1 with ovh that i want to route through for ddos protection
[02:48] <hitsujiTMO> Neytiri: have you configured you network interfaces yet?
[02:49] <Neytiri> yes
[02:49] <Neytiri> the rule i posted works but it does it for all ip addresses
[02:54] <hitsujiTMO> Neytiri: you prob need to specify the external address with -d
[02:55] <hitsujiTMO> Neytiri: this might be of help http://thejimmahknows.com/nat-dynamic-nat-nat-overloadingmasquerade-with-iptables/

[03:55] <Zephree> Looking for a point in the right direction, I have an Ubuntu server with Apache2/PHP5/Postfix, when I run the mail() function in PHP I get the error "sh: 1: /etc/postfix: Permission denied" Any chance you folks know what exactly is producing the error?
[03:56] <cfhowlett> !server|Zephree,
[03:56] <ubottu> Zephree,: Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments, including a server specific !kernel and no !GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current !LTS version is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04) - More info: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition - Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/ - Support in #ubuntu-server
[03:57] <aaas> Zephree seems like the user running the php script (webserver?) doens't have permission to run postfix
[03:57] <Beldar> Viking667, Have you tried saving it in another format? open office and libreo or pretty close to the same in areas the windows version to ubuntu's libreo seems to be a problem. What is your attachment to these docs?
[03:58] <Zephree> aaas: Any pointer on how to check this?
[03:59] <aaas> Zephree run the php script from the command line as a user and then as root see if you get a different error message, not s ure?
[03:59] <Zephree> aaas, Got it, thanks

[04:50] <apb1963> What's the difference between "apt-get install grub-pc linux-image" and "grub-install /dev/sdc && grub-install –recheck /dev/sdc && update-grub" ??
[04:51] <athene_noctua> hi for some reason I just can not get my screen to stop dimming after a certain period of time. I'm running 12.04 with cinnamon as the DE.
[04:51] <thedee> close
[04:52] <athene_noctua> tried looking in dconf-editor and using the gui options to disable the screensaver, etc. I don't want the screen to dim or go to the screen saver at all.
[04:52] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963:  "grub-install /dev/sdc && grub-install –recheck /dev/sdc && update-grub" will fail if you don't have a kernel or grub installed. It installs the grub bootstrap to /dev/sdc and updates the grub config               "apt-get install grub-pc linux-image"   installs grub2 and the kernel
[04:53] <hitsujiTMO> athene_noctua: settings -> brightness & lock.  disable dim screen to save power
=== miliear_ is now known as miliear
[04:56] <athene_noctua> hitsujiTMO: I've already tried disabling everything in there : (
[04:56] <apb1963> hitsujiTMO: OK so if I run "apt-get install grub-pc linux-image" don't I still need to do "update-grub"?
[04:56] <athene_noctua> hitsujiTMO: also looked under power setting and have it set to suspend "never"
[04:57] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: no. grub-pc installs apt hooks that will call update grub after
[04:57] <hitsujiTMO> athene_noctua: not sure then. first person i've heard of with such an issue
[04:57] <apb1963> hitsujiTMO: ok cool.  So how do you know this?  I was unable to find info. like that.
[04:58] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: from doing a hell of a lot of debootstrap installs
[04:58] <apb1963> haha
[04:58] <apb1963> the hand of experience.

=== Jan11 is now known as ON1
[05:00] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: you can also look at the config and post install scripts for grub-pc in /var/lib/dpkg/info if you want to see exactly what it will do
=== Sleepnbum is now known as Guest24163
[05:01] <apb1963> cool.  thank you
[05:08] <apb1963> hitsujiTMO: "it is possible to install GRUB to partition boot records as well, and some appropriate partitions are offered here. However, this forces GRUB to use the blocklist mechanism, which makes it less reliable"  It gives me a choice of: sda, sdc and sdc1...  sda and sdc would be the partitions it does not recommend... yes?  so my best choice is sdc1, the root fs for the new disk I'm installing to?
[05:11] <ouyes> how many of you are not English native speakers?
[05:11] <willbradley> literally nobody
[05:12] <athene_noctua> hitsujiTMO: it's weird, I'm not sure if it's settings that are present in unity conflicting with cinnamon or what . . . I've tried everything I can find in dconf-editor
[05:12] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: installing to a partition is of no benefit. the bios will only start booting from the first bit on the hdd. And installing to a partition who's filesystem uses the first sector (which i'm pretty sure all do) will break that filesystem
[05:13] <ouyes> willbradley, Is English your first language?
[05:14] <willbradley> yup
[05:14] <kostkon> ouyes, and your point is?
[05:16] <ouyes> kostkon, my point is UBUNTU ARE MAINLY BUILD FOR ENGLISH OR PEOPLE SPEAKS ENGLISH.
[05:17] <willbradley> all programming is mainly english
[05:17] <willbradley> Linus Torvalds is Finnish but writes in english
[05:17] <apb1963> hitsujiTMO: OK but my question is in regard to verifying that sda and sdc are in fact the partitions; and therefore my choice should be sdc1.  Am I understanding this correctly?
[05:17] <Pici> uhh
[05:18] <Robipo> ouyes > French here (:
[05:18] <hitsujiTMO> apb1963: sda and sdc aren't partitions. they're drives. sdc1 and sda1 would be partitions. you install grub to a drive not a partition
[05:18] <Pici> ouyes: Ubuntu might be english by default, but there are full translations available for many languages.
[05:19] <Pici> There are also many support channels out there for non-english speakers.
[05:19] <hitsujiTMO> ouyes: some apps are written primarily in other languages and translated to english
[05:19] <apb1963> hitsujiTMO: OK... that's more clear.  So sdc1 would have been the wrong choice. Thank you for the clarification.

[06:07] <Gallomimia_> oh. that's unfortunate
[06:08] <Gallomimia_> got the new kernel working... boot went alright. got a login screen. typed my password and i saw two instances of "report a system problem?" in the upper left corner, followed by a completely black screen, no mousepointer

[06:10] <ouyes> hi guys I got this error msg when I was updating Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/extras.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_main_source_Sources  Hash Sum mismatch
[06:13] <jj_> whats the differenct of debian binary packages and ubuntu binary packages, both are .deb but there's the option to download for debian and a option for ubuntu
[06:13] <Ben64> jj_: one is for debian, the other for ubuntu. using packages for different distros will lead to trouble
[06:16] <jj_> but theyre all .deb D:
[06:16] <Ben64> indeed they are
[06:17] <Gallomimia> hm. same format of file, different dependencies?
[06:18] <Gr4cchus> is GDebi a good program to have incase one has to install some .deb file
[06:18] <Ben64> should be installed by default
[06:19] <Ben64> hmm, maybe not
[06:19] <cfhowlett> Gr4cchus, .deb installs quite easily: sudo dpgk -i filename.deb
[06:19] <Gallomimia> i'm looking for suggestions: i installed kernel 3.12 and rebooted. after a normal looking login screen, i'm now seeing a totally black screen. there were two windows about reporting errors but closing them has left me seeing nothing. perhaps i need to remove catalyst drivers or something? i'm trying to get my radeon HD 7790 to work properly. it was functional but flakey before
[06:20] <Gr4cchus> i tried searching for it through my terminal with find GDebi / and now my terminal is freaking out
[06:21] <Gr4cchus> must of choose a crap way to look for it
[06:21] <Gallomimia> you should probably use find / -name GDebi instead
[06:21] <cfhowlett> Gr4cchus, apt-cache policy gdebi
[06:22] <Gr4cchus> Installed: (none) . So i guess now
[06:22] <olf-folks> how would some one generate keys for /etc/openvpn/keys

[06:31] <duhamel> hello all. I changed my dpi to accomodate a large tv display. I noticed the dpi didn't change in firefox or netflix desktop then i noticed audio wasnt streaming through hdmi when watching netflix or you tube. does anybody have any solution to change firefox dpi specifically.

[07:41] <thom_r> why does copying files to usb take so long? It will start out really fast then come to a crawl after a few seconds.

[07:46] <samdani> whats up
[07:47] <Gallomimia> cfhowlett: well buddy i uninstalled fglrx and related, rebooted, and i can see desktop. the cursor is a bit messed up, and fonts look funny, but at least the computer is usable. now to test it with a game :)
[07:48] <cfhowlett> Gallomimia, best of luck
[07:48] <able> The surface type cover works during install but there is no input after reboot/first launch. can i make grub fall back to the same HID paradigm as setup?
[07:49] <thom_r> are you enabling on screen keyboard in the system settings?
[07:50] <able> im not using an on-screen keybaord
[07:50] <able> keyboard
[07:53] <able> the keyboard is embedded in the cover. works fine during in install, not so much so after booting the installed isystem
[07:53] <able> so i need to tell grub to use that failsafe usb/hid paradigm that setup uses
[07:54] <able> the bug has been there since kernel 3.11
[07:54] <Phlow> Having a kernel panic with 13.10 usb stick install on my MSI GT60 laptop
[07:54] <Phlow> I've got bios set to legacy, fast boot disabled, latest bios... any ideas?
[07:55] <Phlow> oh, and Windows 8 is already installed, wanting dual boot
[07:55] <Gallomimia> aw. looks like my game is running in cpu-rendering mode :(
[07:56] <Gallomimia> well, i need new versions of the video drivers i think
[07:56] <thom_r> Phlow, try remaking the usb. Sometimes they can get messed up while being made, not all the information gets transfered over.
[07:56] <able> Phlow, how does this happen?
[07:57] <thom_r> Phlow, I believe if you want to dual boot, you need to have the computer in UEFI mode. Windows 8 won't boot in Legacy as far as I know.
[07:57] <thom_r> If I'm wrong someone correct me
[07:57] <Phlow> I'll set it back to UEFI after, but I can't boot to USB with UEFI enabled
[07:58] <Phlow> able, I get a screen with some a couple symbols at the bottom (looks normal), then the screen goes black and a moment later a kernel panic
[07:58] <thom_r> then something else is the problem, you should be able to boot Ubuntu un UEFI just fine
[07:58] <Phlow> my usb flash goes right to Win 8 installer if I set UEFI
[07:59] <Phlow> The usb flash was made with the windows usb flash, then I used YUMI to add ubuntu 13.10 iso
[07:59] <Phlow> has worked in the past
[08:00] <Phlow> I'll try to redo the ubuntu iso in YUMI, but I think it's something with the laptop
[08:00] <Phlow> since that's what's new
[08:01] <thom_r> Ok, keep us updated
[08:01] <able> try remaking the install media, if that fails try a different media
[08:01] <paulus68> Phlow: change the iso on the setup USB and try again should be working then I had the same problem
[08:02] <Phlow> paulus68, change the iso as in redo, or a different iso?
[08:02] <thom_r> Phlow, remake the usb, if that usb isn't working try a different usb flash drive
[08:02] <paulus68> phlow: remove the iso from the usb setup and re add it again
[08:03] <Phlow> k, redownloading...
[08:03] <Phlow> in the meantime, there's mention in this thread of an issue with kernel 3.11 and kernel panics:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/1scmzb/install_ubuntu_1310_on_msi_gs70/

[08:58] <clypso> Hello. I have a question regarding terminal command 'file'
[08:58] <pc> "otr set/"
[08:58] <pc> msn
[08:59] <clypso> ?
[08:59] <SaberX01> !details | clypso,
[08:59] <ubottu> clypso,: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[08:59] <Phlow> willbradley, matches
[09:00] <clypso> I have a problem with the terminal command 'file'.  I am trying to view a JPG file but  when i type file bob.jpg it only shows me that its a JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01. Im cerious on how to view the file visually
[09:01] <pc> du /
[09:01] <Ben64> clypso: "file" only tells you about the file, it can't view anything
[09:02] <clypso> Hm. So how would i open the jpeg via terminal ?
[09:02] <Liumeng> how can i get ubuntu's source code
[09:02] <Ben64> clypso: like view it in terminal? you can't really
[09:03] <clypso> so via terminal you cant type a command that would open up the JPEG file ? Not just in a bunch of text
[09:04] <SaberX01> clypso, gnome-open <filename>  .. xdg-open <filename> ... eog -f <filename> etc etc
[09:05] <SaberX01> Like gnome-open ~/Pictures/1.png  .. .. ..
[09:05] <clypso> Now would these commands work in most linux operating systems ? Or is this something you must add to it. i see  i must install it. So typically if i was in some unix based operating system there would be no viewing it. Plus it wouldnt be GUI so how could i right ? So only viewing it in text is possible thru tterminal without additional installations
[09:05] <Ben64> SaberX01: those are all gui
[09:06] <clypso> Ok. makes sense
[09:06] <SaberX01> Of course, you cant' open a binary picture in the terminal.
[09:06] <Ben64> i mean, there are ways, but none are good
[09:06] <clypso> what about executing a script ? or any other type of file ?
[09:07] <SaberX01> Unless your talking about image-magic or other rendering apps, that's different.
[09:07] <SaberX01> clypso, your trying to view the file visually, or modify the file?
[09:07] <clypso> Perhaps both
[09:08] <cristian_c> lol
[09:08] <clypso> Im really dissecting terminal commands and getting to understand Unix in general. Making a switch from windows
[09:08] <clypso> It's quite different
[09:08] <Ben64> this isn't unix
[09:08] <cfhowlett> !source|Liumeng,
[09:08] <ubottu> Liumeng,: You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[09:08] <clypso> Hm. WHats the difference then between linux and unix ? GUI ?
[09:09] <Ben64> and if you're switching from windows, you should install yourself a desktop
[09:09] <Ben64> unix and linux are very different
[09:09] <clypso> Yea i dont want to add anything extra i just want the core of it all and the commands that would work univeraslly on any linux/unix machine
[09:09] <Ben64> !unix
[09:09] <ubottu> UNIX is an operating system created in the '70s, which has many direct derivates and inspired systems like Minix and !Linux. Most "UNIX-style" systems try to somewhat adhere to the POSIX standard.
[09:09] <thom_r> Linux and Unix are not the same thing
[09:09] <cfhowlett> !mini|clypso,
[09:09] <ubottu> clypso,: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want.  The installer is text based (rather than graphical as used on the Desktop DVD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[09:09] <SaberX01> clypso, you can't view binary images in the terminal itself. Image processing and rendering are two different things.
[09:10] <clypso> True. What about executing a file ?
[09:10] <Liumeng> it's so hard to read English docs
[09:11] <clypso> Like a homemmade script i made. Would i just type the script name in and it will execute it ? As long as im within that directory
[09:11] <SaberX01> clypso, yes, many ways of doing that, depending on what your wanting to do.

[09:14] <clypso> I had this idea that all unix/linux had the same commands in their terminal
[09:15] <clypso> Or at least a set of commands thats universal between them. I know some will have extras

[10:16] <cfhowlett> SaberX01, nice.  little different here as I'm on Ubuntustudio which is based on Xubuntu.  Still, I am looking forward to great things.
[10:17] <thom_r> SaberX01, how many servers do you have?
[10:17] <SaberX01> I've not tried any of the 13.x series other than doing ubuntu-qa testing.
[10:17] <SaberX01> thom_r, At home, 6 .. at work, allot.
[10:18] <thom_r> I just have my laptop. I'm getting married in a few months. I would like to set up an email server after we're together
[10:18] <SaberX01> thom_r, have 12.04 server on an HP-Mini, VIA C7 single core .. :-) runs all my VCS (bzr, hg, git, svn) etc.
[10:18] <thom_r> nice
[10:19] <SaberX01> The server installs are my fav by far, that + tasksel adn can get whatever I want.
[10:19] <thom_r> is it possible to have a tower as a media center and email server at the same time?
[10:20] <SaberX01> Definately.
[10:20] <cfhowlett> thom_r, sure, so long as your hardware can handle the load
[10:20] <SaberX01> Relly depends on how many users are hitting the server at one time, but one both can have loads of servers on it.
[10:20] <thom_r> ok
[10:21] <SaberX01> *one box ..
[10:21] <thom_r> it will just be me and my wife hitting the server.
[10:21] <SaberX01> Run just abotu whatever you like then.
[10:21] <thom_r> when that day comes I will need help setting it up
[10:21] <SaberX01> But I will say, Devcot + Postfix is not for the faint at heart .. that's setup is no joke.
[10:22] <SaberX01> thom_r, Start reading now then for the Email server, that's probably the hardest of all servers, that or maybe Bin9 aka DNS ..
[10:23] <SaberX01> *Bind9
[10:25] <SaberX01> thom_r, Here's a short how too: https://www.exratione.com/2012/05/a-mailserver-on-ubuntu-1204-postfix-dovecot-mysql/
[10:25] <thom_r> thanks
[10:25] <SaberX01> Dont thank me yet, you not looked at it .. LOL
[10:27] <SaberX01> thom_r, the introduction states: Building a Linux mailserver from scratch to your own liking is a painful process unless you happen to be one of the few folk who do that day in and day out - there's no way around that fact.
[10:27] <thom_r> I'm browsing it now
[10:28] <thom_r> this sort of information will be good to know
[10:28] <thom_r> I bookmarked it
[10:28] <SaberX01> Indeed, he goes into allot of detail .. where allot of the other How-To's do not, + has Spam and antivirus stuff too, which is a must really.
[10:28] <vmuser> Any ideas where to start with not working bluetooth on 13.10 ?

[10:31] <SoulRaven> hello
[10:31] <SoulRaven> please help me
[10:31] <thom_r> what is your problem
[10:31] <SoulRaven> i have some problems with config the snmpd to be accesibile from outside
[10:31] <SoulRaven> i have configure the firewall, i have remove 127.0.0.1 from default/snmp
[10:32] <SoulRaven> also i have create a new comunity with the ip of the external server
[10:32] <SoulRaven> but still nothing
[10:32] <SoulRaven> i can't access the server from outside
[10:33] <paulus68> soulraven can it be that your router prevents access to your server
[10:33] <SoulRaven> i don't hve any router, i am on dedicated server
[10:34] <paulus68> ok was just a thought
[10:34] <vmuser> cfhowlett, yea that one is nice, but when it's not woking what to do :)
[10:34] <vmuser> i don't have output on hcitool dev
[10:34] <SaberX01> SoulRaven, your dedicated server is at home or is it one your rent somewhere?
[10:34] <vmuser> however the device is visible on lsusb

[10:36] <patthebaker> Hi All and Happy New Year
[10:36] <SaberX01> SoulRaven, and how are you trying to access the Server?
[10:36] <thom_r> patthebaker, hello
[10:37] <patthebaker> I need a little bit help to understand and setup one thing
[10:37] <thom_r> ok
[10:37] <patthebaker> i havbe setup a VPS for learning
[10:37] <patthebaker> i have instelled LAMP and FTP
[10:37] <patthebaker> all is ok so far
[10:38] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1601619477
[10:38] <patthebaker> i have instelled wordpress but when i want update wordpress i need to provide FTP details
[10:38] <patthebaker> how to setup my server so i don't have to do this
[10:39] <SaberX01> SoulRaven, those are routing tables. How are you trying to connect from outside ?
[10:39] <SoulRaven> snmpwalk -v2c -c public my_snmp_ip
[10:41] <SaberX01> SolarisBoy, sri, but I've not used SNMPWALK before, for that you many need to ask in #ubuntu-server.
[10:41] <SaberX01> SoulRaven, that was for you .. not SolarisBoy  .. my bad.
[10:42] <SaberX01> patthebaker, how do you want to update your Wordpress ?
[10:43] <Abhijit> hi
[10:44] <SolarisBoy> SaberX01: is that IP directly connected to the internet or is there an intermediary device at your hosting site? (ip of the server running snmp).
[10:45] <SaberX01> SolarisBoy, He said it's a rented server, so Im assuming it's an external IP from somwhere.
[10:45] <Abhijit> is it possible to just import the existing linux encrypted lvm partition information and using that info install ubuntu on that encrypted lvm? without damaging any data in /home?
[10:45] <SaberX01> SolarisBoy, This not my issue, was SoulRaven having the problem.
[10:46] <SolarisBoy> SaberX01: yep just noticed. - that was for SoulRaven
[10:46] <SaberX01> Sometime <tab> not a good idea :-)
[10:46] <SolarisBoy> SoulRaven: is the external IP the IP of the server or is that just being routed through NAT or something (likely case)?
[10:47] <SaberX01> He was in #ubuntu-server asking a moment ago.
[10:47] <SolarisBoy> if the latter are you certain that there is an allownace on the f/w for SNMP communication?
[10:47] <SolarisBoy> ahh

[10:48] <SaberX01> Abhijit, while it may be possible, I'm not sure of the sucess rate, Iv'e never tried to do that, especially with encrypted partitions.

[10:48] <W4RH4WK> hi there, anyone else's unity panel clock gone, since the year changed, restarting the unity panel services does not work anymore
[10:49] <SaberX01> Abhijit, I would set up the new drive on it's own, then do an rsync / zsync using the access credentials to get the data.

[10:50] <ServerSage> So I have a 5 disk RAID5 array that is currently rebuilding at 36M/sec, which seems slow to me.  I've set the read-ahead to 32MiB, the strip_cache_size to 32768, the speed_limit_min to 100000, max to 400000.  I have tried disabling NCQ on all the drives in the array, but 36M/sec seems the most I can get.  Anything I'm missing?
[10:51] <SaberX01> ServerSage, HW or SW RAID?
[10:51] <ServerSage> SaberX01: mdadm SW RAID
[10:52] <SaberX01> Still seems slow though ..
[10:52] <andyfied> i've been having the same problem with my mdadm raid5
[10:52] <ServerSage> andyfied: I guess misery loves company.  Hehe.
[10:53] <ServerSage> Anybody know if you can enable bitmap on a live array while it's rebuilding? :)
[10:53] <andyfied> i've had other issues with segfaults so it's low priority :p
[10:54] <SaberX01> ServerSage, Actually, having said that, 36M/second, is like 2100+ MB per minute, that's not too bad really on a rebuild.
[10:55] <Abhijit> SaberX01, ok. thansk.
[10:55] <andyfied> ServerSage: i think it's not so bad for a rebuild, but that's also me read speed where the single OS drive happily reads 100/s
[10:55] <SaberX01> I've tested mdadm offline, all my real RAID arrays are HW arrays.
[10:56] <ServerSage> SaberX01: It's a home server, HW RAID would be silly over kill.  lol
[10:56] <SaberX01> LOL well MegaRAID cards pretty cheap these days
[10:56] <SaberX01> But yes, point taken.
[10:57] <patthebaker> SaberX01: if i want update wordpress OR install a plugin on wordpress or do any work on any CMS i need manually give FTP detail. On my sharing hosting i don't have to do this
[10:57] <yudhi> can one help me in understanding the difference between... Ubuntu / Debian / Linux / Unix...
[10:58] <ServerSage> SaberX01: Your idea of "pretty cheap" and mine must be vastly different.
[10:58] <thom_r> yudhi, Ubuntu is based on Debian, which is a Linux operating system. Unix is something different.
[10:59] <yudhi> @thom_r thanks..
[11:02] <SaberX01> ServerSage, I'ts all relative I suppose ..  : -)
[11:02] <punzilla> Hi there.
[11:02] <SaberX01> patthebaker, I do my updates etc on my home dir, then copy them over and change permissions, then use WP for updates after that.
[11:03] <cfhowlett> punzilla, greetings
[11:03] <Utopu> Can you help me, I have 50 messages "http cache starting" with ubuntu server. how to remove it?
[11:03] <ServerSage> SaberX01: True, a MegaRAID controller is cheap compared to a maserati.
[11:03] <punzilla> happy new year all, I need some assistance with my joypad please.
[11:03] <punzilla> Today I have purchased a steam game 'Mark of the Ninja'.
[11:03] <bekks> Utopu: Where do you have those messages?
[11:04] <punzilla> and it is compatible with the X-box controller (which I have a Logitech Rumblepad 2).
[11:04] <Utopu> bekks: in messages at boot
[11:04] <SaberX01> patthebaker, something like: sudo rsync -avP ~/wordpress/ /var/www/  .. then  ... sudo chown www-data:www-data * -R && sudo usermod -a -G www-data <username>
[11:04] <bekks> Utopu: Sounds like you have a squid server running then.
[11:04] <punzilla> I have downloaded jstest-gtk and have attempted to re-map the controller to match that of the x-box configuration.
[11:04] <punzilla> Though the settings haven't stuck.
[11:05] <patthebaker> SaberX01: should i setup Apache to use CGI ? I googled this minute ago
[11:05] <Utopu> bekks: squid is not installed :/
[11:05] <punzilla> and I have also tried downloading qjoypad, which doesn't work despite me downloading it from the ubunty repositories.
[11:06] <punzilla> I need help to re-map my joypad controller configuration please.
[11:06] <SaberX01> patthebaker, I dont do any special configs for that.
[11:06] <bekks> patthebaker: I'd not use CGI, since PHP over CGI is a real mess. Use Apache2.
[11:06] <SaberX01> patthebaker, Simply install the LAMP package and run form there.
[11:06] <bekks> Utopu: How did you check?
[11:06] <Utopu> apt-get remove squid :')
[11:07] <punzilla> I'm using ubuntu 13.10
[11:07] <bekks> Utopu: What if I tell you that there is a package named squid3? :P
[11:07] <Utopu> apt-get remove squid* :')
[11:07] <bekks> Utopu: dpkg -l | grep squid
[11:08] <Utopu> squid-deb-proxy and squid3
[11:08] <Utopu> how is this possible? O.oo
[11:08] <bekks> Utopu: Pastebin the entire output please.
[11:09] <bekks> !pastebinit | Utopu
[11:09] <ubottu> Utopu: pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the « pastebinit » package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com

[11:41] <cfhowlett> narcos, best to ask the #debian channel
[11:41] <SaberX01> narcos, Indeed it does, I can't recall when exactly they went to python2.7 but been a while.
[11:42] <narcos> I can install the package with 'pip install mitmproxy', but trying 'apt-get install mitmproxy' throws an error about a syntax error, as it's using something not supported in 2.6.

[12:08] <thom_r> what seems to be your problem
[12:09] <Gallomimia> well, time to work on some video drivers :/
[12:09] <Gallomimia> i guess i might not have much success if i'm doing it remotely
[12:09] <Korkel> My wifi connection is dropping away, the only a reboot is getting the network back. When I restart, it takes for 30/45 seconds, when my pc is started to get connected.
[12:09] <bekks> Gallomimia: Depends on what you are doing and what you are expecting.
[12:09] <thom_r> korkel, are you sure you have the correct wifi driver installed?
[12:09] <Gallomimia> i've got a radeon and the support has been less than useful for me
[12:09] <SaberX01> Gallomimia, makes a bit tougher that's for sure
[12:10] <Korkel> Thom_r, no idea, how can I see that?

=== zenix`away is now known as zenix`
[12:32] <universal> SaberX01: what I know is that 1st I should safely remove a device and then detach/remove/disconnect it, so I first unmount/eject the mobile filesystem in nautilis and then go for wifi disconnection but the moment I hit eject/unmount button in nautilis, whole system freezes
[12:33] <universal> so I don not kill/stop the ftp server on mobile before unmount/eject on laptop
[12:33] <universal> SaberX01: ^^
[12:34] <SaberX01> universal, I don;t think it should freeze like that either way. Try dumping the WiFI first then, but it's should not be doing that.

[12:38] <SaberX01> universal, I know that you can show is. ALl the bugs Im finding are fairly old. What Ubuntu version is on the laptop?

I have a laptop with Ubuntu OS version 13.10 saucy and BCM 4313 wifi chip with wl driver. the mobile is android 2.3.6. what I do is either I open a hotspot on mobile and connect my laptop to it or I connect both the laptop and mobile to a router. then I install a ftp server on mobile and connect my laptop to it by opening it in nautilis. all this time everything is good and mobile file syste
[12:48] <universal> but in the end when I 1st unmount/eject the mobile file system in nautilis so as to close the ftp server afterwards and then disconnect the wifi later on, the moment I hit the umount/eject button laptop freezes and nothing works, I have to hen manually reboot the system from power button

[13:05] <universal> SaberX01: ok
[13:05] <bekks> universal: And another thing you could try is to look at the logs after rebooting after the lockup.

[13:09] <Temp_o_Rary> im willing to, and i wrote some of the details into the paste
[13:10] <bekks> Temp_o_Rary: If you issued the command in your paste, chmod -R ... - you entirely messed up your system.
[13:10] <OerHeks> Temp_o_Rary, so you performed something with -R chmod 0770 ? time to reinstall
[13:10] <universal> bekks: SaberX01 MonkeyDust I'm connecting my android to my laptop over wifi and running the ftp server on mobile, now what to ? suggest plz
[13:10] <Temp_o_Rary> okay
[13:10] <bekks> Temp_o_Rary: The only thing to do is to backup files you need, and reinstall.
[13:10] <Temp_o_Rary> no way of repair
[13:10] <Temp_o_Rary> okay
[13:10] <streulma> hello, happy new year to all. I can't install Ubuntu on my Macbook Pro 5.2. I have dual Nvidia graphics. I get a black screen by boot, can't boot from BIOS mode, even black screen by EFI mode. EFI boots with nomodeset in prompt.
[13:10] <SaberX01> Temp_o_Rary, indeed as bekks said, is in bad shape, you could spend months trying to reconfigure permissions
[13:10] <d3bug> it would be nice if someone would come up with a script to fix permissions... kind of like what they have on Mac.
[13:11] <SaberX01> Temp_o_Rary, is this a dual boot system ?
[13:11] <Temp_o_Rary> Yes.. i also have windows
[13:11] <SaberX01> universal, use the terminal and ftp connect to the Android
[13:11] <rcw2> is k3b pretty reliable for extracting music from cd's (even if they are scratched)?  i want to be able to rip and throw away the disks
[13:12] <universal> SaberX01: ftp connect command ?
[13:12] <SaberX01> Temp_o_Rary, Unless you have critical files, which could be backed up, I'd reinstall the UB side of the dual boot.
[13:12] <universal> SaberX01: do i have to install ftp client ?
[13:12] <d3bug> Temp_o_Rary:  just so you know "-R" tells chmod to change permissions recursively (from current directory all the way down)...
[13:12] <OerHeks> rcw2, strange way to measure reliability k3b with scratched cd's
[13:14] <husamas> hello and happy new year
[13:14] <rcw2> OerHeks, k3b could have a reputation for doing well with scratched cd's.
[13:14] <husamas> I did a release upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10 over a month ago ... everything is fine except that I havent received any update since then ... I am wondering is the update system kinda idle, or I have some problem in my apt-get? I tried everything from runnign apt-get clean to changing repo urls to point to different countries but nothing happened
[13:14] <bekks> rcw2: It depends on the scratches, like for every other application.
[13:14] <bekks> husamas: Did you run sudo apt-get update yet?
[13:15] <rcw2> scratches aside, is k3b known for doing well with cd's
[13:15] <husamas> bekks , yes many times
[13:15] <bekks> husamas: Pastebin the entire output please.
[13:15] <bekks> !pastebinit | husamas
[13:15] <ubottu> husamas: pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the « pastebinit » package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com
[13:15] <universal> SaberX01: how to ftp connect from terminal ?
[13:16] <ObrienDave> husamas, try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[13:16] <husamas> ok just a minute please
[13:16] <SaberX01> universal, In terminal. It's too much to type here line for line, here's a simple how to you can test with: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/FTP-3.html
[13:17] <universal> SaberX01: ftpubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ftp --help ftp: -: unknown option ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ftp 192.168.1.4:2121 ftp: 192.168.1.4:2121: Name or service not known ftp> ^C ftp>
[13:17] <SaberX01> universal, You will need the IP and Port number from the android, which im not sure wehre that comes from erxactly, never owned an Android.
[13:17] <d3bug> Temp-o-Rary... you have a whisper.
[13:18] <SaberX01> universal, just ftp    then .. open .. then IP:PORT
[13:18] <husamas> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6673072/
[13:18] <husamas> that was for apt-get update
[13:18] <universal> ok
[13:19] <llutz> universal: ftp host port     not ftp host:port
[13:19] <husamas> no errors or anything ... everything's working even installing new packages but never an update is available
[13:19] <bekks> husamas: And whats the output of "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"?
[13:20] <husamas> bekks it says no packages are available for update ... same as apt-get upgrade
[13:20] <husamas> bekks,
[13:20] <husamas> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[13:20] <universal> SaberX01: llutz ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ftp ftp> 192.168.1.4:2121 ?Invalid command ftp> open 192.168.1.4:2121 ftp: 192.168.1.4:2121: Name or service not known ftp> open (to) 192.168.1.4 ftp: connect: Connection refused ftp> open (to) 192.168.1.4:2121 ftp: 192.168.1.4:2121: Name or service not known ftp> 192.168.1.4 2121 ?Invalid command ftp> open (to) 192.168.1.4 2121 Connected to 192.168.1.4. 220 GnFtp 1.1 ready Name (192.168.1.4:ubuntu):
[13:20] <universal> now what ?
[13:21] <bekks> universal: Use a pastebing please.
[13:21] <universal> ok
[13:21] <bekks> universal: Its completely unreadable.
[13:21] <universal> ok
[13:21] <[[a]> Hello everybody, is it possible to ping a wireless laptop from LAN computer in Ubuntu?
[13:21] <husamas> [[a], ofcourse just open a terminal and use ping ip_address
[13:21] <llutz> universal: read your paste. it asks for a "name" so login
[13:21] <d3bug> [[a] doesn't matter if it's wireless or wired...
[13:22] <llutz> universal: "man ftp" gives you an idea about the commands you can use
[13:22] <universal> llutz: what name ? there is not username or password, should I write anonymous ?
[13:22] <ObrienDave> husamas, do you have "download and install automatically" enabled?
[13:23] <husamas> ObrienDave,
[13:23] <husamas> Where can I find that option sir?
[13:24] <ObrienDave> look under software & updates. i run xubuntu, yours might be in a different place
[13:24] <[[a]> husama, d3bug, my comuter IP is 192.168.1.1. When I ping the other computer from my teminal using "ping -c 5 192.168.1.100" (knowing that I have the laptop in front of me right now) => it says 100% packets loss, why is that?
[13:25] <[[a]> something to do with UFW or ARO?
[13:25] <d3bug> ummm... what is your router IP?
[13:25] <husamas> ObrienDave,
[13:25] <husamas> No I have it set to Display Immediately
[13:25] <ObrienDave> hmm
[13:25] <[[a]> router IP 192.168.1.1, my comp IP ; 192.168.1.102. Laptop IP : 192.168.1.100
[13:27] <d3bug> [[a] talk in whisper... too much junk on my screen
[13:27] <[[a]> err..something to do with UFW or ARP ? i mean iptavkes
[13:27] <[[a]> ok
[13:27] <husamas> I noticed something strange after doing the release upgrade ... now when I run apt-get clean then apt-get update the repos are being hit ... I think it should redownload the metadata because a clean was run ... that's how this has always worked for me
[13:27] <OerHeks> [[a], try "ping -c 5 192.168.1.102" as you have no client @ *.*.*.100
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[13:30] <[[a]> OerHeks,  "ping -c 5 192.168.1.102" it works packets have been sent, but w/ .100 => Loss = 100%
[13:30] <husamas> What makes it even stranger is that the package system works for installing new packages ... it feels like apt is stuck in a time point ... does anybody know of a new cache layer that has been recently added to the apt repo metadata?
[13:33] <SaberX01> husamas, Nothing on 12.04 or 14.04 that I know of, my local mirrors working as expected. You do an autoclean && clean && update ?
[13:34] <[[a]> Anyway, is it possible to kill a process in local ip address along with its MAC address?
[13:35] <lotuspsychje> [[a]: man kill
[13:38] <bekks> [[a]: What is "a process in local ip address along with its MAC address"?

[13:41] <cthulhu318> join #security
[13:41] <[[a]> bekks, let me rephrase the question in a proper way: Having two computers (1 Desktop Ubuntu, 1 Laptop WIN7). Is it possible to kill a process of a given running service on WIN7 such as Skype, knowing that I have its local IP address along with its MAC address for the WIN7?
[13:42] <bekks> [[a]: Using MS RPC, that may be possible, but isnt an Ubuntu issue.

[13:51] <husamas1310> bekks, is it possible that my packages are actually up  to date and it's just a nasty coincidence that not a singe update have been release for my package selections?
[13:51] <bekks> wwq: Which is not related to 13.10 kernel versions :)
[13:51] <bekks> husamas1310: Yes.

[13:53] <zakmc> no proxy settings, network is working, i can apt-get install whatever I want
[13:53] <SaberX01> Latest 13.10 UB Signed Kernsl pgk: 3.11.0.14.15
[13:54] <husamas1310> bekks, if you run apt-get clean then apt-get update why all repos are being [hit]?
[13:54] <bekks> husamas1310: BEcause all repo index files are being fetched again?
[13:54] <bekks> wwq: Forget about www.kernel.org when talking about the kernel versions in the Ubuntu repos :)
[13:55] <husamas1310> bekks, they should not be hit because hit means that a local version of the repo metadata is up to date but that's impossible after an apt-get clean ... there simply should not be a local version
[13:55] <zakmc> sudo add-apt-repository -m ppa does not give anymore info
[13:55] <bekks> husamas1310: Why shouldnt they be hit to update the repo index copy that is stored locally? Why is that a problem for you?
[13:56] <Seveas> zakmc: which ppa are you trying to add?
=== sileht_ is now known as sileht
[13:56] <Seveas> zakmc: it should be something like: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:username/ppaname

[13:57] <wwq> 哦
[13:58] <bekks> husamas1310: Please read http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get and the clean option description to see that "clean" doesnt affect metadata at all.
[13:58] <zakmc> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager
[13:58] <husamas1310> bekks, when apt-get displays [hit] it mean that the local version is already there ... when it's absent or old apt-get will print [Get] with some progress bar ... for me, a way to force apt-get to re-fetch repos metadata was to run apt-get clean .. that makes the local metadata disapper and all repos show [Get] ... this behavior is missing now ... for me at least
[13:58] <bekks> husamas1310: See above.

[14:01] <cuddylier> If I've blocked UDP with this command: iptables -A INPUT -p udp -j DROP and iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -j DROP how would I allow a certain IP and Port to use UDP?
[14:01] <cuddylier> I've googled it a ton and came to a dead end.
[14:01] <Seveas> cuddylier: that's a horrible idea. You have now broken dns resolution.
[14:01] <husamas1310> bekks, sorry I'm not a native English speaker .. the man say "Clears out the local repository of retrieved package files" this looks vague to me ... it doesnt mention metadata. thanks for your help
[14:02] <cuddylier> Seveas I have the allow ones too, I just didn't paste them

[14:03] <Seveas> same for -A OUTPUT -d ip.here ....
[14:03] <cuddylier> Is there anyway to specify a port?
[14:03] <cuddylier> As I don't want to allow it for the whole IP or am I forced to?
[14:03] <Seveas> yes, --dport or --sport

[14:25] <SaberX01> tricksy, in the future, you may want to employ this, or a similar .Trash alternative: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/02/make-rm-move-files-to-trash-instead-of.html
[14:25] <bekks> tricksy: You have to resetup everything that was using stuff in there.
[14:26] <rcw2> tricksy, there might be a program to restore
[14:26] <rcw2> tricksy, as long as you don't overwrite
[14:26] <Autoclesis> Pointless berating by a bot does is not conducive to learning.
[14:26] <Autoclesis> -does
[14:26] <tricksy> rcw2:  yes, i'll resetup everything
[14:26] <glitsj16> rcw2: rubyripper preferences > toc analysis shows a msg too, did you check the prefs yet?
[14:26] <SaberX01> There is, but it does nto always work, especially if data has been written there after: http://www.ubuntumanual.org/posts/357/recover-your-deleted-files-in-ubuntu
[14:26] <Autoclesis> At any rate ... "Someone describe their experiences with GMapCatcher" please
[14:26] <curiousx> aloha all
[14:27] <curiousx> happy christmas
[14:27] <Seveas> zakmc: hmm, that doesn't give any clue :( Which version of Ubuntu are you on?
[14:27] <curiousx> :p
[14:27] <curiousx> thappy new year -.-
[14:27] <curiousx> i meant
[14:27] <tricksy> rcw2:  but only creating www in /var isnt coming out to be the soln
[14:27] <Autoclesis> hny curiousx
[14:27] <zakmc> Seveas, 13.10 no_nb locale
[14:27] <tricksy> i am not able to create symlinks in /var/www now
[14:27] <Seveas> xro: yes, select "common" in the list on the left side and scroll down a bit
[14:27] <curiousx> ty auto
[14:27] <tricksy> rcw2:  i am not able to create symlinks in /var/www now
[14:27] <bekks> tricksy: Why not?
[14:27] <curiousx> anyone has 7.1 on ubuntu?
[14:27] <rcw2> glitsj16,   do you recommend any particular settings for TOC Analysis?  what does that even do for me?  is that cddb?
[14:28] <curiousx> i meant successfuly working
[14:28] <rcw2> related to cddb*
[14:28] <rcw2> tricksy, did you get the data back?  wasn't that your first goal
[14:28] <bekks> rcw2: No he didnt. HE had no backup.
[14:28] <zakmc> Seveas, I tried add-apt-repository -m ppa:... but got no more info than the original command
[14:29] <curiousx> i cant get it :p i a only was able to hear from 5.1 but in the setting i had configure it to 7.1 -.-
[14:29] <tricksy> rcw2: i didnt have much data in /var/www
[14:29] <rcw2> photorec?
[14:29] <tricksy> rcw2:  i can manage once i regain access to /var/www
[14:29] <bekks> tricksy: You have access to /var/www.
[14:29] <SaberX01> zakmc, while searching the problem, see several posts of the same ting, in both 13.10 and 14.04 that -m switch not providing additional data, and PPS not being added.
[14:30] <bekks> tricksy: It exists, you can enter it.
[14:30] <curiousx> if anyone has 7.1 please help me :p otherwise ill wait here for new users to join :D
[14:30] <SaberX01> *PPA not PPS
[14:30] <tricksy> rcw2:  so i tried to recreate a folder named www in/var
[14:30] <bekks> tricksy: Every symlink to stuff which was in there will not work, since there is no content anymore.
[14:30] <tricksy> bekks:   but my symlinks are all broken in the new folder that i created
[14:30] <tricksy> bekks: i recreated the symlinks
[14:31] <glitsj16> rcw2: no cddb is the freedb tab, toc analysis is to make a cue sheet of the rip
[14:31] <bekks> tricksy: Of course they are. All symlinks to content in /var/ww are broken since there is no content anymore.
[14:31] <SaberX01> probably owner:group issue with www-data
[14:31] <bekks> tricksy: Regardless of wether yoiu recreated the symlinks. That wont magically restore content.
[14:31] <glitsj16> rcw2: so if you don't need that try setting prefs for toc analysis off, uncheck everything you can
[14:32] <curiousx> exist #alsa chanel?
[14:32] <curiousx> or pulse?
[14:32]  * Autoclesis despairs, starts drinking

[14:32] <cuddylier> Seveas: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6673305/
[14:32] <tricksy> bekks: i used sudo ln -s projects /var/www
[14:32] <ObrienDave> Autoclesis, use a funnel, it works better ;P
[14:32] <bekks> tricksy: Why sudo?
[14:32] <zakmc> SaberX01, I have noticed several posts to the problem, but no solution
[14:32] <Autoclesis> tee hee
[14:33] <Seveas> zakmc: time for some deeper debugging. edit /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/softwareproperties/ppa.py as root, and add a new line between 326 and 327 with just the word 'raise' (no quotes, indented 8 spaces). Then run it again
[14:33] <bekks> tricksy: And did you fix the permissions of /var/www after creating it?
[14:33] <tricksy> bekks:  shouldn't this make a copy of projects in /var/www and create a symlink pointed to it
[14:33] <SaberX01> zakmc, same here, nobody has posted the reason nor solution that I could find.
[14:33] <bekks> tricksy: No.
[14:33] <tricksy> bekks: yes, i gave it 777
[14:33] <bekks> ln -s whatever /foo/bar will create a symlink named whatever in the current directory which points to /var/www
[14:34] <Seveas> cuddylier: you really seem to have trouble following simple instructions... that's not what I asked for.
[14:34] <bekks> ln -s whatever /foo/bar will create a symlink named whatever in the current directory which points to /foo/bar
[14:34] <rcw2> glitsj16, i unchecked create cuesheet, and now hangs at Starting to rip track 1, trial #1
[14:34] <cuddylier> Seveas: Oh, I'm sorry. What did you ask for? I thought iptables --list?
[14:34] <d3bug> bekks... OMFG!!! dude, you should never link to /foo/bar   :P
[14:34] <Seveas> cuddylier: iptables -L -v -n
[14:34] <bekks> tricksy: 777 messes up permissions on /var/www - use 755 and www-data:www-data as owner.
[14:34] <bekks> d3bug: Why?
[14:34] <bekks> d3bug: Did you ever heard of directory symlinks?
[14:35] <d3bug> that's like linking to /dev/zero and trying to divide it... you didn't know?
[14:35] <bekks> d3bug: You talking nonsense, sorry.

[14:37] <cuddylier> Okay thanks.
[14:37] <tricksy> bekks:  what is the correct way to create a symlink? Will i have to separately copy folders into /var/www and then create a sym-link?
[14:38] <BLZbubba> ok I think I found the nvidia_drv.so symlink problem - the nvidia_vdpau 32 bit alternative is afu
[14:38] <BLZbubba> is it possible to have it skip the 32 bit symlink?

[14:42] <Guest27014> SaberX01, Unsettings is set for the icons to be off and they are still there. On the site you sent me there is an option for command line but the commands are to show the icons not get rid of them. I used Pastebin to show you the commands on the site here: http://pastebin.com/Rq7TXtkx  Is it possible for me to make where it says visible invisible instead? would that be a legit Linux command?
[14:42] <Seveas> zakmc: please run this command and pastebin the output: echo '' | openssl s_client -connect launchpad.net:443
[14:42] <Seveas> zakmc: also: dpkg -l ca-certificates
[14:43] <ObrienDave> Guest27014, try the commands using 'false'
[14:43] <SaberX01> Guest27014, if you dont want the icons, true should be false I would think, tough I have not tried it personally.
[14:44] <glitsj16> rcw2: well you saw the factoids about PPA's and the warnings, but you can download the .deb without adding the ppa to test if it works for you from https://launchpad.net/~brandonsnider/+archive/ruby-ripper/+packages

[14:45] <SaberX01> BLZbubba, Im not up to speed on vid-drivers but other here are, if someone knows, they will chime in.

[14:49] <hello> hey i need help can any one please give me some minutes ?

[14:50] <BLZbubba> SaberX01: does ubuntu do separate 386 and x86_64 packages or is there a setting somewhere?  it looks like nvidia-304 owns both the 32 and 64 bit libraries so there is hopefully a way to turn off i386 hidden somewhere
[14:50] <bekks> Guest66334: Which installation directory?
[14:50] <bekks> universal: Where is it mounted to?

[15:26] <xxmate> yeah, i tried sudo rm -rf or -f /var/lib/dpkg
[15:26] <Guest18767> SaberX01, sorry i took so long to come back. I tried the commands and I couldn't get it to work. I pasted the commands I used into the pastebin here along with an error I got : http://pastebin.com/u9dXbn6H

[15:27] <ChogyDan> xxmate: well, sorry, but that was stupid  :(   why did you do that?
[15:27] <ChogyDan> xxmate: I think you have to reinstall
[15:27] <xxmate> probably i saw something to do that on website
[15:27] <azamat> curiousx, it actually was okay on ubuntu 12.10

[15:29] <SaberX01> Guest18767, It would appear you dont have that particular Icon.  Other that what we posted, I dont know what else you could try.

[15:30] <cuddylier> Seveas: See the rules we set, was the IP 185.28.189.136 meant to be the remote IP rather than the IP on the actual box that was being connected to?
[15:30] <cuddylier> As that IP is an IP on the box with port 25579
[15:30] <Guest18767> SaberX01, the No such key 'computer-icon-visible' message confused me because the computer icon is there. The other commands didn't throw an error they went through, they just didnt work

[15:31] <curiousx> sry azamat but idk, i meant i could suggest you a couple of posible solution but... maybe the people here might get mad at me :p
[15:31] <Autoclesis> Will GlobalSat work with Viking?
[15:32] <bekks> Autoclesis: How is that related to Ubuntu?
[15:32] <Autoclesis> Viking is an Ubuntu application on the Ubuntu Store.
[15:32] <Autoclesis> A GPS program.
[15:33] <bekks> Autoclesis: And whats Globalsat?
[15:33] <Autoclesis> A GPS receiver.
[15:33] <bekks> Autoclesis: Thats a good question for the Viking support then.
[15:33] <Autoclesis> Viking seems only to recognize Garmin and a few others...
[15:33] <Autoclesis> lol
[15:33] <Autoclesis> It is, indeed.
[15:33] <curiousx> azamat, and the other solution could be trying out the saucy-oibaf-ppa -.-
[15:34] <Autoclesis> So you're assertion is, it's an Ubuntu program, but the query is not Ubuntu-related?
[15:34] <Autoclesis> your, rather.
[15:34] <user1> hey

[15:34] <user1> XD im on a DELL XPS 630 i
[15:35] <BLZbubba> and i'm thinking the alternatives log cuts off each line so it really ran properly but didn't log the whole command
[15:35] <user1> i love it for 200 dollars
[15:35] <bekks> Autoclesis: Imagine driving a Ford - although it is a car, a BMW garage may not fit your needs in helping you.
[15:36] <SaberX01> BLZbubba, your graphics working ok ?
[15:36] <Autoclesis> That's a fitting analogy to you?
[15:36] <bekks> Autoclesis: Yes.
[15:36] <Autoclesis> Fascinating.

[15:43] <Darksonn> Hi, I started ubuntu 13 without installing from an usb on a computer that has windows 7 because I couldn't start windows, after ubuntu started, i looked at the harddrive, it is not listed under df, in /dev, the only drive with partitions (sda, has sda1) is the sub i booted from, so I can't see the partitions on hard drive, I'm guessing it can't read the partition table on the pc. Anyone know how I would get access to files on the d
[15:44] <bekks> Darksonn: Which Ubuntu 13 - 13.04 or 13.10?
[15:44] <curiousx> azamat, oh! sry they didnt have an ubuntu 13.10 installer :p  https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/2013/intelr-graphics-installer-1.0.2-linux
[15:44] <bekks> Darksonn: If you couldnt read the partition table, you would be unable to boot Ubuntu. Pastebin "sudo fdisk -l" please.
[15:44] <Darksonn> bekks: 13.10

[15:46] <azamat> curiousx, yes, thank you, I have already downloaded installer for 13.04, but when I opened it with software center, it said I don't have some dependent packages. I will now try to install it with gdebi
[15:46] <bekks> Darksonn: Pastebin "sudo fdisk -l" please.

[15:48] <bekks> Darksonn: Is that "sudo fdisk -l" or "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda"?
[15:48] <Darksonn> sudo fdisk -l
[15:49] <bekks> Darksonn: Pastebin "dmesg" too, please.
[15:50] <MarkDavies> I want to install VirtualBox. I downloaded the package and tried to install, why doesn't dpkg install the packages on which VirtualBox depends automatically?
[15:50] <Rook> Hi! do anyone know how make a share folder between 2 ubuntu 12.04/13.10? systems?
[15:50] <bekks> MarkDavies: Because dpkg doesnt do that. apt-get does.
[15:50] <Darksonn> bekks: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6673644/
[15:51] <MarkDavies> bekks: I tried with apt-get, too, and it didn't do it.
[15:51] <trijntje> MarkDavies: where did you get the package? If the package doesn't specify its dependencies correctly, there is nothing dpkg can do about it
[15:51] <trijntje> bekks: dpkg also installs dependencies
[15:51] <curiousx> yep, and that packege is not in ubuntu repos, so dont install it, if you try to install it it will broke another packages
[15:52] <bekks> Darksonn: Looks like you have a problem with your harddisk. Did you poweroff,  and check cables£?
[15:52] <Darksonn> bekks: which cables do you mean I should have checked_
[15:52] <bekks> Darksonn: The cables connecting your harddisk to your computer.
[15:53] <curiousx> lo) azamat, http://askubuntu.com/questions/379291/problem-with-installing-intel-linux-graphics-installer-1-0-2-0intel3-i386-deb
[15:53] <SaberX01> Rook, IN the filer manager, Right-Click the folder you want to share, properties, then share options.
[15:53] <Darksonn> bekks: It's an internal harddrive
[15:53] <MarkDavies> trijntje: from the Oracle page. When I tried to install the package it listed the packages which should be pre-installed. Neither apt-get nor dpkg installed them, however. But I successfully installed them by hand using the list mentioned.
[15:53] <bekks> Darksonn: In a PC or a laptop?
[15:53] <Rook> SaberX01: ty!
[15:53] <Darksonn> bekks: desktop
[15:53] <bekks> Darksonn: Then check the cables.
[15:53] <trijntje> MarkDavies: why not use the software in the ubuntu repository? Then you don't have to bother with all that stuf
[15:54] <MarkDavies> trijntje: I tried and it was all the same..
[15:54] <Darksonn> bekks: You mean I should powerdown and look inside the computer?
[15:54] <trijntje> MarkDavies: what do you mean by that?
[15:54] <bekks> Darksonn: Thats what I said, yes.
[15:54] <Darksonn> bekks: okay
[15:55] <MarkDavies> trijntje: that neither installing VirtualBox from the Ubuntu repository, nor as an external package, had I had the dependencies installed automatically.
[15:55] <trijntje> installing software from outside the ubuntu repository is always a hassle and can break your system. If you have a problem with vbox from the repo its better to sort that problem out than install from oracle
[15:58] <trijntje> MarkDavies: can you install virtualbox from the repository and pastebin the exact error messages you get?
[15:59] <azamat> curiousx, yeah, I read that, thanks) I think I will wait for ubuntu 14 :) I think intel will make another installer for 14
[15:59] <MarkDavies> trijntje: I've successfully installed this package and I don't want to bother with it more, but the installation was something strange. the apt-get command returned something like: "The following are dependencies, but the system will not install them."
[16:00] <curiousx> azamat,  ok
[16:02] <trijntje> MarkDavies: weird, sounds like something messed up your software repository, did you add any ppa's, additional source lines?
[16:02] <MarkDavies> trijntje: nothing like this. Everything's completely clear.
[16:02] <MarkDavies> trijntje: and it was the first time I came across such a problem.
[16:03] <trijntje> weird, I'm not sure what the problem is then

[17:09] <xlr20> bekks: yes there is. i just haven't figured it out. there's a vmware solution i'm working on
[17:09] <xlr20> bekks: for a vm hosted online
[17:09] <bekks> xlr20: good luck then on porting vmware onto iOS.
[17:09] <bekks> xlr20: Leave a note when you are done.
[17:10] <able> akash: why are you PMing me?
[17:10] <xlr20> bekks: why would i port it when there is already a vmware client for ios?
[17:10] <bekks> xlr20: a client is different from the hypervisor...
[17:10] <mohammadajanhabi> how can I download and install suitable dvd player
[17:10] <akash> first tell PMing means what
[17:11] <akash> first tell PMing means what able
[17:11] <bekks> xlr20: there are zillions of remote clients for iOS.
[17:11] <xlr20> bekks: a client is all that's needed. like i said the vm is hosted somewhere online and accessed through the client. anyways i guess nobody here has done it so i'll just keep working on it
[17:11] <HisaoNakai> ActionParsnip: Just tried it. I can't get it to as much as show the Hindi characters. Tried 'xterm -en UTF-8' and 'xterm -u8' on a whim, no change.
[17:11] <xlr20> bekks: there are no zillions of VM clients. VNC, sure there are plenty
[17:11] <bekks> xlr20: I am working like for a long time.
[17:12] <bekks> xlr20: I said "remote clients", not "vm clients".
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: you could run vncserver and connect to it. You will get the desktop showing on the device. Not realy 'running' on thee device
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> HisaoNakai: could install guake, see if its the same. Otherwise i sugest you report a bug
[17:13] <xlr20> ActionParsnip: ya vnc is convenient
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: its also unsecure
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: an ssh tunnel helps there :-)
[17:14] <xlr20> ActionParsnip: vnc can be used with ssh to make it more secure?
[17:14] <ActionParsnip> !vnc | xlr20
[17:14] <ubottu> xlr20: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[17:14] <bekks> ssh can be used to make vnc more secure.
[17:15] <ActionParsnip> Vnc needs to die
[17:15] <bekks> ActionParsnip: ack.
[17:15] <andyfied> you can use other things, like xserver
[17:15] <andyfied> not that i've managed it yet
[17:16] <bekks> which is insecure without ssh too.
[17:16] <xlr20> ActionParsnip: thanks for the link
[17:16] <andyfied> i would only be using it with ssh
[17:16] <HisaoNakai> ActionParsnip: Same issue with guake.
[17:18] <xlr20> ActionParsnip: how about teamviewer, with respect to security?
[17:19] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: sure why not
[17:19] <renji_> do u think someone would make a fork of wayland?
[17:20] <ActionParsnip> Renji_: they can, its source is available
[17:20] <bekks> xlr20: use freenx.
[17:21] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: what do you do on the remote desktop?
[17:21] <bekks> xlr20: no one knows wether teamviewer isnt getting your data, since it is closed source.
[17:21] <xlr20> bekks: thanks i'll check it out
[17:21] <renji_> to run for kunbuntu? @actionparsnip
[17:21] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: there may be a sleeker solution
[17:22] <ActionParsnip> Renji_: if you can get kde running on it etc, sure....
[17:22] <xlr20> ActionParsnip: control the computer remotely, but I like having a desktop image available like with VNC as opposed to ssh in a terminal.
[17:22] <ActionParsnip> xlr20: yes but what do you do once on the desktop itself?
[17:23] <xlr20> bekks: is freenx still being developed? the last entry on their project page is from 2008

[17:24] <xlr20> ActionParsnip: using it to help other people or assist with issues like one would do with teamviewer

[17:25] <blacklight> hi all, is anyone aware of the status of vestige or VST support in amd64 build of lmms? i see an open bug here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lmms/+bug/1182604 stating that the support will be (maybe) fixed within ubuntu 14.04, but no alternatives

[17:25] <bekks> xlr20: accordinng to their PPAs, they do maintain it.
[17:26] <napster> I have a pretty funny question here. :)
[17:26] <napster> I have dropbox on my PC
[17:27] <Stooge> maybe I should use convmv UTF-8 *.* and they will be converted?
[17:27] <napster> but someone shuts down my PC
[17:27] <napster> It should automatically wait till dropbox is fully synced
[17:27] <napster> Is it possible anyway?
[17:28] <bekks> napster: that wouldnt be possible.
[17:28] <ActionParsnip> napster: doesnt matter. Dropbox will continue syncing on poweron
[17:28] <napster> bekks: Would love to see some pointers
[17:28] <bekks> napster: Pointers to "impossible"?
[17:29] <napster> ActionParsnip: err, well its not exactly the use case. I need this to be synced completely before going down. So that the content is immediately available on other machines.
[17:29] <leonoc> hola por aca haber si aprendo un poco mas
[17:29] <napster> bekks: Nope! pointers to possibilities :)
[17:30] <ActionParsnip> Napster: you could see if the client alters a file to state it is up to date

[17:31] <ActionParsnip> Napster: surely you have dropbox on your systems too, to sync between etc.
[17:31] <leonoc> ire for learning English force
[17:32] <napster> ActionParsnip: hmm, I think I should use git or something to do that completely under control.
[17:33] <napster> dropbox has their own versioning
[17:33] <napster> git push before shutdown will be more easier. I was just curios if something can be done with dropbox hooks if they do expose any.
[17:35] <xlr20> napster: have you checked out the alternatives to dropbox before?
[17:36] <napster> xlr20: I have tried out box once, but honestly not much
[17:36] <MonkeyDust> there's also Wuala and box.com
[17:37] <xlr20> none of them are as convenient and easy as dropbox, even if they are better as far as security and offer more free space
[17:37] <xlr20> it's a shame
[17:37] <napster> xlr20: And is there any specific reasons to point to alternatives? Does they provide any features which could help in my use case?
[17:38] <xlr20> napster: well they can offer encryption. wuala and spider oak both do
[17:38] <napster> MonkeyDust: checking out Wuala now
[17:38] <napster> xlr20: ok

[17:41] <gordonjcp> napster: I'm trying to pick out what the original question was, but I can't
=== embed-ns is now known as phil-ns
[17:41] <napster> gordonjcp: The original question was that, is it possible to prevent the shutdown till the dropbox files are synced with the server.
[17:42] <napster> All machines I have access to runs on 13.10
[17:42] <xlr20> napster: who is this person that is shutting down your computer before it syncs?
[17:42] <napster> xlr20: Unfortunately its me
[17:42] <napster> :D
[17:43] <xlr20> napster: you could try using the shutdown command and timing your computer to turn off after an hour or however much time dropbox tells you it will take to sync
[17:43] <ixio2> if one was to install openvpn from the package does it use internal user accounts on the server to authenticate users? or does it have its own internal authentication.. or does it not use users at all and just use certs?
[17:43] <gordonjcp> napster: good question
[17:43] <gordonjcp> napster: is there something that dropbox can call, to tell when it's done syncing?
[17:43] <napster> xlr20: Ok that is the best part. We can't predict how much time it can take to sync everything up.
[17:44] <napster> gordonjcp: my mule says there should be something for doing that. Lets digg together :)
[17:44] <xlr20> napster: you should be able to.. dropbox gives you an estimate
[17:44] <leonoc> ubottu along apredo my life much easier in the chat, he usually always read some text that we are many???
[17:44] <ubottu> leonoc: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[17:45] <napster> xlr20: yes, so the point will be to get that info from dropbox and time the shutdown based on that.
[17:46] <xlr20> napster: you can get that info by right clicking on the dropbox icon in your system tray and reading it yourself, then setting the shutdown command
[17:46] <napster> xlr20: aah! That is a lot of manual work. I'm digging the python SDK for dropbox.
[17:47] <napster> Something is here. Its Qt, easier for me : http://lycis.github.io/QtDropbox/
[17:47] <ActionParsnip> Napster: have you read the dropbox manpage?
[17:47] <napster> ActionParsnip: wow! That was a good pointer

[17:55] <myNickisNick> Mendel: could you tell us a little bit more like what version of Ubuntu you are using,  what you have tried ect ?  thankd
[17:55] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: when you last unplugged it, did you use the safe removal feature in your OS?
[17:55] <Q-collective> Hey all. I just installed Gnome 3.10 and pretty quickly uninstalled it again via ppa-purge after I noticed it broke my Unity. I fixed everything again, but my wallpaper/desktop is still broken. Does anyone know how to get it back up?
[17:56] <ActionParsnip> Q-collective: you may have to remove the current gnome config, we have no way of knowing what changes the packages from the ppa have made
[17:56] <ActionParsnip> Q-collective: also i suggest you contact the ppa maintainer
[17:57] <myNickisNick> Q-collective: what ActionParsnip said maybe use d-conf app to look at each of the settings for the dbus and set back to normal
[17:58] <xlr20> Mendel: which file manager are you using?
[17:58] <Mendel> im using the newest version. when i click trust it keeps popoing up on my phone and this msg pops up on my computer. DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Message did not receive a reply (timeout by message bus)
[17:58] <Mendel> i dont know
[17:59] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: do you use the safe remove feature before unplugging the device
[17:59] <myNickisNick> seems like a mount issue Mendel
[17:59] <xlr20> Mendel
[17:59] <xlr20> try updating your system. maybe something is outdated
[17:59] <Mendel> yes its a mount issue and no whats that
[17:59] <epsilon1> hi. I use a Tenda R502 router. I enabled UPnP and also DMZ in the router but when I use http://www.canyouseeme.org/ to check if I have an open port, it always give me error. I didn't use a firewall (in Ubuntu 12.04LTS). Why?
[18:00] <Mendel> i sudo updates and its all up to sate
[18:00] <Mendel> date
[18:00] <xlr20> did you upgrade too?
[18:00] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: do you safe remove, or do you just unplug it?
[18:00] <Mendel> just unplug it
[18:00] <Mendel> what should i be updating exactly
[18:00] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: why do you think operating system makers put that feature in?
[18:01] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: seriously. Think about it
[18:01] <xlr20> lol
[18:01] <Mendel> lol im just a noob
[18:01] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: what? To all computers?
[18:01] <xlr20> Mendel: you should be careful with your devices. don't be lazy
[18:01] <Mendel> sure I would if I knew what he was talking about
[18:02] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: plug it into your windows pc, or mac or whatever you use it in.
[18:02] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: then let it sync and do whatever iphone rubbish does, then in the bottom right you will see an icon
[18:02] <myNickisNick> Mendel: if you have any file managers open close them or just reboot,  then plug phone back in and see if it mounts
[18:02] <Mendel> it charges but i want to download my music from my iphone to ubuntu
[18:03] <ActionParsnip> Mendel: you will see "safely remove hardware" and you can use that, then you can unplug
[18:03] <myNickisNick> I would also make sure that I have the most recent lib of libimobiledevice

[18:06] <ActionParsnip> epsilon1: what is the error?
[18:07] <myNickisNick> pac1: you can also look at the logs of lightdm  compiz ect.  But what do you mean the icons are  failing ?
[18:07] <epsilon1> that site says my ports are closed
[18:08] <ActionParsnip> epsilon1: sounds like a router issue then.
[18:08] <epsilon1> this is the error: I could not see your service on 95.76.....    on port (80)

[18:09] <epsilon1> yes, I accesed my router

[18:11] <epsilon1> ActionParsnip: I don't know. I only enabled UPnP and also DMZ host. I saved, I restarted router, modem and computer. But it didn't work
[18:11] <glitsj16> pac1: if you use the command to start eclipse you've put in the .desktop file (Exec=...) from terminal, does it work? does it give any errors?

[18:12] <pac1> yes.  no errors when starting from bash.
[18:12] <trijntje> pac1: keep in mind that you need to specify the full path in the .desktop file, not relative to home
[18:12] <epsilon1> the router? Yes.
[18:13] <glitsj16> pac1: does the .desktop file have execute permissions?
[18:13] <ActionParsnip> epsilon1: then its a router issue, logically. I'd ask in ##networking

[18:54] <Voting> my ubuntu laptop wont boot and last time a buddy typed something into the the grub command line and got this laptap to go back to booting just fine, some sort of re-set thing... hangs when I try to boot.
[18:54] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: Alright. Unfortunately I have a recent AMD card and the open source driver is still not good enough... so I tried the proprietary driver from AMD's website
[18:55] <Bashing-om> ciencisto: And, now you get a blcak screen ?
[18:56] <Mendel> whats a good program I should get?
[18:56] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: Not yet, but I think I would if I rebooted. I got errors (possibly fatal) in my installation log : http://justpaste.it/dyxz
[18:56] <Bashing-om> ciencisto: look'n at the pastie. I be back !
[18:57] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: Alright, thank you so much!
[18:57] <Mendel> whats a good program I should get?
[18:58] <ciencisto> Mendel: Depends of what you use?
[18:58] <Mendel> ubuntu
[18:58] <ciencisto> Mendel: And what do you need?
[18:58] <BluesKaj> gabriel, can you get to a virtual console/TTY , ctrl+alt+F1-F6 , then login and remove nivdia-331
[18:59] <Mendel> something interesting to play around with maybe something to trace someones ip
[18:59] <MarkDavies> how can I kill a process which catches both Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z sequences?
[19:00] <MarkDavies> that is, how can I take the control of the terminal back, in the first place?
[19:00] <ciencisto> Mendel: Trace someone's IP? I don't know any program for that, sorry.
[19:01] <Bashing-om> ciencisto: looks like the installer removed the failed install, can you get a terminal activated at this time ? will run a couple of commands and have a looksee.
[19:01] <Mendel> idk something i can play around with
[19:01] <Mendel> that was jus an idea
[19:01] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: The installation terminal is still opened
[19:02] <micros> When i use kill() to send a signal from a child process to the pid of the parent (launched as root), the parent sigint handler isnt called. However, if i execute the child process using sudo from the shell, it works. Any idea why? thanks.
[19:03] <PublicStaticVoid> Whats the IM client built into Ubuntu?

[19:11] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: Yes, I am on the open source driver and wanted to switch to the latest proprietary driver.

[19:12] <icloud> can someone help me? i am getting a fatal error when running update-initramfs -u, ERROR: could not open directory /lib/modules/3.11.0.14-generic: No such file or directory
[19:12] <icloud> FATAL: could not search modules: No such file or directory
[19:12] <server-dannemois> quelqu'un ?
[19:12] <Bashing-om> ciencisto: yep, should be safe to do so, I expect you to still have the open source driver available and used .
[19:12] <icloud> i checked my /lib/modules directory all the folders are in the form of 3.11.0-14-generic not .14
[19:13] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: Alright. And what about the proprietary driver? Will I be able to install it if I retry of something?
[19:14] <ikonia> icloud: why are you manually running that - it should be run automatically with the kernel update
[19:14] <randomcpp> is noatime necessary with a ssd??
[19:14] <icloud> yeah i got that after installing the latest kernel
[19:15] <ikonia> icloud: where did the kenrel come from ?
[19:15] <icloud> ikonia, so then i tried to manually rerun it
[19:15] <Bashing-om> ciencisto: What is the need to go to the OEM driver ? That means is not for the faint-at-heart ! Have you tried "Additional Drivers" utility to remain with in ubuntu's package management system ?
[19:15] <ikonia> !info linux-image
[19:15] <ubottu> linux-image (source: linux-meta): Generic Linux kernel image.. In component main, is optional. Version 3.11.0.14.15 (saucy), package size 1 kB, installed size 33 kB
[19:16] <icloud> ikonia, from the repo, i just did sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic
[19:16] <ciencisto> Bashing-om: In the past months, I have tried at multiple times the Additionnal Drivers, and always they were either not working or slower than the open source driver, which is also slow. That's why I now want to install the OEM driver
[19:16] <ikonia> icloud: while I'm not doubting you personally, it seems unlikley that a kernel would have the wrong directory from the main repo
[19:17] <ikonia> icloud: that is a basic test that would get caught in pre-functional testing.
[19:18] <icloud> ikonia,  yeah i understand i think there is something wrong with my update-initramfs, b/c actually all the old kernels have the same directory structure too.
[19:18] <icloud> icloud@icloud-X58A-UD3R:/lib/modules$ ls
[19:18] <icloud> 3.11.0-13-generic  3.11.0-14-generic  3.8.0-31-generic
[19:18] <ikonia> icloud: again, that seems unlikely that updte-initramfs is a "problem"
[19:19] <Bashing-om> ciencisto: ATI has moved the older (HD 3,4,and 5) cards to "leagacy, and no longer support them > what card do you have ? -> lspci -nnk | grep -iA3 vga <- Maybe nada can be done.

[19:21] <DRAMA-MAKER> with random people or ?
[19:21] <icloud> ikonia, so is it possible to tell update-initramfs to look for the correct folder? or should i just rename the folders

[19:25] <pacopad> Hi Guys ,
[19:25] <Pessimist> ciencisto, don't ever install propertary ati driver from their website because there's a high chance it will break your X server because it's a generic installer. That's why Ubuntu (and many other distros) package their own catalyst drivers.
[19:25] <pacopad> i'm runing a fresh saucy dist on an arm plateform
[19:25] <ciencisto> DRAMA-MAKER: Probably ;¬)
[19:25] <pacopad> i got problem to compil soft with error like /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
[19:26] <pacopad> i have to add libs in makefile
[19:26] <pacopad> i already compile those soft on other distro without adding libs
[19:26] <ciencisto> Pessimist: Let's say that I haven't read your username... But what should I do if neither of Ubuntu's drivers are good enough?
[19:26] <pacopad> is there something to check ?
[19:27] <icloud> ikonia, yeah it is really weird i can't boot into the new kernel, but i can still use the old ones.
[19:27] <randomcpp> is noatime necessary with a ssd?

[19:28] <randomcpp> compdoc, what's the point to disable journaling with ssd? reduce rw operations?
[19:28] <Pessimist> ciencisto, catalyst has a shitty (pardon) 2d acceleration so if you have a older cpu you can't change anything. What GPU do you have?
[19:29] <pacopad> i got to add -lX11
[19:29] <pacopad> i never do that with this soft on other distro
[19:29] <pacopad> maybe i missed a special package on saucy ?

[20:33] <metadept> well specifically, i installed ubuntu on a separate hard drive (24gb ssd) as a single partition without a swap partition, it seemed to work fine, but attempting to access some of the windows partitions gave me an error saying that windows hadn't shut down properly so they were locked
[20:33] <rww> metadept: Windows 8 doesn't shut down fully when you say shut down. See e.g. http://www.howtogeek.com/129021/how-to-do-a-full-shutdown-in-windows-8-without-disabling-hybrid-boot/
[20:33] <metadept> then when i booted into windows, it went into system restore and did a bunch of opaque operations, which broke the linux partition SOMEHOW such that it boots to recovery mode but not graphical
=== codethough is now known as codethought
[20:34] <rww> (no idea about the second part of your issue, i have no experience with windows 8 system restore)
[20:35] <metadept> so part of my confusion stems from the fact that i have no idea what windows even did when it decided to "fix" things or why it would have any issue in the first place with something on a separate empty drive
=== alex12-afk is now known as alex12
[20:35] <danishman> Windows 8 fast boot, creates error in Linux. It's a known problem, and there are good work around
[20:36] <metadept> danishman, thanks, i'll see if disabling that solves the issue
[20:37] <danishman> yes
[20:37] <Darkenvy> where can I get help with scripts?

[20:49] <devdvd> hi all, I'm trying to encrypt a second drive on 12.04 lts but all i can find online is the full process for encrypting an os drive.  Can someone point me to a good doc on just encrypting a second drive
[20:55] <Pessimist> devdvd, create a volume group on that drive then create volumes you want and encrypt it with cryptsetup
[20:56] <vaio> hey, what is the difference between a mainline and repo kernel?
[20:57] <bekks> vaio: The first does not contain the additional ubuntu patches of the latter.
[20:57] <bekks> vaio: The first one is build from the stock kernel.org sources.
[20:57] <vaio> oh ok
[20:58] <vaio> and the repo kernel, is shipped on the install medium/via updates?
[20:58] <bekks> vaio: Correct.
[20:58] <vaio> bekks: a guy on the launchpad error tracker asked me to submit a bug with the repository kernel booted
[20:59] <vaio> guess i'm clear then
[20:59] <vaio> thank you

[21:02] <jj_> hey
[21:02] <jj_> how do i open magnet links in transmission?
[21:05] <Pessimist> jj_, add torrent by url or something like that ?
[21:05] <jj_> Pessimist: yes
[21:06] <devdvd> Pessimist: thank you
[21:06] <jj_> i use transmission as default torrent client, but theres no option to open magnet with it
=== AndresSM is now known as AndresSM_away
[21:07] <Pessimist> devdvd, then you can open it with cryptOpen (you probably have found some kind of article/tutorial -- it's pretty straightforward)
[21:08] <Pessimist> jj_, there is add -> add url on my transmission 2.51
[21:09] <brontosaurusrex> jj_, drag and drop not working?
[21:09] <jj_> Pessimist: but i want like, when i click the magnet link, it opens automatically in transmission
[21:09] <glitsj16> jj_: you've got to set /usr/bin/transmission-gtk as your preferred magnet protocol client in your browser, so when clicking a magnet url it gets sent straight to transmission
[21:10] <glitsj16> jj_: what browser do you use?
[21:10] <jj_> firefox
[21:11] <jj_> glitsj16:
[21:11] <jj_> it worked
[21:11] <glitsj16> jj_: ok, you can set it in firefox prefs > applications, search for magnet and assign transmission-gtk to it, you'll need to browse manually to /usr/bin
[21:11] <glitsj16> cool
[21:11] <jj_> i had to go to this directory: /usr/bin/transmission-gtk
[21:11] <jj_> then it worked
[21:11] <jj_> but if i type transmission to search, it doesn't find anything
[21:11] <jj_> strange
[21:12] <glitsj16> jj_: type transmission where?
[21:12] <glitsj16> in dash?
[21:12] <jj_> in that window that you choose the app to open
[21:13] <glitsj16> ah in firefox .. you need to look for torrent and assign the same /usr/bin/transmission-gtk to it i believe
[21:14] <glitsj16> jj_: you can only look for protocols/mime-types and assign apps, not the other way around
[21:14] <jj_> but, if i lookd for "transmission" shouldnt it return the transmission-gtk?
=== gordonjc1 is now known as gordonjcp
[21:16] <glitsj16> jj_: i don't think so no, because transmission isn't a content type
[21:16] <marcos> hi, i have a server with 2x1tb. when i look at gparted it shows sda nd sdb identical partitions with each being 1tb raid . When i look at the file system under system monitor it shows /dev/md2 as home and /dev/root with bot being only 1tb. Am i missing something? shouldnt i be seeing 2tb?
[21:17] <marcos> maybe i dont understaind raid
[21:19] <curiousx> aloha all, i got a Xonar 7.1 and a 7.1 headphone, but i can not configure my ubuntu 13.10 at 7.1 i only can configure it at 5.1 any one can help me with that please?  -.-
[21:20] <TJ-> marcos: RAID-1 == mirror I'd guess you actually have something like sda1 + sdb1 = md1 mounted at /, and sda2 + sdb2 = md2 mounted at /home
[21:21] <marcos> yes ur actually correct
[21:21] <marcos> but shouldnt it shows as 2tb?

[21:23] <User338857585858> Does anyone know if Ubuntu is secure?/
[21:23] <marcos> oh thanks TJ-  i got a link explaining raids
[21:23] <marcos> thank you again
[21:24] <geirha> jj_: How did you install transmission-gtk?
[21:25] <Pessimist> User338857585858, what do you mean?
[21:25] <jj_> it comes with ubuntu 13.10
[21:25] <jj_> geirha:
[21:25] <geirha> jj_: Then it should've been available from the Dash, yes
[21:25] <User338857585858> I mean, the NSA seems to have owned just about everything... have the bough ubuntu as well???
[21:26] <jj_> it is geirha
[21:26] <jj_> but its doesn't show up in the window of adding app to open magnet in firefox
[21:26] <apb1963> Greetings & Happy New Year

[21:28] <curiousx> ill try that channel its a good idea, maybe they can help me :)
[21:29] <apb1963> The operation was a success.  I have now completed the debootstrap process and  I'm running off my "new" disk.  I also have my old failing disk mounted as an external device.  I would like to restore all of my old applications, settings, data, etc.  What's the best way to go about doing that?
[21:29] <glitsj16> curiousx: have you tried http://www.webupd8.org/2009/06/enable-surround-sound-in-ubuntu-linux.html yet?
[21:29] <Pessimist> jj_, if you set it in preferences and when you click on the magnet link it won't show any windows in firefox, it will just open transmission and show you the window of adding a new torrent there
[21:30] <geirha> jj_: Oh, nevermind. I see the transmission-gtk package doesn't register itself as a magnet opener
[21:32] <lhamil64> hi
[21:33] <apb1963> I'm sure there must be a log file that has a record of all the apt-get installs I've done for starters?  And perhaps another program that reads that file and can re-install those things - perhaps with interactive input so I can pick and choose what I want to reinstall?
[21:34] <lhamil64> Quick question about bluetooth. If I run "dmesg | grep Blue", it lists bluetooth devices, but when I go to the bluetooth preferences it says there aren't any devices found.
[21:34] <apb1963> Sort of a like a backup/restore in a way?
[21:34] <bekks> apb1963: /var/log/dpkg.log
[21:34] <bekks> apb1963: No sort of backup/restore, just a log.

[21:44] <anonymous_> hey
[21:46] <bjensen8_> Where is the best place to start when figuring out why an ubuntu 12.04 lts server has crashed? I know the time. The syslogd tells me nothing: Here is a snippet: http://pastie.org/8592187
[21:47] <TJ-> bjensen8_: kern.log, auth.log
[21:48] <TJ-> bjensen8_: if it lost power you won't see anything (unless its on a UPS)... if the kernel panicked then unlikely the log file was synced to disk
[21:48] <bjensen8_> bjensen: right. I asked the hosting center. they said they looked at their power usage graphs, no drops
[21:49] <bjensen8_> TJ-: I mean
[21:49] <apb1963> bjensen8_: The best place to start looking would be at the console, prior to rebooting the system
[21:49] <TJ-> bjensen8_: then search all the logs to reconstruct the time it failed and work backwards from that point in all the logs to see if anything stands out
[21:50] <bjensen8_> apb1963: Right Ive done that for syslog, nothing unusual is popping up. Only blocks by UFW
[21:50] <TJ-> bjensen8_: How long was it from last entry before crash, to the reboot? Could that indicate a physical intrusion?
[21:51] <bjensen8_> TJ-: 20 minuttes
[21:51] <apb1963> bjensen8_: Not syslog... not any log.  On the screen... prior to rebooting
[21:51] <bjensen8_> apb1963: Um..how can I check that now?
[21:52] <apb1963> bjensen8_: after taking a picture of that screen with a camera, then you can reboot and start looking at logs as TJ- is saying
[21:52] <apb1963> bjensen8_: You can't.  Now you know for next time it happens :)
[21:52] <bjensen8_> its a U1, no screen
[21:52] <bjensen8_> rack
[21:53] <apb1963> that could be a problem
[21:53] <andyfied> then ssh in and wait for it to break
[21:53] <bjensen8_> TJ-: Sorry I just checked again its 8 minuttes. Which I think is reasonable because it does a lot of temp calibration etc when starting from the bios
[21:53] <andyfied> not that it helped me
=== Thor|Away is now known as Thorium220
[21:54] <apb1963> I believe there's a way to redirect the console to a log file on a remote machine... I don't remember how to do it though.
[21:54] <bekks> andyfied: It will not help - in case of a kernel panic, your ssh connection dies, too.
[21:55] <apb1963> and to be honest... I don't know if it would help in the instance of a kernel panic
[21:55] <bjensen8_> The only thing in the kern.log within 30 min of the shutdown is UFW blocks. So perhaps a malformed package to make the server crash?
[21:55] <bjensen8_> package = packet
[21:55] <andyfied> oh, didn't read up far enough for kernal panic, but i thought there was only two things you could find out from that anyway, sync or no sync to disk
[21:55] <apb1963> I remember reading about packets of death a long time ago, but it was a fairly rare situation
[21:57] <TJ-> bjensen8_: Do you have remote KVM to it? If so set up a logging monitor on it in case it happens again... could be a developing hardware fault
[21:58] <cristian_c> Hello again
[21:58] <cristian_c> How can I install jsattach?
[21:59] <cristian_c> Any ideas?
[21:59] <apb1963> bjensen8_:  TJ- had a good thought... do a memtest on it
[21:59] <bjensen8_> TJ-: I could order it yes
[22:00] <cristian_c> What package is it contained in?
[22:00] <apb1963> there isn't any kind of mamaboard test is there?
[22:00] <bjensen8_> apb1963: can I do memtest from within ubuntu?
[22:00] <bekks> bjensen8_: you can install memtest86+ and reboot into it.
[22:01] <bekks> bjensen8_: you would need a console.
[22:01] <bjensen8_> bekks: yeah I was hoping I could perform a test from within ssh
[22:01] <apb1963> not while it's running afaik .... you have to run it from a boot
[22:04] <bjensen8_> ok ill see if it happens again and then order a kvm at the hosting center
[22:04] <bjensen8_> I can use memtest if I have kvm, right?
[22:05] <apb1963> I also wanted to run memtest while the machine was up... but you have to figure that at best, it could only test memory not currently in use... otherwise it would have to keep rearranging memory allocations and I don't think that's even possible in ubuntu - specifying where in memory a program will run?  That would be something.
[22:06] <apb1963> I mean it could be done... I just don't think the kernel is designed that way - but then I'm just guessing.

[22:22] <rhagu> Hi I think about installing a newer kernel on 12.04 via linux-generic-lts  but what does eol stand for?
[22:22] <Pessimist> rhagu, eol = end of life
[22:22] <ActionParsnip> !eol
[22:22] <ubottu> End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[22:24] <DevAndy> Hello Ubuntu IRC!
[22:24] <rhagu> ah, so eol versions will not automatically switch to the next hwe stack after (for example) saucy has reached its end of life?
[22:24] <DevAndy> I'm trying to use PostFix to forward my emails to Gmail, but I'm getting this error: http://pastebin.com/zwD4gs6R

[22:29] <ActionParsnip> samiralajaad: one is for debian, one is for ubuntu

[22:31] <ytrezq> Hello, I need a multithreaded version of grep for searching in a file which make 1TB. Does any one know a working version? thanks
[22:32] <rhagu> ActionParsnip I see, but what is the difference between these two packages: linux-generic-lts-saucy-eol-upgrade linux-generic-lts-saucy ?
[22:33] <ActionParsnip> !info linux-generic-lts-saucy-eol-upgrade
[22:33] <ubottu> Package linux-generic-lts-saucy-eol-upgrade does not exist in saucy
[22:33] <ActionParsnip> Rhagu: where are you getting the package from?
[22:33] <rhagu> sudo apt-cache search linux-generic-lts on ubuntu 12.04
[22:34] <Pessimist> linux-generic-lts-saucy is a backport of saucy kernel to ubuntu 12.04
[22:34] <ActionParsnip> Rhagu: that command doesnt need sudo?
[22:34] <rww> ActionParsnip: it's in precise and precise-updates
[22:34] <ActionParsnip> Rhagu: it doesnt. Stupid keyboard
[22:34] <ActionParsnip> Rww: i see

[22:43] <shahan123123> do they call that the liveUSB?
[22:43] <bekks> shahan123123: Yeah.
[22:43] <rhagu> bekks so (running with the quantal kernel) instead of installing the next version via linux-generic-lts-raring I would just do linux-generic-lts-quantal-eol-upgrade?
[22:44] <bekks> rhagu: Only when your Ubuntu release is EOL.
[22:44] <rhagu> what does it do if it isnt?
[22:45] <shahan123123> i see, i got a "could not write bytes:  broken pipe" error at boot, and am now using Ubuntu 12.04 liveUSB

[22:48] <shahan123123> jhutchins: ActionParsnip, i had a working install of 12.04 going for a while on my laptop, it was the only OS on there and recently i got the broken pipe error it won't boot at all and running form the liveUSB kinf of sucks it is a 32GB usb and wireless won't work

[22:56] <TJ-> shahan123123: It can be caused by a couple of issues. The first is mistmatches with the video card drivers (especially nvidia), the other is a user profile file created by the X display server that simply needs deleting ( "rm /home/$USER/.Xauthority" - replace $USER with your username)
[22:57] <Guido1> I also have another question. I'm using seamnkey and firefox on xubuntu. some websits ask if it is allowed to get information about the location. if i say "yes" it doesn't work. if i use the same browsers on windows xp it works. so i assume that it has to do with xubuntu.
[22:58] <shahan123123> TJ-:  hmm I saw that on a thread/Askubuntu thing before and i know my laptop doesn't have nvidia

[23:25] <pvl1> jhutchins: after a kernel upgrade, and i reinstalled nvidia module. perhaps i should justtry to reinstlal module again. is glamoregl neccessary?
[23:26] <jhutchins> pvl1: Check your cable.
[23:26] <pvl1> jhutchins: but everything else works fine... just vlc is blue
[23:26] <shahan123123> TJ-: oh i seem to have made the changes from a "sudo -i" in this liveUSB session... but i'll check again when i reboot into recovery, thank you.
[23:26] <jhutchins> ZoltaNman: What did you try to do?  How did you try to do it?  What did you expect to happen?  Specifically what happened instead?

[23:29] <ZoltaNman> jhutchins: I am trying to run cgminer. The error I get is /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1: no version information available. I have installed libudev-dev, libc6, multiarch-support and ia31-libs.

[23:41] <jhutchins> ZoltaNman: I presume that's a bitcoin thing?  It looks like some component of it is unable to determine the version of libudev - why it needs that who knows.  Sounds like poor coding/packaging.  Try a different miner?  Get support from the project?

[23:50] <idueppe> hi, I'm frustated - does anybody managed to install ubuntu 12.04 on raid > lvm > luks via debootstraping? Why does it only works via guided installation?
[23:56] <idueppe> does grub-install uses /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab?
