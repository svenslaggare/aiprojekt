[12:01] <darwin188> hello, i need some help with ubuntu
[12:01] <darwin188> i just installed it to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:01] <amphi> sybariten: I'd have thought so; I don't use gnome
[12:01] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:02] <hedrek> !amarok
[12:02] <ubotu> I guess amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/
[12:02] <sybariten> amphi: neither would i... if i was sure i wouldnt lose stuff by changing
[12:02] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:02] <amphi> sybariten: lose stuff?
[12:02] <I_Love_DRM> Isn't the "thrash can" on the bootom right? next to the 4 desktop screen selectors.
[12:02] <Amin> !bash
[12:02] <ubotu> For a list of basic commands, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands
[12:02] <Amin> !init
[12:02] <ubotu> Init is how Ubuntu starts up misc. system services at boot time.  To control the services, please install the package "BUM" from "Universe" Repository
[12:02] <sybariten> amphi: you know ... uh .. the terminal here in gnome has tabs, and it has choices to change char emulation instantly. could i do that under xfce, etc etc
[12:02] <sybariten> loose stuff like that
[12:03] <jayrod06> !Aac
[12:03] <ubotu> methinks aac is read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for information about aac support
[12:03] <crazy_penguin> night all! // jo ejt!
[12:03] <AlwaysIcey> Yep. I was just about to mention that I_Love_DRM.
[12:03] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:03] <amphi> sybariten: guess so; just use gnome-terminal I suppose; I use mrxvt for tabbed xterms
[12:03] <sybariten> I_Love_DRM: you have a thrashcan there ?
[12:03] <darwin188> i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:03] <darwin188> can anyone help me out?
[12:03] <AlwaysIcey> I do too.  it looks like a calculator on my screen, but it's a trash can.
[12:03] <cr1mson> How do I correct 'dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)' ?
[12:03] <sybariten> amphi: but i couldnt use gnome-terminal under antyhing but gnome could i
[12:04] <amphi> darwin188: you need to mess with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I guess
[12:04] <nelisa> hey folks, newcommer here
[12:04] <amphi> sybariten: why not?
[12:04] <cr1mson> I'm trying to install glibc
[12:04] <darwin188> and then?
[12:04] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:04] <CLAUDIA> hola
[12:04] <amphi> sybariten: AFAIK it's a standalone prog (albeit with a lot of shared lib deps probably)
[12:04] <CLAUDIA> alguien que sepa de linux que me ayude
[12:04] <Old> "rpm -U webmin-1.260-1.noarch.rpm" - this command doesnt seem to work for me, any ideas of how to use a. rpm file?
[12:04] <AlwaysIcey> Claudia, hablas ingles?
[12:04] <Old> I need to install it
[12:04] <bimberi> ompaul: yes i like the new edubuntu background too - although it's a kinda cold and is missing New Zealand (bug reported) :)
[12:04] <nelisa> is there a way to lower my screen resolution, Ubuntu loaded tops and is hard on my eyes
[12:04] <CLAUDIA> no
[12:04] <amphi> !tell CLAUDIA about es
[12:04] <AlwaysIcey> !es
[12:04] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[12:04] <gnomefreak> Old: ubuntu is debian not redhat
[12:04] <sybariten> amphi: i thought gnome stuff required gnome as the window manager (althouih its prolly bigger than just a window manager today) to run, just as all K-programs (Kdevelop an all) would require KDE ... etc
[12:04] <ompaul> bimberi, :-)
[12:05] <Amin> !rpm
[12:05] <ubotu> methinks rpm is the Redhat Package Management file. Very similar to Debian's DEB files, but require alien to install. ask me about !alien
[12:05] <nelisa> hola CLAUDIA
[12:05] <gnomefreak> Old: ubuntu uses .debs not .rpms
[12:05] <Old> ooh
[12:05] <CLAUDIA> hola nelisa
[12:05] <Amin> !alien
[12:05] <ubotu> somebody said alien was a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
[12:05] <gnomefreak> CLAUDIA: #ubuntu-es
[12:05] <Old> Is there a way to use .rpms, like renaming it or something?
[12:05] <gnomefreak> Amin: alien isnt really recommended to use
[12:05] <amphi> sybariten: you can run kde progs without kde (you still need the libs), same for gnome; I run gnome progs like gthumb here without gnome
[12:05] <gnomefreak> Old: find a deb
[12:05] <Madpilot> Old, there's "alien", but you should look for a deb first
[12:05] <CLAUDIA> gracias
[12:05] <aj_> how do you add backports to dapper? like so i can get lame debs?
[12:05] <amphi> CLAUDIA: de nada
[12:06] <Old> gnomefreak i cant tbh, this guide is old, and i bet the file isnt on google anymore
[12:06] <Old> I'll look
[12:06] <gnomefreak> Old: what is the app?
[12:06] <CLAUDIA> sabes espaol
[12:06] <Madpilot> aj_, there won't be any backports for Dapper yet - development of the next version hasnt' started yet
[12:06] <sybariten> ok next question ...  if i compile something and then do make install in order to get it in place.... (in this case irssi) .. and i already had that tool installed via apt-get ... will make be able to "overwrite" my old version, and will the apt-system know that i got a new version of the irc client??
[12:06] <DBO> !es

[12:06] <CLAUDIA> amphi
[12:06] <gnomefreak> CLAUDIA: join #ubuntu-es
[12:06] <sybariten> amphi: ok didnt know that
[12:06] <robertj> are there any good wiki pages for setting up software mixing of sound?
[12:06] <nelisa> how to lower the res
[12:06] <robertj> I can't get my sdl games & teamspeak to play nice
[12:06] <aj_> so you can't get lame or mythtv in a repo?
[12:06] <Old> gnomefreak, it's webmin, for administrating your counter-strike servers (game servers)
[12:07] <Old> http://mirrors.redwoodvirtual.com/mirrors/www.webmin.com/download.html
[12:07] <gnomefreak> aj_: did you enable universe and multiverse
[12:07] <aj_> yes
[12:07] <Old> Can i use any of those?
[12:07] <gnomefreak> !webmin
[12:07] <ubotu> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebminWithoutARootAccount for webmin instructions for Ubuntu. Webmin runs on https://localhost:10000 - As of Ubuntu 6.06, webmin is REMOVED from Ubuntu and will no longer be supported
[12:07] <disinterseted_pe> how do i go about finding out about this 'mmsh://a814.l1977144512.c19771.g.lm.akamaistream.net/D/814/19771/v0001/reflector:44512?MSWMExt=.asf'.
[12:07] <amphi> sybariten: some of the integration stuff may not work (those DEs must be for _something_ ;), but the individual profs should work
[12:07] <lurk3rX> dis, thats a windows media player link :p
[12:07] <Old> thanks gnomefreak, i'll just take a peak

[12:12] <Old> Anyone ?
[12:12] <mikebot> anyone know why my mplayer always gives me the error "New_Face failed. Maybe the font path is wrong. Please supply the text font file (~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf)."
[12:12] <RandolphCarter> http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2006/5/21/4048 - bye bye Ballmer :)

[12:12] <RandolphCarter> amphi: gotham prison
[12:12] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, 60 Hx only
[12:12] <RandolphCarter> mikebot: did you install the mplayer-fonts package?
[12:13] <Old> gnomefreak, read above. Could you help me perhaps?
[12:13] <mikebot> sybariten, RandolphCarter not sure
[12:13] <Old> nice job btw

[12:13] <coucho> nelisa: maybe you're able to help me out?
[12:13] <gnomefreak> Old: that should be the path iirc
[12:13] <AlwaysIcey> Is it an older computer nelisa?
[12:13] <amphi> RandolphCarter: ah, the purges begin ;)
[12:13] <Old> gnomefreak, what's the exact path (Im new to ubuntu)
[12:13] <nelisa> it's a laptop an HP Pavilion N5495
[12:13] <gnomefreak> Old: i dont do much with perl except use it in scripts
[12:14] <MENDIGO> nelisa, no, i was going to update to Dapper Drake but then when i saw that would have to download 500mb I choose to Cancel
[12:14] <xdica> hi olks
[12:14] <gnomefreak> Old: /usr/bin/perl
[12:14] <mikebot> RandolphCarter, how do i do that?
[12:14] <Nintendud> I just installed the 686 optimized kernel for Ubuntu, and now mplayer and xmms don't run. if I launch them from the command line, it just says "segmentation fault". I recompiled mplayer, but it still says the same error. any ideas? I tried googling, and maybe the nvidia X driver is related to this problem (I had a bit of a problem getting X to work with the nvidia driver when I installed the kernel, but it eventually worked)
[12:14] <guenni> hallo
[12:14] <Old> cheers gnomefreak
[12:14] <RandolphCarter> mikebot: sudo aptitude install mplayer-fonts
[12:14] <mikebot> RandolphCarter, thanks
[12:14] <AlwaysIcey> I'm not sure then nelisa.  I haven't tried this on a laptop, so I'm not too sure how what resolution options you should have.
[12:14] <MENDIGO> nelisa, I did a backup of the sources.list then i replace it with the backup and did a apt-get update
[12:15] <Old> thanks, It's installing now gnomefreak.
